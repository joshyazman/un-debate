"1",43,"AFG",68,2013,"I bring to all warm greetings and the good wishes of the Afghan people. I have the honour to address the General Assembly in the last year of the current elected Government of Afghanistan. I therefore think that it is useful briefly to revisit the story of Afghanistan over the past 12 years  our historic successes  the achievements that have transformed Afghanistan and  yes  the challenges we have faced continuously during that time. I should then like to share with the Assembly the vision of the Afghan people and Government for the future of freedom  dignity  prosperity and democracy that we are striving to solidify in our country and  briefly  to address the critical importance of our relations and cooperation with countries in our region and with the broader community of nations.To better illustrate the journey that Afghanistan and its noble people have been on over the past 12 years  I should like to share two contrasting pictures of the reality of Afghanistan — in the year 2001  at the time of the collapse of the Taliban regime  and in the year 2013  as we are going through a historic period and a process of transition.For a little more than two decades prior to November 2001  when the Afghan people ousted the Taliban regime from power  with military backing from the United States-led international military coalition  the people of Afghanistan suffered incalculable pain  deprivation and losses through three distinct periods. Between the communist coup in 1978  followed by the invasion of our country in 1979  and the fall of the communist regime  more than 1 million Afghan men  women and children were killed  more than 2 million were made orphans or left with severe war wounds  and more than 5 million were forced out of their villages and towns into refugee camps in neighbouring countries  mainly in Pakistan and Iran  as a result of the brutality of the occupation and the communist regime and in the course of our resistance against that occupation. We fought for our freedom and independence — our holy jihad — and we won  in the process helping the national freedom and independence movements in Eastern Europe.The international community that had supported our struggle for several years abandoned us when the defeat and withdrawal of the Red Army became apparent. Exploiting the vacuum and internal strife created during the early 1990s  the foreign-backed Taliban movement rose to power and quickly controlled more than 90 per cent of Afghan territory. Then  equally quickly  they removed their masks and revealed their true identity  holding the Afghan nation hostage and embarking on a period of particularly cruel and barbaric violence and cruelty under the guise of Islam. With their backward views  violence and brutal suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Afghan people  especially women  they turned our country against itself. The international community did not mobilize to take action against the Taliban regime until the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States  including in this city.At the end of 2001  when  with the military backing of the United States-led international coalition  we were getting ready to drive the Taliban regime from power  Afghanistan was in near-total isolation from the region and the world community. The Afghan people were a terrorized population  without rights or freedoms and without protection from the Taliban regime’s brutality. Severe poverty and disease were endemic  with little or no access to health-care services. The education system  which completely excluded women and girls and had fewer than half a million male students attending schools and universities  was a catastrophic failure. The average annual per capita income was about $100 and the country lacked a single national currency. Our roads  bridges  irrigation networks and other components of critical national infrastructure were completely destroyed. Afghanistan was without a national army or a national police force  and all our other State institutions had been reduced to nothing. In short  Afghanistan was a failed State  ruled by a proxy militant group that provided shelter to international terrorists  thus posing a real danger to regional and international peace and security.The situation in Afghanistan during that period was indeed bleak. The Afghan people had little hope for their own or their children’s future. However  following the Al-Qaida terrorist attacks in the United States  the Afghan people came together and  with support from the United States and a multitude of other friends and allies in the international community  removed the Taliban from power and embarked upon a new era of hope  reconstruction  development and progress — a new era marked by an entirely different reality. Primarily as a result of our own sacrifices and the considerable sacrifices and support of our international friends and allies during our 12-year partnership  Afghanistan once again has become the home of all Afghans  men and women  where they enjoy equal rights and freedoms under our democratic Constitution.Today Afghanistan is a forward-looking young democracy with functioning State institutions  an elected President  an elected Parliament and elected provincial councils in each one of our 34 provinces  backed up by a powerful civil society movement. Afghan independent media  with approximately 50 independent television channels  more than 100 community FM radio stations and hundreds of print publications  are arguably among the freest in the region. Today there are more than 20 million mobile-phone users across Afghanistan  an increasing number of them accessing information and using various platforms on the Internet. Per capita income has increased from $100 a year to $600 a year  our national currency has been consistently stable  and our trade ties with the outside world are rapidly expanding.Today in the new Afghanistan the number of children attending school stands at well over 10 million  40 per cent of them girls  and there are hundreds of thousands of young men and women attending some 70 public and private colleges and universities. More than 70 per cent of our people today have access to basic health-care services. That  among other things  has increased average life expectancy from approximately 40 years to more the 60 years in just one decade.We have built thousands of kilometres of roads  irrigation canals  bridges and other pieces of our country’s critical physical infrastructure  thereby cutting travel time and facilitating trade and movement within the country and with neighbouring countries. Afghanistan today is a proud and active member of the international community  while managing its ever-expanding relations and cooperation with countries and organizations throughout the world  through a network of some 70 diplomatic and consular missions.The examples of rejuvenation and development  progress and achievements that I have just described represent the true picture of today’s Afghanistan. Considering that 12 years is not a very long time in the history of a country  especially a country such as Afghanistan  which has gone through more than 35 years of war and destruction  those achievements and gains are nothing short of a historic transformation. I have drawn that clear contrast between the Afghanistan of 10 years ago and the positive reality of today for two main reasons: first  to underscore a model of collective action and international cooperation in support of one country’s efforts to establish peace  security and development; and  secondly  to counter a narrative of doom and gloom for Afghanistan by those who are ignorant about our progress  or who harbour ill-will towards us. The new Afghanistan is indeed currently going through a critical period of security  economic and political transition that comes with its difficulties and challenges but that is helping us to consolidate our fledgling democratic order and strengthening our national sovereignty  independence and ownership of our own affairs.That is the vision of the Afghan people and Government for the years leading up to the completion of the transition in 2014 and into the transformation decade of 2015 to 2024. In the security area it is our more than 350 000 brave and professional soldiers and police officers — not foreign soldiers — who are directly responsible for the security of more than 90 per cent of the Afghan population. The transfer of security responsibilities from the international forces to Afghan national security forces  launched in the summer of 2011  will be completed throughout the country by the end of 2014. Our forces have demonstrated their courage  commitment and effectiveness in successfully taking over from their international partners. It is through the enormous and selfless sacrifices of our proud and patriotic national security forces on a daily basis that security in most cities and towns that have gone through transition has improved and the Taliban have been beaten back. We are fully confident that  with the continued financial assistance of the international community for equipment and other requirements and needs  as pledged at the Chicago NATO Summit in May 2012  Afghan national forces will be able to provide security to the Afghan people and defend the country against external threats.Parallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the capacity and capabilities of our national security forces  the Afghan Government is pursuing a political process of peace and reconciliation with the Taliban. The key principles and conditions for that process are clear: respect for Afghanistan’s Constitution  which guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan men and women; the preservation and enhancement of the advances made over the past decade; and the renunciation of violence against the population.The Islamic Republic of Pakistan  a major neighbour  can play a key role in supporting our peace process. We have been heartened by the recent successful visit to Islamabad by President Karzai and the positive and constructive dialogue that took place between the two Governments during that visit. We look forward to further steps and progress in the weeks and months to come. Pakistan’s essential role in advancing the Afghan peace process is a clear example of the support that Afghanistan’s neighbours and other countries in the region  especially Muslim countries  can provide to the Afghan peace process.As far as the economic component of transition is concerned  the presence of a large international military force over the past 10 years has generated employment and income opportunities for thousands of our citizens  so it is natural that there will be an adverse impact resulting from the withdrawal of those forces. In addition to our best efforts to fulfil Afghanistan’s role as the trade  transit and economic integration roundabout in the heart of Asia region for the benefit of all people of the region  the Afghan Government is keen to reduce the negative economic impact of the international military withdrawal and to strengthen our national economy in at least three ways. The first is by focusing on the development of the agriculture and agribusiness sector  in which more than 70 per cent of our population is directly or indirectly engaged  and where there is enormous potential for growth and employment generation. Secondly  Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions of dollars of natural resources  including minerals and hydrocarbons  representing a guaranteed source of wealth and income for generations to come. We already have several State-owned and private companies — from China  India  the United Kingdom  Canada  Turkey  the United Arab Emirates and other countries  in addition to Afghan companies — expressing a keen interest in investing billions of dollars in copper  iron ore  gold  rare-Earth minerals  oil and gas. We are actively seeking to attract additional foreign investment to this sector  while remaining duly diligent to make sure that our natural riches serve the goal of a strong legitimate national economy and improved prosperity and welfare for the Afghan people.Thirdly  the Tokyo Conference last July pledged more than $16 billion through 2015 to help the Afghan Government fill its projected fiscal gap. Conference participants also committed to providing additional financial assistance to Afghanistan beyond 2016 at or near the levels of the past decade. That generous financial support will be critical in tiding us over the next few years.In addition to the security and economic transitions  we have a crucial political transition coming up next year  namely  the presidential and provincial council elections. Next year’s presidential elections will mark the first time in our history that one elected President will transfer power to another elected President through a peaceful democratic process. The Afghan Government is doing everything possible to ensure free  fair and credible elections  so that the Afghan people can choose who the next President will be. A successful presidential election will entrench our democratic process and greatly contribute to our efforts towards lasting peace  security and prosperity.As we go forward in implementing the transition agenda and preparing for the transformation decade  another key foundation of our long-term success will be the strategic partnerships we have forged with some of our closest friends and allies over the past few years. Since October 2011  when we signed our first long-term strategic partnership agreement with the Republic of India  we have entered into similar partnerships with the United States  Germany  Australia  France  the United Kingdom  Italy  Norway  Finland  Denmark and Poland. We have also concluded or are currently negotiating similar partnerships with the European Union  Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. In that regard  I should like to reiterate the Afghan Government and people’s appreciation for the solid and broad-based expression of long-term political support for a peaceful  prosperous  democratic Afghanistan by more than 100 countries and organizations at the historic international Bonn Conference  kindly hosted by the German Government in December 2011. With the United States  we are negotiating a separate bilateral security agreement that will define the parameters of the long-term security and defence cooperation between our two countries. I should like to reiterate our long-standing principled position that any bilateral security agreements that Afghanistan signs with other countries  including the United States  will be purely for the purpose of ensuring peace  security  development and the consolidation of our young democracy  and not directed at our neighbours or any countries in the region. Afghanistan belongs to its region. As recent history has clearly demonstrated  the peace  security and stability of Afghanistan  as the centre of the heart of Asia region  has a direct impact on the peace  security and stability of the entire region  and vice versa. We want Afghanistan to serve its rightful role as a key land bridge in our vital region for the flow of people  goods and investments. In that context  the Istanbul Process on Regional Security and Cooperation for a Secure and Stable Afghanistan  which we launched together with our Turkish friends and all other participating and supporting States in November 2011  is of vital importance for confidence-building and promoting results-oriented cooperation. Two follow-on ministerial meetings  in Kabul in June 2012 and in Almaty in April of this year  have taken the Process to the level of maturity. It has now developed into a meaningful forum for discussion on specific confidence-building measures and enjoys considerable momentum. As the permanent co-Chair of the Process  the Afghan Government is particularly grateful to the People’s Republic of China for hosting the next ministerial meeting next summer.In addition to improving cooperation and confidence on a whole range of other issues  all countries in our region  and our allies and friends in the international community  must continue decisively to confront the single biggest challenge that still endangers our collective peace and security and undermines the welfare of our people  namely  the continuing menace of terrorism and extremism and their sanctuaries and support systems in the region. We will not achieve the full potential of our citizens or realize true and lasting peace and security in Afghanistan or the wider region until we have dealt decisively with the brutality and evilness of the terrorists who try to harm us every day. Fortunately  we are more hopeful now than in the past about a gathering common approach against terrorism and extremism in our region. This year’s General Assembly session is taking place at a time in which the United Nations has seen a number of conflicts continue  while new ones have taken shape. In Syria  we watch the ongoing immeasurable suffering of the great people of that country. Afghanistan calls for an immediate halt to the violence there  which has taken the lives of more than 100 000 people  forced more than 2 million Syrians to become refugees and left 6.8 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. We strongly support a political solution  reached through a broad-based national dialogue that meets the aspirations of all Syrians. Moreover  the international community must provide the support necessary to address the humanitarian needs of those affected by the conflict  including the millions who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. Speaking of long-standing conflicts  none is more evident than the decades-long strife between Palestine and Israel. Following years of deadlock and impasse  we see that renewed efforts for a peaceful settlement have emerged with the resumption of direct negotiations between the two sides. That is an important development  which we hope will result in durable peace  enabled by the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. We also hope to witness the inclusion of the State of Palestine as a full Member of the Organization.In conclusion  as I stand before the Assembly  I feel more strongly than ever that our shared vision of a world free from violence  conflict and destitution will be achieved only if we put our differences aside and act as one. If we adhere to the principles of understanding  solidarity and cooperation  we will be able to secure our collective future  as evidenced in the historic successes we have achieved in Afghanistan over the past 12 years.The United Nations has been a reliable partner in helping us come this far. As we prepare to embark upon the transformation decade  we expect the Organization to continue its support through a renewed approach that reinforces Afghanistan’s leadership and ownership. Let me also assure the Assembly that  as we in Afghanistan work to preserve our gains and consolidate our young democracy in the crucial years ahead  we will remain an active Member of the United Nations."
"2",82,"AGO",68,2013,"On behalf of the President of the Republic of Angola  His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos  whom I have the honour to represent before the Assembly  allow me to congratulate Ambassador John William Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to assure him of my country’s support in the fulfilment of that important and noble mission. I would also like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the effective manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session  and we salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continued dedication to the cause of our Organization.This session of the General Assembly is taking place in a complex international climate  one where the intervention of the international community is needed to provide lasting solutions to conflicts that constitute serious threats to international peace and security. The prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact on populations  terrorism  organized crime and drug trafficking  maritime piracy  environmental crimes and looting of resources  as well as extreme poverty  deprivation and hunger are issues that require priority attention from our Organization. Angola reiterates the importance of the role of the United Nations as a driving force behind global efforts to maintain peace  stability and economic and social development  and it is therefore important to strengthen its capacity for conflict prevention and crisis management.My country will continue to contribute actively in peacekeeping efforts  assuming responsibilities at the international level  in particular with regard to Africa  as well as in the regional framework and the economic and political groups it is a part of  including the Southern African Development Community  the Economic Community of Central African States  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Gulf of Guinea Commission.In that context  the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region  signed in February in Addis Ababa  is both the most appropriate mechanism for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the best guarantee for regional stability and for safeguarding the peace  security  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We reiterate our call to the signatories to respect their commitments  and we condemn the threats that negative forces continue to pose to civilian populations  particularly in the city of Goma and its surrounding area.In the context of global efforts to maintain international peace and security  we reiterate the importance of revitalizing the United Nations system  particularly through reform of the Security Council  which should adapt to the realities of today’s world by increasing the number of its permanent members so as to fairly represent every region.We express our deep concern about the escalation of violence in Egypt and add our voice to the call to the transitional authorities to act with moderation. We urge the African Union and the international community to continue to work towards a solution to the crisis in that country.The conflict in Syria poses a risk to international peace and security  and the violence is seriously worsening the humanitarian situation in the region. We call on the international community to act urgently in order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the conflict through the mediation of the United Nations and the Arab League  and we urge respect for the human rights of civilians.The Israeli-Palestine conflict is one of the oldest on our planet and one that still confounds the international community. Angola supports the mediation efforts undertaken by United States Secretary of State John Kerry  and hopes for the resumption of dialogue and the conclusion of an agreement between Palestine and Israel that can convert the deadlock into lasting peace and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders  living side by side with the State of Israel in security.We note with concern the poor progress being made in resolving the question of Western Sahara  and we urge the parties to continue negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations  so that the people of Western Sahara can exercise their right to self-determination.Angola welcomes the normalization of the legal and constitutional framework of various African countries that  after tumultuous periods of instability  have successfully held free and fair elections and are now making strides towards building democratic States  establishing the rule of law and promoting economic and social development. In that connection  we welcome the democratic election of President Ibrahim Keita in Mali and express our solidarity with the process of reconciliation and reconstruction of the country. We also congratulate those countries that have shown positive developments and that despite unstable situations are working to implement agreements aimed at resolving crises and normalizing their constitutional frameworks. They include Guinea-Bissau  Madagascar  Somalia  the Sudan and South Sudan. We call for the entire international community to support the efforts those countries are making to achieve peace and stability.Six years after the onset of the international financial crisis  with its grave repercussions for the world economy  many countries are experiencing serious difficulties in financing programmes for economic growth and mobilizing resources for development aimed at improving living conditions and meeting the Millennium Development Goals. That situation is even more problematic for developing countries  particularly in Africa  where armed conflict and poverty frequently coincide.In that context  the Angolan Government believes that it is essential that we consider “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  the theme of this session of the General Assembly  in the hope that it will contribute effectively to the economic and social development of developing countries. The Angolan Government is of the view that during this session the Assembly should consider holding regional meetings based on the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  in which various leaders could define their positions on the post-2015 agenda from a regional perspective  and which could be followed by another meeting at the global level. In that regard  the Government of Angola reiterates its support for initiatives aimed at liberalizing international trade so as to promote fair and balanced competition  and we hope that the ninth World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference  scheduled to take place in Bali in December  will lead to the best results.Environmental challenges persist. By renewing the commitments to sustainable development contained in Agenda 21  the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development provided a sound basis for policy-making at the national and international levels and for ensuring the social  economic and environmental welfare of our peoples. To that end  we reiterate that it is essential to take appropriate measures to strengthen international support for actions in support of sustainable development  as well as to increase the financial resources of the United Nations budget through contributions so as to enable the Organization to fulfil its mandate efficiently and make sustainable development a reality.On another topic  the embargo against Cuba violates the rules of international law and has for decades been a major impediment to the development of that country and to the improvement of the living conditions of the Cuban people. Angola reiterates its position of principle that  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  the embargo should be brought to an end.Angola reiterates its belief in mutual respect and mutual benefit  good neighbourliness and the strengthening of regional economic integration. Angola will continue to respect all international commitments and treaties to which it is a party. We respect and implement the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutional Act of the African Union  and we establish relations based on the principles of self-determination  the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights.Currently  Angola is experiencing a period of consolidation in its democratic institutions and the rule of law. There has also been a dynamic process of reconstruction and development marked by the consolidation of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a national policy and strategy for the promotion of economic diversification contained in our economic and social development plan for the period 2013-2017.By agreeing to join the programme of countries eligible to graduate from the least developed country category  Angola reaffirms its priority to implement a programme of diversification of its domestic production aimed at achieving balanced growth in various sectors  expanding employment opportunities and decreasing its dependence on imports of consumer products and its high dependence on oil sector exports.Despite progress made in the past decade and the fact that the Angolan economy is on the right path  much remains to be done in order to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals. Aware of that challenge  the Government continues to develop programmes aimed at reducing social inequality  while pursuing the fight against hunger and poverty as two crucial elements for building a prosperous society and attaining social justice. Furthermore  rehabilitating and upgrading the main productive and social infrastructure  including the reconstruction of roads and railways  electricity and water supply and distribution systems  and sanitation and telecommunication networks  continue to be a challenge for the Government in its quest to improve the well-being of the population and attain sustainable development in Angola.I would like to conclude by referring to an issue of particular importance for the Government of my country. The Republic of Angola is a candidate for non-permanent-member status in the Security Council  with elections to be held at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We hope we can count on the support of all the States that make up the Assembly.I will finish by expressing my country’s unconditional support for the initiatives of the United Nations aimed at building a better world for all  based on justice and freedom  free from all threats that endanger international peace and security."
"3",129,"ALB",68,2013,"I am the newly elected Prime Minister of Albania. This is my first month in office. It is truly humbling to stand at this rostrum in the steps and the shadows of some of the great figures of history who have stood here and shaped our world  in this forum  which  for all the criticisms of the United Nations  is a living reminder that good must come from bad and that the march of progress through time is powered by debate  ideas  cooperation  argument and agreement.Albania is no great Power; it is a small country  but with great potential. It has outstanding natural beauty and good and hard-working people. My challenge is to bring change so that this potential can be fulfilled. It will take time. It will take a lot of effort and perseverance. It will take understanding and support from friends and partners. For my part  I will add leadership. We have a long way to go  but it can be done.I was reading a study recently that analysed every country in the world  measuring the positive and negative media coverage. Switzerland was at the top; Albania was 161st. In truth  people around the world may not know that much about Albania  but what they think they know is not good. The film industry has not been kind to us — Wag The Dog  Taken  Taken 2. Even I was a bit scared to be in Albania after that. I hope one day Liam Neeson  Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro can visit and see what a beautiful country it is and feel the potential that I feel.But I am not naive. Our problems are not all based in Hollywood. Some are real and damaging  such as corruption  which scars countries in the way the swish of a blade can scar a beautiful face. It deters legitimate investors from investing. It holds back progress. It stops people from believing there can ever be fairness. Corruption can and must be beaten if we are to build the economic rule of law we need  get the investment we need and attract the tourism that our scenery  heritage and warm  welcoming people deserve. It will not be easy  but it can be done  and we are fully committed.The world has changed tremendously in the course of recent decades  and it is changing now at an even faster pace. We all expect the United Nations to follow suit. United Nations reform is not only necessary; it has become imperative. If we fail to agree and act on that  the role which the United Nations is to play will remain incomplete.One of the important aspects of change is the ongoing reform of the delivery of development assistance. In the course of a few years  delivering as one has proved to be a valuable achievement  and it represents today an avenue for deeper reform. If we want more effectiveness  better efficiency and coherent action by various United Nations actors and if we aim for better results on the ground and better value for our money  delivering as one is the way to go. We have pledged our support and will continue to do so as we are convinced that is the right path. The United Nations is beyond any doubt one of the most important world bodies. We joined it in the middle of the past century. But it is not alone; for us  the European Union (EU)  which represents the most important political project the world has known to date  is another. We aspire to join it. We know the changes we have to make  and I am determined to make them.If the EU has turned its attention towards our region  particularly due to past conflicts  together we — Albanians  Serbs  Montenegrins  Bosnians  Macedonians and all the other peoples of the region who have already joined the European Union — should maintain our eyes and our focus on the EU for projects related to our development for a better and more prosperous common future. Regional cooperation that is not grounded in strategic projects serving the economic revival of all our countries in the process of integration into the European Union as a developed economic area would be completely ineffective. We have neither the time nor the luxury to engage in time-consuming  ineffective projects. No country of the region can afford such a luxury. Consequently  we should create new momentum in regional cooperation by effectively combining the objectives of the South East Europe 2020 strategy with the projects of the Europe 2020 agenda. We should not forget that successful regional cooperation has a direct effect on meeting economic accession criteria. Undoubtedly  meeting such criteria through intense and fruitful regional cooperation is neither an easy nor a simple task.My vision for Albania is also a vision of the Balkans working together  in defiance of our history of so much war and conflict  although — let us say it loudly and proudly — these are past wars and past conflicts. I want to share my conviction that the remarkable agreement between Kosovo and Serbia launched a new era in South-East Europe. Their dialogue  which was an act of courage and wisdom on the part of both Kosovo and Serbia  with much-appreciated facilitation by the European Union  challenges every country of the region to mobilize its efforts in new and innovative forms of collaboration and cooperation. Not everything is easy or perfect. There are still a few here and there who continue to think in the past. But the prevailing truth is that Prime Ministers Thaçi and Da.i. have shouldered their leadership responsibility to bring their countries into the future they both deserve. More than anything  in a world interconnected and interdependent like never before  where space and relationships are related and recreated in continuity  it is crucial to live in the new time without prolonging the old one of conflicts and nationalism.In this regard  Albania is committed to peace and prosperity in the region. This is why it is committed to the irreversible independence of Kosovo  which is already recognized by 104 Member States. This is why it calls upon all countries that have not yet recognized Kosovo to do so. They will not only help Kosovo and its people  but they will join those who  by recognizing Kosovo  have played an important role in strengthening security and stability in South-East Europe.To those who are sceptical  I say that the people of Kosovo  like all the other peoples that now enjoy fully recognized  independent republics following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia  deserve the recognition of their sovereignty  particularly as they have demonstrated  more than any other people in the region  their indisputable commitment to human rights  minority rights  dialogue and peace. Without this commitment  it would be very difficult for our region to make progress towards integration into the European Union. But their commitment is obvious and firm  and the region has been making remarkable progress towards its most important goal — integration into the European Union. Croatia has joined the European Union. We are waiting in the queue  as are Serbia and Kosovo.I have no doubt that  provided that each and every country of the region replaces the politics of division with the politics of cooperation  and provided that we build shared values  beliefs and policies instead of clinging to ancient enmities  we can show how much we have changed and how quickly we can make the further changes needed to take our place alongside others in the modern European family of nations. It will undoubtedly take time and perseverance. It will take the understanding and support of European Union member States. It will take leadership on the part of us all  and as past practice and successful examples show  it can be done.This is a very serious commitment  and I would like to state here that it is our firm intention to explore every possibility to initiate a constructive debate  develop a real dialogue and foster close cooperation in every possible aspect with each and every country of the region  including  notably  Serbia. Let the Balkans  which have been known so long for war and bloodshed  now be known for changing its ways and thereby change the world for the better.I wish that  in this statement of hope  I could avoid having to speak about one of the most terrible human tragedies of our times  which has been unfolding before our eyes for two and a half years now. It has taken more than 100 000 human lives. It is destroying an entire generation and has brought a country to ruin. The recent large-scale use of chemical weapons constitutes a despicable crime against humanity that should not and must not remain unpunished.Yet even within such a bleak picture  there has been a glimpse of hope. Yesterday  the Security Council finally adopted resolution 2118 (2013)  on the removal and destruction of chemical weapons in Syria  which we welcome. It must now be quickly and fully implemented. As I walked to this rostrum  I felt the extraordinary sense of responsibility that the leadership of a country implies. I felt the power of the historic forces pulsating in this building. I felt the new world it has shaped  the challenges it has met  the challenges it has failed to meet and the challenges we  the family of nations  struggle to meet today in this ever more interdependent and complicated world.I ran for office on the theme of renaissance  but we all know that words spoken while campaigning are the easy part. What is hard is turning those words into deeds  actions  policies and projects that deliver change. I am confident  but I am humble enough to know I cannot do it alone. I have much to learn  and the United Nations is one of those places where one always finds people  individuals  groups and Governments who can teach with experience and lead by example. We need support. We need partners and friends willing to be part of our journey for change. Renaissance means a new Albania. Building the renaissance is the challenge we face. It will take time. It will take perseverance. It will take the understanding and support of partners and friends. It will also take leadership  which I am committed to. But I know it can be done."
"4",152,"AND",68,2013,"I should like to begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda. We are fully convinced that he will be a manifest example of how small States can shoulder the responsibilities deriving from participating in the international community. It is both an honour and a great responsibility to address the Assembly on behalf of the people and the Government of the Principality of Andorra. It is doubly an honour as we are celebrating 20 years since our country became a Member of the United Nations.In 1993  with the approval of the Constitution and our entry into the United Nations  Andorra’s 700-year reality as a sovereign  democratic country that had no army and had remained neutral — few countries can make such a claim — in the heart of the Pyrenees was formally recognized. The visit of the Secretary-General to our country in April on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of our Constitution served to reiterate once again Andorra’s commitment to the principles and values of the United Nations. Those principles and values must not remain mere high-sounding declarations and founding charters  but must be translated into greater effectiveness in improving people’s lives. It is particularly worth noting the emphasis that the United Nations has placed on development in recent years. I refer to the Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000  which are to be assessed definitively in two years’ time. It was particularly relevant to directly link the main principles of peace  democracy and the negotiated resolution of conflicts and human rights with more specific matters of extreme importance  such as the eradication of poverty and hunger  universal primary education and the sustainability and protection of the environment.At this session of the General Assembly  we have discussed and we will continue to discuss the definition of new goals to be introduced after 2015. However  we must not forget that all reports indicate that we shall reach that date without having accomplished most of the Goals set in 2000. Over the past 13 years we have advanced very little with respect to the sustainability and protection of the environment. Child mortality continues to increase in the poorest regions and countries. Achieving universal primary education by 2015 is totally unviable  and progress towards preventing and treating AIDS in the poorer countries remains inadequate. A great deal of work remains to be done.It would not  however  be fair to emphasize only what we have not done and to forget all the progress that has been achieved in other areas. Since 2000  the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has been halved. The share of the world’s population with access to safe drinking water rose from 76 per cent in 1990 to 89 per cent in 2010. Notable progress has been achieved in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis  and the goal of reducing hunger by 50 per cent in 2015 would appear to be achievable  which would be a great success. Andorra applauds the decision to conjoin the United Nations main principles with specific objectives to solve the great problems faced by humankind. We must not give the impression that we are just a group of Heads of State and Government who have met in a First World city  full of fine words and good intentions  but completely ineffective when it comes to solving the problems threatening the lives and dignity of millions of people all over the world. Unfortunately  that is the image that we have at times projected to the international community. That is why I said that we applaud the fact that specific objectives have been set  that we evaluate progress towards meeting them and that we come here to explain that progress and shortcomings. I hope the goals of the post-2015 agenda will be even more ambitious and that we will be able to dedicate even more effort to realizing them. That is because the citizens of the world need to know that those who proclaim the expansion of democracy and the rule of law are the same people who have striven to reduce poverty  hunger and child mortality and to promote gender equality and universal education  which are so important. Otherwise  we will run the risk of citizens perceiving their institutions and the United Nations as being far removed from their everyday lives and real problems. Even more seriously  we would run the risk of words such as “democracy”  “human rights” and “international law” becoming meaningless.A year ago  on the occasion of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly  we condemned and repudiated the Benghazi attack. Today  one year later  we must all feel that we are citizens of Nairobi. We must stand with those who condemn terrorism and defend the principles of the United Nations. A year ago we used this platform to express our deep concern about the civil war in Syria  in particular the conflict’s devastating effects on the Syrian population. We said then that the conflict was creating a terrible dilemma for the international community — that of finding the right balance between a diplomatic resolution and respect for the rule of law. The use of chemical weapons against civilians  which we condemn and which is contrary to all the values that the General Assembly upholds  places the international community in a scenario that requires firm and strong answers. The strong reaction to the situation led by the United States and France  along with the pragmatic attitude of Russia  has generated the momentum to advance in the search for that fair balance. First is the issue of reaching agreement on the evidence and destruction of such chemical weapons; second is the issue of taking advantage of this dynamic in order to make greater diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict. That will require new steps towards furthering the Geneva process. Nor must we forget the humanitarian dimension of the Syrian conflict  which is not only a priority but a terrible loss and a cruel emergency. The resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis can also be included in the dynamic of our quest for the right balance  based on a two-State-solution  between the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people for a peaceful and democratic State and the desire of Israelis to obtain assurances for their existence  safety and security.Each and every time we are unable to resolve a conflict  we are jeopardizing the principles and values that are most valued by the international community: peace  security  dialogue  human rights and democracy. It is not always easy for the international community to find a fair and effective way of responding  perhaps because we are responding to the problems rather than preventing them. Therefore  I would like to return to what I said at the beginning of my speech. We cannot allow the principles and values of the United Nations to be relegated to high-flown declarations that have no positive impact on people’s lives. Peace  the rule of law and democracy must be accompanied by effective respect for human rights and a substantial improvement in the living conditions of people  which means less poverty  less hunger  more education and more gender equality. An ambitious development agenda that is implemented effectively is the best way of preventing conflicts and ensuring peace and security.Early in my statement  in recalling Andorra’s admission into the United Nations 20 years ago  I referred to the more than seven centuries of peace in our country  which is a relevant point to make at an event such as this. I am sure that other Andorran representatives have raised this point. We are proud of our country’s peaceful history  but we are also keenly aware that Andorra  a small State  would probably not have enjoyed more than 700 years of peace had there been any great inequalities among its inhabitants  had the laws not been fair or had tyranny reigned instead of a parliamentary regime  since there cannot be peace without justice in Andorra or anywhere else. All of us who are here today  all of us who have spoken from this rostrum this week  are obligated to ensure peace and justice  democracy and development  human rights and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. All the principles and values to which we are firmly committed must always go hand in hand. It is a long and difficult path  but it is the only way in which a better world can possibly come about. Referring to what President Obama said a few days ago (see A/68/PV.5)  it is obvious that we live in a world of imperfect choices. This difficulty must not be used as an excuse for our failure to act. As President Hollande stated from this very rostrum (see A/68/PV.5)  the United Nations has a responsibility to act  and the worst decision is to take no action at all. "
"5",197,"ARE",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election to serve at its sixty-eighth session. I am confident that his experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his wise leadership during the last session  and to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his staff for their tireless efforts to promote global peace  security and development.The United Arab Emirates continues to firmly believe in the purposes and principles of the United Nations  as enshrined in its Charter  calling for the protection of international peace and security  the promotion of peaceful coexistence among nations and peoples through the peaceful resolution of international disputes  respect for the provisions of international law  and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Those goals also call for us to foster a climate favourable to international relations based on tolerance  non-violence and recognition of others. My country has followed such an approach in its regional and international relations.However  we cannot conceal our deep concern at the recent events in the Arab region associated with sectarian strife  an escalation in terrorist attacks and growing incitement to violence  which  in turn  have given rise to extreme polarization in the region and among its peoples  severely impacting stability and development. In the Arab Gulf  we see how extremism and terrorism in the Kingdom of Bahrain are threatening to undermine security and stability and destroy a history of tolerance in which sectarianism has never played any role. The situation has been further aggravated by the politicization and exploitation of the religion of Islam by those seeking to use it as a tool to exclude and marginalize other segments of society  which  until now  had all lived in constructive  harmonious and peaceful coexistence.All of this has led to widespread fears about the fate of the national State and what that implies in terms of the undermining of the pillars of the State  the wasting of its resources and the weakening of its economy. As members may be aware  such difficult conditions have put the young people of the region in jeopardy of falling into the clutches of extremism and violence  especially in a climate of growing despair and lack of opportunities.That is why the United Arab Emirates gives paramount importance to its efforts aimed at promoting a culture of moderation and non-violence and fighting extremism in all its forms. In that regard  I refer in particular to my country’s initiative to fight extremism through the Hedayah International Centre of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism. The United Arab Emirates actually proposed the Centre’s establishment at a meeting held here at the United Nations  and today the Centre is seeing the light.In that context  I can only condemn in the strongest possible terms all cowardly attacks  but particularly the terrorist attack committed at the shopping centre in Nairobi  which resulted in the deaths of dozens of innocent victims.The United Arab Emirates is deeply disappointed at the international community’s inability to put an immediate end to the worsening tragedy of the brotherly Syrian people caused by continual military actions and indiscriminate and systematic bombings by Syrian forces in Damascus. So far  more than 100 000 people have been killed and millions of people have been injured or displaced. This is an extremely dangerous violation of international law and international humanitarian law.We are deeply concerned at the increasingly serious implications of the conflict in Syria and the entire region. We strongly condemn and reject all crimes against humanity committed by the Syrian regime  especially the chemical attack against Ghouta  Damascus  which killed thousands of civilians  including children. We therefore call upon the international community to take all measures necessary to punish the Syrian regime for its massacring of civilians. The Assembly should be aware of the frustration that we and the majority of countries in the region feel with respect to the dysfunction of United Nations mechanisms that could have prevented the Syrian regime’s aggressive acts against its own people. The Organization’s failure to act is directly responsible for exacerbating the humanitarian tragedy that we are witnessing in Syria today. It is also responsible for the threat to the Syrian State  Syrian society and the Syrian people.The United Arab Emirates has fulfilled its responsibilities with respect to ongoing relief operations for the Syrian people and continues to provide all kinds of aid — building hospitals  providing medical supplies and staffing medical teams. It calls for concerted international and regional efforts  directly or through international organizations  to meet the humanitarian needs of Syrians displaced inside Syria and across the country’s borders  with a view to alleviating their suffering.In that context  we are seeking in these meetings to address the issues of our region  its stability and its future. That the issues and events that take place in Egypt are very important and cannot be overlooked is beyond question. Egypt is a pivotal State whose stability and civil peace signify that the region is beginning to recover. Accordingly  the United Arab Emirates is following with great interest the positive developments that are occurring in Egypt  as we firmly believe that Egypt plays a key role in ensuring stability  development and prosperity. There is no doubt that a stable and calm Egypt is vital to security and peace  not only in the Arab region  but in the world as a whole.On 30 June  Egypt experienced a second wave of revolution  when tens of millions of Egyptians expressed their resolute will to draw up a road map for a better future for their country. In it the ground is laid for an inclusive democratic path based on the participation of all segments of society without any exceptions  within the framework of a policy characterized by moderation  centrism  non-violence and the non-use of religion as a means to exclude or classify or to foment sectarianism or hatred. The United Arab Emirates therefore believes that the sovereign measures implemented by the Egyptian Government to protect national security and the steps it has taken to implement the road map supported by the people give grounds for optimism and enhance the Egyptian Government’s credibility. I would also take this opportunity to urge the international community to stand behind Egypt at this critical juncture and support the sincere efforts of its interim Government to lay the foundations of stability  development and civilian constitutional rule.The United Arab Emirates recognizes the suffering of the Arab region caused by the interference of others in its internal affairs and the ensuing threats to national statehood generally. We therefore wish to warn of the danger of interfering in the domestic affairs of Egypt and call on everyone to refrain from disrupting the country’s march towards stability and democracy.The issues that the Arab region faces are all interconnected. Everyone in this Hall realizes that peace emerges as a central and relevant issue to all that is occurring there. Although many decades have passed  the Palestinian people continue to look forward to realizing their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State  with East Jerusalem as its capital  based on international legal instruments that recognize their right to establish a State  in line with the 4 June 1967 borders  as confirmed by United Nations resolutions and in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative.In that regard  I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the relaunching of peace talks under the auspices of the United States. We hope that those talks will lead to positive results in the form of the establishment of a Palestinian State. We also welcome the European Union’s constructive position consisting of non-recognition of the legitimacy of the Israeli settlements and the decision to cease its dealings with them. The United Arab Emirates is ready to contribute to a successful outcome of the new initiative in order to achieve security  peace and economic growth in that important part of the world.Security and stability in the Gulf region represent a high priority in the balanced policy that we have derived from principles found in the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law  especially those that call for peaceful coexistence  confidence-building  good neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  and the pursuit of peaceful means in the resolution of conflicts and disputes. Based on those principles  my Government expresses  once again  its regret at the continued Iranian occupation of our three islands — Abu Musa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — and demands that the undiminished sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over those islands be fully restored.We emphasize that all actions and measures taken by the Iranian occupation authorities are considered null and void and are contrary to international law and all norms of common human values. Therefore  we call upon the international community to urge Iran to respond to my country’s repeated peaceful  sincere request for a just settlement of the dispute  either through direct  serious negotiations between our two nations or by referring the case to the International Court of Justice  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law.Acting from our firm principles in regional and international relations  we welcome the declared approach of Mr. Hassan Rouhani  President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We affirm that our country will sincerely cooperate with him in the interest of promoting security  stability and prosperity in the region.There has been considerable debate about Iran’s nuclear programme. Many suspicions revolve around it. Therefore  we urge Iran to constructively cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency  defuse all scepticism about the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities  and act with full transparency and clarity to avoid any negative consequences that could arise from the absence of such cooperation. The United Arab Emirates does  however  believe that the peaceful use of nuclear energy has become an urgent requirement to meet today’s growing demand for energy.We are proud that we are a nation that has pioneered peaceful uses of nuclear energy  which are surrounded by all possible security and safety guarantees. The United Arab Emirates has opened the way for the introduction of renewable energy and the development of clean-energy technologies as its contribution to humankind in protecting the planet from the negative effects of climate change.The United Arab Emirates firmly believes in the necessity of achieving human development at the national and international levels. That goal can be achieved only when a number of conditions are met  including respect for human rights and for the equality of all without discrimination on the basis of gender  ethnicity  religion  language or any other ground. That requires due regard for human dignity  the renunciation of violence and the prohibition of torture and abuse. The United Arab Emirates has been encouraged by the positive response to its periodic report by the members of the Human Rights Council  who commended the country’s achievements and progress.Achieving overall human development requires the creation of an environment conducive to tolerance and moderation  free of any incitement to hatred. In that context  it is necessary to support and promote dialogue among different countries and religions  without arrogance or superiority on the part of any culture over another  because each culture has something to give and something to gain with respect to another’s culture.The empowerment of women  the recognition of their vital role in communities and the protection of women against discrimination in various fields are imperatives for the international community. The United Arab Emirates is proud of the significant measures it has taken in that respect  which have won the United Arab Emirates a high ranking among the countries in the region. Our country has also made significant strides in combating human trafficking  and it has developed national legislation to stand firm against that inhumane crime.Achieving sustainable development for all people is a major priority for the United Nations and its Member States and one which will require scientific and technical cooperation  as well as the transfer of technology between developed and developing countries  to further the common good of all peoples and countries of the world."
"6",244,"ARG",68,2013,"I would particularly like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly and his country Antigua and Barbuda  a member of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. It is an honour for all Latin Americans that he is presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.I would like to begin by expressing our solidarity with the victims of the attacks in Kenya and Pakistan  and generally to all the victims of the terrorist attacks occurring in various parts of the world. I say this not out of formal sympathy or for reasons of protocol  but because our country  Argentina  along with the United States of America  is the only one on the American continent to have suffered a terrorist attack — in our case  on two occasions: in 1992  when the Israeli Embassy in the city of Buenos Aires was blown up  and two years later  when the Jewish community centre AMIA in Argentina was bombed. Some of the relatives of the victims are here with us  as always  and I can see them from here. Clearly  we are talking about victims. These were not soldiers or fighters. They were people who were getting on a bus  perhaps entering a bar or going to work  and who were surprised by an explosion. They had not taken part in any war; they were not combatants or soldiers; they had not chosen to go and fight. So I am thinking of those victims and their families  who deserve our solidarity and the strongest possible condemnation of all forms of terrorism.In the context of this sixty-eighth session of the Assembly  we see the Syrian question as a common thread. Almost in a premonition  only a short while ago I was here at the United Nations  presiding over a meeting of the Security Council  of which Argentina is a non-permanent member for 2013-2014. On 6 August  just about a month and a half ago  we proposed a measure to reform the Security Council. We stated that the functioning and the rationale of the Council actually reflected another era  that of the Cold War  when fear of nuclear holocaust had led to the creation of the Organization  uniting the forces that had defeated Nazi Germany  and then produced a bipolar world. That fear of nuclear war resulted in a system with veto power so that no one would be able to push a button and blow up the world. The fact is that that instrument  which worked in 1945  has now been shown to be dysfunctional and completely obsolete — and not only as regards the Syrian question  but also when it comes to dealing with issues affecting peace and security around the world.Incidentally  I would like to express my appreciation for the fact that for the first time we have been given the opportunity to speak at such a late hour of the day  because it has somewhat interrupted the inertia of the course of the meeting. There are times when we come to these meetings with a format  almost a monologue  that makes it difficult to present arguments or counter-arguments that take into account the statements made by previous speakers. I have listened very carefully to almost all of the addresses given earlier today. Obviously  I paid particular attention to those that touch on the global decision-making system  and  of course  because I am a staunch supporter of multilateralism  I paid a lot of attention to the first address  by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.In many of those statements I heard mention of 21 August. On 6 August  we spoke of the need for Security Council reform and of the fact that the right of veto is no longer necessary. There should be a system — such as those used by regional organizations of the Americas  such as the Union of South American Nations  Community of Latin American and Caribbean States or the Southern Common Market and its associated States — in which decisions are taken by consensus. Why is that? Governmental administration is different  as the power of veto is necessary in order to govern. When dealing with conflict resolution and management  if one party to the conflict  or an interested party  has the right of veto  that right necessarily becomes an obstacle to the resolution of the conflict. We did not know what would occur 15 or 16 days later. Many have noted that the crisis in Syria erupted on 21 August. In fact  it is extremely difficult to understand that the current crisis in Syria was only recognized on 21 August  when we became aware of chemical weapons. Syria has been caught up in that conflict for over two and a half years. Over 150 000 people have lost their lives and 99 per cent of them died as a result of conventional weapons — not chemical weapons. I remember that at the last meeting of the Group of Twenty (G-20)  during a discussion about Syria  I asked  “What is the difference between a death resulting from bullets  anti-personnel mines  missiles or hand grenades  and a death resulting from chemical weapons?” Each is more or less equally shocking. As it is not the first time  why is there talk of chemical weapons as if it were the first time that chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction have been used? I recall a statement made by another leader today with reference to the terrible gas chambers of the Nazis  the gas in the trenches and the chemical weapons used in other instances. I also remember hearing about and reading about — as I had not yet been born — the nuclear holocaust in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the consequences of using those weapons on many generations of Japanese people. I remember when I was much younger — the President of Uruguay also recalled the time of his youth  I was less than 20 years of age  and many others will probably also remember — when napalm and phosphorous were used during the Viet Nam War. That was recorded forever in the Pulitzer prize-winning photographs of naked boys and a naked girl. I remember  as if it were today  that naked young girl running down a road after having been hit by napalm in a bombing.I also remember  in all fairness  the suffering of the people of the United States when they saw the doors of the planes open and they saw the corpses of the soldiers who had gone to fight being removed  wrapped in black plastic bags. I can imagine the pain of each girlfriend  each sister  each wife  each daughter of the soldier who had died  trying to understand why. Many did not understand why the soldiers had had to lose their lives many thousands of kilometres away from their country. It is so irrational  so unjust. There are no just wars. Only peace is just.On 6 August  in the discussions on the issue of peace and security  it was stated that peace and security are not military concepts; rather  they are political concepts. Today  I was pleased to hear the Secretary-General mention that very concept  which we had referred to in the Security Council — namely  that peace and security are not military but rather political concepts. Therefore  we welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached on the question of Syria. My country opposed direct intervention — bombing. It was quite simple. The argument that  in order to avoid deaths  you would cause even more deaths could not be sustained by any reasoning or even common sense. We did not speak out at that time only to speak. Furthermore  we were not discussing just any country  but one with great respect for the norms of international law.My country  Argentina  has signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  making Argentina one of the most advanced countries — if not the most advanced country — in developing nuclear power for peaceful and scientific purposes. We sell nuclear power generators to Egypt  Algeria and Australia. We also use nuclear energy for medical purposes. We do not condemn the use of nuclear energy for warfare while at the same time deploying nuclear submarines. That has been our experience  for example  in connection with the sovereignty dispute involving our Malvinas Islands  since the United Kingdom has militarized the southern Atlantic region and sent nuclear submarines. We have no double standards. We are not hypocritical. We have not only signed the NPT but are also parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)  as was also mentioned by the Secretary-General in his statement.In other words  when we speak of condemning dictators  we are actually parties to the Rome Statute and can be brought before the Court. We are also members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington  D.C. It is curious that many who speak of respect for human rights  the relevant institutions  international law and the ICC and often refer to human rights have not signed the treaties on the subject.If one is to speak of human rights  Argentina has accomplished a great deal. We were a founding Member of the Organization and promoted the creation of a human rights secretariat within the United Nations and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. I am joined here by the head of the Asociación Madres de Plaza de Mayo. She was also with me in Paris to sign the treaty  of which we are a founding party.I referred to human rights because there was something said today about human rights in another speech. It has been said here that if this is the world in which people want to live  then they should say so and be prepared to face the cold logic of mass graves. Argentina too can speak of mass graves. Even today  well into the twenty-first century  we continue to come upon mass graves that hold the remains of the thousands of prisoners and those who disappeared under the genocidal dictatorship that began 24 March 1976  which was similar to the one that took power on 11 September 1973 in our sister republic of Chile  overthrowing the democratically elected Government of Salvador Allende.How wonderful it would have been  after all the speeches condemning genocidal dictators  if someone back then had come to the aid of the Argentine and Chilean and so many other peoples of the American continent who  in the midst of the Cold War  were the sacrificial victims of murderous dictators. But it was also said here that  if those who cared about human rights were moved to act on someone’s behalf  perhaps if that concern had at least coincided with the interests of some great Power  they would have acted differently. We have spoken of those things here  including the need to put an end to that double standard  and we have said that the resolutions and decisions of a multilateral organization such as the United Nations must take place on a level playing field for the weak and the strong  the small and the large. We have been waiting since 1965  when the plenary and many resolutions of the Assembly and the Committee on Decolonization required both Argentina and the United Kingdom to sit down to hold a dialogue — another word that I have repeatedly heard in every speech. There is a dispute over the matter of sovereignty over the Malvinas  and yet the United Kingdom has turned a cold shoulder. And so we continue with double standards  which some people do not like to hear mention of. But hypocrisies are like witches; evidently  they exist. I have also heard — I should add that I have heard with pleasure  so not everything has to do with double standards — that there has at last been recognition  as an essential basis for beginning to untie the Gordian knot that the matter of the Middle East represents  of the need to recognize the State of Palestine and the right of the State of Israel to live securely within its borders. Moreover  I think it has quite rightly been said that it is impossible to achieve security for the State of Israel unless there is also recognition of the existence  and support for the viability of the physical existence of  the State of Palestine. We can do no less than agree on that characterization.I have also heard the new President of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and I have heard the comments that the great Powers have made about that change of Government. If I understood correctly  there appears to be a kind of new expectation of change in the face of the new authorities in the Republic of Iran  with which  as the Assembly knows  we have a disagreement that stems from — a cause of mine — a formal case by the Argentine judiciary against five Iranian citizens in connection with their participation in the bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina. It has now been 10 years since  for the first time  on 25 May 2003  then President Néstor Kirchner called in this same Hall for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate in clarifying the facts of that case. Year after year until 2007  he continued to do so  and from 2007 until today I myself have also continued to do so. A little over a year ago  we received a reply from the then Foreign Minister of Iran offering to initiate talks and reach an agreement on cooperation. Why? For a very simple reason. Because the case has been stalled for 19 years. Nothing has moved. If there are five Iranian accused  the only one with whom I can and must speak so that the judge can take a deposition from those five citizens is obviously the Republic of Iran. That seems very obvious  but often in this peculiar world  even in my own country  which is also a bit peculiar  obvious things have to be explained.I have also heard today about imperfect choices. I liked that expression  which was used by one of the Presidents. I think that when Argentina spends 10 years asking for cooperation and then suddenly someone finally says “Fine  we are going to talk; we are going to cooperate”  there was no other possible choice except to sit down together. That issue used was internally in our country to attack us politically  and here too in the United States by the vulture funds to pit us against the United States Congress and say that we were reaching an agreement  a treaty  with Iran. But on what? Nuclear weapons? No. On a strategic alliance to attack the West? No. On an agreement to convert to Islam? No. The agreement was simply to unblock the procedural impasse in order for the Argentine judiciary to take depositions from the accused  while at the same time ensuring due process through a commission of international jurists who would be neither Iranian nor Argentine and whose actions would not be binding. The treaty was approved in my country nine months ago. I could almost say that the baby is about to be born  if I were to put it in biological terms or in terms of childbirth. It was approved by all the appropriate organisms  including the Parliament. It was published in the official bulletin. The world knows that Argentina has duly complied with that treaty. To those who found it so convenient for Iran — after nine years with no news or notification or agreement from the Iranian authorities  I wonder if we were not right ourselves when we affirmed and said that it was a way to unblock the issue.The fact is that there is now a new Government to whose speeches I listened attentively  and a President who declared in statements I read that he in no way denied the Holocaust. That is very important. At least it is important to me and to many citizens around the world. Even today  he specifically declared that through the recent election  by displacing a leader whose positions we have all heard  so there is no point in repeating them  Iranian society had proved that it wanted more moderate positions. We have heard  from this very rostrum and these very microphones  that there is a will to agree  to talk  to be an open and peaceful democratic society  and to act in goodwill.The President of France referred to the nuclear case as the important matter pertaining to Iran; I would like to speak about the issue of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina as the other major issue. They said they would make gestures by opening up to negotiations  and that they did not want weapons for military use. In other words  as I understood it  they were saying that they would adhere to what we support  which is non-proliferation. Now we wait to be told if the agreement has been approved  or when it will be. Moreover  we await the announcement of the date for the establishment of the commission  as well as a date for the Argentine judge to travel to Tehran — yes  to Tehran; we are not afraid and we will go there.We believe in the goodwill of people  and there is no reason for us not to believe that they actually want peace. Everyone who has spoken here has said they wanted peace and that they loved one another  so we believe everyone. But we also hope to see everyone acting consistent with their words and actions. I therefore wanted to put this specific question on the table. I have no doubt that  if the words we have heard here are true  we will see a positive response. I say that to avoid any misunderstanding as to our deep conviction and belief in the rules of international law  and also to make it clear that our patience does not mean that we are naive or even foolish. We think that more than enough time has gone by  and we think answers are now needed. The victims deserve this. The Islamic Republic of Iran deserves that too  if it really wants to show to the world that this is a different Government and that its actions are also different. I trust that this will be the case. I have no reason to think otherwise.As for other matters that I wish to discuss  let me say that we are “serial abiders” when it comes to the norms of international law. We are also “serial victims” of other unwritten rules that are nevertheless very important in today’s world of finance and economics. They are norms not written by the major international financial centres or the risk-rating agencies or those that speculate  like the vulture funds  when it comes to dealing with countries that  like Argentina  defaulted on their debt  in the case of Argentina in 2001.There has also been talk here of poverty and the need for children to have access to education. I wish to read out two paragraphs of the address by the Secretary-General. The first has to do with weapons  wherein he speaks about poverty and points out that “at a time of pressing human need  spending on weapons remains absurdly high. Let us get our priorities right and invest in people instead of wasting billions of dollars on deadly weapons.” (A/68/PV.5  p. 3)For the record  Argentina does not produce any chemical weapons  or even sell conventional weapons. It would be interesting to find out — as I mentioned at the G-20 — who supplies weapons to the rebel groups that are fighting the Syrian Government. It goes without saying that the Government of Syria possesses the weapons of a State. We would like to know who supplies the weapons to those who fight the Syrian Government. This is not about taking any sides; rather it is just about putting forward something that is quite logical  for the weapons trade is today a real business.Did we really have to wait for 1 000 people to die as a result of chemical weapons to realize that 150 000 others had died before them? Why was an arms embargo not declared two years ago to prevent so many deaths? Well  that should be answered by those who sell weapons. We do not sell them and therefore cannot give an answer to that question — although we suspect what it would be.I would also like to read out another very significant passage in which the Secretary-General talked about the economic situation. Although the question of Syria has been the common thread running through the whole Assembly  it is clear that the economic crisis that started here in the United States with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 still  despite all speeches and things we have seen and heard  continues to generate volatility and fragility. The latter is a term that was often invoked  and not just in the G-20.We see millions of people unemployed around the world  a situation that very much reminds us of that in Argentina in 2001 when we defaulted on our own debt. This is linked to the fact that we are also serial victims of the unwritten rules of the lobbyists  of risk-rating agencies and of those who trade in financial derivatives and speculate like vultures hovering over countries in default  buying securities at very low prices and then attempting to make millions. That is the Argentine case  but it could be the story of any other country  very soon in fact. Since the Government of former President Néstor Kirchner first took office  on 25 May 2003  Argentina began to explore how to emerge from its debt  which accounted for 160 per cent of our country’s gross national product. We had 25 per cent unemployment  a poverty rate of 54 per cent and more than 30 per cent in extreme poverty. Many countries could perhaps see themselves mirrored in that state of affairs. In 2005 we organized the first restructuring process  which was accepted by 76 per cent of our creditors. During my own Government in 2010 we reopened the debt-restructuring process and managed to secure the approval of 93 per cent of our creditors. Consider that  in any country that has insolvency laws  when companies go bankrupt the law requires the agreement of at least 66 per cent of the creditors in order for the bankruptcy judge to make the remaining creditors accept the terms — at least  that is the case in Argentina. I think the number is the same in the United States  that is  66 per cent. In addition  here in the United States even municipalities can declare bankruptcy  and a judge may decide that  if the sustainability of the municipality is at stake  an even lower figure is acceptable. The fact remains that in 2010 Argentina reached agreement with 93 per cent of its creditors. Since 2005  Argentina has consistently and in a timely manner paid each and every one of its debt maturities  so much so that the last payment was made only a few days ago. That involved a bond subject to Argentine domestic law  payable in Buenos Aires. We paid $2.07 billion  and today our debt to gross domestic product ratio is a little under 45 per cent  down from 160 per cent  as I mentioned before. Much of the debt is actually public-sector debt. The foreign-currency-denominated debt of Argentina is only 8 per cent of gross domestic product  due both to national and foreign private holders. I would reiterate  however  that we have been in strict compliance. In 2008  seven years after Argentina defaulted on its debt  the vulture funds  as we call them  swooped in. The United Nations is caught between the vultures of debt and the hawks of war. It is worse than Hitchcock’s The Birds  since Hitchcock  at least  was a good director. But what is certain is that bonds were purchased for $40 million  and they now wish to collect on that while disregarding the creditors’ agreement to certain arrangements and extensions. The creditors  like any group of creditors  wanted to be repaid and so approved certain arrangements and extensions. But the vulture funds want to recover the whole nominal value of the bonds  without arrangements  extensions or delay. From the $40 million that they initially bought in the so-called self-regulated markets  they will recover $1.7 billion. So from 2008  we are talking about a yield of over 1 300 per cent. I would like to ask the Secretary-General where we can find businesspeople devoted to creating jobs  innovating and investing in production if  in this kind of casino economy  somebody can buy $40 million in defaulted bonds and then secure a court decision that enables them to collect $1.3 or $1.7 billion.This is not only an Argentinian problem; this is a problem that involves the whole world. This is why we wish to thank the Republic of France for having gone to the United States Supreme Court and presented itself as amicus curiae. We also thank the former head of the International Monetary Fund  Anne Krueger. She is not and has never been a very good friend of Argentina’s  but she also did that. We also remember the former United States Secretary of the Treasury  Paul O’Neill  who  when it was decided to leave Argentina to its own devices in 2001  amidst a social and institutional crisis that left 30 people dead as a result of violence in the streets  said that American plumbers should not have to pay for an Argentine fiesta. Today  I say that the millions of Argentines who went back to work  the millions of Argentines who can once again entertain hopes and dreams  the scientists who returned to the country and the children who once again have access to education do not have to pay for the lobbyists’ fiesta. These lobbyists  by participating in political campaigns and contributing money to the politicians’ campaigns here  have the lobbying power they need to destabilize the international financial system. Is that not remarkable? And such a short time has elapsed between Paul O’Neill’s assertion and what we are saying today. We are not asking for anything. We just want to be allowed to pay. It is remarkable. We started by defaulting on our debt and now they will not let us pay it back. It seems almost absurd  in a world that is grappling with debt restructuring involving millions of men and women. Even here in the United States  there are men and women who are unemployed and have lost their homes  not to speak of the devastation we see in Europe. Obviously  Argentina and many of the countries represented here today do not have the good fortune of being countries that issue reserve currencies  but we have expressed our willingness to honour our commitments. I think this should be recognized  unless the idea is to use a country like Argentina as an example  because it was able to climb out of the hole  to create jobs and generate growth  and to pay its creditors without applying the prescriptions that the International Monetary Fund tried to impose upon it. Incidentally  there is also a need for global market regulation and market interventions. Wonderful statements have been made in the Group of 20 regarding tax havens  ratings agencies and capital flows  but what is certain is that the world needs global laws for global governance. Just as we ask for Security Council and General Assembly resolutions to be respected  we also ask for rules and for respect for the sovereignty of countries  especially those countries like ours that wish to honour their commitments. Finally  I would like to address the Assembly on this very special day. Today we see war  human rights violations and other violations intertwined. Perhaps some are of a more subtle nature  such as losing one’s job  one’s rights  one’s livelihood or one’s hope. I think  at the core  our duty as world leaders is to build a truly different history. Many of those who have already spoken have made somewhat ambivalent statements. Some have been encouraging  while others have been disillusioned as a result of not having been able to do what they wanted  almost as if their desire to do something had just been a whim  and when they were not allowed to  they grew frustrated. I believe that the one thing we cannot do when we have the responsibility of governing and when we might be able to govern a country with a lot of power is to lose our temper or  even worse  make mistakes. Making mistakes is the one thing we should not do  because mistakes are not paid for by the leaders who make decisions or imperfect choices. Mistakes are paid for in human lives  not only if we are talking about war  but also if we are talking about the economy. In that case  they are paid for in terms of unemployment  lack of access to health care  education  housing and security. There is cheap labour available for drug trafficking  which we talk so much about fighting. One of the keys to fighting drug trafficking is to put an end to cheap labour in emerging and underdeveloped countries. We must also put an end to money-laundering for drug trafficking in central countries  because the money is not laundered in the countries that produce the raw materials. Money-laundering takes place in the central countries. It is right to say this  because we hear so much talk about drug trafficking and other things.I would conclude with a phrase by the Secretary-General that I really liked. I thought his invitation was most appropriate. It was specifically an invitation to turn hope into action through hard work  commitment  dignity and integrity. He ended with the words “with passion”. I am a person with a lot of passion. Some say that I am sometimes a bit too passionate and a bit too forceful in my statements. “With passion”  he said  but above all with compassion. He said that we can build a future that the people want and the world needs with passion and compassion. It is not the first time I have heard this word. I must confess that I heard it many years ago  and very often  in my own country. Perhaps I did not understand it at the time  this passion. It was used then  and is still used today  by a cardinal from Argentina who is today Pope and whom I would also like  as a Christian  to thank for the key role he played in dealing with the question of Syria. Compassion and passion — that means the passionate embrace of hope  of the future  of the things that are yet to come  and compassion for those who are less privileged  for the most vulnerable  for those who are waiting for so many things  who have done nothing to deserve extreme poverty and be Godforsaken  and compassion for all those who are victims — of war  of unemployment  of extreme poverty and misery — in other words  of our own failures as world leaders."
"7",269,"ARM",68,2013,"I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to thank the outgoing President  Mr. Vuk Jeremi..During the past two decades  the international community has made great strides towards the development of a cohesive approach aimed at addressing the political  social and economic challenges that the international community is facing today. We need to analyse our commitments  keeping in mind the difficulties that we have encountered while implementing the Millennium Development Goals. The world economic and financial crises are partially responsible for our straying from the charted path. However  they brought to light some of the underlying issues that had either been overlooked or underestimated and which turned out to be important for the overall success. We are all aware that  in the context of interdependence and the growing interconnectedness of the world economy  no country can achieve the Millennium Development Goals in isolation. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development enriched our understanding of the ways of achieving the overall progress towards the political  social and economic development.Armenia welcomes the inclusion of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the main theme of our deliberations in the current session.(spoke in English)Despite the fact that most of us share the understanding that the elimination of violence and terror is essential for building peaceful  sustainable and prosperous societies  peace seems to remain an elusive phenomenon in many parts of the world. Armenia remains alarmed by the worsening of the humanitarian situation in Syria. The number of refugees Armenia continues to receive already exceeds 10 000  but tens of thousands of Syrian-Armenians remain in Syria  a country that had become their second home after the genocide of 1915  and they are struggling for their survival in unbearable conditions together with their fellow Syrians.Armenia welcomes the unanimous adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  based on the agreement reached in Geneva between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Kerry. The resolution could lead to the elimination of chemical weapons and the exclusion of their use in Syria and pave the way for a political solution of the Syrian crisis  putting an end to the suffering of the Syrian people.It is our strong belief that there is no alternative to the peaceful solution of conflicts. The resolution of conflicts requires political will and determination. Three months ago  on 18 June the Presidents of the three co-Chair countries of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — Russia  United States and France — made a new statement on Nagorno Karabakh in the framework of the Group of Eight Summit in Enniskillen. In Armenia  we welcomed that statement and affirmed that  like the co-Chairs  we continued to believe that the elements outlined in the statements of the Heads of State of the co-Chair countries over the past five years can form the basis for reaching a fair and lasting settlement of the conflict. We share the position of the co-Chair countries that those elements should be seen as an integrated whole and that any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a solution. We absolutely agree that peoples should be prepared for peace  not war. Unfortunately  to date the Azerbaijani leadership has been doing just the opposite  increasing warmongering and anti-Armenian hate speech on a daily basis  even using the lofty rostrum of the United Nations for its purposes.We absolutely agree with the Heads of the three co-Chair countries — which are also three permanent members of the Security Council — that the use of force will not resolve the conflict and that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace and stability. However  through its unprecedented accumulation of offensive weaponry at a massive scale  Azerbaijan seriously endangers regional and international security  despite its membership in the Security Council.Unlike Azerbaijan  Armenia has on several occasions reiterated its commitment to the principles of international law and  in response to the Enniskillen appeal of the Presidents of the United States  the Russian Federation and France  once again reaffirmed that commitment  particularly with respect to the non-use of force or the threat of force  equal rights and the self-determination of peoples and territorial integrity.Azerbaijan keeps misinterpreting the 1993 resolutions of the Security Council — resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — the core requirement of which was the immediate cessation of all hostilities and hostile acts and the establishment of a durable ceasefire. Azerbaijan has not only failed to comply with the latter requirement  but further intensified its aggression and the military operations against Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia using mercenaries closely linked to notorious terrorist organizations. It is not surprising that since the ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994  the mediators  the three permanent members of the Security Council  have never made another reference to those resolutions.Azerbaijan is acting as if the international community shared its approach and as if it shared the approach of the international community. In reality  Azerbaijan continuously rejects all proposals of the internationally mandated OSCE Minsk Group co-Chair countries. Baku has rejected all versions of the Basic Principles of the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict proposed by the co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group  including those presented at the Kazan  Sochi  Astrakhan and Saint Petersburg summits. Baku refuses not only the Basic Principles  but also the confidence-building measures proposed by the co-Chairs on consolidation of the ceasefire  withdrawal of the snipers from the line of contact and the establishment of a mechanism for investigating ceasefire violations. Azerbaijan not only obstructs confidence-building measures  but also periodically organizes provocations on the line of contact with Nagorno Karabakh and on the border with Armenia  which has resulted in new casualties.At the previous session of the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.19)  I spoke about the Azerbaijani leadership’s release and glorification of an axe-murderer named Ramil Safarov  which was strongly condemned by the entire international community and by the human rights commissions of the United Nations and other international organizations. Even today  more than a year after Safarov’s release  the Azerbaijani leadership continues to declare that what they did is just and right and dares to criticize the stance of the international community. That clearly demonstrates the deepening gap between the Azerbaijani leadership and the international community in terms of perceptions of what is good and what is bad.Most recently  Azerbaijani authorities at the national level have ostracized the eminent Azerbaijani writer Akram Aylisli for publishing a novel in which he talks about the pogroms against Armenians in Baku  Sumgait and other parts of Azerbaijan. Aylisli’s books were publicly burned  and the writer had to leave the country after receiving death threats.Just last week the Azerbaijani leadership once again came up with new threats against Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh and made claims to Armenian territories  including its nearly 3 000-year-old capital city  Yerevan. Notwithstanding Azerbaijan’s destructive stance  Armenia will continue to make efforts towards the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict exclusively through peaceful means and on the basis of the purposes and principles and norms set forth in the United Nations Charter and the provisions of the statements made by the Presidents of the three co-Chair countries’ at L’Aquila  Muskoka  Deauville  Los Cabos and Enniskillen.In March  the Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution initiated by Armenia and co-sponsored by over 60 countries on the prevention of genocide. The recognition  condemnation and prevention of genocide remain a priority for Armenia  and we will take the necessary actions to prevent new occurrences of the crime of genocide  while keeping the issue of responsibility for crimes against humanity and the denial thereof high on its agenda. As the nation that survived the first genocide of the twentieth century  Armenia unequivocally welcomes the clear position adopted by the States Members of the United Nations that precludes any possibility of immunity or pardon for perpetrators of crimes against humanity.In May 2013  Armenia assumed the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  a regional organization that is a key partner of the United Nations in our shared global quest to advance the principles of fundamental freedoms  the defence and promotion of human rights and the continuous efforts for peace and security.Cooperation between the two organizations is also well established in the fight against racism  xenophobia  hate speech and intolerance. Those issues are also among the priorities established during Armenia’s chairmanship  elaborated in response to the challenges that Member States of both the United Nations and the Council of Europe are facing today.Armenia is committed to strengthening the institutional capacities of the United Nations. In that regard  we support the United Nations reform process and are ready to contribute to it. We believe that the reforms provide an opportunity to enhance the role of the Organization in addressing the crucial issues facing the world."
"8",302,"ATG",68,2013,"I stand in the Hall today as the leader of one of the smallest countries in the world — small by size  population and resources. I also stand here today with a proud heart and a strong voice because my small country of Antigua and Barbuda has produced a giant in the world’s geopolitical sphere. He is among the finest and most accomplished diplomats to have ever walked these great halls. The Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda send congratulations to His Excellency Ambassador John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are beyond sure that he will guide this body through a successful session. I offer congratulations also to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  on a job well done and for his unrelenting service to the international community.Exactly five years ago today  I stood in this hallowed Hall and stated that: “We are all members of one body. The welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound together. Industry cannot flourish if labour languishes. Transportation cannot prosper if manufacturing declines. The general welfare cannot be provided for in any one act  but it is well to remember that the benefit of one is the benefit of all  and the neglect of one is the neglect of all.” (A/64/PV.7  p. 32)With the ever-increasing gaps in equality among nations  the challenges for developing countries over the years have remained vast. In trying to address the issue of inequality and to diminish very basic human challenges by 2015  world leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were described as a milestone in international cooperation. With a 15-year timespan for their implementation  the Declaration was widely expected to inspire development and to directly improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. They are the people who are struggling to survive in the most basic living conditions and who are suffering from the effects of poverty  gender inequities  ill health and environmental degradation.Thirteen years have gone by  and what do we  as a global community  have to show in terms of concrete results? No matter which side of the lens we look through  something is appallingly wrong. With less than two years to go before 2015  we must ask ourselves as leaders why those commitments  related to the most significant global declaration made to the world’s most vulnerable people  are not being fulfilled.It is important for me to be extremely clear. I am not here to declare the MDGs dead  nor am I advocating that they be interred. Rather  I remain convinced that they can still be refocused  reformed  reshaped and rebranded into a new mechanism post-2015.We find ourselves standing at the precipice of 2015  that crucial defining moment. The current moment is captured by notable but uneven developments in some crucial areas. Considerable gaps remain and new challenges have emerged. As leaders we must therefore acknowledge that now more than ever  through the process of globalization  individuals and societies from one corner of the Earth to another  from oceans and continents  are intricately connected and more interdependent than ever before. Therefore  a post-2015 development agenda must concede that fact and be guided by that reality. The deliberations for international collaboration and development ahead of 2015 present the opportunity to redirect previous notions of prosperity and development among nations. Considering the current world economic  social and environmental challenges  that is indisputably critical.We must concede that the current structure of the internationally agreed development goals does not provide satisfactory remedies to our universal problems  which include an increase in global warming  the escalating gap between the worlds’s rich and the poor  the further deterioration of the world’s financial system and the uneven roles that developed and developing countries play in responding to and addressing issues of universal importance and impact on our societies. Taking into account some of those shortcomings  now is the opportune time for setting the stage for a post-2015 development agenda that is all-inclusive  effective and pragmatic.Of concern to Antigua and Barbuda are the failings of the international community in fulfilling the aims and objectives outlined in the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The year 2014 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  which was held in Barbados in 1994. Looking back over the 20 years since that Conference  we see that the international community’s actions to address the unique and special circumstances of SIDS have been lacking. It is my hope that the SIDS conference in Samoa in 2014 will give the international community the opportunity to correct the wrongs made and to improve on shortcomings with regard to SIDS. The conference will also present us with a third chance to identify a set of concrete actions  which will be needed for the further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation and thereby regain momentum lost by SIDS in the quest for sustainable development.We welcome the decision by the United Nations family to designate 2014 as the International Year of Small Island Developing States. Antigua and Barbuda pledges to highlight throughout 2014 the issue of SIDS with the aim of reinvigorating the SIDS agenda.My Government firmly believes in promoting partnerships supporting sustainable development based on the principles of mutual respect and understanding  equality and a genuine desire to affect the social and economic development of all. My Government has deepened our integration efforts with our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) brothers and sisters  focusing on fully implementing the CARICOM Single Market and Economy  as well as deepening the various subregional regulatory frameworks.As a member of the smaller grouping of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)  Antigua and Barbuda has fully joined and endorsed the OECS economic union in an effort to build on the shared tradition of our subregional integration arrangements and to expand the areas of shared sovereignty in order to survive and ultimately thrive. At the same time  my Government has secured full participation in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  as we seek to further strengthen the integration and development of Latin America and the Caribbean.It is a recognized fact  but one worth repeating  that small island States contribute the least to the causes of climate change yet suffer the most from its effects. We small island States have expressed our profound disappointment at the lack of tangible action within the negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to protect SIDS and other vulnerable countries  their peoples  culture  land and ecosystems. The responsibility for mitigating climate change is shared by all nations  developed and developing. However  developed countries should shoulder their moral  ethical and historical responsibility for emitting anthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is those actions that have now put the planet in jeopardy and compromised the well-being of present and future generations.Vulnerable developing societies such as ours are also victims of the globalization of crime  notably in the havoc wrought by handguns in the possession of criminal elements  by narcotrafficking that is essentially targeted at markets in developed countries and by the deportation of criminals to our shores. We urge the international community  in recognition of the link between globalization and crime  to provide greater support for the efforts of small island States such as Antigua and Barbuda to address the escalation of crime and strengthen the rule of law in combating international drug trafficking. We further call on our developed partners to reduce the practice of deporting violent criminals to our shores. Most of those deportees have neither connection nor familiarity with our countries.Antigua and Barbuda is proud to be among the growing number of States that have signed and ratified the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The Treaty will  among other things  assist Antigua and Barbuda in enhancing its capacity to tackle the scourge created by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition  which is associated with other transboundary crimes  such as drug trafficking. We have emphasized throughout the process that such crimes have had a negative impact on the socioeconomic well-being of our societies. Antigua and Barbuda stresses the importance of the early entry into force of the ATT and will continue to work energetically with Member States to ensure its entry into force.Another threat to the sustainable development of small island developing States such as Antigua and Barbuda is the rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The situation is at an alarming stage  as hundreds succumb annually. For Antigua and Barbuda  the prevention  care and treatment of non-communicable diseases continue to be a challenge. Heart disease  diabetes  cancer  cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases continue to be the leading causes of death in our region. Our health-care system  economy and population are heavily burdened by NCDs; it is for that reason that my Government has become even more proactive in addressing the issue. Health care continues to be basically free for Antiguans and Barbudans  and the Government often helps citizens seek treatment abroad when our facilities at home are unable to provide it. I ask the Assembly to continue to keep the issue of NCDs high on its agenda.My small developing nation of Antigua and Barbuda has sought to ensure that the trade rules agreed to by a majority of members of the international community  including the United States of America  are adhered to. I take this opportunity to once again draw the Assembly’s attention to a trade dispute between my country and the United States of America that has been ongoing for a decade and which has been submitted to the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO). I draw the Assembly’s attention to the dispute because I believe it has the potential to damage the credibility and undermine the utility of the WTO’s dispute settlement system and of the WTO itself. My Government won the case at both the original and appellate levels and yet  a decade later  the end is not in sight. It is a case that pits the world’s largest economy against one of the smallest  and despite our best efforts  our patient negotiations with the United States of America have borne no fruit. The United States of America has neither removed the offending laws nor agreed on a fair settlement with Antigua and Barbuda that would compensate for the wanton destruction of an entire economic sector. We believe that it is a blow to the credibility of the WTO to allow the world’s largest economy and the WTO’s most powerful member to ignore the lawful decision of its dispute settlement tribunal without consequences. The international trading system will not long survive such a profound challenge  and we call on the United States to correct past wrongs and come to the table with meaningful proposals that can bring the matter to a just conclusion. Although my Government has until now exercised strategic patience  we intend  through the only mechanism that the WTO has provided  to seek compensation for the thousands of jobs lost  the companies collapsed and the general devastation of the second-largest sector of our economy after tourism. More than jobs are at stake here. The WTO must be seen to deliver justice to its members  especially one of its smallest constituents. If not  its credibility as the arbiter of international trade disputes will bleed into the dust and hollow out its noble intentions.As a part of the Caribbean and a member of the CARICOM family  Antigua and Barbuda supports the preservation of the sovereignty of every nation. We are therefore very proud of our long-standing relationship with the Republic of Cuba. My Government condemns in the strongest possible terms any discriminatory or retaliatory policies and practices designed to prevent Cuba from exercising its right to freely participate in the affairs of our hemisphere. Today  I once again reiterate my Government’s firm condemnation of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of coercive laws and measures contrary to international law  the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of free navigation and international trade. Antigua and Barbuda therefore urges the United States of America to respect and take note of the unceasing call by the Members of the United Nations that it immediately lift the unjust economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba. These and other associated measures serve no other end than to hinder the socioeconomic development and well-being of the people of the Republic of Cuba.Antigua and Barbuda also affirms its long-standing stance and commitment towards combating terrorism in all its forms and expressions and condemns any action which goes against international law  resolutions of the United Nations or principles of human rights protection. We therefore condemn the recent terrorist acts in Kenya and express our profound sympathy to the Government of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the families of those who lost loved ones. We also in the strongest sense condemn acts of terrorism in other parts of the world.Antigua and Barbuda also expresses its concern about the inclusion of the Republic of Cuba on the list of State sponsors of terrorism published by the State Department of the United States of America. We reject the unilateral elaboration of blacklists accusing States of allegedly supporting and sponsoring terrorism  which is inconsistent with international law. We request the United States of America to put an end to that unilateral practice.Antigua and Barbuda welcomes the launch of the design for a permanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade  an initiative that was championed by CARICOM. We also look forward to its full erection in the coming months.One year ago  I stood here and reiterated the need for serious dialogue on the topic of reparations. Today I am proud that the members of CARICOM  at its thirty-fourth Regular Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government  held in Trinidad and Tobago in July  agreed to support the establishment of a regional reparations commission to begin laying the groundwork for a process of engagement and conversation on the issue of reparations for native genocide and slavery.I am equally pleased that the first regional reparations conference was held in St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier this month  with proposals for the formalization of a regional reparations commission. Antigua and Barbuda therefore conceptualizes the call for reparations as an integral element of our development strategy and believes that the legacy of slavery and colonialism in the Caribbean has severely impaired our development options. We therefore assert that reparations must be directed towards repairing the damage inflicted by slavery and racism.We have recently seen a number of leaders apologizing to the African diaspora  to indigenous peoples and to former colonies for past wrongs and injustices. I salute those leaders who have demonstrated such enlightenment and strongly encourage others to do so and equally match their words with concrete and material benefits to the descendants of genocide and the brutal enslavement of their ancestors.My country  while developmentally focused  is mindful of other global issues  particularly with reference to peace and security. The continued unrest in the Middle East  particularly in Syria  is heartbreaking. The images of innocent women and children being displaced and killed tug at my consciousness. Antigua and Barbuda gives its unconditional support to the preservation of the role of the United Nations and other organizations in working towards stabilization and peace in Syria and other conflict-ridden countries.In the same vein  we call on those leaders to protect civilians at all costs and move quickly to devise diplomatic solutions to the conflicts. Wilful and deliberate attacks upon civilians should be taken seriously by the international community  and the international courts should move to act in a manner consistent with international laws and norms.War  or even the threat of war  should be an absolute last resort and should have the full support of the international community at all times. Unilateral prescriptions will never solve a problem.We cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 development agenda if world leaders stand idle and see the tears and desperation on the faces of the many children who are hungry. We cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 development agenda if world leaders allow easily treatable illnesses and diseases to destroy our populations.We cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 development agenda if world leaders sit back and allow the lines of class divisions and insurmountable social barriers to increase.We cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 development agenda if world leaders continue to allow the imbalances of economic growth  destructive trade barriers and protectionism from developed to developing countries to persist. We cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 development agenda if world leaders do not act to save our environment and stop the pollution of our air and oceans and the wanton destruction of our forests and lands only for the benefit of a few.When the founders of the United Nations formulated this great institution  it was not envisioned as a stage or a repository for eloquent speeches. The United Nations was conceptualized as a place where our challenges would be discussed  solutions cultivated and action taken.It is for those reasons that our leaders gathered here today should work towards a fundamental  impartial and sustainable social  economic and environmental post-2015 development agenda that is far-reaching and all-inclusive. Anything less would be unacceptable and would be a travesty for millions of the world’s inhabitants  for whom we are required to act and do so courageously and decisively."
"9",349,"AUS",68,2013,"As a freshly minted Foreign Minister  I am delighted to take part in this general debate. Only a few weeks ago  Australia held national elections and chose a new Government. Only nine days ago  I was sworn in as Australia’s thirty-eighth Minister for Foreign Affairs. A change of Government is a significant national decision. It has happened only seven times in our country since the Second World War.Australia is an open  liberal democracy. We recognize our good fortune in having an unbroken record of peaceful democratic transition stretching back to 1901. The United Nations offers that same ideal of peace and order in relations among States. It gives us a place to resolve our differences and to be heard on the concerns that matter most.There is an intrinsic connection between the security and stability of Governments and economic development. Good Governments understand that providing a secure and stable environment for their citizens is their most fundamental task  but that task is tied inextricably to the strength of their economy. Economic growth  development and trade are the key drivers of national and international prosperity  and a vital support for global security. That is why the new Australian Government will put economic diplomacy at the centre of our foreign policy.We will promote responsible economic governance and open trading systems that support export-oriented economies. We recognize that a strong business sector  open trading rules and liberal foreign investment policies can foster economic growth and  with it  opportunities to achieve prosperity and security. Strong economies give nations and their people an environment in which to build their lives — to make choices for the lives they want to lead. Strong  open economies foster sustainable growth. We understand that from our experience in Australia and in our region.Australia’s economic success and high standards of living are anchored in reform efforts over many years. We liberalized our economy and unilaterally dismantled trade barriers and protectionist policies. In our own region  as economies have opened  standards of living have improved. We have witnessed the enormous growth of the middle class in South-East Asia. Estimates suggest that approximately 145 million people will be considered middle-class in 2015  up from 95 million in 2010. In Asia more broadly  we expect a middle class of over 3 billion people by 2030. Indonesia  currently the world’s sixteenth-largest economy  is on track to be the world’s seventh-largest economy by 2030. China and India are projected to become the largest and third -largest economies by 2030. Over 290 million people in China were lifted out of poverty in the decade between 1999 and 2009.The Secretary-General has rightly focused our attention this week on the needs of the poor  the commitment we made to them over a decade ago  and our vision for the future. We need to finish the job on the Millennium Development Goals. Beyond 2015  we must prioritize sustainable economic growth in the global development framework. We must provide the opportunity for all people  including people with a disability  to lead healthy and productive lives  leaving no one behind. We must support women’s economic participation and empowerment.The future of peace will be built on economic prosperity. Aid is an important part of delivering sustainable economic growth around the world. It plays a significant role in supporting economic reforms and good governance  promoting the rule of law and building the productive capacity of trade-related sectors. But it is the effectiveness of aid delivery that matters. For example  infrastructure deficiencies that prevent developing economies from fully engaging in the global markets need to be overcome. Estimates of infrastructure financing needs  including for the roads and ports required to facilitate trade  dwarf global aid. According to the Asian Development Bank  Asia alone will require $750 billion annually over the next decade to meet its infrastructure needs. This compares to annual global aid flows of $130 billion. Only the private sector has the capacity to mobilize the financing necessary for such massive infrastructure investments.There is a role for aid in helping to overcome the obstacles to investment. It must attract  but should never replace  private-sector capital. The returns are high. A joint report of the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that every dollar invested in aid-for-trade can lift exports from developing countries by $8.We firmly believe that the economic growth of developing countries can be unlocked through trade. Australia will continue to promote trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization  through regional and sector-specific deals  and through bilateral free trade negotiations. The Australian Government aims to build a network of bilateral and regional free-trade agreements. We will work in the World Trade Organization to rebuild the multilateral trading agenda. Australia puts the highest priority on global economic reform and trade liberalization as the best way to secure jobs and economic growth. These will be key themes for us as we chair the Group of 20 in 2014.No one should pretend that the economic sphere exists in isolation from other parts of our human experience. Economic progress alone is not sufficient. We need to ensure that all people around the world are free to fully exercise their economic  civil and political rights. Australia was one of eight nations involved in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and in 1948 the Australian President of the General Assembly  our Foreign Minister Mr. H. V. Evatt  oversaw the adoption of the Declaration (see A/PV.183).Since then  Australia has been at the forefront of defending human rights globally and regionally in support of equality and fundamental freedoms — freedom from discrimination; freedom from slavery  torture  arbitrary arrest  detention or exile; freedom of speech  conscience and religion; freedom to work  to enjoy health and education and to participate in the life of the community. Importantly  these freedoms must extend to all women and girls  including through equal access to employment  resources  education and health services  and they must be underpinned by robust and independent legal systems to enforce economic  social and political rights.Australia will continue to promote and protect human rights standards around the world. That is why we are seeking membership of the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term.The situation in Syria is an urgent security and humanitarian crisis we must address. Left unchecked  it will continue to cause great human suffering and further destabilize the region. Along with the rest of the world  Australia has condemned the horrific chemical weapons attack on 21 August  as we have condemned the Al-Assad regime’s use of conventional weapons against its own people.The first obligation of any Government is to protect its own citizens. In 2005  leaders of all States Members of the United Nations signed on to this principle in the World Summit Outcome on the responsibility to protect (resolution 60/1). Australia  as current President of the Security Council  will therefore co-sponsor a draft resolution before the Council that condemns in the strongest terms any use of chemical weapons. The draft resolution will make clear  for the first time  that the use of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace and security  and in doing so set a new international norm that will help to deter future use. It will say that those responsible for using such weapons must be brought to justice — a call we strongly endorse.We welcome the fact that draft resolution sets out in no uncertain terms that the Al-Assad regime must comply fully with the requirement to destroy its chemical weapons. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons now needs strong international support for its role in the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons.Australia will also continue to press for the Council to take action to assist the humanitarian effort in Syria and  of course  provide our full backing to efforts to find a political solution in accordance with the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/523  annex) that leads to a cessation of violence and a political transition which meets the aspirations of all Syrians.But we cannot just focus on a single instance of global security  for we are engaged on security challenges around the world  including in the Indo-Pacific region. Through our Security Council membership  we draw on lessons learned from our experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and take forward initiatives that are meaningful to our region. We welcome the strong support which the Security Council gave yesterday to Australia’s resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and light weapons. These weapons are a major driver of many conflicts that are brought to the attention of the Council.When Australia led the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) 13 years ago with our friends from New Zealand  Papua New Guinea and other countries of the Pacific  one of the first tasks the Mission faced was to restore peace and security. RAMSI moved quickly to secure the surrender of firearms — an early and decisive action that underpinned the peace that was built and maintained over the next 10 years. And women played a crucial part.That is why  throughout the Pacific  we are supporting efforts to strengthen women’s participation in policing  through recruitment  retention  training and mentoring support. In the Philippines  Australia is funding women’s participation in peace processes that bring together Muslim  Christian and indigenous women. And we continue to build on our record on security  disarmament and peacekeeping. As co-author of the draft resolution  we worked to secure the adoption of the world’s first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution 67/234 B)  which has now been signed by the majority of the United Nations membership  with a further 18 signatories being obtained during the course of this week.Outside of the Council  we work directly with countries in our region to build their security. Australia commends the efforts of Timor-Leste and the Group of Seven Plus countries emerging from conflict  including Solomon Islands and Afghanistan  in their efforts to promote the rule of law  civil and political institutions and a strong private sector.The United Nations is a vital forum for the security and prosperity of our world. That is what Harry Truman  President of the United States at the time the United Nations was founded  imagined when he spoke of a “world fabric of international security and growing prosperity”. No community can build lives  families and nations in the absence of stability  predictability and security. No country can ensure the security of its people without an economy that offers them the dignity to pursue lives they value.As you have made clear  Mr. President  the task the United Nations takes on this year and next  setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  is one that could set the course of humankind for decades to come. On behalf of the people of Australia  I wish all nations well in taking on that task  and commit Australia to play its part. Together  we will strive to build the prosperity that underpins and supports international peace and security."
"10",396,"AUT",68,2013,"I thank the President for raising for discussion at this year’s general debate a very pertinent subject  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. Shaping our planet’s future after 2015 is indeed a crucial task ahead of us  as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described very impressively in his presentation this morning (see A/68/PV.5). While we remain fully committed to the full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  the post-2015 agenda has started.One idea that has caught my particular attention is to upgrade the eradication of hunger from an indictor to a goal in that new agenda. More still needs to be done  and everyone must contribute a fair share: States  international organizations  the private sector  academia and civil society alike. Let me assure the Assembly that Austria will contribute its share as well.The international community currently faces major threats in its search for global security. The Middle East remains exposed to fundamental challenges. We welcome the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation on a framework for the destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. We believe that the Security Council should refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Accountability is  and remains  necessary to stopping the atrocities and prevent future crimes.The path to democratic participation and a new beginning in Syria — the actual goal of the civilian protests that started two and a half years ago — remains crucial. Unfortunately  the parties seem to be firmly set on a military solution to the conflict. However  it should be clear that the best way to achieve a sustainable solution can only be a political  negotiated one. That is the Austrian position.By now the civil war in Syria is greatly affecting all neighbouring countries. The conflict is a Syrian one  but the consequences go far beyond its borders. It has indeed become international.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have been overshadowed by the upheavals in the region. I have followed events there for almost 40 years. I am convinced that what is needed for a solution is the willingness not only to negotiate in good faith but also to take into account the needs and sensibilities of the negotiating partner: the other side. I  for one  cannot believe that the value of the new settlements to Israel outweighs the damage they cause by being an obstacle to peace and reasonable conditions.We welcome that the new United States Administration has devoted its full attention to that long-standing question and that direct negotiations resumed at the end of July. What we need now is decisive leadership. We are convinced that a breakthrough in the central conflict would also mean a decisive step towards stabilization of the entire region.While we continue to support the ongoing transition processes in the Arab world  recent developments in the region have cast a shadow on the democratic gains achieved so far. Progress on the difficult path to democracy will greatly depend upon whether all parts of society are included.Vienna and its United Nations headquarters serve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable development. Austria is very pleased that the Office of the Special Representative for the Sustainable Energy for All initiative in Vienna started its activities on 1 July. We welcome the initiative’s cooperation with thematic and regional hubs  as well as with other specialized organizations like the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.Austria is also the host country of the newly established International Anti-Corruption Academy. This international organization and centre of excellence has already undertaken several successful activities in fighting corruption — a major obstacle to reasonable development in all areas of society. I thank the Kingdom of Thailand for hosting the second Assembly of Parties  scheduled to take place in December. Furthermore  I would like to invite all States that have not yet done so to become members of the Anti-Corruption Academy.This year’s Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations took place in Vienna in February  with the forward-looking theme of “Responsible leadership in diversity and dialogue”. More than 1 500 participants from Government  civil society  the private sector and the media  as well as a youth forum of 150 outstanding and highly dedicated participants  provided most valuable input for the discussions of the Forum.In that context  I am also pleased to report that the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue was inaugurated in Vienna on 26 November 2012. The Centre — a joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria — serves as an interactive platform for religious leaders  experts and civil society alike.Multilateral cooperation can deliver solutions to global problems. The historic accomplishment of the Arms Trade Treaty is an important example in that regard. We look forward to its earliest possible entry into force. At the same time  the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime is being challenged  day after day  by alarming developments. We were  and still are  deeply shocked by the use of chemical weapons in Syria. We observe North Korea’s continued development of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities with concern. And we have new hope that the Iranian nuclear issue will be resolved by negotiations  which  after the election of a new Iranian President  should be resumed shortly.Similarly  the continued reliance on nuclear weapons and the limited progress towards nuclear disarmament are of great global concern. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts can be achieved only when they go forward together. Nuclear weapons should be stigmatized  banned and eliminated. The humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons have to be put at the centre of our attention.While some might believe that there is a contradiction between respect for cultural and religious differences on the one hand and the universality of human rights on the other  I am convinced that they reinforce each other. If people and nations can count on human rights being protected  they will show respect for the other side.The Human Rights Council  with its universal periodic review mechanism and special procedures  has  within a few years  developed into an effective instrument to address human rights violations and crisis situations in many instances. Austria  as a current member of the Council  is contributing to those efforts with targeted initiatives for the safety of journalists  the protection of religious minorities and the promotion of the rights of the child. We welcome the continuing trend towards the universal abolition of the death penalty  which is a longstanding interest of mine. However  too many countries still maintain a retentionist policy with regard to that cruel and inhuman form of punishment. Our diplomatic efforts therefore have to be reinforced.We are worried by the increasing number of human rights violations based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna and the 2005 World Summit firmly placed human rights at the centre of United Nations activities. Respect for human rights is an indispensable prerequisite for peace  security and development.Last year  the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Rule of Law provided an excellent opportunity for us to renew our commitment to the rule of law at the national and international levels. The Austrian Government is considering setting up an Austrian rule-of-law trust fund  designed to support international actors in strengthening the rule of law and to offer legal expertise and deploy legal experts free of charge to developing countries  at their request. International law and the rule of law are the foundations of the international system. Austria strongly believes that only an international system based on the rule of law can lead to lasting peace  security  economic development and social progress. Obviously  that is particularly true for the use of force  which should occur only in self-defence or when authorized by the Security Council.In that spirit  let me confirm that Austria remains fully committed to an effective United Nations system. In that connection  I especially want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts and his commitment to peace  the rule of law and human rights."
"11",421,"AZE",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and wish him every success in fulfilling this highly responsible duty. We are also grateful to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his able presidency of General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.This year’s general debate is taking place during a period of serious threats and challenges to peace  security and sustainable development. Environmental  economic and social indicators demonstrate that the models for progress and development need to be modified and adapted. The theme of the current general debate  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is timely and topical in providing an opportunity for evaluating the progress achieved so far and identifying new ways of overcoming existing obstacles.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which were adopted to address extreme poverty and multiple other forms of deprivation and for defining future development priorities  are of key importance in making future positive differences in the world.Azerbaijan recently became a donor country and contributes to the sustainable development efforts of countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America. This is a brand-new chapter in the history of my country and its activities in the international arena. A national entity  the Azerbaijan International Development Agency  which was established for that purpose  has already carried out various assistance programmes in more than 20 countries. The Heydar Aliyev Foundation has also conducted various humanitarian and social programmes.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recently commended Azerbaijan’s achievements in combating hunger and recognized that the country has accomplished the first MDG  namely  combating undernourishment. Moreover  gender equality  the empowerment of women and the fight against HIV/AIDS have also been identified as areas of progress.One of the key elements that Azerbaijan is considering in the context of the post-2015 agenda is information and communications technology (ICT)  which is a driving force of development and progress. To achieve the objective of ensuring improved access to ICT  efforts must be intensified to enhance regional synergies for promoting investment in ICT capacity-building  refocusing tools and content so as to address the particular needs of populations and thus better deploying ICT in the service of sustainable development. In that connection  Azerbaijan has put forward a proposal to establish the Eurasian Connectivity Alliance  a regional platform in support of improved connectivity and greater cooperation in the field of ICT. We are encouraged by Member States’ support for that initiative through the adoption of resolution 67/298 in September and look forward to further cooperation with interested Governments and other stakeholders.The world is still witnessing violations of the fundamental norms and principles of international law. Hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world continue to suffer from acts of aggression  military occupation  ethnic cleansing and a prevailing culture of impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.Twenty years ago  in 1993  the Security Council adopted four resolutions — resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — condemning the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories. In those resolutions  the Council reaffirmed respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan  reconfirmed that the Nagorno Karabakh region is an integral part of Azerbaijan  and demanded the immediate  full and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all the occupied territories.The resolutions also made specific reference to violations of international humanitarian law  including the violent displacement of a large number of civilians in Azerbaijan  attacks on civilians and the bombing of its territory.A series of Security Council presidential statements on the issue adopted between 1992 and 1995 are phrased along the same lines. All in all  the aforementioned resolutions  which are clearly the most authoritative and binding rulings on the problem  acknowledge that acts of military force were committed against Azerbaijan and that such acts constitute a serious violation of international law.To our deep regret  the Security Council’s principled demands  including  in the first place  the withdrawal of occupying forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan  have still not been implemented  and the mediation efforts conducted for more than 20 years within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  have yet to yield results. Against that background  with a view to deflecting the attention of the international community from the urgent need to address the main problems caused by its continuing aggression against Azerbaijan  Armenia has been undertaking efforts to distort the actual situation and downplaying the relevance of Security Council resolutions and misinterpreting their provisions. Moreover  Armenia’s continued claims of annexation and the consistent measures it has been undertaking in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan with a view to further consolidating the status quo of the occupation and preventing the return of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons to their homeland represent an open challenge to the conflict-resolution process and pose a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.On our initiative at the United Nations in 2005 and 2010  OSCE-led fact-finding and fact-assessment missions visited the occupied territories. Both missions documented the fact of illegal activities in those areas  involving  inter alia  the insertion of settlers  the extensive redrawing of boundaries  the changing of original geographic names  and the discriminatory treatment of cultural property and sacred sites. However  the missions’ recommendations remain just on paper. Moreover  the latest reports on the transfer of Syrian Armenians into the Nagorno Karabakh region and seven other adjacent occupied districts of Azerbaijan  along with other illegal activities  including efforts to operate flights into and out of those territories  provide yet more evidence of Armenia’s deliberate policy of annexing Azerbaijani land.In that regard  it is critical that the international community continue to insist on the need for an immediate and unconditional end to all actions that are seriously obstructing the prospects of a negotiated peaceful settlement to the conflict. Armenia’s policy of annexation has absolutely no chance of succeeding. The Nagorno Karabakh region was  is and will always be an inalienable part of Azerbaijan. The only way to achieve a durable and lasting solution and to establish civilized relations between the two neighbouring States is to de-occupy Azerbaijani territories  fully re-establish the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan  and comply immediately with the inalienable right of refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes. That is what international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions require  something that can in no way be introduced as a bargaining chip during the conflict-settlement process. Above all  Azerbaijan will never compromise its territorial integrity or the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Without prejudice to its rights under the Charter of the United Nations  in particular those set forth in Article 51  Azerbaijan has embarked upon  and remains committed to  the conflict-settlement process.We have no doubt that the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of Nagorno Karabakh will one day live side by side in peace and dignity in this region of Azerbaijan. It is therefore essential and vital to continue efforts towards peace  agreement and coexistence between the two communities of the Nagorno Karabakh region. We consider those aspects to be an important part of the entire reconciliation process  which should be given the attention it deserves. Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled stance of the States Members of the United Nations that has been expressed on issues that are important for Azerbaijan and pertaining to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve of the international community to defend the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  as well as its strong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.We note the encouraging developments in the Middle East peace process with the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. The current situation of insecurity in the whole region necessitates progress in the peace process as never before. It is imperative that the parties demonstrate responsibility to sustain international efforts towards achieving the two-State solution and avoid actions that would risk undermining that objective. The economic  financial and humanitarian situation in Palestine requires continued international attention and assistance  particularly in order to ensure humanitarian aid for the region. In June  Azerbaijan hosted a conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on the establishment of an Islamic financial safety net in support of Palestine  as well as a donors conference in support of the city of Al-Quds. States members of the OIC and other international organizations attending the conferences pledged to contribute to improving Palestine’s economy  health care and education  as well as two infrastructure projects. We welcome yesterday’s adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  regarding the safeguarding and destruction of Syria’s chemical-weapon stockpiles. We hope that the unanimous and strong position demonstrated by the Council will contribute to finding a political solution to the conflict in Syria  putting an end to the suffering inflicted on the Syrian people and ensuring that all parties concerned comply with their obligations and commitments under international law. Azerbaijan strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria  particularly the resulting killing of civilians. Resolution 2118 (2013) affirms that the use of chemical weapons constitutes a serious violation of international law and qualifies such an act as a threat to international peace and security. By endorsing the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/522  annex) and calling for the convening of an international conference on Syria  the Security Council paved the way for achieving a peaceful transition  stability and reconciliation. It is imperative that all parties cease armed violence  engage constructively in the political process and commit to the implementation of the Geneva communiqué.In conclusion  I would like to express our hope that during the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  Member States will be able to take successful steps towards a stronger and more effective United Nations. We look forward to the continued commitment and engagement of the United Nations system  both in reinforcing the implementation of national development goals by individual countries and in ensuring the implementation of the decisions and resolutions adopted by the Organization."
"12",467,"BDI",68,2013,"On this special occasion  when I have the honour to speak to various delegations that have come from the four corners of the world to participate in the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  I would like  on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza  President of the Republic of Burundi  and on behalf of my delegation  to express our congratulations to His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.To Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  his predecessor  we wish to say how much his work as President at the sixty-seventh session was very much appreciated in my country  and we take this opportunity to relay to him our sincere congratulations for having very ably presided over that session.It is also our great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his excellent achievements in a difficult and often turbulent international sociopolitical and economic context. Our best wishes and our continued support will accompany him throughout his second term in office  so that he can continue with the same momentum the work started in all priority areas on the United Nations agenda and in particular  that of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the central concern of the current session. It is for us an opportune moment to take the floor to address the Assembly to talk about the situation in my country  on the one hand  and to mention some current issues that are presently of concern to the international community  on the other hand.With regard to my country  my statement will focus on the political and economic situation and on our progress regarding the Millennium Development Goals  for which we are called upon to establish new benchmarks.In the political area  we are preparing to hold general elections in 2015. As we have always said  including during our previous elections  we have promised to the people of Burundi and the international community to hold transparent  free and peaceful elections. Burundi is seeking to set up a truth and reconciliation commission soon  as was provided for in the Arusha Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation  in order to shed light on the massive human rights violations after our independence and to create a more stable and democratic society.With regard to socioeconomic concerns  in December 2012 Burundi adopted a strategic policy instrument entitled “Vision Burundi 2025”  which sets out what Burundi will look like in 2025. Its main pillars are the goals to promote strong leadership at all levels of the State apparatus  to provide good living conditions for the population  to rely on an educated population that enjoys good health  to promote accelerated and double-digit economic growth and to make the most of regional integration so as to increase and diversify the economy of Burundi. Other goals include putting in place an aggressive demographic policy aimed at limiting the population growth rate to 2 per cent in 2025 and gradually restoring social cohesion and giving pride of place back to the fundamental cultural values that have always characterized Burundian society. One could also cite the goals of setting up a village and urbanization policy aimed at significantly increasing the urbanization rate to 40 per cent  as well as creating synergies among the various development stakeholders and promoting a good context for dialogue and consultation with respect to planning for development financing and implementing Vision Burundi.Along those same lines  Burundi has also adopted a second policy instrument  the Strategic Framework for Growth to Combat Poverty 2012-2016  launched in February 2012. Its goals are the consolidation of peace  security and the rule of law  managing population growth  increasing agricultural production and marketing  improved efficiency in public spending  a dynamic and efficient private sector  a sufficient increase in energy production  and strengthening development capacity. Since the central theme of this debate pertains to the post-2015 development agenda  it is appropriate for my delegation to review Burundi’s socioeconomic achievements. As the Assembly is aware  the Millennium Development Goals are the promise that we made to the poorest and most vulnerable people of the world. The MDGs have managed to place human beings at the heart of the development agenda. I should now like to turn to the status of the implementation of MDGs in my country  which I will review one by one.With regard to MDG 1  on the eradication of extreme poverty  we have seen relatively good progress since 2006. Even so  we must note that  although generally the rate of poverty has steadily decreased from 81 per cent in 1998 and to 67 per cent in 2006  it is nonetheless unlikely that Burundi will reach its target.With respect to MDG 2  achieving universal primary education  many improvements have been noted in terms of the net enrolment rate in primary school education in Burundi  which rose from 52 per cent in 1990 to 96 per cent in 2010. That occurred as a result of policy measures  in particular the presidential measure taken in 2005 regarding free schooling  and because the restoration of peace has enabled even children beyond school age to be enrolled in school. It is therefore possible that the second MDG will be achieved in 2015.Concerning MDG 3  on gender equality and the empowerment of women  there is near parity of girls and boys in primary school  but disparities have increased in secondary school. In higher education  the ratio of girls to boys has improved. In State institutions  we have seen an increase in the number of women in Parliament  with 43 per cent in the National Assembly and 50 per cent in the Senate. Those figures far exceed the stipulation in the 2005 Constitution  which established a quota of 30 per cent for women in political institutions.With respect to the MDG 4 target of reducing the under-five mortality rate  that rate has decreased by 35 per cent  going from 88 deaths per 1 000 live births in 1990 to 57 per 1 000 in 2010. Despite that progress  we are still far from the hoped-for 13.5 per cent  which was our aim in order to achieve the target of reducing by two thirds the under-five mortality rate. The relative improvement is due to more people going to health-care facilities  because we have made health care free for children under 5.With regard to MDG 5  on improving maternal health  the target is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality rate by 2015. The mortality ratio has undergone a downward trend since 1990. It decreased at a rate of 30 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births per year  amounting to a reduction of 54.5 per cent between 1990 and 2010.As to MDG 6  combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  a survey conducted in 2010 shows that the HIV prevalence is estimated at 1.4 per cent in the population aged 15 to 49 years  while among women ages 15 to 24 years old it is 0.8 per cent  as compared with 3.5 per cent in 2007. Nonetheless  we see a downward trend of HIV prevalence among women ages 15 to 24  according to the sentinel surveilance system. With regard to the status of HIV orphans  the available data show that the number of deaths has gone from 12 000 per year in 2004 to fewer than 6 000 per year in 2011. That is a decrease of approximately 50 per cent.With regard to MDG 7  ensuring environmental sustainability  in Burundi the percentage has gone from 70 per cent to 72.5 per cent in 20 years. Data show that the proportion of the population using an improved sanitation system remained stagnant  at around 46 per cent  between 1990 and 2010.In terms of MDG 8  on a global partnership for development  Burundi does its utmost to mobilize domestic resources and external support — estimated at $75 billion — in order to achieve the MDGs by 2015.Concerning Burundi’s position vis-à-vis the post-2015 agenda  it is evident from national consultations with all segments of the population that a post-2015 development agenda should focus on the following areas: governance  inequality  conflict and fragility; economic growth and employment; energy  water and a sustainable environment; access to basic social services; and food security.Substantial progress has been made with respect to the strategic framework for peacebuilding  and a third phase of the programme is currently being developed by the Government  in conjunction with the United Nations Office in Burundi and the parent office in New York. In view of the notable progress that has already been made since our country was first placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission  Burundi considers that it is now time for it to withdraw gradually from that agenda in order to make way for other countries whose need is currently greater.At the same time  my Government has expressed the wish to see the United Nations Office in Burundi convert in February 2014 to a Burundi country team office. That would enable Burundi to work in close collaboration with the United Nations team and with other partners to meet the socioeconomic challenges with which it is currently faced.Having summarized my Government’s achievements  I shall now talk about Burundi’s role regionally and internationally. With regard to its international role  Burundi was one of the first two countries to take the courageous decision to participate in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)  where it has served since 2007. I should emphasize that Burundi is proud of the progress towards normalization in Somalia  but we call upon all the partners to strengthen the operational capacity of AMISOM so that it may complete its mission.Burundi is also participating in peacekeeping operations in Cote d’Ivoire  Haiti and the Sudan. Soon  it will be participating in Mali and the Central African Republic. The recent election of Mr. Boubacar Keita as the country’s President is undoubtedly a decisive step in re-establishing the principles of democracy that governed the country in the past. That is the right path towards normalization. In our view  those successful elections are an important step in terms of Mali’s recovery. A Burundian contingent is ready to be deployed in that country. With regard to the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi aligns itself with other members of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and partners such as the African Union and the United Nations to ensure peace in that country. In that regard  we reaffirm our commitment through the terms of the agreement of 15 December 2006 and the relevant protocols of the ICGLR  as well as statements and decisions made by Heads of State and Government of member States in Addis Abeba and Kampala. At the regional level  we reaffirm our commitment  under the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region  signed in Addis Ababa on 24 February. With regard to the very unstable situation in the Central African Republic  Burundi  as a member of the Economic Community of Central African States  is ready to work with other nations to deploy a military contingent there in order to participate in re-establishing peace. Concerning the situation in Egypt  Burundi hopes that the Egyptian people find a swift way out of the crisis. With our African Union and United Nations partners  we are prepared to ensure that the Arab Republic of Egypt and its people revive their democratic institutions. With regard to Syria  Burundi believes that the international community must do all it can to help all parties reach a ceasefire in order to settle their differences peaceably. With regard to the conflict in the Middle East  Burundi reiterates its support for a negotiated solution that leads to two States living side by side in peace and mutual respect  in line with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Terrorism in its various forms has become a source of daily concern. Not even a week goes by without an act of terrorism being carried out somewhere in the world. Barbaric acts strike indiscriminately  affecting innocent people who have had the misfortune of finding themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Government of Burundi would like to take this opportunity to condemn  in the firmest way possible  the cowardly and arbitrary terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. That heinous act has plunged into mourning not only Kenya  but the entire international community  given the different nationalities of the victims. We would like to convey to our brothers the people of Kenya and to their Government our sincere condolences and to reassure them of our friendship and solidarity. Burundi reiterates its full support for the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy  adopted by Member States in 2006. With regard to the International Criminal Court  Burundi would like to express its full solidarity with the people of Kenya  who have just democratically elected their leaders. Burundi would like the Court to review how it functions so that it can benefit Member States of the international community as a whole. Burundi calls for a review of the Rome Statute at the next meeting of States parties  which is to take place from 20 to 28 November. In the meantime  it is important that the peace and reconciliation processes on our continent be strengthened rather than weakened.Burundi welcomes the ministerial meeting to be held by the African Union on the sidelines of the sixty-eight session of the General Assembly on 27 September  as well as the announcement that a summit of Heads of State will be held on 11 and 12 October in Addis Ababa.We have renewed the commitment of the Government of Burundi to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to ensure peace and security. We would like to conclude our statement by reiterating Burundi’s commitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. My Government hopes that cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union can be strengthened in terms of tackling issues related to African countries in accordance with the letter and spirit of the founding documents of those two institutions.

"13",514,"BEL",68,2013,"It was in my country  in Ypres  during the First World War  that chemical weapons were used in a conflict for the first time. We can all recall the dreadful suffering of thousands of those soldiers. Almost 100 years later  that same suffering is being inflicted on thousands of Syrians. Despite the international Geneva Protocol of 1925  the history of the world — a shared history — is repeated  from Ypres to Damascus.This is the second year that I have addressed the General Assembly from this rostrum. In one year  so many hopes have been raised and fulfilled but  at the same time  so many additional war crimes have been committed. A year ago  I spoke of 30 000 Syrian deaths. Today there are 120 000. And that conflict is not the only one. While we are talking here  atrocities continue in various parts of the world.All of us here must show as much courage as the men and women who are fighting in the streets for their freedom and dignity. Within the United Nations  we have everything we need to act  while those who are fighting often have nothing but their courage to live on. If a veto must be cast  it should be a veto on tyrants and their crimes.No one can end a famine or stop a tyrant alone.Peace is a shared responsibility. That is why there is no alternative to multilateralism and politics  if we seek to improve the lot of humankind. That is what motivates Belgium’s commitment  which is political  financial and at times even military  as the fifteenth most significant contributor to the United Nations.My country is also of the view that among our responsibilities we have the responsibility to protect — that is to say  the responsibility to prevent and fight the particularly atrocious crimes of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Belgium fully supports the actions of the United Nations in that regard. In 2014  we will organize an international conference in Brussels on the prevention of genocide.When we work together  we achieve results. Mali is proof of that. But let us not forget that nothing is ever settled forever. For it to last  peace must be continuously nourished. I would like to commend in particular the recent efforts of the international community in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The population of the north-east of the country has for years suffered massacres  mass rapes  the forced recruitment of soldiers  including of child soldiers  pillage and forced displacement. Just yesterday  witnesses told me of martyred children. That is shameful.The efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are bearing fruit. The Intervention Brigade is playing an active role in protecting the population. The Addis Ababa Framework offers a genuine possibility for the stabilization of the entire region. However  let us make no mistake: agreement at Kampala is essential for the process to be successful. Pragmatic solutions must also be found — without  however  accepting general amnesty or allowing for impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Belgium stands ready to contribute to such solutions. The territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must also be respected. All external interference must cease. Belgium urges the Congolese authorities to implement the structural reforms needed in the army and the police  so as to re-establish the rule of law throughout the national territory and to guarantee the prosperity of the Congolese people.Going to war  building walls and curtailing rights is always easier than building bridges and keeping the peace. It is easier to build walls than to organize a democratic system or build hospitals and schools. In our contemporary globalized world  conflicts can be resolved only by political solutions. That is why Belgium supports the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States  as he seeks to bring the parties to the negotiating table. In that regard  I welcome the American-Russian initiative to hold the “Geneva II” conference.It is not death that metes out justice; it is respect for the law. It is the law that organizes human societies  protects the weak and prevents violence. Law is essential because a world without rules — whether in terms of civil interactions  trade or finance — leaves humankind face to face with its worst enemy: itself. Respect for the law is a foundation of the life we share. Laws must be respected  including in situations of conflict. I am referring in particular to humanitarian law  so that victims can receive assistance and care.Belgium has echoed and tirelessly backed the calls from humanitarian agencies for the obstacles to their activities to be lifted. We demand that access to health care be improved on the ground everywhere  including in Syria. All parties must respect international humanitarian law. My country participates actively in efforts to provide assistance to populations that have been victims of fighting. The onset of winter and the sharp rise in the number of victims  refugees and displaced persons mean that the international community must step up its efforts further still.The law must also stop impunity. Peace cannot ever be built on amnesty for the worst crimes  or turning a blind eye thereto. Together with 56 other States  Belgium has called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. The work of the Court is contributing to bringing about an era of responsibility. All States should cooperate with the Court.The law must also make it possible to bring dictatorships and oppression to an end. In 2010  all those who defend democracy welcomed the advent of the Arab Spring. I am not one of those who today have turned their backs on that hope. Let us not forgot all of the women and men in Tunisia  Libya  Egypt and elsewhere who wish to live in peace. We must support them and promote the holding of free elections. We should encourage them to draft constitutions that guarantee fundamental rights  justice and equality. We should also recall that winning an election or exercising authority following elections does not give someone the right to oppress minorities. True democracy means respecting and protecting minorities.The law must guarantee individual freedoms. Freedom means  for example  the right of young women to study and to choose their partners for themselves or to remain single. Freedom also means the rights of women to move in public as they please. Freedom also means to right to practice one’s religion or to practice none at all. Freedom also means the right of heterosexual and homosexual couples to walk hand in hand in the street or in other public spaces. I am proud that Belgium guarantees those fundamental freedoms. I am also proud that my country promotes efforts to spread such freedoms everywhere in the world.While I am speaking of continuing our efforts and making them lasting  I would like to mention the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is absolutely vital that we seize the opportunity afforded by our American friends. A solution must be arrived at now  based on the coexistence of two States  with the State of Israel and an independent State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security. We have also made it very clear that we are against colonization. In that context  Belgium is ready to host a conference in Brussels aimed at ensuring that private economic partners provide support for the peace process. We believe that there can be no economic plan  however  unless there is a political plan with a concrete timetable.Peace and security also depend on harmonious prosperity  whose benefits must be shared equitably around the globe and among its citizens. According to scientists  the world’s ecological footprint now exceeds the world’s capacity for regeneration by about 50 per cent. That situation is untenable and affects everything on the planet. I welcome the United Nations initiative to convene Heads of State and Government here in New York for a forum on sustainable development. It is here that less developed and developed countries can solve the huge challenge of sustainable development together. Every country has problems that are either shared or complementary and interconnected. By that I mean extreme poverty  desertification  the exodus for ecological reasons of millions of people  the exhaustion of natural resources and climatic warming.Despite the progress that has been made  much remains to be done to meet the Millennium Development Goals. Hunger  poverty and unequal access to education and health care are intolerable injustices. We must continue to mobilize to fight them. That is why Belgium asks that the efforts made under the rubric of post-2015 development be merged with the goals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in a single negotiation framework within the United Nations. That single framework should bring together the economic  social and environmental aspects that are becoming facts of life for all of us.I would like to touch on one final subject  that is  espionage and cybercrime. Our colleague President Dilma Rousseff asked a true question for today (see A/68/PV.5). Is it permissible to ignore privacy laws in the name of security and the fight against terrorism  two areas that are basic for all peoples? I support the call by the President of Brazil for protecting the private lives of citizens everywhere  in particular on the Internet. She proposed the establishment of a multilateral framework designed to effectively ensure the protection of data online. The Internet must not become an invisible battleground. It should remain an instrument of freedom and development for all  a place where all can communicate in peace and security.In 2014  along with other nations  Belgium will solemnly commemorate the centenary of the First World War. We will do it out of duty to the memory of the young men from more than 50 countries who came to die on the battlefields of my country in order to liberate us. They were not even 20 years old. We will also commemorate the war’s centenary in order to teach young people of today  so that they too can become militants for peace."
"14",559,"BEN",68,2013,"As he is not personally able to participate in this general debate  the President of the Republic of Benin  Mr. Boni Yayi  has asked me to represent him. At the outset  I would like congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and  through him  to honour his country  Antigua and Barbuda  for that success  which demonstrates the trust that it enjoys within the international community. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  who demonstrated great leadership in fulfilling his very busy term of office. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts at the head of the world Organization  in particular since January 2012  as part of the implementation of his programme “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex).Benin fully supports the implementation of that programme  which focuses on issues that are fully consistent with the views and priorities of the Governments of the least developed countries (LDCs)  in particular those of my Government with regard to governance matters  namely  sustainable development and preventing conflicts  disasters and violations of human rights  as well as ensuring the participation of all stakeholders in the management of public affairs.Two years from the 2015 deadline established for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we can see that major efforts have been made by States to achieve the Goals. Assessments conducted at different levels have shown that least developed countries are falling far behind in implementing the Goals  in spite of the significant progress that has been made.Nevertheless  it is a fact that achieving the Goals has become a top priority of my Government’s work and mobilizes a significant share of available resources. We should therefore welcome the campaign started in April to commence the countdown of the last 1 000 days leading up to the 31 December 2015 deadline. We have reason to hope that the new dynamic and the new life that has been breathed into efforts of the international community will enable significant improvement in the performance of least developed countries. Benin has taken that opportunity to develop a road map that includes a stopwatch for the last 1 000 days in order to speed up the achievement of the Goals by 2015. My country is one of 16 African countries deemed able to achieve at least five of the eight MDGs by that date. I would like to commend the leadership of the United Nations and its relevant bodies  as well as other partner agencies  in mobilizing energies to assist States in achieving the Goals. It is important to fully include in the post-2015 development agenda those MDGs that have not been achieved on time and give them top priority in order to ensure there is continuity with the new normative framework established by the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro and the demands that will result from the goals currently being developed. In that regard  the main theme for the general debate of the sixty-eighth session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is quite timely and perfectly in line with the consultations that have taken place at various levels to develop that agenda.Thanks to the meticulous clarification of issues and challenges by the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  appointed by the Secretary General to present recommendations to him  we have a galvanizing vision and appropriate materials to build a unique  coherent programme regarding all those points  and pragmatic enough to ensure that everybody on the planet is placed on a sustainable development path so everyone can have access to shared a prosperity that leaves no country or person aside.The post-2015 development agenda must be universal in nature. It must also be broken down into specific measures targeting reforms and corrective measures needed to re-establish any balances that have been upset or threatened. From that standpoint  it is of crucial importance that the situations of greatest current concern to the international community should enjoy particular attention  as stipulated in principle 6 of the 1992 Rio Declaration. We should therefore strongly support what is stated in the Secretary-General’s report entitled “A life of dignity for all” (A/68/202)  that the needs of the least developed and most vulnerable countries should form the basis for defining the goals of the programme.It is a welcome fact that the situation in those countries has already been the subject of significant thinking  with key action programmes that cover periods that go far beyond 2015. In that regard  the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020 is and should be perceived as an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda. Its main aim is to ensure the transition of half of the 49 least developed countries to a higher-income level by 2020.Against that backdrop  Benin is quite clear about its responsibility as the head of the global coordination bureau for the LDCs. We intend to propose the holding of an international conference on the theme “New partnerships for developing the productive capacities of LDCs in the context of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action”  to be held in Cotonou in April 2014. That effort already enjoys strong support from the United Nations and some development partners from diverse cooperation frameworks  whether they are North-South  South-South or according to other types of triangular partnerships. I appeal for goodwill to help make that voluntary initiative a decisive turning point in terms of mobilizing the necessary resources to help least developed countries make the leap to industrialization based on their competitive advantages. That route offers LDCs a possibility for creating decent jobs so they can make the most of their demographic advantages and turn that into a factor for stability and prosperity.We must enhance the role of quality  relevant and transformative education at the heart of the social  economic and development agendas — an education system focused on the real needs of society and the modern world. In that regard  I welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of the Global Education First initiative  which is a platform for leading an open debate on the aims of education in the current context and to prepare children for living active  productive and personally enriching lives. That is a prerequisite for meeting the challenge of social inclusion of young people.Benin has been honoured to participate actively since February in the work of the group of Member States championing the initiative. I urge the international community to support that noble project  which is a guarantee of adequate  inclusive training for youth. I call on all countries to join the Initiative in order to contribute to the collective thinking and its efficient implementation.At Rio de Janeiro we affirmed the inextricable link that exists among the economic  social and environmental pillars of sustainable development. However  that vision will not materialize if we set aside the existing relationship among peace  security and development. We should invest more in guaranteeing peace and security as an essential factor for sustainable development. At a time when we are thinking about the broad outlines of the post-2015 development agenda  we should also forge a consensus on the path to follow and the means to strengthen the bases of international law pursuant to respect for the essential principles of the Charter of United Nations  to which all States Member of the Organization have freely acceded. We must constantly strive to bolster the ramparts of peace; without them  any development will be in vain  in the light of the destruction that comes from conflicts triggered by their violation. I would take as an example the atrocities that we see  sometimes at a frightening level  such as what occurred in Syria with the use of banned chemical weapons  which we condemn in the firmest possible terms.We must reinforce the clout of the international regulatory regimes and make progress in the area of disarmament  whose paralysis carries great risk for humankind. In that regard  too  we welcome the conclusion of the Arms Trade Treaty. We must better harness the mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. The partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations is a valuable tool for building a more integrated and solidarity-based world. That solidarity must be clearly displayed against the rise of a violent extremism that is increasingly dangerous when it takes root in our societiees by associating itself with transnational organized crime networks.All those all equally pressing challenges that the international community needs to address. We would benefit from adopting a preventive and proactive  as well as healing  approach in order to improve the health of our planet and constantly expand the vital space necessary for ensuring that humans flourish  if we really want to ensure the universal access to peace and shared prosperity that we all so sorely want. The very encouraging way in which the crisis in Mali was managed is to the credit of the partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations. It proved what the international community can achieve if it uses its levers of our collective security system in time. Benin has been honoured to take an active part  alongside other African countries  in the noble mission of rebuilding the State in Mali. The election of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita is the start of a new era where Mali is returning to the family of free nations struggling to bring happiness to their peoples. In that connection  the policies adopted in the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel must be decisively implemented in order to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and progress for the peoples of the region for the certain benefit of international peace and security.We must also commend the efforts undertaken to stabilize the countries of the Great Lakes region  especially the Democratic People’s Republic of the Congo  as well as Somalia  where the African Union has shown its ability to restore and rebuild peace  with  of course  the support of the United Nations. The case of the Central African Republic gives us pause  as it requires a commitment from the international community commensurate with seriousness of the current challenges.The resurgence of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea has had an enormous impact on the economies of the countries of the Atlantic coast and in the hinterlands. The initiatives undertaken with the support of the United Nations and the backing offered by our bilateral partners have enabled us to set up information-sharing centres pursuant to resolutions 2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) of the Security Council. That was the aim of the joint summit on maritime security of the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Commission of the Gulf of Guinea that took place in Yaoundé on 24 and 25 June. That followed the meeting of Foreign Ministers and Defence Ministers of ECOWAS  ECCAS and the Gulf of Guinea Commission that took place in Cotonou on 18 and 19 March. After Yaoundé  there was the Malabo summit of the Heads of State of the Gulf of Guinea Commission held on 9 July  which took the historic decision to open the Gulf of Guinea Commission to all States in the area of the Gulf of Guinea  which gives the arrangements an inclusive technical consultation framework. Strengthening regional cooperation means that we need to set up an international support mechanism to improve cost-sharing in order to guarantee lasting results. It is important for the Security Council to adopt a new resolution to that effect.More than ever  the United Nations must stand firm in its role as the best forum for a fruitful multilateralism  where different initiatives come together to give the necessary impetus for more inclusive and less unjust global governance that finds comprehensive  lasting solutions to crises of every stripe that trouble the world with disastrous repercussions on human security and human rights.The delays in the establishment of a Palestinian State with all the attributes of an independent and sovereign State  including full membership in the United Nations  living side by side with the State of Israel within secure borders and with full international guarantees is still a subject of concern. In that regard  Benin welcomes the efforts of the Obama Administration that have led to the renewal of dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis. Along the same lines  the paralysis in the United Nations with respect to different political and military crises shows how urgent it is to reform the international system  in particular the Security Council. Achieving that reform would be real proof of the commitment of the United Nations to inclusive and less polemic management of the great problems of today.The Government of Benin is firmly committed to the universality  indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights  which it considers to be the third pillar of the United Nations system. They are considerations that govern our participation in the work of the Human Rights Council  where we strive to promote a correlation between the behaviour of States and the international obligations they have undertaken through a mutual open dialogue and mutually enriching cooperation as the most effective way for developing and protecting universally recognized human rights and the fight against impunity. Governments must undertake to create more cohesion between stakeholders and to ensure understanding and consensus on essential matters and avoid internal divisions that undermine the State while negative forces are constantly striving to wreak havoc. My Government is committed to strengthening the principles of democracy and the implementation of effective local development policies. My Government remains convinced that promoting  developing and shoring up democracy  far from being a luxury  is a vital and unavoidable necessity for all African States.That is why Benin is striving each day to find the ways and means to strengthen and streamline its political system so as to permanently anchor it in universal values. I remain convinced that democracy can be viable and useful for the people only if it contributes to development  to promoting the dignity and fundamental rights of citizens  to strengthening social justice and to maintaining peace and international security.In conclusion  I would like to express the compassion of the people of Benin to the brotherly people of Kenya for the tragedy they have experienced following the recent terrorist attack. The same compassion goes out to all those people in the world who are suffering from intolerance and its attendant violence."
"15",605,"BFA",68,2013,"Sociopolitical crises  armed conflicts  the degradation of ecosystems  pandemics like HIV/AIDS  religious extremism  terrorism  cross-border crime and development problems are today the vital questions that call upon the conscience of individuals  summoning their responsibility for building the present and the future. I am convinced of the need to enhance our spirit of sharing and solidarity in order to meet the challenges of promoting peace  stability and security and to provide humankind with all the tools needed for better mastery of its evolution.Before continuing  I would like to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. In addition  I would like to express our recognition for the remarkable way in which his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  presided over the work of the sixty-seventh session. Allow me also to repeat to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the expression of the esteem and recognition of the Government of Burkina Faso for his availability and staunch commitment to peace and development. The current session is taking place in an international context characterized by relentless economic difficulties and growing threats to peace and security on a global scale. I take this opportunity to express to the people of Kenya the compassion and solidarity of the people of Burkina Faso following the terrorist attacks that were recently perpetrated in Nairobi.The West African subregion continues to be marked by the stigma of multidimensional crises that have taken place over the past two decades. Our subregion  and particularly the Sahelo-Saharan zone  has became a hideout for drug traffickers and terrorists whose desire to destabilize the region represents a real threat to the peace and security of our States.I would like to welcome the gradual improvement of the situation in Mali since the deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the holding of presidential elections  which supports the re-established constitutional order. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to all those players who have helped to resolve the crisis in Mali. To the Malian authorities and people  I express my warmest congratulations on the success of the recent presidential elections. The implementation of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel will contribute  I am convinced  to enhancing stability in that country and in the entire Sahelo-Saharan region. Burkina Faso is determined to play a role alongside the international community to achieve the objectives of that strategy.Dialogue is the favoured way to ensure understanding among and within peoples. Furthermore  the Government of Burkina Faso supports strengthening social cohesion  broadening spaces for freedom and dialogue  and seeking together solutions to conflicts. It is in that spirit that my country has been participating for two decades in peacekeeping operations conducted by the United Nations  the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States  with contingents of about 2 000 men and women who are deployed in various theatres of operation. I pay tribute to the efforts of all those who work tirelessly to build a world of peace and freedom. Beyond the resolution of sociopolitical and military crises in West Africa  Burkina Faso strongly supports the initiatives of the international community that seek to restore lasting stability in the Central African Republic  the Democratic People’s Republic of the Congo  the Great Lakes region  Somalia and the Sudan.With regard to Western Sahara  my country supports the search for a political solution acceptable to all parties and reaffirms its support to the Moroccan initiative for an autonomous status for the Saharan region as a credible and realistic alternative in resolving that dispute.Beyond the African continent  the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic urgently requires an immediate end to the hostilities and a search for political solutions to the crisis. Therefore we encourage the implementation of the American-Russian agreement of 14 September aimed at control and dismantlement of chemical weapons stockpiles. With regard to the situation in the Middle East  we welcome the relaunching of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine and strongly encourage the different parties to work towards a peaceful solution to the conflict in order to reach a fair and equitable solution based on the recognition of a Palestinian State living in perfect harmony with Israel.The climate of dialogue and détente that characterizes relations between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China should be welcomed and encouraged. In that spirit  we must welcome the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations specialized agencies  particularly the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We also welcome Taiwan’s incalculable contribution in support of the achievement by developing countries such as Burkina Faso of the Millennium Development Goals.Peace in Africa requires pertinant socioeconomic development programmes to generate effective responses to the uncertainties created by the international economic situation and to strengthen trust between the people and the leaders. A landlocked country of the Sahel without great natural resources  Burkina Faso is committed to implementing strong policies in the context of its Strategy of Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development  with a view to promoting development and to significantly improving in the quality of life of the people of Burkina Faso. As we approach the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  the theme of the current session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  raises in a pertinant way the issue of the dialectical relationship between development  peace and security. It therefore offers us an opportunity to focus our thinking on a new vision in order to achieve comprehensive progress  based on strong international solidarity  towards sustainable development. That is why it is important that we redouble our efforts to regulate environmental issues on the basis of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex)  held in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro.Peace and stability appear as still-distant goals  given the number of centres of conflict throughout the world. That situation demands that we further strengthen multilateralism  rigorously apply the principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organization  strengthen the instruments for promoting those ideals and carry out the reform of United Nations bodies  in particular the Security Council. It is my hope that the General Assembly’s work at this session will contribute to achieving those noble objectives for a more fulfilled and united humankind."
"16",648,"BGD",68,2013,"I congratulate President Ashe very warmly on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I congratulate also Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his able leadership as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I admire the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his wisdom  bold initiatives and successes as head of the United Nations.Rapid technological innovations are transforming our world. The changes involved are also creating new conflicts within and among States. The vulnerable  the deprived and the disadvantaged have been the most affected. That reminds me of my father and the Father of the Nation  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and his visionary call  in his first appearance before the General Assembly  in 1974  for a world order based on peace and justice and a global economic arrangement to free the world of poverty  hunger and aggression. As his daughter  I am proud to have been among leaders who adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000  to have been at the review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2010 and to be participating now in the transition from the MDGs to the post-2015 development agenda.I hope that this year’s theme — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — will help us to design a pragmatic strategy for those goals. The Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and the newly established High-level Political Forum are making good progress. Our experience also will be useful in overcoming the challenges to the MDGs by 2015 and in preparing the post-2015 development agenda.Bangladesh has submitted to the United Nations a draft of the post-2015 development agenda that covers socioeconomic and environmental goals and the resources required for achieving them. We also held a Global Leadership Meeting on Population Dynamics in Dhaka  whose declaration placed human individuals at the centre of the entire development agenda. The declaration incorporated population growth  ageing  urbanization and migration as the priority issues. The meeting also strongly identified the need for mainstreaming migration in the post-2015 development agenda  particularly to accommodate the expected climate migrants.Our aim is to become a middle-income country and to realize our Vision 2021 by setting goals that are in line with the MDGs. We have already met or are on track to meet Millennium Development Goals 1 through 6. Poverty has been reduced from 56.6 per cent in 1991 to below 26 per cent today. In the past four and a half years  the average gross domestic product growth rate remained at 6.4 per cent; 50 million people have joined the middle income group; export earnings rose from $10.53 billion in 2006 to $27.03 billion today; remittances increased from $5 billion in 2006 to $14.5 billion; foreign currency reserves improved from $3.49 billion in 2006 to $16 billion; and power production capacity also increased from 3 200 megawatts in 2006 to 9 059 megawatts today  to name a few indicators.Bangladesh is therefore often called a model of economic development and the standard-bearer of South Asia. Our achievements received an MDG award  a South-South Award  a Global Diversity Award and a food award for 2013 from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those recognitions were achieved largely due to the practice of the principles found in the resolution entitled “People’s empowerment and development” (resolution 67/107)  which I submitted and which the General Assembly adopted at its sixty-seventh session. Using state-of-the-art digital technology  people today are getting more than 200 services from 4 582 digitized Union Information and Service Centres. Rural women are also receiving health-care services from 15 500 digitally interconnected community health clinics and union health centres  which have extended health-care services to people’s doorsteps. Advanced cell phone technologies are also providing services to more than 100 million subscribers.I believe that real national development is achievable only through education. Education is the main driving force for attaining the peace and prosperity of a nation and for upholding justice  the rule of law  democratic values and people’s empowerment. Real development also demands the empowerment of women and their equal participation with men in all walks of life. Our new educational policy provides girls free education up to higher secondary school  monthly stipends for 11.9 million students of poor families  and free textbooks to all students up to the secondary level. Our policies have also helped develop women leaders from the grass roots to the topmost level. In politics  so far  14 000 women have been elected to local Government bodies and 70 to Parliament. Five women are serving as Ministers and one as Whip. Bangladesh is possibly the only nation today with women occupying the position of Prime Minister  Speaker  Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader  all at the same time. The 10 per cent of posts reserved for women have helped many succeed in reaching high positions in the judicial and administrative branches  in diplomatic posts and in the armed forces and law enforcement agencies.Our policies of empowering the people  particularly the vulnerable  include social safety-net programmes  such as vulnerable group feeding and development; housing and livelihood for the homeless; monthly pensions for senior citizens  widows  destitute women  insolvent freedom fighters and people with disabilities; maternity allowances for a total of 4.3 million people; and food and nutrition security for more than 1 million rural people through One House  One Farm schemes  to name a few. The disadvantaged and the physically challenged are provided with education  skill development and interest-free loans for self-employment and  in the formal sector  a 1 per cent quota has been reserved for them. For those with autism and other developmental disorders  a resolution on autism spectrum disorder was introduced by Bangladesh at the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly (resolution 67/82). It was adopted  unifying us all in our quest to provide them their rightful place in the world.However  our progress in all spheres has been sadly held back because of climate change. Fraught with increasing natural disasters  Bangladesh faces a calamitous future due to global warming and sea level rise. It is estimated that a 1˚ Celsius increase in temperature would lead to a 1 metre rise of the sea level  submerging one fifth of Bangladesh and forcing 30 million climate migrants to move elsewhere  thereby creating crisis of a huge magnitude within and beyond our borders. I therefore reiterate the call that I made at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly (see A/64/PV.4) for a legal regime to ensure the social  cultural and economic rehabilitation of climate migrants. I again call for a fast-track funding mechanism for least developed countries to ensure sustained funding for the realization of our adaptation and mitigation action plans on climate change.Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971 through monumental sacrifices. Our sacrifice began with bloodshed to preserve our mother tongue  Bangla  on 21 February 1952. At my Government’s initiative  UNESCO immortalized that sacrifice in 1999 by UNESCO by its declaration of 21 February as International Mother Language Day. The measures we have taken so far in that regard include the establishment of the International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka and asking the United Nations to declare Bangla as one of its official languages. I thank the United Nations for introducing a Bangla website and radio programme  and the United Nations Development Programme for publishing its Asian report in Bangla. During our 1971 war of liberation  Pakistani occupation forces — in collaboration with their local cohorts — perpetrated genocide  rape  arson and crimes against humanity. More than 3 million people sacrificed their lives and a quarter of a million women lost their honour to achieve independence. Since then  it has been the ardent hope and aspiration of the nation to bring the perpetrators to justice. Accordingly  our Government constituted two war crimes tribunals under the international crimes tribunals act of 1973 to try them. The trials are being held with the highest standards of judicial practices. The successful completion of the trials would heal the wounds of war and move Bangladesh on to the road of peace and progress. I urge the international community to support the trials process for the sake of justice  human rights and the rule of law. The anti-liberation forces have always been working to destroy the secular nature of our nation. Under the direct patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-Jamaat alliance Government from 2001 to 2006  they coalesced to form terrorist outfits  which began with bomb and grenade attacks killing people  especially secular leaders and members of Parliament. On 21 August 2004  they made an attempt to assassinate me by lobbing 13 grenades at a public rally that I was addressing to protest the grenade attack on the British High Commissioner on 21 May 2004. In that attack  24 people were killed and more than 500 injured. Miraculously  I survived. As members are aware  earlier a more brutal attack was carried out  on 15 August 1975  killing my father  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  the Father of the Nation  and 18 members of my family. My younger sister  Sheikh Rehana  and I survived only because we were out of the country at that time. The gruesome attacks cemented my resolve to eliminate terrorism and to adopt tough anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering acts. At home  our Government is entrenching democracy in order to ideologically defeat terrorism and extremism. Our commissions on elections  anti-corruption  human rights and information have been strengthened. During our Government’s tenure  the elections commission has conducted 5 777 elections  electing 63 995 persons to the Parliament  city corporations  municipalities and other local bodies  without receiving any complaint. The elections commission has therefore amply proven that it can hold free  fair and credible national elections. With respect to foreign affairs  we aim to cement peace by resolving outstanding issues with our neighbours  by increasing cooperation with them through strengthening connectivity and by maintaining good relations with all countries of the world according to the dictum of the Father of the Nation  “Friendship towards all  malice towards none”.Our commitment to global peace is proved by our role as a top troop-contributor in United Nations peacekeeping operations and as a Vice-Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission. It is also reflected by our position on disarmament and the nonproliferation agenda. During my first term as Prime Minister  from 1996 to 2001  Bangladesh became the first South Asian nation to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. In my current term  I am happy to again be the first in the region to have signed the Arms Trade Treaty  and to have acceded to the remaining instruments of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons at this year’s treaty-signing event. Our role in world affairs is based on justice and democratic values  with the aim of ensuring international peace and security and supporting disarmament. The promotion of cultural expression and interfaith and intercultural dialogue is essential for peace and development in the post-2015 era. My personal initiatives to disseminate those values at home and abroad were recognized by UNESCO in 2012  when we were awarded the Cultural Diversity Medal. Culture is integral to the identity of every State Member of the United Nations. Therefore  my country has proposed — to UNESCO and in the General Assembly’s thematic debate on culture and development — including culture as a theme of the post-2015 development agenda. I reiterate that call here today and request the support of all present.Bangladesh is hampered by resource constraints and inadequate external assistance. To achieve the MDGs by 2015 and to implement the post-2015 development goals  we need our development partners to honour their pledges to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance (ODA) and 0.2 per cent of GNP as ODA to the least developed countries (LDCs). I urge them to also grant LDCs duty-free and quota-free access to their markets  as well as an equal voice in the Bretton Woods and international financial institutions and the free movement of labour. The implementation of part IV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is also essential for the benefit of both sending and receiving countries.The elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda is a daunting task for all States Members of the United Nations. We must be united in agreeing on a common framework for the development agenda that would fulfil our aspiration to build a just  prosperous and sustainable world where no person or nation is left behind. Bangladesh  representing 160 million progressive and resilient people  will lead those efforts up front.The globalized world has unique complexities that sometimes threaten peace. Justice-based policies are imperative to eradicate such threats. Justice is the panacea for peace that enables development and progress  which in turn dispel the challenges posed to freedom  democracy  human rights  the environment and the equitable sharing of transboundary resources such as water  among others  as well as the challenges posed by climate change. Our resolution on the culture of peace  introduced at the Assembly every year  is drafted in that spirit and is always adopted by consensus. It conveys the message of mutual respect for peoples and nations in our bid for a world of peace and promise. I believe that we all aspire to such a world for our future generations."
"17",694,"BGR",68,2013,"I am truly honoured to address this forum. Let me convey my congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Bulgaria welcomes the theme you have selected as timely and relevant and wishes you every success. A 16 year-old Bulgarian boy  writing a school report on the Millennium Development Goals  compared the world’s development model to a colourful carpet in which some colours  threads and stitches were missing  making it look unfinished  patchy and ragged. Indeed  the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals resembles an unfinished work. Undoubtedly  a lot has been achieved in the global fight against poverty and underdevelopment  but progress has been unsteady and limited. Nowadays it is hard to accept that more than 1 billion people still suffer from extreme poverty and malnutrition and that basic health services for many women and babies remain a remote luxury. Disparities in wealth distribution  quality of life and personal opportunities have become more extreme across the globe. Climate change and environmental degradation have reached an alarming level and require our urgent collective response. The well-being of future generations is at risk due to the irrational management of natural resources. Despite our efforts  wars and armed conflicts continue to rage in different regions and cause thousands of deaths and are leading to humanitarian crises and human suffering. We also continue to witness violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.The situation in Syria continues to be a major cause of concern and a risk to regional and global security. Bulgaria strongly condemns the chemical attack on 21 August  which took the lives of thousands of innocent people  including many children. The use of chemical weapons in Syria constitutes a blatant violation of international law  a war crime and a crime against humanity. There is strong evidence to substantiate the assertion that the Syrian regime is responsible for those attacks  as it is the only party that possesses chemical agents  weapons and the means of their delivery for an attack of that scale.There can be no impunity  and the perpetrators of that heinous attack must be held accountable. Bulgaria  which is one of the signatory countries of a letter urging the Security Council to immediately refer the situation in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court  joins similar calls coming from the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.My country welcomes the framework agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to place Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal under international control with a view to its swift and secure destruction  and joins them in demanding that the Syrian regime provide the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with immediate access to inspect any and all sites in Syria. We call on the Security Council to unite and shoulder its relevant responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations  including Chapter VII.The use of chemical weapons should not divert attention from the persistent gross violations of human rights and continued human suffering. The momentum created should be used to move towards a lasting political solution to the conflict through the resumption of the Geneva process  with the active involvement of the United Nations.The worsening humanitarian crisis requires joint coordinated action to alleviate the suffering and help those in need. Bulgaria has provided humanitarian assistance to ease the plight of refugees in neighbouring countries. Situated not far from the region  my country is also affected by the daily influx of refugees from Syria. Despite its financial constraints  the Government has adopted an emergency plan and has provided additional resources in order to guarantee adequate assistance  accommodation and services to Syrian refugees. We count on the assistance and help provided by our partners and the humanitarian bodies of the United Nations system.We expect that Iran will demonstrate clear political will and address the concerns of the international community by providing credible evidence of the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. In that respect  Iran’s full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency is of paramount importance. The Government in Tehran must show greater transparency in its nuclear activities and should fully comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions.Bulgaria welcomes the successful adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons  and looks forward to its prompt entry into force.My country is encouraged by the resumption of the direct peace talks between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the initiative of Secretary Kerry  the Quartet and the parties concerned. We expect both sides to demonstrate perseverance and commitment to a peaceful solution  to respect each other’s legitimate interests and to refrain from unilateral actions that could undermine the process. Negotiations are the best way forward towards the ultimate goal  namely  a just  comprehensive and lasting solution on the basis of the two-State formula.Bulgaria welcomes the appointment of former Minister for Foreign Affairs Nickolay Mladenov as Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. His mission in Iraq is an important contribution to the peacebuilding and restoration process in that friendly country and to the stability of the region as a whole.Bulgaria condemns terrorism as one of the most horrific crimes and challenging threats to international peace and security. Terrorism has no face  no name  no colour and no religion. It strikes unexpectedly and scars the lives of everyone it touches. Recently  terrorism struck again in Nairobi. On behalf of Bulgaria  I convey my deepest condolences to the people and the Government of Kenya  but also Iraq  Pakistan and other countries where deadly terrorist attacks have occurred.On 18 July 2012  a terrorist attack claimed six innocent lives at a Bulgarian airport. That incident changed Bulgaria forever and is a reminder that the fight against terrorism is a common cause  on which the entire international community must remain united. We believe that the perpetrator of that horrendous terrorist act will be brought to justice soon. Bulgaria is grateful for the moral support  solidarity and practical assistance of other Member States in the investigation of that horrific crime. The critical role of international cooperation in this area once again points to the necessity of a prompt finalization of the negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention to combat terrorism.Let us take a look at what Europe has achieved in the past century. From a continent in ruins  torn apart by wars  we  Europeans  have created an area of peace  security and prosperity. Enemies have become friends and allies  united for a better future for their children. Today  in the European Union  we have harmonized regulations and share a single market  all underpinned by our common values.The past 25 years in the history of the Balkans are another great example of what can be achieved when neighbours work together towards a common goal. Building trust  good neighbourly relations  stability and security in South-Eastern Europe and in the Black Sea region is among Bulgaria’s priorities. My country remains strongly committed and will continue to support the efforts of our partners from the Western Balkans to meet the European Union membership criteria and take their legitimate place in the united European family.The European Neighbourhood Policy remains one of the most efficient instruments of the European Union to deepen cooperation and ensure peace and stability in the broader region. Bulgaria attaches particular importance to the Eastern dimension of the Policy to enhance relations with countries of the Black Sea region and members of the Eastern Partnership.If common borders and geographical proximity make us neighbours  shared cultural heritage is what makes us a family. This year we  the Slavic nations  celebrate together the one thousandth one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the mission of the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. Almost 12 centuries ago  they bestowed upon us the invaluable gift of the first Slavic alphabet. Bulgaria welcomed the disciples Saint Cyril and Methodius and adopted the Cyrillic script  which has helped us to preserve our national identity over the centuries.This year the international community marks the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action on human rights. On this occasion  Bulgaria would like to emphasize its strong conviction that human rights should remain one of the foremost priorities for the United Nations. As a candidate for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021  Bulgaria will intensify its efforts in promoting the highest human rights standards both domestically and internationally. We welcome the convening of the High-level Meeting on the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and Other Internationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities. As a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and as a member of the bureau of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention in New York  my country is strongly engaged in promoting the comprehensive and consistent implementation of the Convention at all levels  including by engaging disabled people’s organizations as an important partner in disability-inclusive development.My country is convinced that the course of reforms of the United Nations should continue in order to enhance the efficiency  representativeness and transparency of the entire United Nations system. To meet the needs of a changing world  the United Nations should continuously adapt and improve. That includes a revitalized General Assembly  a strengthened Economic and Social Council and a Security Council that reflects contemporary realities. As member of the Eastern European regional group  Bulgaria continues to hold its position as to the need for allotting at least one additional non-permanent seat in an enlarged Security Council to the group  given the fact that  in the past 20 years  its membership has more than doubled.Based on our long-standing engagement with the principles and values of the United Nations  I pledge that Bulgaria will be a responsible and reliable partner should it be elected as a Security Council non-permanent member for the term 2018-2019. We hope that the Members of the United Nations will entrust Bulgaria with that responsibility  and we stand ready to shoulder it in a spirit of partnership.We are still a long way from the future we want. The Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development outlined a comprehensive agenda for further work to be completed in the three dimensions of sustainable development. The recently published report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda presents key proposals for transformative shifts and a global  people-centred and planet-sensitive agenda. Bulgaria is actively engaged in the negotiation process on the new sustainable development goals  with a view to achieving a post-2015 framework that is human rights-driven  builds upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and integrates poverty eradication and sustainable development in a single and coherent process.The new universal and legally binding climate agreement to be signed in 2015 should reinforce the overarching post-2015 development agenda and speed up the international community’s efforts to introduce new sustainable models for growth.Culture and education should be accorded their rightful place in the post-2015 development agenda. In that regard  UNESCO’s role is of pivotal importance. Let me take this opportunity to reiterate Bulgaria’s strong support for the re-election of Ms. Irina Bokova to a second term as Director-General.I would like also to express Bulgaria’s admiration for the work done by UNICEF in the service of the children of the world. Bulgaria highly values the partnership and policy advice provided by the UNICEF Office in Sofia and others worldwide in modernizing the national child-protection sector and achieving more equitable and inclusive child care.Today we are building the world of tomorrow. Young people should be at the heart of those efforts as active participants  not as bystanders. For Bulgaria  young people are key stakeholders in the post-2015 development agenda.This year Bulgaria commemorates the seventieth anniversary of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the death camps during the Second World War  a unique achievement of Bulgarian civil society. Unfortunately  our country was in a situation where it could not do the same for Jews from northern Greece and parts of Yugoslavia. We deeply mourn their loss as well as that of all the victims of the Holocaust.Recently  citizens from different parts of the world  Bulgaria included  have engaged actively in public life  demanding greater transparency  accountability  decency and integrity from their politicians. We in my country believe that this renewed energy on the part of civil society deserves to be encouraged and supported. I firmly believe that safeguarding human dignity is the ultimate goal of the United Nations  as  indeed  of any genuine democracy."
"18",739,"BHR",68,2013,"It gives me great pleasure at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ashe on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to pay tribute to his friendly country  Antigua and Barbuda. I am confident that his vast diplomatic experience  with which I am personally familiar  and thorough knowledge of international affairs will guarantee the smooth conduct and success of our work at this session.I express my gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his skilful and judicious management of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I would like also to strongly commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to strengthen the United Nations and uphold its principles despite formidable difficulties and increasing challenges. We pledge our full support to him in his endeavours to enhance the role of the Organization and its peacebuilding capacities in the face of such major challenges.We extend our heartfelt condolences to the people and the friendly Government of Pakistan for the loss of hundreds of lives as a result of the earthquake that hit south-western Pakistan. We pray for their souls and extend our sympathy to their families. We condemn the terrorist act that targeted a commercial centre in Kenya’s capital  Nairobi  and deeply regret the scores of innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of that cowardly act.The Kingdom of Bahrain firmly believes that it is imperative to link peace to development. That concept has been acknowledged in and by all United Nations bodies for decades  and must now be enhanced and implemented at all levels. That is why the Kingdom of Bahrain is working to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  as a top priority of its development programme.The most recent report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/68/1) presents us with an accurate and concrete portrait of global problems in all their complexity. Those problems require effective solutions  particularly as we approach the 2015 deadline. In our view  therefore  the President’s choice for the theme of this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is apt and well considered  calling as it does for a collective effort to attain the goals we seek  based on the recommendations contained in the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  in order to ensure sustainable development. It also suggests the creation of a monitoring mechanism  under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council  to follow up on all recommendations made by relevant conferences on issues related to sustainable development  for the benefit of future generations.The Kingdom of Bahrain is located in the Arabian Gulf  a region of vital strategic importance that has been a crossroads of world civilizations since time immemorial. The countries of the region are experiencing one of the most prosperous eras in their history  building a society based on justice and development in every dimension — political  economic  social and cultural. As successive United Nations Development Programme annual reports have reflected  the region ranks high on the indices of human development. In that regard  we reaffirm our keen desire to continue making steady progress in development for the benefit of the peoples of our region  harnessing the formidable progress that has been made in information and communication technologies  as well as in dealing with issues pertaining to security  environment  natural resources and population.As a vital part of the world  our region seeks to consolidate a new concept of regional security that emphasizes the region’s geopolitical situation and considers security in relation to humanitarian needs  food and water. It also considers security in the context of existing coalitions that link the region to friendly countries through strategic and historic agreements that emphasize human  food and water security and that are designed to reinforce stability  enhance dialogue and promote a culture of peace  friendship and mutual respect.We in the Kingdom of Bahrain and the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have designated three important strategic pillars that guide our interaction with one another and help us to make progress  build healthy and sustainable relations with our neighbours  engage with the world at large and respond to new developments and challenges. Those pillars are axes for the world politics of today on a planet characterized by globalization and fruitful cooperation between its nations. In our view  therefore  the first pillar is regional partnership in the field of security  among ourselves and with our world partners. We in the GCC system work together to preserve our shared stability and security within a framework of coordination  cooperation and complementarity that results in the unity we seek. Our partnerships extend across the Arab and Islamic world. Here in the United Nations we continue to pursue such partnerships in the cause of maintaining world peace and security. We find political and economic solutions to many global problems within a multilateral cooperative framework that encompasses other strategic partnerships through dialogue with political Powers and economic groups such as the United States  the United Kingdom  the European Union  the Russian Federation  China  Japan  India and the member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  with a view to playing an active role in consolidating the principles of international cooperation and friendly relations between nations and peoples.In that context  our principal goal is to spare humankind the scourges of war  conflict and disasters. We therefore call for the establishment in the Middle East  including the Arabian Gulf region  of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  and for compliance with the criteria and safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency  especially those related to nuclear safety. In that regard  we support the efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany to work with the Islamic Republic of Iran to reach a swift settlement of the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme issue  in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  while guaranteeing the right of all States to enjoy the fruits of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We reiterate the importance of convening an international conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  in the Middle East  originally proposed for 2012  in accordance with the resolution adopted at the May 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Consistent with the principles and purposes we all endeavour to uphold in the context of our cooperation with the United Nations in order to improve stability in sensitive regions  we reaffirm our utter rejection of terrorism  extremism and violence in all their manifestations and forms  irrespective of their reasons  motives  justifications or sources. We also condemn all terrorist acts that threaten regional peace and stability  and noted the need to add groups such as the Lebanese Hizbullah to the list of international terrorist organizations  in view of their criminal acts aimed at terrorizing peaceful civilians and creating instability and chaos.We are committed to seeking peace  cooperation and security for our countries  within the framework of both international and regional structures and organizations by cooperating with our allies from other friendly countries to ensure freedom of maritime navigation in the Arabian Gulf and to protect commercial vessels from piracy off the coast of Somalia and the Horn of Africa and in the Gulf of Aden. We also contribute to peacekeeping and stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.We stand by the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt and support its efforts to achieve stability and security  rightfully defend its vital interests  implement a road map that can lead it to safety and propose clear steps to meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people and restore Egypt’s leading role in the Middle East.We also reiterate our principled position of unwavering support for and solidarity with the sisterly Kingdom of Morocco regarding its territorial integrity and a settlement of the Western Sahara problem  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.The second of our three strategic pillars encompasses support for the principles of good-neighbourliness  non-intervention in the internal affairs of others  abiding by the provisions of international law and its instruments and peaceful coexistence. We are also eager to take advantage of opportunities to put those principles into practice  in responding to the challenges we face and transforming them into opportunities to protect the region from tensions  threats and instability.The first of those challenges is the important task of putting an end to Iranian intervention in the internal affairs of the countries of the region and to its occupation of the three Emirates islands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. We ask that the repeated calls of the sisterly United Arab Emirates for a just solution to that question be heeded  either through serious direct negotiations between the two countries or by referral to the International Court of Justice for arbitration  in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law. In the face of that challenge  we look forward to new  clear and positive statements and initiatives from the Islamic Republic of Iran that can help to end the tensions and instability in the region and contribute to confidence-building  cooperation and the establishment of friendly relations based on good-neighbourliness and mutual interests.The second challenge concerns the Palestinian question  and the need to arrive at a just  permanent and comprehensive solution that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. That challenge has led to an important opportunity  the Arab Peace Initiative  launched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia  and endorsed at the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002. We still believe that that initiative presents an important opportunity to secure peace  security and a bright future for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples on the basis of coexistence  cooperation and good neighbourliness between the Arab States and Israel.We look forward to overcoming wars and animosity. For centuries Arabs  Muslims  Christians and Jews lived side by side in the region and forged their common history in a framework of coexistence and tolerance based on mutual respect for each other’s beliefs  culture and religion. The Arab Peace Initiative stipulates that the Palestinian people must enjoy all the full and legitimate rights enjoyed by other peoples of the world. It reaches out to the Israeli people with guarantees of security designed to reassure them against any threat or danger to their existence. In that respect  we fully support President Mahmoud Abbas in his sincere endeavours to achieve the aspirations of his people. He is one of the best leaders ever born in the land of Palestine and deserves our support in each of his steps toward the attainment of the desired peace.Today  we reaffirm our support for the tireless and sincere efforts of United States Secretary of State John Kerry to relaunch the peace process between Israel and Palestine in order to reach a permanent solution on the basis of international law  the relevant United Nations resolutions  the two-State solution  the creation of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the 4 June 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and any agreed swaps of territory between the two parties. We look forward to seeing an end to the oppression of Palestinians  the lifting of the Gaza blockade and to a halt in the building of settlements. We welcome the correct stance of the European Union whereby it refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of Israeli settlements built on Palestinian territory and suspends all financial dealings with such settlements.The third pillar is the need to attain the aspirations of our peoples. Foremost among these are the need to raise living standards  to bring about peace and stability  and to ensure respect for human rights through pluralism  democracy and the participation of all in a continued dialogue that takes into account the cultural values of a society and the levels of political  economic  social and cultural development of its peoples.Throughout the modern history and for over two centuries  the Kingdom of Bahrain has been eager to interact with its people and to engage in a dialogue with them based on full transparency and commitment. Ever since His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al-Khalifa assumed the leadership of the country  the Kingdom has pursued a steadfast policy of laying the foundations of a modern  independent  sovereign State based on sustainability  competitiveness  justice and a commitment to constitutional and legislative reforms. Such reforms have encompassed every aspect of political  economic  social and cultural life  as well as human rights and an enhanced role for women in building a society faithful to its values  culture  accomplishments and heritage.The King’s achievements are attributable to good governance and to his support for intellectual  political and organizational efforts to create democratic institutions that give everyone a chance to use their talents and creativity as active citizens of the contemporary world. That has made our country immune to the sectarian tensions and conflicts witnessed in many other countries of the region  notwithstanding the acts of violence perpetrated by some extremist and terrorist groups targeting security officers  residents and expatriates in their quest to spread terror and discord and to sabotage the national economy and development efforts. Such acts are being dealt with according to the law and justice system in a manner that protects the rights of all.Convinced that Bahraini citizens have a role to play in building and developing their society  we seek to cooperate closely with national and international civil society and human rights organizations in an ongoing dialogue based on an exchange of experiences and opinions and in a spirit of cooperation  not confrontation. We are all parties to the same cause in which we all believe — support and respect for and protection of human rights. In that context  the Kingdom of Bahrain has achieved concrete results in the field of enhancing human rights  notably through the establishment of a commission for prisoners and detainees  a national fund to compensate those affected by events  and a general secretariat for grievances within the Ministry of Interior.In that spirit  a historic initiative proposed the creation of an Arab human rights court that was endorsed at the meeting of the League of Arab States held in Qatar in March in response to the aspirations of the Arab peoples. This initiative represents a qualitative stride for the region and conforms to the rule of law and similar practices in other parts of the world. For the first time in modern Arab history  we will have a court to establish a solid foundation for the protection of human rights in the Arab world.Our national fund will compensate those affected by events  and the general secretariat will address grievances within the Ministry of Interior operating as an autonomous body within the framework of national laws and professional policing standards  as stipulated in the police code of conduct.In response to the aspirations of the Arab peoples  the GCC countries have spared no effort to achieve peace and security and to restore stability in some Arab countries facing serious challenges of late. In that respect  in Yemen a GCC initiative led to the national consensus dialogue towards a peaceful settlement of the crisis  in line with the aspirations and expectations of the brotherly Yemeni people to achieve security and stability in their land.Eager to see stability restored in the Syrian Arab Republic  and cognizant of the right of the Syrian people to choose their own political system  we support the current diplomatic steps towards destroying the Syrian chemical arsenal and the agreement reached in Geneva between the United States and the Russian Federation. We welcome Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) of 27 September  which calls on all parties concerned to take serious and concrete steps to address the Syrian crisis and its repercussions  particularly paragraphs 16 and 17 related to the transitional period and the implementation of the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/523  annex).All of these efforts should be complemented by an integrated political process so as to meet the aspirations of the Syrian people to democracy and political pluralism. We call on the United Nations and the international community to shoulder their responsibilities by taking the appropriate deterrent measures to halt the serious violations of human rights to which the Syrian people have been subject  and to put an end to the crimes of genocide being perpetrated with all kinds of lethal weapons  which have claimed more than 100 000 martyrs  injured many more  and created millions of refugees and internally displaced persons.I will not speak at further length  but I would like to assure the Assembly that the Kingdom of Bahrain  out of a sense of international responsibility and in all honesty and sincerity  wishes to play an active role in promoting international cooperation and strategic partnerships with the international community. Bahrain looks forward to a better and brighter tomorrow in which individual dignity and fundamental freedoms are a reality  and an individual’s just and legitimate rights are protected. Bahrain rejects conflicts and wars and seeks to maintain friendly relations with all countries of the world within the framework of respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs  as stipulated by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations."
"19",777,"BHS",68,2013,"Permit me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the Assembly. As a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  the Bahamas takes special pride in the election of one of our region’s own — the third such person to be so elected over the years. You may be assured of our full support as you attend to the duties of the high office to which you have been elected and for which you are  if I may say so  superbly qualified. We consider it a privilege to extend Ambassador Paulette Bethel to your office as Chef de Cabinet  and we wish her well as well.Permit me also to express my condolences and those of the Bahamas to the President and people of Kenya following the tragic attack on innocent civilians in Nairobi just last week.This year we in the Bahamas are celebrating our fortieth year of independence. It is appropriate  therefore  that we should pause today and look back to 1973  when our nation was founded and our membership in the United Nations began. In addressing the General Assembly for the first time on 1 October 1973  our then Prime Minister  Sir Lynden Pindling  spoke of our journey from the dehumanizing experiences of slavery and colonialism to the liberating achievements of freedom  majority rule and independence. He spoke  too  of the “perpetual interdependence of the big and the small ” and the fervent wish of the Bahamian people to be neither “dominated nor coerced.” He also had this to say:“We have the means to give new hope to mankind  to create a stable international order dominated by total and absolute political and economic self-determination and human and moral values which make human beings paramount  not things or abstractions.” (A/PV.2135  para. 28)Sir Lynden’s call for us to be faithful to the responsibilities of our nationhood and world citizenship is as relevant and compelling today as it was when we were welcomed into the family of the United Nations 40 years ago. As the present Prime Minister of the Bahamas  I have therefore come here today  on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  to renew our pledge to play our part to help make our planet the place of peace and stability and of collaborative endeavour and mutual support that it was intended to be  and must be  for the good of all humankind.But we need to ensure that such pledges are not just so many catchy phrases. We need to not only talk the talk but walk the walk. We in the Bahamas are determined to do just that. That is why  to cite one very recent example  my Minister of Social Development  Melanie Griffin  on Tuesday of this week here in New York  signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilites on behalf of the Bahamas. This is an important step forward that we have taken  marrying our rhetoric to our actions and synching our domestic agenda with our international obligations. We intend to ratify the Convention in the shortest possible time  and later this year we will introduce the necessary legislation in our Parliament to protect the rights of the disabled and to give full effect to our obligations under the Convention. The end to discrimination against the disabled in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is now clearly in sight. Indeed  it is now imminent.I would also submit today that we are all of us under a moral obligation to ensure that the policies and aspirational goals that the General Assembly sets for itself  and to which all Member States subscribe  are in fact reflected in the way that we govern our respective nations internally and  to no less a degree  in the way that we interact with each other as Member States in the international community. For example  we cannot  on the one hand  proclaim that we believe in free trade  then implement policies that inevitably bring about the destruction of agriculture as we know it in the Caribbean  and  in response to the resulting moral outcry  simply shrug our shoulders and piously lament that the old order changeth.We have to become more conscious of the practical outcomes of what we do. Too often  in the headlong rush for change  we damage the vulnerable and the weak. We then make pledges to help but seldom live up to those pledges in any sustained way. We simply cannot build a credible new world order on the basis of such practices. They run completely counter to our lofty pronouncements about the need for interconnectedness and mutual support in the pursuit of economic progress for all the nations of the world  be they large or small  developed or developing.We see the same dynamic at work in the ongoing economic aggression of many of the more developed countries against small  offshore financial service-based economies  especially in the Caribbean region of which the Bahamas is a part. Some have used their power  either unilaterally or in small groups of high-powered nations  to impose their will  arguing that there is something fundamentally immoral  something intrinsically sinister  about the accumulation of wealth in offshore jurisdictions.We reject that premise and we criticize in the strongest possible terms the efforts of some to maim and cripple  if not destroy  the offshore economies within our region. Ironically  the anti-money-laundering  anti-terrorism funding and anti-criminal regulatory regimes of many of our countries are far more robust and demonstrably far more effective than the corresponding regulatory regimes in many of the same countries that are leading the fight against us.We firmly believe that offshore financial services can be responsibly operated and regulated. We believe that the sector represents true tax competition and  in the great majority of cases  that it affords an honest opportunity for families and individuals alike to protect their privacy while accumulating lawfully earned capital for themselves and future generations. Moreover  the evidence is overwhelming that most of the investment of that offshore wealth takes place in and generally benefits the developed world.Unilateralism and diplomacy by coercion are not the way the world should be dealing with that issue. Instead  we need to challenge the United Nations to take the lead in developing and refining multilateral global mechanisms for the governance of the offshore financial services sector — mechanisms that will meet the legitimate demands of the developed world for the protection of their fiscal systems and their need for greater security  while at the same time allowing offshore financial-service economies to continue to grow in an orderly and properly regulated way.Let us not forget that the destruction of those offshore financial-service economies will destabilize the countries that depend upon them for their livelihood. To destroy that sector in the Caribbean would effectively cause tens of thousands of newly empowered middle-class citizens to slip back into poverty or to migrate to the developed world. The middle class of which I speak constitutes the anchor of social stability for the countries of our region. If it is taken away  social destabilization will emerge as a risk of the most ominous kind. And should that risk materialize  the developed world may well end up finding that it has solved one problem only by creating an infinitely bigger one for itself.The need for greater multilateralism is also evident in many of the other problems confronting the Bahamas and our region. A matter of the highest national priority for us revolves around our ongoing problem with illegal migration to our shores. We in the Bahamas suffer from the illegal migration of tens of thousands of desperate people from our sister Caribbean Community State of Haiti — an exodus undeniably driven by crushing poverty.We also have a problem with illegal migration from other countries in the Caribbean  albeit to a much lesser extent. Of special note in that regard are migrants from Cuba. We believe that the policies rooted in the Cold War that largely account for that migration ought to be brought into alignment with the realities of the modern era.Our archipelagic nation  though comparatively small in population  covers a vast area. With our hundreds of islands  the opportunities for illegal migration are greatly multiplied. At a time when it is imperative that we invest in the education and health and future of our people  we are forced instead to devote an ever-growing share of our resources to the problems associated with illegal migration.The Bahamas  like the rest of the world  understandably places a great deal of emphasis on the human rights of migrants  but we also believe that there must be similar concerns for the ill-effects on migrant-receiving States such as ours. In particular  we are concerned about the increasingly unsustainable costs that are being incurred and the resulting erosion in the quality of life for the citizenry of the Bahamas. Our country  the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  simply does not have the financial resources and infrastructural capacity  much less the psychological stamina  to endure that dilemma indefinitely.That should also remind us of the economic disparities within our region and of the need to intensify global efforts to eliminate poverty and structural imbalances that impede economic growth within certain segments and sections of the Caribbean. For as long as those disparities persist  illegal immigration to the shores of countries that are comparatively more prosperous will continue to grow.Another problem that is of special concern to us is the continuing influx of guns and the increase in gun-related criminality  not only in the Bahamas but throughout the region. As a world community  there is  I am convinced  a great deal more that we can and should be doing to fight that common menace.The Bahamas has this year signed the Arms Trade Treaty  and we encourage all States that have not already done so to sign the Treaty as well. And we implore those countries that produce the guns that end up taking innocent lives and causing terror in our communities to become more proactive in controlling the export of guns. We implore them to step up the policing of their own borders against arms traffickers.We therefore call for more robust surveillance and reconnaissance measures to be instituted. We already have the experience of joint anti-drug operational activities with the United States of America. However  more resources ought to be employed in a region-wide effort to fight crime. In particular  we call for a massive increase in joint tactical operations so that more air and maritime assets can be consistently deployed and the thousands of square miles that constitute the territorial waters of Caribbean States can be more effectively patrolled. We in the Bahamas stand ready to play our part in those joint efforts  without which the war on arms trafficking  human smuggling and the transshipment of illicit drugs will never produce the victory we all strive for.In a recent talk that I gave to a meeting of the International Monetary Fund that the Bahamas hosted for the region  I made the point that we must all seek to mitigate the vulnerabilities of our small States in the CARICOM region. Of particular concern in that regard is the fact that we have as yet been unable to disabuse the international financial organizations of their conviction that gross domestic product per capita is by itself an accurate measure of the wealth of a nation or of its state of development.The result of the continuing adherence to that dogma and the policies that have flowed from it is that the international financial assistance needs of countries in our region are being erroneously assessed and misunderstood. I therefore again join all of those calling for a revamping of the criteria in that regard so that the true financial assistance and development needs of developing countries can be evaluated in a fairer and more balanced and pragmatic way.Another significant vulnerability for my country concerns the environment and the need to address comprehensively issues of climate change. The Bahamas is surrounded by the sea and is low-lying. Indeed  80 per cent of the land mass of the Bahamas is less than five feet above sea level. The implications of climate change and associated rises in sea level are therefore obvious for my country and its people. I would submit that the world  particularly the developed world  has a stake in resolving those issues  for while countries such as ours may be the victims of climate change  we are not among the countries that are  in fact  largely responsible for the climate change that threatens our future and that of the planet.In the Bahamas  we are waging our own battles. We are putting our fiscal house in order. We are introducing innovative tools to fight crime. We are training a new generation for twenty-first century jobs. We are creating new partnerships to tackle our most pressing problems. We are aggressively pursuing renewable energy. We are revamping and modernizing our structure of governance to make it more responsive to the needs of the twenty-first century. And by the increased use of the referendum machinery  we are demonstrating our commitment to a deepening of our democracy. We are a small country with strong convictions and big ideas. But as we look beyond the borders of our nation and of the region to gaze upon the global scene  we see much eloquence and many handshakes and the ceremonial signing of one treaty after another. Rarely  however  do we see concrete steps or enforcement mechanisms with teeth. Ringing declarations have been made from Rio to Copenhagen and beyond  and we are constantly being challenged by our own citizens to demonstrate to them that real and measurable progress is being achieved at the global level.We need to see more courage  more leadership  more sustained action on the global stage. So as the leader of a small but proud nation  I take the opportunity to say to the big and powerful nations: Find your courage because the hour grows late."
"20",802,"BIH",68,2013,"First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  as well as members of your team  and to extend to you my full support in your future work. Plenary meetings of the General Assembly have always been an opportunity for Heads of State to gather and exchange their opinions about the world situation in order to try to find solutions for contemporary global problems.My country’s strategic goal of establishing a formal relationship with and membership in the European Union (EU) is based upon its ambition to become part of the big family of democratic States and therefore assure the full functionality of its own institutions and its further development on the basis of a free market and the rule of law  and especially human rights. Based on the direction and foreign policy activities of Bosnia and Herzegovina  our focus remains on furthering our relationship and institutional relationship with the European Union  according to the Stabilization and Association Agreement and its full implementation. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s aspiration to become a member of the European Union is based upon broad political census.The fact that the process of European integration demands comprehensive political  institutional and legal adjustments in order to reach European standards in all areas is of fundamental importance to my country. We are also fully aware that the active participation of all segments of society of Bosnia and Herzegovina is necessary to expedite the process of European integration. I expect that expediting the remaining activities and the implementation of the Sejdi.-Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights will lead to the fulfilment of the requirements for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for accession to the European Union.I also hope for a positive development in the process of fulfilling the conditions for activating the NATO membership action plan and further integrating Bosnia and Herzegovina into NATO security structures. I would also like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the final phase of negotiations for accession to the World Trade Organization.Allow me to emphasize again that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a very clear stance with regard to war crimes. All those accused of war crimes will be held responsible for the crimes of which they are accused before either international or domestic courts.Bosnia and Herzegovina puts great emphasis on regional and subregional cooperation and dialogue among neighbouring countries  whose cultures and traditions have been present in the Balkans for centuries and who are currently at different stages of transition and democratic reform. Bosnia and Herzegovina is turned towards the future and to cooperation with neighbouring countries on the basis of mutual respect  as well as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. The development of bilateral relations with all of our neighbouring countries and other countries in the region is focused on several key areas: Euro-Atlantic integration  advancing economic cooperation  strengthening regional cooperation and finding constructive solutions for current issues.Our emphasis on regional cooperation is on the development of communications infrastructure as a basis for better economic  cultural and scientific ties  as well as overall regional development. The potential for regional economic ties is especially strong in the areas of industry  tourism  agriculture and energy.I would like to especially emphasize our bilateral relations with the Republic of Croatia  which gained a new dimension and dynamic with the Croatian accession to the EU  which was marked by eagerness on both sides to find solutions that are in best interests of both our countries.I must point out that we continue to live during one of the greatest economic and financial crises in contemporary history  which is certainly the greatest threat to global peace and security. We must do everything in our power to tackle its negative effects and consequences. Although the latest indicators show that some developing countries are coming out of the recession  that is not the case in poor and developing countries  where the consequences of the crisis are very harsh.The institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been strategically working towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We believe that  despite the difficulties caused by the world economic situation  there will be no obstacles in reaching our stated targets by 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina has finalized the development strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the social inclusion strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina  while the strategy for poverty eradication has already been designed and implemented. All of that has been done in cooperation with the relevant United Nations agencies in the country  whom we would like to thank for their close cooperation.Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to contribute to global efforts to define a development framework and then to implement it in order to readily face economic  social and environmental challenges. Considering that the importance of the three aspects of sustainable development I have mentioned crosses national borders  Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that regional cooperation is crucial for the successful preparation of the new post-2015 development framework.Bosnia and Herzegovina  as well as all the other Western Balkan countries at this stage of integration  follows European Union policy and views with regard to the new development agenda. Bosnia and Herzegovina consistently supports the position that sustainable development is possible only in harmony with nature. I am of the opinion that economic and political interests must not be an obstacle to achieving global consensus on a true beginning of the global fight for the preservation of the natural balance of planet Earth. It is often forgotten that climate change has a direct impact on development  poverty and hunger  and consequently on global peace and security. Short-term solutions will have long-term consequences  and the steps we take today will be our legacy for generations to come.All of us present here agree that the United Nations needs continuous and comprehensive reform  which should be conducted with great caution  assuring a wide consensus of Member States. United Nations reform should provide for efficient and coordinated functioning of all segments and bodies of the system. It is a widely held belief that Security Council reform is crucial for core reform of the world Organization. That reform  carried out with the consensus of the Member States  is necessary for reasons of efficiency and credibility  and it can be achieved only by taking into account the contemporary geopolitical reality  which differs from that of 1945. Only a Security Council reformed in that way can have full authority and responsibility in addressing the most important issues of international peace and security. That is the mandate entrusted to the Council by the Charter of the United Nations.Dialogue and compromise are the best way to ensure the widest possible support  and Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the opinion that Security Council reform should be moved from a standstill as soon as possible. We also believe that a reformed Security Council should have an additional seat for a State from the Eastern European Group  as the number of countries in that group has more than doubled in the past two decades.In accordance with that position  I would also like to emphasize that more engagement in preventative diplomacy is expected from the Security Council. We believe that more activity in the area of preventive diplomacy would help solve many problems and crises before they intensify  which would be a more efficient way for the Council to work. Encouraging dialogue to resolve critical issues by compromise  while acting against any kind of exclusiveness  especially in the area of human rights and human life  is of the utmost importance. Timely and efficient conflict prevention  rather than reaction to a crisis that has already escalated  is definitely a more effective and less costly approach to international peace and security. We are eager to share with others the positive and the negative of our post-conflict and peacebuilding experience. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that every crisis should be studied carefully  with careful consideration for the roots of conflict  the culture  religion and local customs and every other factor in order to find a just and long-term solution. There are no universal solutions for any crisis  and each one should be attended to and considered separately.Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that it is necessary to take concrete steps to prevent nuclear proliferation around the world. In spite of visible obstacles of the past decade  there are new initiatives giving new momentum to the disarmament and non-proliferation process. We believe that nuclear disarmament can be achieved by encouraging Member States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to respect their obligations under the Treaty. Bosnia and Herzegovina will sign the Arms Trade Treaty during the Treaty event.Bosnia and Herzegovina is gravely concerned about the continuing violence in Syria  which has worsened the humanitarian crisis and caused unacceptable suffering for the Syrian people. We call on all the parties to comply with their obligations under international law and human rights law. Resolving the crisis in the Middle East continues to be one of the most important priorities of the world Organization. We believe that all possible steps should be taken to create a positive climate in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. We expect all sides to refrain from any rash actions and to focus on launching this very important dialogue.In order to play a constructive role in international relations and to contribute to self-sustainable peace and stability  Bosnia and Herzegovina participates in the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan. In support of international efforts  we also actively participated in the United Nations missions in Liberia  South Sudan and Cyprus. I would also like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina remains very concerned that terrorist attacks around the world continue to take the lives of innocent victims. We are committed to fighting terrorism and believe that results in that regard can be achieved only through comprehensive cooperation and a partnership of as many Member States as possible.Bosnia and Herzegovina is also following the situation on the African continent with great interest. We expect that despite the world financial and economic crisis  most developed countries will continue to increase their contributions to the official development assistence that is essential for capacity-building in poor African countries. Therefore  we welcome the activities of the United Nations through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and other efforts aimed at putting Africa on the road to stable and sustainable development  especially with regard to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That particularly applies to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We also support all efforts of the African Union  African Governments and the United Nations to improve the rule of law and democracy and to strengthen civil society and its institutions  in order to improve all aspects of society. We wish to point out that continued and greater financial aid to Africa is just as important as improving the efficiency and transparency of the use of aid funds for sustainable development.In today’s world  with political and social processes more dynamic than ever  we face challenges quite different from those of only a few decades ago. It is becoming clear that only a strong multilateral approach can produce good solutions. In its more than six decades of existence  the United Nations has seen many trials and tribulations  but it has always been  and continues to be  the only guide to a better future. It is still the only organization capable of providing solutions to the global problems we face. It is up to us to make it stronger and more efficient  for only the United Nations — the most comprehensive and inclusive organization — can help bring progress and well-being to our planet. If we work together to implement all our agreements reached in this hallowed place  there is no doubt that we will live in better and more just conditions than exist today. On that path  we need to return to the basic values and principles of human rights  equality and world peace that are the foundation of the United Nations."
"21",849,"BLR",68,2013,"I will begin with a simple question: what is the key challenge facing today’s world? I believe that it is the fact that humankind’s societal evolution has not kept pace with globalization. We are constantly lagging behind. Our failure to adjust quickly and effectively has given rise to a range of political  economic and social problems. That mismatch between technological and societal development has been the norm since the beginning of the industrial revolution  in the late eighteenth century. Furthermore  these days it represents a far more serious threat than ever before. The pace of globalization has been steadily accelerating  and therefore we have had to adapt much more quickly.We need a mechanism that will enable us swiftly and effectively to address this problem. Such a mechanism could appropriately be called “a new global world order”.Today we can hardly say that we have a global order at all  as the notion of order implies stability  which we do not have at present. The old rules are not being observed  and new ones have not been established. We permanently find ourselves stricken by various global crises. The great Powers seek to provide global governance by means of clubs whose membership is limited to themselves. Other countries wager on regionalism  and medium-sized and small countries see their rights infringed at every turn. Overall  the current geopolitical situation is characterized by an increasing dynamic of multilevel competition as well as by the global governance crisis. What is even more alarming is that all of this is taking place against a backdrop of increasing global inequality. It is clear that if we cannot arrive at an order by design  anarchy will come to us by default.Let me state that Belarus has no clear-cut recipe as to how to build a new global order. After all  this can hardly be done quickly and simultaneously. The great Goethe once said: “Man is not born to solve the problem of the universe  but to find out what he has to do and to restrain himself within the limits of his comprehension”.Let us try to proceed with precisely this logic in mind. We are convinced of the need to move forward first and foremost in areas where there is a particular urgency to do so.We believe that we should start by strengthening the role of the State in today’s world. The industrial revolution once made the State strong and the idea thereof appealing.Indeed  the history of the past two centuries has not been a narrative of military power. Rather  it has been a story of the growing force of the principle of self-determination  that is  the aspiration of nations to establish their own States  which can then effectively promote the interests of their citizens. It is no wonder that in times of crisis and uncertainty  the great leaders of the past saw the strengthening of the State’s role as a solution. United States President Franklin Roosevelt  faced with the Great Depression  thought that only a strong State could address the problems of the “forgotten man”.Over the past several decades  globalization  especially in its unregulated phase  has clearly reduced the role and importance of the State. We find ourselves in a paradoxical situation. On the one hand  global processes have curtailed State power. On the other hand  tackling the growing transnational challenges sparked by globalization requires strong States. What do we mean by this?Let us start from the premise that we all live in a very diverse world. States  reflecting this range of diversity  assume very different forms in their domestic and internal organization. History has shown that it is impossible to boil all States down to the same level.We are convinced that it makes sense to assess States  and let me here resort to philosophy  on their content rather than their form. In other words  a strong State is an accountable State  in both domestic and foreign policy  regardless of its form.Let us then build relations based on the notion of content rather than form. Indeed  why does the domestic political situation of  say  Belarus or Cuba serve as a basis for some countries to pursue policies of sanctions and persecution — policies that contravene international law — against those States? After all  it was the people of those countries who determined their form and they do not wish another  because their Governments pursue accountable policies. By and large  the people have no objections to them in terms of content.The call for a strong State  of course  has nothing in common with a call for dictatorship. Franklin Roosevelt said: “History proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and successful Governments  but out of weak and helpless ones”.State weakness is no longer a humanitarian concern but a problem of international security. It is a guarantee that we will fail to cope with the mismatch generated at the global level by the different paces of the globalization and societal adaptation processes.We deem the next area of focus to be efforts to ensure global convergence. It is worth pointing out that such attempts have often been undertaken in the past. Unfortunately  the areas of application were inappropriate from the start. Convergence basically occurred in the context of attempts by the mighty of the world to impose their own political and economic models on other countries. That was outright coercion. As a result  all such attempts have backfired.In today’s world  completely different approaches are needed — approaches aimed at unity and stability rather than disunity and anarchy. We need social convergence. To put it simply  we must work to create a robust middle class in every State  without coercion. After all  all countries have an interest in a sizeable national middle class. History has clearly shown that success in that area will ensure the domestic stability of a State and foster its interest in pursuing a foreign policy of international stability. We are convinced that the benefits produced by the middle class at the national level can have a similar impact at the international level. A large number of middle-income countries worldwide would be the best safeguard to ensure a truly multipolar  fair and stable world. Such a group of States would seek neither diktat nor dominance over others. What is more  having just recently emerged from the grip of poverty and domestic instability  many countries have fully realized the importance of global development and of solidarity aimed at the least developed countries.Building on that understanding  Belarus is keen to rekindle the topic of middle-income countries at the international level. In May  we held a regional conference on middle-income countries in the context of sustainable development. We witnessed immense interest in that event. Likewise  Belarus welcomes the high-level international conference on middle-income countries held in June in Costa Rica. Those and other relevant events point to the need for more focused work within the United Nations system on cooperation with middle-income countries. At the same time  a number of ongoing trends are working to prevent the strengthening of the middle class in those States. The unfettered globalization ardently carried out by the so-called market fundamentalists has served to increase inequality in the world and hollow out the middle class. Many  in both developed and developing countries  are already confronting the resulting political and economic consequences.We pin our hopes for improvement on the ongoing effort at the United Nations to design a post-2015 United Nations development agenda. The world is fast approaching the 2015 completion deadline set for the Millennium Development Goals. My country’s current view is that the key lesson to be drawn  even at this stage  is that there can be no lasting progress in today’s world in any individual area if other areas are neglected. That is because everyone and every thing in the world — people  economies and threats — has become highly interconnected. For instance  one cannot succeed in tackling migration without addressing poverty  conflicts and environmental disasters. That perception  in turn  points to the need to set the stage for a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda. It is highly commendable that the United Nations  its Member States and many other stakeholders have already been actively engaged in the preparatory process. Likewise  it is gratifying that everyone views the paradigm of sustainable development as the basis for the future agenda. That is the proper course  as sustainable development — based on its economic  social and environmental components — is the best approach to meeting the global development challenges in a truly comprehensive manner.Belarus shares the view that the sustainable development goals should be at the heart of the next agenda. We see the need to develop such goals in as many areas as possible. It is particularly crucial that they address those areas not covered by the Millennium Development Goals  such as  for example  migration  energy and employment. We believe that each and every goal must be achieved through appropriate thematic global partnerships among States  international organizations  civil society and the private sector. A good example of that is the global partnership against slavery and trafficking in persons initiative  which is now being successfully implemented. We hope that a comprehensive approach to development will help in controlling globalization and  more important  ensure that it is fair. After all  it must work in the interests of all rather than of a few. Drawing on a historical analogy  one can argue that the post-2015 development agenda represents our future  comprehensive “new deal” — like the one launched by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The United Nations serves as the indispensable platform — thanks to its unquestionable legitimacy  universal membership and comprehensive scope — for the international community to appropriately reconcile and subsequently implement its interests in terms of the new deal.The greatest danger in geostrategic uncertainty is not the uncertainty itself; rather  it is the desire to take action in a complex setting using yesterday’s logic  namely  a business-as-usual attitude. We are certain that only by shaking off such an approach will we be able to forge a global order to benefit all people on Earth."
"22",884,"BLZ",68,2013,"I am once again privileged to address the General Assembly on behalf of my country  Belize.It is with great delight that I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. You are a testament to all the peoples of the Caribbean and the world of the height to which each of us can aspire when industry and character are fused into one. Rest assured  Mr. President  of the unqualified support of Belize throughout your term in office. I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor for his service as President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.It is in the quest for the attainment of the two ideals of peaceful conflict resolution and the enhancement of the lives of all peoples that leaders of Member States make this annual pilgrimage in September to address the General Assembly. Belize commends the United Nations and its visionary leadership over the years for its unflinching efforts in discharging the core functions of the Organization.The promulgation of the Millennium Development Goals  in 2000  resulted in all countries working together  for the first time in human history  to address and rectify the gaps in their development agenda to reduce poverty. It was a signal event and a major breakthrough for the United Nations development agenda. It gave hope for the provision of huge amounts of desperately and genuinely needed aid  the transfer of technology and other development assistance from affluent nations  financial institutions and philanthropists to nations mired in poverty. That was undoubtedly good news. It was reminiscent of the Marshall Plan  which rescued Germany and Japan from abject ruin after the Second World War and catapulted them to heights of affluence they had never experienced before.By the end of the 1990s  most countries were in dire straits. According to former Secretary-General Kofi Annan  more than 60 per cent of the world subsisted on $2 or less per day  while more than 1 billion people were living on less than $1 per day. Illiteracy was nearly at 1 billion people. Eight hundred million people were chronically hungry — one in seven people on Earth — including 200 million children. And 1.3 billion people lacked even the most basic health-care  sanitation and education services. Today  13 years later  as the Millennium Development Goals are being implemented  the scorecard reveals that  while a small minority of countries are showing commendable success in attaining the Millennium Development Goals  the vast majority of nations are still mired in poverty  with scant or no signs of development.We note with disappointment that rich countries have not even been able to bring themselves to honour their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product as official domestic assistance to poor countries. The resources being provided by international and other financial institutions and by private donors fall far short of what is needed by poor countries to attain those laudable  and indeed basic  Goals. It is evident that  for some inexplicable reason  developed countries have abandoned Goal 8 — developing a global partnership for development. In the absence of the cooperation of developed countries  the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals by poor countries will remain an illusion.Poor countries possess neither the requisite leadership cadres  the financial  human and technical resources  the infrastructure  the necessary levels of investment and trade nor the institutions to bring about levels of development that are capable of generating the wealth needed to underwrite the expenses associated with the attainment and  most important  the sustainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Perhaps even worse  far too many countries have no realistic prospects for achieving such capacity within the foreseeable future. Despite that  Belize remains committed to the attainment of the Goals  which we are pursuing assiduously.Given our experience with the Millennium Development Goals  it is  in our view  eminently fitting that you  Mr. President  should have kept the spotlight on the post-2015 development agenda for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In that connection  the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” is very apt indeed. The Millennium Development Goals must remain a work in progress. The post-2015 development agenda must be informed by our experiences with the Millennium Development Goals. In that regard  a careful analysis must be undertaken to ascertain why our rich development partners have failed to live up to their obligations under the partnership to provide the promised development aid and expertise to poor development partners. And new mechanisms must be devised to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda does not suffer a similar fate.As we embark upon setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  Belize has recognized and identified four underpinning points: that the post-2015 agenda must be global; that it should integrate the outcomes of major summits into a cohesive action-oriented agenda that can be implemented  building upon successes and improving lessons learned; that the necessary resources must be sourced and committed to underwrite the new partnership for development; and that it must be guided by our core values of conflict prevention and poverty eradication.Belize endorses the intergovernmental processes for the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda. Our domestic priorities  which complement the global agenda  are contained in the document Horizon 2030  which articulates our development framework. Sector-specific documents emanating from Horizon 2030 inform our national development agenda in areas such as security  energy  gender  education and health.Topping the list of our domestic priorities at this time is the resolution of the Guatemalan claim  which poses an existential threat to our nation and requires urgent resolution if the peoples of our two countries and our region are to continue to enjoy the peaceful coexistence that has characterized our relationship thus far. When I addressed the Assembly last September (see A/67/PV.20)  I was pleased to report that our two States had agreed to submit to the citizens of our respective countries  in a simultaneous referendum to be held on 6 October 2013  six days from today  the question of whether it was the will of our respective constituencies that the Guatemalan claim be submitted to the International Court of Justice for a final resolution. Regretfully  however  last April  Guatemala gave official notice to both Belize and the Organization of American States that the Guatemalan Government had decided not to proceed with the referendum and was proposing that it be postponed sine die. Not unexpectedly  that decision was not well received in Belize.The Guatemalan claim is a constant source of anxiety for our citizens as well as for investors in our country. Furthermore  both our territorial and maritime border regions have been suffering from depredations and environmental degradation as a consequence of the wanton and sustained illegal activities of Guatemalan campesinos  fishermen and criminal elements engaged in narco-trafficking  human trafficking  smuggling  illegal panning for gold  the extraction of xaté and other exotic plants and animals  the illegal felling of timber and the pillaging of our ancient Mayan ruins. The felling of timber in our rainforests is contributing to the denuding of our mountains  which results in violent flooding in the rainy season and the transfer of topsoil  sand and silt into the sea. Those soils are then ultimately deposited on our pristine barrier reef  choking and destroying its fragile ecosystems and compromising the health of the entire reef and the marine ecological system that thrives there.Additionally  the increasing trespassing by Guatemalans into our country has given rise to more frequent violent encounters between Guatemalans and members of the Belize Defence Force  resulting in fatalities in some instances. Those incidents put a heavy strain on the relations between our country and Guatemala and the peace of our region as a whole.While Belize appreciates that the activities of the Guatemalans in our border regions are the direct result of poverty and failed development in their own country  we are concerned by the fact that such activities create the conditions for conflict. There are some 65 Guatemalan villages along the 141-mile-long Belize-Guatemala border. The villagers there are largely indigent and unemployed. Absent higher employment and increased security patrols on both sides of the border  the incursions of Guatemalans will not  in our view  abate  but will only get worse.Belize is resolved to do everything in its power to protect its citizens and territorial integrity  but our efforts alone will not be sufficient to put an end to the forays of Guatemalans into our country. Input from the international community will be vital in assisting with the development of income-generating enterprises in the border regions to ameliorate the poverty there  which is what compels Guatemalans to trespass in those regions.Border conflicts are dangerous by nature. In his memoir  Interventions: A Life in War and Peace  former Secretary-General Kofi Annan wrote:“[Conflicts] suck in their neighbours  send thousands of refugees spilling into other countries  create havens for armed groups and terrorists  and they cause the spread of criminal networks and cross-border lawlessness  including piracy. In short  conflicts ... are inherent generators of global insecurity  the causes of which need to be addressed by wealthy and poor States alike.”I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Organization of American States and the group of friends who support the efforts of Belize and Guatemala to resolve the Guatemalan claim peaceably and  in the interim  to ensure that peace is maintained between our two countries.Climate change is another existential threat  looming not only over Belize but over all nations of the world  large and small. In our view  it is urgent that the international community arrive at consensus as to the imminence and magnitude of the threat posed to humankind by climate change  as well as on the way forward in dealing successfully with that perilous phenomenon. That is another threat that can be successfully dealt with only by the United Nations. Combating the threat will necessitate huge expenditures  the deployment of cutting-edge technology and  most likely  the cessation of the use of fossil fuels.Developing countries such as Belize will need both technical and financial assistance from the international community and international financial institutions to adapt to the changes being brought about by climate change and to mitigate the deleterious effects thereof.Belize has established a national climate -change committee to coordinate our Government’s interventions in all areas relating to climate change. We are also establishing a new climate-change policy and strategy that provides for the scaling up of mitigation and adaptation efforts at all levels. We applaud the Secretary-General for his decision to convene a high-level meeting on climate change in the near future.The security of its citizens is a paramount obligation of every Government. The Belize Government takes that responsibility seriously. However  the threats to the security of our citizens are so numerous in today’s globalized world that no single country has the capacity to tackle the issue on its own. Consequently  Belize works actively with our multilateral and bilateral partners in funding the necessary resources  technical assistance and training in our quest to secure our citizenry. We are party to the Central American Security Strategy  which is dedicated to combating the activities of national  regional and transnational criminals. We also collaborate closely with security and law enforcement authorities in our region  including Canada  the United Kingdom  the United States and Mexico.We are very pleased with the adoption  earlier this year  of the Arms Trade Treaty and we will  in due course  ratify it. We have also enacted a whole raft of legislation to strengthen our crime-fighting capabilities.The Belize Government invests as much as 26 per cent of its annual budgeted expenditure on the education sector. We believe that education is one of the quickest ways to lift our people out of poverty. Also  one half of our population is below the age of 25 and approximately 37 per cent is below the age of 18. They will all need world-class education and skills training if they are to be able to compete successfully in global markets. At this time  Belize is not able to provide education and training at that level locally and cooperates with its international partners for the provision  in large measure  of such education.Non-communicable diseases and disabilities are impacting the countries in the Caribbean region very negatively. In our own country  the incidence of cancers  diabetes  HIV/AIDS  chronic lung diseases  hypertension and strokes is reaching epidemic proportions. Empirical data reveal that in low- and middle-income countries  non-communicable -isease-related impairments account for 65.5 per cent of persons living with disabilities. It is therefore urgent that the United Nations work to address the afflictions that are blighting the lives of untold numbers of our citizens.At the most recent meeting of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community  a historic decision was taken that the Community should pursue all the necessary steps to recover reparations for the descendants of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade from the nations that participated in and benefited from that trade. Belize urges the United Nations to lend its support to that initiative  which seeks to address  at least in part  the unspeakable evil perpetrated by the European nations that participated in the trade.Earlier this year  Belize successfully rescheduled its debt obligations with its commercial bondholders  an exercise that enabled us to avoid the spectre of sovereign default. Despite that restructuring  however  Belize’s capacity to finance its development programmes is still challenged  and it continues to rely on cooperation with its bilateral and multilateral partners to achieve its development goals. In that regard  Belize would like to express its gratitude to the United Nations and its related agencies  including the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Population Fund  UNICEF  UNESCO  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Pan American Health Organization  which work tirelessly to support the implementation of our national development objectives. We also wish to thank the many nations that are currently partnering with us in development.Belize would like to enlist the support of the United Nations in helping to persuade the international financial organizations that per capita gross domestic product is not in itself an accurate measure of a nation’s wealth or stage of development  particularly in the case of heavily indebted middle-income countries like ours. Such a method of assessment would disqualify those countries  including my own  from eligibility for badly needed concessionary financing  and that eventuality could well lead to reversals of their hard-won gains.The Government of Belize is committed to a rights-based approach to the development of our country and people. To that end  we have embraced the international human rights regime and are making our best efforts to enable inclusive growth. In that regard  we are pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government of Belize has  in consultation with its stakeholder partners at the national level  submitted the report for its second universal periodic review for consideration by the Human Rights Council at its seventeenth session  in October.I would like to inform the Assembly that we  too  condemn the cowardly terrorist act that took place recently in Kenya.Earlier I referred to my country’s position on the post-2015 development agenda — that the agenda must be inclusive if we are to achieve meaningful development. We need to ensure that all our countries are allowed to participate in a meaningful manner  and that includes the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We cannot deny the significant advances they have been able to make in such a short time  or their contributions in support of global goals and commitments  especially in the area of development cooperation. Their experience can teach us about advancing our own development.Every year the Assembly votes to lift the economic embargo on Cuba. We continue to support that call.Belize also continues to call for an urgent and peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The situation in the Middle East troubles us. As responsible citizens of the world  we condemn the use of chemical weapons and welcome the framework agreement — led by Russia and the United States of America and supported by the Security Council — that we hope will lead to the removal of all chemical and biological weapons from Syria. We also call on other nations to abide by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.As we approach the end of an era and look towards the post-2015 development process  our Government  policymakers  planners and all levels of society will be challenged to focus on what we want and what we can achieve together. We must commit to a process of ensuring that we adopt goals and objectives that reflect global priorities and are adapted to our national contexts. Our agenda must be reflective of the world’s most pressing problems  which include  but are not limited to  environmental sustainability  inequality  growth with equity and social inclusion.We are confident that under your guidance  Mr. President  that process will be an inclusive  accessible and transparent one."
"23",931,"BOL",68,2013,"I wish to convey my greetings to the Secretary-General and all the Presidents  Heads of State  delegations and international organizations from across the world. I convey also my special greetings to those attending this annual general debate of the General Assembly.We are here once again  as usual  to share experiences relating to leadership and to work for the sake of life  humanity  equality and social justice. But we are also here to express our profound differences as concerns life  peace and democracy. Over the past few days I have been listening to the statements made by certain Powers  which leave a lot to be desired in terms of liberty  equality  dignity and sovereignty.Thanks to the awareness of the Bolivian people  I have now held the presidency for almost eight years. In that time — despite the economic and financial crises in some so-called developed  industrialized and  I would even say  even exaggeratedly industrialized countries  because some Powers industrialize simply to put an end to life — we in Bolivia have an economic growth rate of 4.8 per cent  on average. Previously it was just over 2 per cent under the economic policies of the free market and neoliberalism. This year the economic growth rate is estimated at 6 per cent  at least  so we are doing well. I would like to point out that thanks to that economic growth  in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) we have reduced poverty; we have met the MDG of reducing poverty and extreme poverty. United Nations data for 2011 indicates that that year 1 million Bolivian men and women entered the middle class. Bolivia has 10 million inhabitants  so that means that 10 per cent of Bolivia’s inhabitants improved their economic status. The rate of undernutrition for children under the age of 5 has decreased even more than required by the related Millennium Development Goal. The literacy-rate goal for people between 15 and 24 years of age was met  and UNESCO declared Bolivia a country free of illiteracy thanks to the cooperation of Cuba and Venezuela  which have been working with us since 2006-2007.The Goal on coverage in terms of maternal health has been reached  and maternal and child mortality has decreased. Thanks to that economic growth we have been able to create vouchers for pregnant women and for children under 2 years of age  which has made possible a decrease in maternal and child mortality. Coverage in terms of potable water has increased. For example  we created a programme entitled “My water (more investment for water)”. I must thank the Andean Development Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank for their contributions. With their funding we put together “My water” I and II  and we are now on the third programme  with $300 000 per municipality in rural areas. That has made it possible for us to provide some municipalities with 100 per cent coverage in terms of potable water.I have just come from a major event in the department of Santa Cruz  where I visited several municipalities. In two of them  the mayors — who are not from the party in power but from other parties — told me that “My water” III will result in 100 per cent of the local population having drinking water. We have made advances in that area. Investment in water is a blessing for life. It means minimizing disease  because potable water helps people avoid contracting diseases. I would like all here to know that we have been able to achieve this thanks to a State that lives in conditions of sovereignty and dignity. Why am I saying this? Because previously  politically we were subject to the American empire. The embassies of the United States decided who would be minister. Economically  we were subject to the International Monetary Fund. From the time we arrived  we have said “Enough!” to submitting to international organizations and to the United States embassy. Previously  for any loan  the International Monetary Fund set conditionalities  blackmailing the various Governments. Those conditionalities involved our giving up our natural resources to transnational companies  so that Bolivia would privatize basic services. But basic services are a human right and cannot be private property. So when we freed ourselves politically and economically  we started to do better.One of the policies we adopted was to nationalize hydrocarbons — gas and oil. I want the Assembly to know  just to share a small experience  that previously State contracts with transnational oil companies stated that the bearer acquired the right to the land at the mouth of the well. When union leaders asked Governments why the gas and oil were not the property of Bolivians  they told us that as long as they were underground they belonged to the Bolivians  but once they were out of the ground that was no longer the case. They invented this title business for the land at the mouth of the well. In addition  82 per cent of the benefits went to transnationals  especially in mega-oilfields  and 18 per cent to Bolivians. It was looting  it was theft. But since we nationalized hydrocarbons  I must say that we have really begun to improve the economic situation and the social conditions in our country. Just one example: oil income in 2005  before I was President  was $300 million. This year  thanks to nationalization and the fight waged by social movements  oil sales will total more than $5 billion. Last year we almost reached $5 billion. That figure continues to grow with new investments  and today we have reached the stage of giving added value to those natural resources.As the Assembly is aware  I am not an expert in politics or in economic matters. But I am here at the request of the Bolivian people  learning daily about the needs  problems and demands of my people  the people of Bolivia.I would therefore also like to say that this joint work with the social movements  which are the organized representatives of the people  is going well. I would like the United Nations and the Secretary-General to know that we have issued a directive and are working on the patriotic agenda for 2025. What exactly is that agenda about? As Bolivia was founded in 1825  the year 2025 will be our bicentennial as a republic  while we are now a plurinational State. We are working with all social movements and authorities  be they local mayors or provincial Governments  to establish a medium- and long-term plan that will make it possible to guarantee a future for the generations to come.Besides local issues  there are also pending regional issues  such as the one between Bolivia and Chile on sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. An invasion began on 14 February 1879  which on 23 March of the same year gave rise to a limited resistance. Who invaded us? It was the Chilean oligarchy of the time  along with British companies. We lost our access to the sea  and many meetings have been subsequently held on the issue. An unfair treaty was imposed on us  and it was not observed. I want the Assembly to be aware of the following. In a number of meetings with former Presidents and with the latest brotherly President of Chile  we have tried to reach an understanding. However  there has never been an official proposal to resolve the issue of the Bolivian people’s irrevocable right to return to the Pacific with sovereignty. What did the President of Chile say in September 2010 when he addressed the General Assembly here in New York (see A/65/PV.12)? He said that treaties were inviolable and they must not be touched. On 28 January 2013  during the summit of the Community of Latin America and the Caribbean States (CELAC) in Santiago  President Piñera Echeñique said that of course treaties could be perfected. First  he said they were untouchable  and then he said they could be perfected. That shows that this issue is on his mind and that it needs to be resolved. On 17 December 2012  Piñera Echeñique publicly stated that Chile would ensure respect not only for the treaties it had signed  but also its sovereignty  with all the strength in the world. But in January at the CELAC summit President Piñera Echeñique said that sovereignty could not be touched unless economic interests were at stake. On 22 September 2011  at the General Assembly President Piñera Echeñique said that there were no ongoing territorial issues between Chile and Bolivia (see A/66/PV.15). However  on 2 February 2013  in an interview with La Tercera  a Chilean newspaper  he recognized the following: Chile has offered Bolivia autonomy in a territorial enclave. In other words  he is trying to resolve the issue. But that proposal has never been made official. There is a fourth contradiction. On 11 November 2012  at the Ibero-American Summit held in Cadiz  Spain  the President of Chile said that Chile would demand that a valid treaty that was still in force — the treaty of 1904 — be respected  and that any conversation about the matter must be bilateral in nature: it did not belong in a multilateral forum such as that in which we are participating today. What did the President of Chile say on 2 February 2013? He said that the possibility of a gateway to the sea without sovereignty  north of Arica  will come to an end if Peru won at The Hague. Another contradiction: in June 2013  President Sebastián Piñera Echeñique said that Chile had the right to defend its territory  sea and sovereignty with strength and conviction and that Chile was a country that would never bend in the legitimate defence of its territory. In June  he said that Chile would not cede to the Bolivian position while President Morales continued to belittle him. On 7 September 2013  he said that  naturally  they would respect the ruling from The Hague. When it came to the ruling from The Hague  they were a country that respected rulings. I simply wanted to state that to avoid conflict. Since its foundation as a plurinational State  Bolivia has been by nature a peaceful State. With all due respect  I would like to inform members that we have turned to international courts. We have requested the International Court of Justice to declare that the Republic of Chile has an obligation to effectively negotiate  in a timely fashion and in good faith  sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean in order to re-establish Bolivia’s past  present and future rights to the sea. I want members to be aware that this request cannot and should not be interpreted as an act of hostility. On the contrary  it is a demonstration of Bolivia’s respect and confidence in the mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Members cannot imagine how much damage we have suffered  economically and geographically  or the damage that has been done to the people of Bolivia and to our past and future generations  by the 1879 invasion. Our grandparents continue to ask us when we are going to go back to the sea  because Bolivia was born with an outlet to the Pacific Ocean. So that everyone is aware: we are seeking a peaceful solution to this dispute. We have heard the various statements made over the past few days. One cannot listen to every single one of them  but I want to say that  while we are working to eliminate extreme poverty  we  the Heads of State and Government  are also working for peace with social justice. Nevertheless  a handful of Powers promote wars  armed conflict and military intervention without respecting even international organizations. We have heard here statements about freedom  democracy  peace  justice and security. As peoples who have been the subject of interventions and have been exploited  marginalized and robbed of our natural resources by the empires of the time  we wonder what democracy  what peace and what social justice some Presidents who come here are talking about. We witness Presidents and their retinues blocking airspace and not providing guarantees of our attendance to this forum  for example. How can they speak of democracy  when the spy services of the United States violate human rights and the privacy and security of other States while using private companies? It turns out that they spy not only on democratic Governments  but even on their own allies  their own citizens and the United Nations itself. Well  fine  let them spy on us anti-imperialist Presidents and Governments. But spying on the United Nations? Spying on their allies? I feel that there is a great deal of overweening arrogance towards humankind.That is why we continue to speak out. Not only do they spy  they also hatch coups d’état. What peace can we speak of when military spending sacrifices the human rights of our peoples? I would like to ask the people of the United States: How is it possible  when there are so many people out of work  for their country’s Government and President to spend $700 billion on the military and espionage annually  when there are so many of our brothers in the United States who are homeless and jobless and without an education? One cannot understand how that country can spend so much money interfering with other countries while leaving its own unprovided for.They talk to us of human rights while torture is being carried out in the prisons of Guantánamo and on military bases in the Middle East  and while union and political leaders who do not share imperialist and capitalist views are also tortured. I would like to say to the United States that it must not believe it is master of the world. It is mistaken. Furthermore  it signs agreements yet refuses to sign some of the most important treaties in the world. It does not respect United Nations resolutions.The security of the empire and the fight against terrorism have become the biggest excuse and tool for unilateral military intervention. Terrorism cannot be combated through more military spending and interventions or the training of military forces. As far as I know  the way to fight terrorism is with social policies  not military bases; with religious tolerance  more democracy  more equality of justice and more education. What country is free from problems? Of course there are differences. The best thing to do is to provide means  even if not all our Governments have the same economic policies. Capitalism wants to emerge from its crisis through war and armed intervention. We must ask ourselves who benefits from the wars. Who distributes the natural resources after an intervention? Whose hands do they end up in  once countries are bombed? Who is really governing in the United States  I wonder? Is it its citizens  or the companies that promote wars? From outside  at least — I am not an ambassador living in the United States — what we see is that those who finance political and election campaigns are bankers and big businessmen  and they are the ones setting policy.Those who govern cannot be mistaken or confused about the conflict in Syria. Naturally  we are against the use of chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction. But who possesses the greatest nuclear arsenal? Who invented chemical weapons? Who industrialized those weapons that end human lives? In my region  at least  things are perfectly clear. We know whose hands they are in  where they come from and who produces them. Democracies do not wage war. What we are seeing is that those who make the decisions about wars are the arms industry  the financial system and oil companies. Plutocracy has become a substitute for democracy. The Government of the rich and powerful decides the fate of the world. We are facing a new moment in the imperial geopolitical disposition — and I do not wish to revisit how Latin America and the Caribbean  like Africa and the Middle East  were at one time carved up by various imperial Powers  who were interested not in resolving issues of poverty  democracy and equality but rather in those countries’ natural resources — and now  once again  those Powers wish to divide it all up through military intervention and with military bases.Another subject being debated is the colonization of space  as we have seen in recent years. Those who believe they are the masters of the world have told us that their power has no limits and that they can intervene wherever they feel like. Again  I wonder what the United Nations is for. What do we have treaties and conventions for? What use is multilateralism? Human multilateralism we welcome; inhuman interventionism will be combated by people all over the world. I believe that as a union leader and as someone from one of the most humiliated sectors in the history of Latin America  the indigenous peasant peoples.War is a business for capitalism. There can be no peace without justice; there can be no equality as long as the business of war has pride of place. It starts and wages wars for its businesses. That is why I believe it is important at this event to consider such issues in depth.Another instrument of domination is the fight against drug trafficking. But I have to say that despite the efforts of the Bolivian people and Government  there are certain Powers that do not shoulder their responsibilities in combating the traffic in drugs  because the drug market is in the capitalist countries. Since we got rid of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and launched our own national policy — and thanks to some of our neighbours  such as Argentina  Brazil and Chile  to which I am grateful for their joint efforts — we have seen improvements and a better way of fighting drug trafficking than the way imposed by the DEA and the United States. I welcome the fact that the United Nations has acknowledged the decrease in drug trafficking in Bolivia  but it has not been certified by the Government of the United States. Who should we believe  the United States or the United Nations? I leave it up to the Assembly.I have felt somewhat insecure when it comes to visiting the United Nations in New York  which is why we should think seriously about changing the location of the Headquarters of the Organization. The Headquarters of the United Nations should be in the territory of a State that has ratified all the treaties adopted by the United Nations. As the Assembly is aware  the Government has never ratified the treaties on human rights or the rights of Mother Earth. They do not guarantee us visas or overflights. I offer my solidarity with my friend Nicolás Maduro Moros  President of Venezuela. How can we be sure that a meeting of the United Nations here in New York is secure? Perhaps some of us do  but those of us who do not share the views of imperialism and capitalism feel completely insecure. I would just like to say  though not out of fear  that we should not be complicit in such an arrogant attitude to the peoples of the world. How can we genuinely believe in the United Nations if we do not respect resolutions — for example  those ending the economic blockade of Cuba. There are only two or three countries that do not vote to end it. Most of us welcome it and vote for the resolution every time. But if it is not implemented and not respected  then why are we here at the United Nations?Furthermore  I wish to inform the Assembly that everyone knows that the United States harbours terrorists  criminals and the corrupt. They escape from Bolivian justice and arrive here. The United States Government is not assisting in the fight against corruption. What kind of an agreement could we then have in the fight against corruption? Beyond that  the United States accuses the Governments of other countries. It accuses Cuba  of promoting terrorism. How can Cuba do that? Perhaps it is due to such accusations that only 60 or 70 Presidents  of the more than 190  have come here. I feel that such policies scare off Presidents. Who will come next year to vote  when resolutions are never respected? That reason  and many others  should encourage us to consider changing the Headquarters of the United Nations. I do not expect it to be Bolivia  or South America. There are countries that have ratified all of the human rights treaties. That is where the Headquarters of the United Nations should be located.There is blackmail when it comes to visas. I had to wait for a visa in order to come here  and then it was for only four  five or six days — no more. What good is such a visa? One has to watch the clock and when to leave  because the visa will be taken from us. We are being threatened  intimidated and blackmailed with visas.If the Assembly is here to seriously discuss the well-being of humankind  perhaps my country can share with some who are present here the idea of seriously considering establishing a tribunal of the peoples  including major international organizations that defend human rights  to begin an investigation of the Obama Government. I was surprised by the words of United States President Obama at the start of his term. It struck me when he stated  “I was elected to end wars”. Those were his words  found in newspapers  on radio and on television. I said to myself  this fraternal President of the United States originates from a family that suffered from discrimination like me. We are going to agree and we will put an end to war. I was deeply struck by that. Now we are seeing the exact opposite. Perhaps it is due to the Nobel Peace Prize. We congratulate him. In the end  however  it is a Nobel Peace Prize  rather than a Nobel war prize. What is the basis for a trial? It certainly includes crimes against humanity and the bombing of Libya. I would like to know who owned the oil in Libya beforehand? Who owns it now? Previously  at the least  the people of Libya benefited from that oil  but how is it being managed and used now? What happened in Iraq? I am convinced that behind any war or intervention  a plan is being devised on how to later seize the natural resources. That was our experience in Bolivia. However  we have recovered our natural resources democratically  without bullets but with votes  not with money but based on the awareness of the Bolivian people. As for prosecuting acts of international terrorism  the financing of terrorist groups and the arming of opposition forces — once I expelled the United States Ambassador to Bolivia  I had no regrets. We are better off now  politically and democratically. We are now ending our cooperation with the United States Agency for International Development  which had been plotting. We want and welcome cooperation  so long as it is unconditional and free of blackmail or preconditions involving Presidents or the privatization of natural resources and basic services. Imagine the damage inflicted on a country by an economic blockade. It is the best tool of genocide. Therefore  if we are truly responsible for the well-being of humankind  if we are responsible for truth  justice and peace  then we must organize to fight back so that no president — from South America  the Middle East or anywhere else in the world — will ever again cause harm to life or to humankind. Like previous debates here — on the financial  climate  economic and food crises — the Assembly is now addressing the issue of interventionism. As long as imperialism and capitalism exist  peace  justice  liberty  dignity and sovereignty for the people of the world will never be possible. I am convinced of that  because I have a little experience. We should therefore contemplate a world free of oligarchies  monarchies and hierarchies  and then consider the sort of human order we would want for the world.All of us possess sovereignty and dignity  whether we are small and backwards — “developing”  as they call us — or whatever our situation. What damages the political class? Sometimes it is arrogance  the abuse of power and corruption. As Presidents of Governments  it is our obligation to fight against such policies that cause so much harm to the political class. It is our obligation to change the politics. In my experience  politics is not about business or profits. It is about service  commitment and extending the greatest effort for one’s people. If anyone thinks that politics involves business or profit  they are wrong. Such President or Government will not go far. If a Government allows bankers  financiers or multinational corporations to govern  it is mistaken. A Government must be controlled by a President who has been democratically elected by the people  with the participation of society and for the well-being of the majority of the people. We welcome the fact that private property is respected. However  it is something else when economic policy and governing are considered in favour of the few  rather than of the many. With my little bit of experience  therefore  I call on all members to fight against the economic policies that cause great harm to humankind around the world. I reiterate that as long as imperialism and capitalism exist  the struggle will continue  the people will continue to rise up  but there will be no justice. Freeing ourselves from imperialism and capitalism will certainly ensure peace and social justice and dignity and sovereignty for our peoples."
"24",978,"BRA",68,2013,"I would first like to briefly express my pleasure at seeing the representative of Antigua and Barbuda  a country that is part of the Caribbean and is very dear to Brazil and our region  at the helm of the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly. You can count on the permanent support of my Government  Sir.Before I begin my statement  I would also like to voice the Brazilian Government’s and people’s repudiation of the recent terrorist attack in Nairobi  and to convey our condolences to and express our solidarity with the families of the victims and the people and the Government of Kenya. Wherever terrorism may occur and wherever it originates  we will always condemn it unequivocally and resolve firmly to deal with it. We will never compromise with barbarity.I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to an exceedingly important and serious matter. Recent revelations concerning the activities of a global network of electronic espionage have provoked indignation and disgust in public opinion worldwide. For Brazil the situation is particularly serious  since we have been a specific target of that intrusion. Citizens’ personal data has been indiscriminately targeted and intercepted. Business information  often of major economic and even strategic value  has been a focus of espionage activity. And communications of Brazilian diplomatic missions  including our Permanent Mission to the United Nations and the Office of the President of the Republic itself  have been subject to interception.Such meddling in the lives and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and as such is an affront to the principles that should govern relations between them  and between friendly nations in particular. A nation can never promote its own sovereignty in a way that damages the sovereignty of another. The right of one country’s citizens to security can never be ensured by violating the fundamental human and civil rights of those of another. It is even worse when private companies support such espionage activity. The argument that the illegal interception of information and data is allegedly intended to protect against terrorism is untenable.Brazil knows how to protect itself. We repudiate and fight terrorist groups; we do not give them shelter. We are a democratic country surrounded by democratic  peaceful countries that respect international law. We have lived in peace with our neighbours for more than 140 years. Like many other Latin Americans  I have fought arbitrary behaviour and censorship myself and therefore cannot possibly fail to uncompromisingly defend individuals’ right to privacy and the sovereignty of my country. Without the right to privacy there is no real freedom of speech and opinion and therefore no genuine democracy. Without respect for sovereignty there is no basis for normal relations among nations. What we have before us is a serious violation of human rights and civil liberties through the invasion and capture of confidential secret information pertaining to business activities and  above all  a case of disrespect for the national sovereignty of my country. We have registered our protest with the Government of the United States and we have demanded explanations  apologies and guarantees that such procedures will never be repeated.Friendly Governments and societies that seek to build a truly strategic partnership  as in our case  cannot possibly allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they constituted a normal  ordinary practice. They are unacceptable. Brazil will redouble its efforts to adopt legislation  technologies and mechanisms to protect us adequately from the illegal interception of communications and data. My Administration will do everything within its reach and powers to defend the human rights of all Brazilians and all the world’s citizens  as well as to protect the fruits of the ingenuity of Brazilian workers and companies.The problem  however  goes beyond the bilateral relationship of two countries. It affects the international community itself and demands a response from it. Information and telecommunication technologies cannot become the new battlefield among States. The time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war through espionage  sabotage and attacks against the systems and infrastructure of other countries. The United Nations must play a leading role in the effort to properly regulate the conduct of States with regard to those technologies. It should also consider the importance of the Internet and social networks as part of our efforts to build democracy worldwide.For that reason  Brazil will present proposals for the establishment of a multilateral civil framework for the governance and use of the Internet  as well as measures to guarantee the effective protection of the data and information that traverse it. We must establish multilateral mechanisms for the worldwide web that are capable of ensuring key principles. The first is freedom of expression  individual privacy and respect for human rights; secondly  multilateral  open democratic governance  conducted with transparency while stimulating collective creativity and the broad participation of civil society  Governments and the private sector; thirdly  the principle of universality  which ensures social and human development along with the construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory societies; fourthly  cultural diversity  without the imposition of beliefs  customs or values; and fifthly  the neutrality of the web  which must be governed only by technical and ethical criteria  rendering unacceptable any restriction of it for political  commercial  religious or any other purposes. Harnessing the full potential of the Internet therefore requires responsible regulation that will simultaneously guarantee the freedom of expression  security and respect for human rights.The choice of the post-2015 development agenda as the theme for this session of the General Assembly could not be more appropriate. The fight against poverty  hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our time. For that reason  Brazil has adopted a socially inclusive economic model based on generating employment  strengthening small-scale family agriculture  expanding credit  increasing the worth of salaries and developing a vast social protection network  particularly through our family stipend programme. In addition to those achievements  we have lifted 22 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty in only two years through out plan to free Brazil of extreme poverty. We have drastically reduced child mortality. A recent UNICEF report indicates that Brazil has achieved one of the most significant reductions in the child mortality in the world.Children are a top priority for Brazil. That is reflected in our commitment to education. We are the country that has most increased public investment in education  according to the latest Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report. We have also just approved legislation that earmarks 75 per cent of all petroleum revenue to education and 25 per cent to health services.In the debate on the post-2015 development agenda we must focus on the results of the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development as key drivers. The major step taken in Rio de Janeiro was to place poverty at the very centre of the sustainable development agenda. Poverty is not a problem exclusive to developing countries  and environmental protection is not a goal to achieve only after poverty is overcome. The meaning of the post-2015 agenda is the development of a world in which it is possible to grow  to include  to conserve and to protect. By promoting social mobility and overcoming extreme poverty  as we are doing  we have created an immense contingent of citizens with improved quality of life  increased access to information and greater awareness of their rights — citizens with new hopes  new desires and new demands.The demonstrations last June in Brazil were an inseparable part of our process of building democracy and of social change. My Administration did not repress them; on the contrary  it listened to and understood the voices from the streets. We listened and understood because we ourselves came from the streets. We ourselves came of age and developed through the great struggles of Brazil. The street is our ground  our base. The protesters did not ask for a return to the past. Rather  they asked for further progress towards a future of greater rights  more participation and more social gains.In Brazil  it was during this decade that we experienced the greatest reduction in social inequality in the past 50 years. It was during this decade that we created a system of social protection that has allowed us to nearly eradicate extreme poverty. We know all too well that democracy generates the desire for more democracy  that social inclusion creates demands for further social inclusion  and that quality of life awakens people’s yearning for even more quality of life. For us  all the progress achieved thus far is just a beginning. Our development strategy demands more  as desired by all Brazilians.It is not enough to listen. We must act. We must transform this extraordinary energy into achievements for everyone. I have therefore launched five major pacts: a pact against corruption and for political reform; a pact for urban mobility  geared towards the improvement of public transportation and urban reform; a pact for education  our great passport to the future  which will be supported by royalties from oil revenues and the petroleum social fund; a health pact that provides for doctors to assist Brazilians in the poorest and most remote regions of the country; and a fiscal responsibility pact  to guarantee the economic viability of this new stage in our history.Although the most acute phase of the crisis is behind us  the situation of the world economy remains fragile  with unacceptable levels of unemployment. According to statistics from the International Labor Organization  there are more than 200 million unemployed people throughout the world. That phenomenon affects populations of both developed and developing countries. This is the right time for us to strengthen the trends for growth in the world’s economy  which is showing signs of recovery. Emerging countries alone cannot ensure the resumption of global growth. More than ever before  it is necessary to engage in concerted action in order to reduce unemployment and re-establish momentum in international trade. We are all in the same boat.My country is restoring growth despite the impact of the international crisis of the past few years. We have relied on three key elements: first  a commitment towards sound macroeconomic policies; secondly  continuing and upholding successful social inclusion policies; and thirdly  the adoption of measures aimed at increasing our productivity  and therefore our international competitiveness. We are committed to stability and inflation-control  to improving the quality of public spending and to upholding proper fiscal performance. We reiterate our support for a reform of the International Monetary Fund. The governance of the Fund should reflect the weight of emerging and developing countries in the world economy. Delaying such adaptive reform will further reduce the Fund’s legitimacy and effectiveness.The year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit. As such  it will be an occasion for us to carry out the urgent reform that we have been calling for since that first summit. We must avoid a collective defeat of coming to 2015 without a Security Council capable of fully exercising its responsibilities in today’s world. The limited representation in the Security Council  in view of the new challenges of the twenty-first century  is a source of grave concern. Examples of that concern include the huge difficulty in providing a solution for the ongoing Syrian conflict and the state of paralysis in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian question. The recurrent polarization among permanent members on important issues has led to a dangerous inaction. The Council must be urgently endowed with voices that are both independent and constructive. Only by expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council and by including developing countries in both categories will it be possible to solve and overcome the current representativeness and legitimacy deficits from which the Council suffers.The general debate provides us with an opportunity to reiterate the fundamental principles that guide my country’s foreign policy and inform our stance on pressing issues on today’s international agenda. We guide ourselves and our actions through a defence of a multilateral world governed by international law  where the peaceful solution of conflicts holds sway and where the pursuit of a fair and solidarity-based order prevails both economically and socially.The crisis in Syria has caused unrest and breeds a sense of anger. Two and a half years of lives lost and destruction have caused the greatest humanitarian disaster of the century.Brazil’s population of Syrian descent is an important component of our nationality identity  Our country is thus deeply involved with the plight of the Syrian people. It is necessary to prevent the killing of innocent people — women  children and the elderly — and to silence weapons  whether they be conventional or chemical or whether they be used by the Government or by the rebels. There is no military way out. The only solution is through negotiation  dialogue and understanding.Syria’s decision to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention and enforce it immediately was an important development. As such  the measure is decisive for overcoming the conflict and helps build a world free of chemical weapons. I would like to stress that the use of such weapons is heinous and unacceptable under any circumstances. We therefore support the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. It is incumbent upon the Syrian Government to fulfil the agreement in its entirety and do so in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation. Under all circumstances and in any case  we repudiate unilateral interventions in violation of international law and without authorization by the Security Council. Unilateral intervention would only further worsen the lack of political stability in the region and would increase human suffering. Likewise  lasting peace between Israel and Palestine has taken on a new and pressing dimension given the sweeping changes that the Middle East is currently undergoing. The time has come to meet the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for an independent and sovereign State. The time has also come for us to bring about a broad international consensus for a two-State solution. The current talks between Israelis and Palestinians should yield practical and significant results in favour of an agreement.The history of the twentieth century shows that abandoning the multilateral system is a prelude to war  with the ensuing trail of human destitution and devastation. The history of the twentieth century also shows that promoting the multilateral system bears fruit on the ethical  political and institutional fronts. May I therefore renew an appeal for a broad  vigorous convergence of political will that will uphold and reinvigorate the multilateral system  of which the United Nations is the main pillar.When the United Nations was founded  the peoples of the world rallied around the hope that humankind would be able to overcome the wounds of the Second World War and the hope that  yes  it would be possible to build  from the rubble of destruction and massacre  a new world of liberty  solidarity and prosperity. We all have the responsibility not to let such a generous and fruitful hope die. "
"25",1022,"BRB",68,2013,"It is my distinct honour and pleasure to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government  at their thirty-fourth meeting in July  pledged their support for your presidency. Allow me therefore to assure you of my delegation’s support throughout the current session of the General Assembly. Let me also commend your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for ably guiding the work of the General Assembly during its sixty-seventh session.You have assumed leadership of the General Assembly at a very pivotal moment in the United Nations timetable. The expiration deadline for the Millennium Development Goals is near  and our efforts to elaborate an agenda for the post-2015 period are intensifying. Following the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  modifications have been made to the institutional framework for sustainable development. An agreement has been reached on the establishment of the High-level Political Forum and the United Nations Environment Assembly. The deliberations on the reform of the Economic and Social Council have been completed. It is envisaged that the deliberations of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and the intergovernmental committee of experts on sustainable development financing will accelerate in the next few months. The international community continues to chart a course in the pursuit of global sustainable development.The theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  will require us to engage in what might best be described as a retrospective and prospective dialogue. Much has been said about the current global financial and economic crisis  which has been made worse by the many manifestations of the impact of climate change — extreme weather events  food crises and volatile food crises — compounded by unprecedented levels of terror and violence. At the same time  we have seen a global determination to tackle these issues.Barbados recognizes that the stability  health and productivity of the global environment  particularly coastal and marine resources  are fundamental to the survival of Barbados  CARICOM and other small island developing States (SIDS). We therefore deem it imperative that countries like ours maintain active involvement in shaping the global development policy agenda. It is recognized  however  that SIDS are constrained in their ability and capacity to craft independent solutions. One major barrier is our debt situation.The issue of debt sustainability is of particular relevance to SIDS. In highlighting its importance  the Prime Minister of Barbados  in his feature address to the recently concluded interregional preparatory meeting for the Third International Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  noted:“Debt sustainability is a critical issue not only for Barbados  but for many of the SIDS... We must therefore use the opportunity provided by the Third International Conference on SIDS to both find and share solutions to this challenge  as it is a major constraint to SIDS achieving sustainable development.“In this context  it is imperative that  before we meet in Samoa  an opportunity be provided to fully ventilate this matter. In this regard  the relevant entity of the United Nations responsible for coordinating SIDS issues may want to consider convening a meeting of the Finance and Economic Ministers of SIDS to discuss this issue and to put forward specific recommendations to be considered as part of the outcome of the Third International meeting on SIDS.”I repeat that call on this body and commend it to the relevant entity of the United Nations system to act expeditiously on this proposal.Another issue of concern to Barbados relates to the international financial-services sector. We believe that the sustainability of our development is being stymied by efforts to undermine this very important sector  which continues to provide a stable and substantial contribution to our gross domestic product. Barbados therefore associates itself with the comments of the Right Honourable Perry Christie  Prime Minister of the Bahamas  in his address to the General Assembly (see A/68/PV.19). We are a well-regulated jurisdiction which has sought at all times to comply with international rules and best practice  and it is our intention to operate within the established international norms that have guided this sector to date.In 1994  Barbados was honoured to host the first United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. At that time  we were optimistic that the international community’s recognition of the inherent vulnerabilities of small States would lead to real progress in the development of SIDS. However  the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy in 2010 revealed that“[s]mall island developing States have made less progress than most other groupings  or even regressed  in economic terms  especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability” (resolution 65/2  para. 5).Despite this  Barbados remains committed to the process to advance the sustainable development of SIDS.As you are aware  Mr. President  Barbados attaches great importance to sustainable development in all its dimensions. We believe that the theme for this year’s session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is thus both timely and important. Such an agenda must recognize the importance of addressing the very specific needs of the Members of the United Nations. I speak therefore from the perspective of SIDS.Barbados believes that the post-2015 development agenda should involve commitments to the eradication of poverty and hunger; environmental sustainability  with a strong emphasis on coastal and marine resources; the development of sustainable and accessible renewable energy technologies; the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture agenda  in tandem with food and nutrition security; gender equality and women’s empowerment; and youth development  education and employment.We also call for emphasis on the inclusion of vulnerable groups  including persons with disabilities; the requisite means of implementation  including capacity-building  technology transfer  trade and technical cooperation; the integration of appropriate systems for accountability  monitoring  evaluation and reporting; and good governance  respect for human rights  and the rule of law.This is not a mere shopping list. It reflects the understanding that all these issues are inextricably linked. They represent challenges or problems that must be tackled simultaneously  if we are to achieve sustainable development. These cannot be addressed in a silo-like manner.The importance of a policy of sustainable development can therefore not be understated. It is a matter of survival. It is for this reason that the Government of Barbados has envisioned the building of a green economy as its strategy for advancing its sustainable development. As Prime Minister Freundel Stuart indicated in the foreword to the Green Economy: Scoping Study Synthesis Report on Barbados “the Green Economy debate recognizes our structural vulnerabilities  offers a model to assist us in further realizing our sustainable development aspirations  and creates the institutional platform that would enable us to participate in innovative partnerships in the fight to save our planet  against mounting unsustainable consumption and production patterns”.Our situation as a special case for development holds as true today as it did more than 20 years ago  when the United Nations system first acknowledged our vulnerabilities and our special link to ocean resources. In the case of Barbados  we are of the opinion that a green economy is inextricably linked to our development and as such should not be lost in this very important discussion.Over the past several months  increasing attention has been focused on the preparatory process for the Third International Conference on the Sustainable Development of SIDS  to be held in Samoa in 2014. Three regional preparatory meetings in the various SIDS regions were convened in July. Members may recall that the interregional meeting was held in my country  Barbados  the birthplace of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States — the Barbados Programme of Action.Barbados attaches great importance to the preparatory process for the Samoa Conference. As we take stock after almost 20 years of the implementation of the Programme of Action and 10 years of the Mauritius Strategy for its further implementation  we wish to emphasize that this process is an integral part of the overall post-2015 development agenda. This preparatory process can strengthen the collective action of SIDS in addressing their vulnerabilities and special development challenges. Prime Minister Stuart of Barbados referred to this recently as building SIDS collectivity.The support of the international community must underpin this concept of SIDS collectivity by strengthening interregional and intraregional collaboration between SIDS and the various SIDS regions  and increasing emphasis on institution-building  including the establishment of an appropriate institutional mechanism to facilitate  in particular  intraregional collaboration among SIDS.Credence is given to this approach by the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability  whose report (see A/66/700) stressed that the building of effective institutional governance at the local  national  regional and global levels is essential for achieving sustainable development  facilitating greater utilization of science and technology to help address many of the issues being faced by our young people in strengthening the interface between youth talent  innovation and entrepreneurship  and speaking with one voice at the international level on issues impacting SIDS sustainable development.Barbados believes firmly that South-South and triangular cooperation must be part of any effort to reform the existing international development cooperation architecture and to build more inclusive global partnerships for effective development cooperation. We possess a wealth of experience in areas that we can share with developing and middle-income countries  including education and training  health care  social partnering  clean -nergy policies and technologies  environmental protection  including coastal conservation  and the provision of social safety nets.Like other SIDS  however  we are constrained by limited financial resources and the persistent and prolonged global financial crisis  which continue to have a negative impact on resource mobilization and financial flows to developing countries. Barbados supports the observation made by the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation  that there is a need to give the global South the incentive to invest more in multilateral forms of South-South cooperation. We therefore welcome the formation of partnerships with the private sector  international organizations  donors and civil society organizations specifically designed to better facilitate such South-South cooperation.There is a clear need for greater equity  fairness and transparency in the method employed to determine socioeconomic classifications and resource allocation. The persistent use of arbitrarily determined international classification and ratings systems that are based on gross domestic product per capita and other narrow criteria must be expanded in scope to take into account meaningful variables such as vulnerability.In this context  we refer again to the observation by the Secretary-General that gross domestic product per capita on its own is an inadequate indicator. We also applaud the useful research being conducted on vulnerability indices and other measures beyond gross domestic product by bodies such as the Commonwealth  the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  and the United Nations Statistical Commission. Barbados will continue its advocacy on this issue.Barbados is not unique. Like other SIDS  we recognize that our efforts to achieve sustainable development must of necessity incorporate delivery modalities encompassing finance  good governance  development cooperation  trade capacity-building and institutional strengthening. Barbados therefore reminds this body that we must foster strong partnerships if we are to craft effective and truly lasting global solutions.We call on Member States to revisit the Small Island Developing States Technical Assistance Programme as a means of enabling the transfer of skills  knowledge and experience across SIDS and the three SIDS regions. We hold the view that the Programme offers much potential for enhancing capacity and access to SIDS-grown technologies and skill sets. The Technical Assistance Programme must be seen as an important mechanism for advancing the post-2015 development agenda.The provision of free health care for Barbadian citizens has been a critical contributor to the high level of human development in Barbados. The treatment and prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases  however  account for a disproportionately large percentage of our national budget. That has entailed the diversion of scarce resources that should have been devoted to achieving other development goals. Chronic non-communicable diseases constitute one of the major challenges to the sustainable development of Barbados  effectively threatening the development gains that Barbados has made.Our strong commitment to preventing and combating chronic non-communicable diseases is reflected in strong multi-stakeholder partnerships  including the dedicated engagement of civil society. Despite the national prioritization of non-communicable diseases  the focus on prevention  and the implementation of evidence-based programmes  a developing country like Barbados cannot  on its own  achieve its national objectives. International cooperation and assistance in this area are critical.My country does not draw a dividing line between its domestic and foreign policies. We have been blessed with stable Governments. We have enjoyed a tradition of constitutional change in our Governments since independence. As a nation  we have striven to create a just society. We see an inextricable link between development and international peace and security. Without development  there can be no international peace and security  and without international peace and security the development agenda will not succeed.For Barbados  therefore  the rule of law at the national and international levels is an indispensable condition for sustainable development. Barbados is deeply concerned by the number of national regional and international conflicts raging throughout the world. We are yet more concerned that the threshold of what constitutes an acceptable level of violence and acceptable levels of atrocity grows higher and higher. The findings of the United Nations inspection team that chemical weapons were used in Syria are alarming. My country believes that the perpetrators of these acts must be brought to account. Moreover  we believe that the international community must work in good faith to find a political solution to the escalating and ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria.At the same time  the international community must not lose sight of the many conflicts and acts of terror that continue throughout the world. Against this background my delegation wishes to extend profound condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya on the recent terrorist attacks that were perpetrated against the people of that country. As we have stated  there can be no justification for acts of terror.In Barbados and the Caribbean  illicit small arms and light weapons are the weapons of mass destruction. Primarily linked to international drug trafficking and other transnational organized crime  the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons in the Caribbean exacts a heavy toll on State and citizen security and impairs national development. For that reason  Barbados and CARICOM consistently argued for the elaboration of a robust  legally binding Arms Trade Treaty  which would set the highest common international standards for regulating the transfer of conventional arms. Barbados is pleased  therefore  to be among those Member States that have signed the Arms Trade Treaty. It is our hope that the implementation of the Treaty will lead to a reduction in the flow of illicit small arms  light weapons and their ammunition  parts and components  thus contributing to a reduction in armed conflict and violence.Our first Prime Minister  now a national hero  the Right Excellent Errol Walton Barrow  in his maiden speech to this body on 9 December 1966  stated:“We have no quarrels to pursue and we particularly insist that we do not regard any Member State as our natural opponent... We will not regard any great Power as necessarily right in a given dispute unless we are convinced of this  yet at the same time  we will not view the great Powers with perennial suspicion.” (A/PV.1487  para. 78)The United Nations was established in the aftermath of the Second World War to promote international peace and security. We call on the Security Council to meet its obligations to the international community. It is clear that there cannot be business as usual while humanitarian crises continue to emerge and countless lives continue to be lost. My delegation therefore remains concerned about the economic embargo that continues to be imposed on Cuba  as well as the extraterritorial impact that it continues to have on countries inside and outside our region. We call for the ending of the embargo and trust that it will soon be ushered into the pages of history.My delegation looks forward to the further unfolding of the post-2015 development agenda during this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  and I wish you  Sir  every success as you guide the General Assembly in realizing an agenda that is inclusive and one that will redound to the benefit of all."
"26",1054,"BRN",68,2013,"On behalf of His Majesty the Sultan and the people of Brunei Darussalam  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We thank our former President  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his efforts and contributions over the past year.Let me begin by expressing our sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya and to the families of the victims of the terrorist attack. Such an act deserves our condemnation. Our deepest sympathies also go to those affected by the recent earthquake in Pakistan. Thirteen years ago before the Assembly  our leaders made a promise to our peoples to fulfil their hopes and expectations for a better life. This is why we see the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a highly important global partnership. It has shown us that progress can be made if we work together locally  regionally and internationally. I would therefore like to place on record our expression of appreciation to our Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the support and commitment provided by the United Nations to realize that historic initiative.We are now approaching the end of the 15-year period. Like many other nations  Brunei Darussalam has been able to learn much from its experiences in implementing the MDGs. We understand the high expectations for all to do well. However  we need to consider the problems that some Member States are struggling with. Those include limitations to natural resources  political conflict  socioeconomic problems and natural disasters. That is why this year’s theme is so appropriate. It is focused on setting the stage. For us in Brunei Darussalam  it means having a national vision — Brunei Vision 2035 — that clearly provides direction towards attaining a dynamic and sustainable economy in the interests of our people.In line with the Vision  we place great emphasis on helping our younger generation realize their hopes. We have done this by providing quality education  encouraging innovation and creating better job opportunities. We also do what we can to assist fellow developing countries  either bilaterally or in partnership with other countries and international organizations  in human resource development  offering scholarships to study in Brunei Darussalam and training under community outreach programmes within the region. We hope that the people-to-people approach will promote cultural exchanges and understanding.At the same time  our regional work has been strongly influenced by other Member States’ efforts to achieve the MDGs. Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  we have an agreed plan to achieve an ASEAN community by 2015. Brunei Darussalam  as this year’s ASEAN Chairman  has chosen the theme “Our people  our future together”. It signifies our people’s role in ASEAN’s community-building efforts. In addition  we have also encouraged our member States to start working on an ASEAN plan beyond 2015  to further strengthen our mission in promoting peace  stability and prosperity. We will also continue to work together to strategically position ASEAN in the wider region and the world at large. In that regard  we are pleased that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has accepted our invitation to come to Brunei Darussalam for the fifth ASEAN-United Nations Summit. We look forward to sharing our views and experiences with him  and hope that will strengthen cooperation between our Association and the United Nations.We are also encouraged by the recommendations put forward in the recent report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Agenda on how we can better assist our people in their daily lives by providing food security and quality education and eradicating extreme poverty. Overall  the MDGs have offered us many lessons indeed  and now it is time for all of us to move forward. Regardless of the statistics of who has achieved the goals and who has not  we feel that much has been attained through the very concept of the MDGs. The Goals have opened up opportunities to every Member to develop in its own way and to involve its people in that development  even beyond 2015. Unfortunately  the options open to some people are severely limited. That is so when the basic  fundamental right of self-determination has been denied. We refer particularly to the people of Palestine  whom we believe can attest to that. Their legitimate struggle for a homeland of their own remains unresolved. Hence  we support the calls of the international community for intensified efforts towards realizing this basic right  which we take for granted today.The date of 29 November 2012 was indeed a memorable day in the history of Palestine  when it was accorded observer State status in the United Nations (see A/67/PV.44). I would like once again to express our support for Palestine’s full membership and for its people’s legitimate struggle to exercise their right to their own independent and sovereign State.The worsening situation in Syria continues to be of serious concern. We join the international community in condemning the use of chemical weapons  which has caused the loss of lives in that country. More importantly  we support all efforts  particularly those of the United Nations  to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. In that regard  we welcome the United States-Russia framework agreement for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons and the recent adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria.Before I conclude  we would like to thank the Secretary-General and all his staff  as well as the United Nations Volunteers  for their hard work. We highly respect the peacekeepers for the sacrifices they have made in the maintenance of international peace and stability. We hope that our efforts within various United Nations agencies and bodies will lead us to the future that we all want."
"27",1095,"BTN",68,2013,"I bring to you  Mr. President  and through you to all representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Allow me also to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure you of my delegation’s full support and cooperation as you steer the important work of this session.I am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to address the Assembly for the first time. I do so owing to the mandate accorded by the people of Bhutan to the People’s Democratic Party at the second parliamentary elections held this summer.The second parliamentary elections were yet another milestone on the path of democracy that Bhutan chose to undertake five years ago. In 2008 there were two political parties  whereas four parties contested this year’s elections. The people of Bhutan voted for change and ushered in a new Government. These  I believe  are signs of a vibrant democracy enabling the people of Bhutan to exercise their will through the ballot box.We know that democracy needs to go beyond elections. We will therefore continually work to strengthen democratic institutions  the rule of law  an independent judiciary  a vibrant civil society  an open and free media and  above all  a democratic culture that enables people to voice their aspirations and to live with dignity  equality and prosperity. As we embark on a new phase in our relatively young democracy  we do so in full confidence that democracy in Bhutan is irreversible and on a firm footing. In this journey  we count on the support of our friends and the international community.We meet at a time of extraordinary changes. While some have been able to achieve tremendous economic growth and prosperity  millions of people continue to languish in the inhuman depths of poverty. Our relentless drive for economic growth has come at the cost of our environment. The climate is changing. Natural disasters hit us with increasing frequency and intensity. The natural question then is  how do we advance economic growth  promote societal progress and prosperity within the confines of nature? How do we lift the millions of people out of the vicious circle of poverty? How can we ensure that we leave a planet safe and secure for our children and grandchildren?These  I believe  are the key questions that confront us all. Although we come from different parts of the globe  with our unique historical backgrounds and cultural experiences  we are bound by our shared future. In today’s interconnected and globalized world  we can prevail only if we come together as global citizens and work to find solutions for the sake of our common future. In this endeavour  Mr. President  as you have rightly stated  failure is not an option.My delegation welcomes the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” for this general debate. The question of the post-2015 development agenda is important  especially for the least developed and landlocked countries  which in many respects have the most at stake. It presents the opportunity for all countries to share their experiences and the kind of development agenda that they would like to see in the post-2015 era.As we set the stage for a development agenda beyond 2015  the Millennium Declaration (resolution 52/2) provides a strong foundation. In our search for a new development agenda we must not forget the important principles set out in the Declaration  but must emphasize their continued relevance. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) inspired nations and a whole generation to improve the lives of many people by creating synergies between nations and among people. All efforts must be made to accelerate the realization of the MDGs during their last mile.The outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex) also outlined important principles on which the post-2015 development agenda should be built. These principles must guide our efforts to come up with a holistic and transformative development agenda that puts people at the centre of development and brings about shared prosperity and happiness to all. Within this broader vision  poverty eradication must form a central theme of the post-2015 agenda. For Bhutan  the alleviation of poverty remains a challenge and features as a key priority in the current eleventh five-year development plan.Equally important is the need to bring about inclusive development  which is one of the priority objectives of the Royal Government of Bhutan. Targeted interventions are being planned to promote the livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Bhutan.The empowerment of women should constitute one of the main building blocks of the post-2015 development agenda. Any development agenda will fall short if it does not include the empowerment of women as a key component.Issues related to youth and to providing gainful employment to a growing population is one of the critical challenges that my country continues to face. It is therefore vitally important that the post-2015 development agenda address the issues of youth  as they are the key stakeholders of that era.I cannot overemphasize the importance of a strong means of implementation in the post-2015 development agenda. Without it  the capacity of developing and least developed countries to realize the post-2015 development priorities will remain severely challenged. At the intergovernmental level  Bhutan will continue its close engagement in the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  on which it is pleased to serve as a member. We look forward to contributing to the intergovernmental negotiations towards the elaboration of a single post-2015 development agenda.The subject of development inevitably leads me to refer to my country’s experience  in which it is guided by the development philosophy of Gross National Happiness  a vision that has given character to my country. Happiness and development have come to mean many things  and there are indeed many experts and a rich body of literature on the subject. This body also adopted resolution 65/309  on happiness  at its sixty-fifth session  and resolution 66/281 proclaiming 20 March as the International Day of Happiness  at its sixty-sixth session.Happiness as a development policy must relate to individuals as well as to Governments. It is the sacred responsibility of Governments to ensure that conditions are created for its citizens to pursue their individual happiness within the larger aspirations of the country. All our achievements  including the peaceful transition to a democracy in 2008  as well as the progress realized in achieving the Millennium Development Goals  have been as a result of embarking on a people-centred development approach.Encouraged by our positive national experience  Bhutan has facilitated efforts to elaborate a holistic approach to development. We intend to share the findings with Member States and the wider international community at an appropriate time. We hope that this modest contribution will serve as a useful input to the ongoing discussions on the post-2015 development agenda.While Bhutan has made significant socioeconomic progress  we face many challenges and vulnerabilities  being both a landlocked and a least developed country. Our economy remains import-driven and dependent on a single export commodity. Poverty  youth unemployment  natural disasters and vulnerability to adverse impacts of climate change  including glacial lake outburst floods  pose challenges. We will therefore continue to count on external support and assistance as we work towards achieving our long-cherished goal of self-reliance and graduation from the least developed country category.We recognize that a vibrant democracy should be built on a strong economy  which is essential to bring about improvement in the lives of the people. Therefore  in the eleventh Five-Year Development Plan  the main thrust will be to promote prosperity for all through inclusive social development  accelerated green economic development and infrastructure development.The United Nations  with its global scope and mandate  remains the only universal organization that can forge a global coordinated response to the pressing challenges in areas ranging from peace and security to development. The challenges of our times are  however  testing the United Nations and the resolve of its Member States to work together. Every effort must be made to strengthen the role and efficacy of a United Nations that is just  democratic and representative and allows space for its Members  including the smallest  to participate fully in its work. That is the key to the legitimacy of an effective multilateral system.We remain hopeful that under your able leadership  Sir  the sixty-eighth session will further advance work on the reform of the United Nations. The General Assembly must be revitalized and its role strengthened. The membership of the Security Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories must be expanded to bring it into line with contemporary realities and to make the Council a more representative body.These are challenging times indeed. It falls upon us to seek the wisdom of those who created this great institution to work together in the spirit of international cooperation in solving international problems. We have the opportunity not only to strengthen the role of the United Nations and advance multilateralism  but also to define a holistic development agenda that will respond to the universal aspiration for happiness."
"28",1136,"BWA",68,2013,"Allow me  on behalf of the Botswana delegation  to join previous speakers in congratulating President Ashe most sincerely on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly. His election demonstrates the confidence and high esteem in which he personally and his great country  Antigua and Barbuda  are held by the States Members of the Organization. We particularly admire his deep passion and proven record of leadership here at the United Nations on issues of sustainable development and climate change. We are therefore confident that the vast knowledge and experience of multilateral diplomacy which he brings to this position will contribute significantly to the success of this session. May I also congratulate his predecessor  Vuk Jeremi.  for his effective guidance and sterling leadership of the sixty-seventh session.My delegation fully endorses the theme he has proposed for this session  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  including overcoming poverty and insecurity as well as ensuring the achievement of the sustainable development goals.This is quite relevant and fitting given the fact that the international community is on the brink of two major interrelated developments in the global arena: the imminent target date of 2015 for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the evolution of the sustainable development goals  which will constitute a significant part of the post-2015 development agenda. We therefore pledge our full support and cooperation to President Ashe in his efforts to usher in a new development paradigm.There is no doubt that the challenges of extreme poverty  disease  lack of access to affordable energy  potable water and sanitation  climate change and gender inequality will continue to haunt millions of our people  especially in developing countries.It is on account of this that my delegation is of the strong view that the formulation of the sustainable development goals should be predicated on the outcome of the current review of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. To that end  we believe that the sustainable development Goals should complement the Millennium Development Goals rather than replace them wholesale.Botswana has made impressive achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  and we have mainstreamed them into our national development planning process. A substantial portion of our national budget is allocated to health  education  infrastructure  human resource development and the empowerment of women and young people.I am proud to report that we have achieved universal primary education  as well as universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment  care and support services. We have drastically reduced the mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. We are working tirelessly towards achieving zero new infections and zero HIV/AIDS-related deaths by 2015.We reaffirm our commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Central to our efforts is the commitment to ensuring respect for human rights and expanding access to prevention  treatment and care support services for affected populations  including those most at risk. In addition  we remain committed to providing a good quality of life for all of Botswana. In that regard  we give the utmost priority to the implementation of poverty eradication programmes  with particular focus on vulnerable communities and vulnerable groups  such as women  youth  the elderly and persons with disabilities.Despite all of the achievements we have made to date  serious challenges remain. Permit me to briefly address the vexing subject of climate change and the situation of countries in special categories  including middle-income countries. Botswana is among the sub-Saharan African countries that suffer the most from the adverse impact of climate change. Some of the notable manifestations of climate change are extreme temperatures  water shortages  land degradation  desertification and persistent drought. Climate change also has adverse impacts on health and food security.While it is gratifying that progress continues to be made in many countries in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  my delegation believes that more needs to be done  particularly to assist vulnerable countries in arid and semi-arid areas and landlocked and transit countries  such as my own  that are also susceptible to drought and desertification. Financial support  technology transfer and capacity-building need to be generously extended to that special category of countries in order to assist them in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.Last year  Botswana hosted the Summit for Sustainability in Africa  whose outcome declaration calls upon Governments to ensure that the contributions of natural capital to sustainable economic growth and the maintenance and improvement of social capital and human well-being are quantified and integrated into development and business practices. We wish to commend the work done by non-governmental environmental organizations worldwide in their unremitting efforts to save the planet from climate change and its negative effects.Botswana welcomes the adoption earlier this year of the long-overdue Arms Trade Treaty. The Treaty establishes common international standards for the regulation of international trade in conventional arms  ammunition and parts and components  with a view to strengthening international peace and security. In that regard  I am delighted to report that arrangements are under way to facilitate our signing and ratification of that vital instrument in the very near future.Botswana remains firmly committed to a strong and effective international criminal justice system — hence our continued strong support for the mandate and work of the International Criminal Court. We believe that the Court has a vital role to play in the fight against impunity  genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.In that regard  last April  Botswana hosted a regional workshop for African States parties to the Rome Statute. The workshop was aimed at encouraging African States parties to ratify the 2010 Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute  which deal with the specific question of the crime of aggression. I am pleased to say that  following the workshop  Botswana became the first African State party to ratify the Kampala amendments. We can only hope that other State parties will follow suit so that we can secure the requisite number of ratifications for the amendments to enter into force.Turning now to issues of international peace and security  it defies logic that  throughout the course of history  humankind has unleashed untold suffering on humankind. Conflict is raging in many parts of the world  where innocent lives are being lost needlessly. My delegation wishes to reiterate that States have a duty and a responsibility to protect their populations from war crimes and crimes against humanity and to see to it that the perpetrators of such crimes do not benefit from impunity. In situations where it is clear that States have failed or are unwilling to exercise their responsibility to protect  it is only fair and proper that the international community should intervene. In that regard  I refer mainly to the responsibility of the Security Council.For slightly over two years now  the people of Syria have been engulfed in a brutal civil war whose end seems nowhere in sight. We remain deeply concerned that Syria continues to be soaked in the blood of its citizens. We therefore wish to note our disappointment with those permanent members of the Security Council that continue to frustrate resolutions authorizing interventions seeking a lasting solution to the ongoing carnage in Syria.It is a cause for extreme sadness that  despite the ever-worsening humanitarian situation in that country  the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the situation. We fear that  if the current state of affairs continues  a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions will unfold and haunt humankind for many generations to come. Accordingly  we wish to reiterate our position that punitive action in some form should be taken against the Al-Assad regime for committing crimes against humanity. We appeal once again to the Security Council  the organ with responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  to take decisive action  once and for all  to end the human suffering in Syria.Let me take this opportunity to commend all credible human rights and humanitarian organizations for their efforts to relieve human suffering around the world. We equally wish to commend those countries in the region  especially Turkey  Jordan and Lebanon  for accommodating and positively responding to the plight of refugees from Syria and trying to meet their needs.The political upheaval in Egypt is also a cause for grave concern. Naturally  we believe that former President Morsi contributed to the present crisis by attempting to promulgate his undemocratic and divisive agenda  which resulted in an unfortunate military coup. Urgent action is therefore required to restore constitutional rule in that country.We note with deep concern that  shortly after celebrating the second anniversary of its independence  Africa’s newest sovereign State  South Sudan  has experienced developments in its relations with the Sudan that seriously threaten its security and territorial integrity. At the same time  we remain deeply concerned about the further deterioration of the political and humanitarian situation in Darfur. We therefore appeal to the international community to assist in all ways possible to restore peace and stability in that region.My Government strongly condemns the recent spate of terrorist attacks in Kenya  Nigeria and Pakistan  which have resulted in the loss of many innocent lives. We wish to convey our sincere condolences and sympathy to the affected countries and the families of the deceased. Those acts of terror are a threat to international peace and security and militate against the international community’s efforts to build a secure  peaceful and prosperous world.Such terrorist acts are transnational in nature and call therefore for a global response. To that end  we appeal to the conscience and resolve of all members of the international community to remain united and steadfast  if we are to win that fight. There can be no doubt that  if left unchecked  international terrorism has the potential to undermine our global development agenda.We find it opportune to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the vanguard role he continues to play in the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as in addressing issues of human suffering across the globe. The Secretary-General should also be applauded for his continued efforts to coordinate international efforts to advance the post-2015 development agenda.Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s continued commitment to playing its part in the quest for international peace and security as well as in the international community’s unrelenting efforts towards making the world a safer  peaceful and more prosperous place for both present and future generations."
"29",1179,"CAF",68,2013,"The theme chosen for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the Central African Republic has been compromised as a result of the crisis that we are going through. I shall therefore devote my statement entirely to the situation that prevails in my country.As national leaders gather here in New York to share their concerns in a world where violence  hate  extreme poverty and armed conflict are ever more present and a miserable generation lives in indescribable suffering  I have the onerous duty of taking the floor as Prime Minister and Head of the Transitional Government of National Unity of the Central African Republic to address  from this lofty rostrum at the United Nations  the human tragedy afflicting the people of my country  whose suffering seems to have been forgotten by the international community.At the outset  I and my delegation would like to convey to Mr. John W. Ashe our heartfelt congratulations on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also wish to acknowledge the remarkable work carried out under the leadership of Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  his predecessor. In addition  I wish to express my utmost gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his energy and pragmatism and  in particular  for the special attention that he continually pays to my country and its people.I must also pay well-deserved tribute to the Heads of State of the Economic Community of West African States and of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community  who unfailingly come to my country’s aid as it suffers from multiple crises  and to the United Nations  the European Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie and France for their unflagging support to the Central African Republic in these very trying times. Our thanks go  too  to the United States Government  which has been fighting with us side by side against the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony.The terrible news of the terrorist attack in Nairobi reached us as we gathered here in New York. My country condemns that and other senseless attacks and expresses its condolences to the afflicted families and to the Kenyan people.The tragedy affecting the Syrian people for more than two years demands action from the international community. The use of chemical weapons against the civilian population must be strongly condemned. That is why my country supports the actions under way to dismantle the chemical arsenal in Syria  with emphasis on a diplomatic resolution of that crisis.While Africa has the dubious honour of distinguishing itself by the acts of violence of all sorts that occur there  the continent still gives us grounds for hope. Only a few days ago  Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was elected President of Mali  a country in the throes of a crisis that has undermined its national unity. We convey to him our warmest congratulations and our inexhaustible encouragement in his efforts to restore peace and sow the seeds of democracy in his country.In the half-century of its independence  the Central African Republic has experienced a series of cyclical political and military crises  which have led to a succession of political regimes. The decades of recurrent crisis have created constant instability  which has led to the disintegration of the State. The home-grown causes of this situation derive from the fragility of the State  a lack of political dialogue  a failure to abide by commitments in the management of public affairs  a refusal to let go of power  tribalism  nepotism and the politics of exclusion. In addition  there are now phenomena previously unheard of in the Central African Republic — impassioned inter-ethnic and interreligious tensions that remind us of the tragedies suffered by other African countries.The external causes are due to the collateral effects of the crises in Darfur and Libya  as well as the long conflict in the Sudan  which led to the independence of South Sudan; the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the actions of residual groups of former Chadian rebels; and the terrorist activities of Joseph Kony’s LRA in the south-east of the country. The various disturbances have led to the circulation of a large quantity of military weapons of all calibres throughout our country. Those weapons have gravely impaired the security and the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic and led to serious human rights violations; massacres of civilian populations; kidnappings; summary executions; mass rapes; large-scale pillaging and arson  including the burning of private houses  public buildings and grain silos; the desecration of places of worship; and the degradation of natural resources and wildlife.The Central African Republic is thus faced with multifaceted challenges that require immediate action to restore the security of people and property throughout the territory. There must be protection of and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable sectors of the population  including internally displaced persons and refugees. State administration must be re-established throughout our territory. We also need to restore social cohesion and national harmony. We must revive our economy  manage public finances and organize general elections. In accordance with the commitments made to the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)  the Government plans to establish conditions for a return to security  peace and constitutional order by 2015.The goal at the end of the period of peaceful transition  which every citizen in the Central African Republic longs for  is a country where peace and security are guaranteed in all sectors of political  economic and social life  where disarmament  demobilization and reintegration are successfully managed and where free  transparent and credible elections are held  thereby ensuring the designation of legitimate authorities in the contry.In compliance with the commitments made in the 11 January 2013 Libreville Agreement and the 18 April 2013 N’Djamena Declaration  under the auspices of the Heads of State of ECCAS  we have established transitional institutions  including the Government of National Unity  in which due regard is paid to geographical and political balance; and the National Transitional Council  a legislative and constituent transitional body. We have adopted a constitutional transitional charter and an organization act relating to the transitional constitutional court. We have also appointed and sworn in the members of the court  and the Head of State of the transition has now taken his oath of office. The last institution  namely  the high communications council  will soon be established. The next elections will be organized by our national authority for elections  which will be established in the days to come.We are trying to re-establish our defence forces with help from the international community  but that will be possible only if some basic conditions are met. The Head of State and the Government of National Unity are tackling that extremely difficult task.Following the violence  killings and looting in the Boyrabe and Boeing neighbourhoods in the city of Bangui  measures have been taken to ban former Séléka elements from maintaining order. Now the mission rests solely with the gendarmerie and the police. A ceremony of reconciliation took place between the officers of the Central African Armed Forces and those of the former Séléka rebellion. The Séléka coalition has been dissolved  and we are trying to create a dynamic fusion of the latter with the Central African Armed Forces.With regard to the encampment of the former Séléka coalition  15 sites have been established in the provinces in order to bring together the former Séléka rebels for identification and disarmament and to select those who could possibly join the army. While efforts were under way to do that  new outbreaks of violence erupted in certain prefectures of the Central African Republic  at Bossangoa and Bouca  involving armed clashes between former Séléka elements and organized self-defence groups  who claimed to be supporters of the former President and wanted to regain power. Muslim families were massacred  which led to extremely cruel reprisals by the former Séléka elements against Christian populations and innocent civilians.Accordingly  the Head of State  in agreement with the Government of National Unity  took 10 measures to strengthen security: the appointment of a Minister of Security from civil society to head the Ministry of Public Security; the arrest and arraignment of persons suspected of crimes  violence and looting in the areas of Bangui concerned and the sentencing of 16 former Séléka members to eight years in prison  by which the Government demonstrated its resolve to combat impunity; the entrusting of all operations to the police and the gendarmerie alone; the placing of the gendarmerie and police under the Ministry of Public Security so that manpower and material resources could be shared to ensure effective security throughout the territory; the dismantling of the former Séléka coalition and the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace; the removal of Séléka elements from police stations  private houses and administrative buildings to restore security throughout the territory; the resumption of police service in areas long occupied by former Séléka elements as a corollary to the release of persons arrested by them; the launch of operations to disarm former Séléka elements who refused to be quartered in the barracks assigned to them; the transfer of approximately 1 200 former Séléka members to two sites in the provinces of Sibut and Bossembélé  pending the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration programme; and the initiation by the Head of State of a social dialogue through meetings with various sectors of the population  notably victims of former Séléka elements.The 5 August 2013 report of the Secretary-General (S/2013/470) on the situation in the Central African Republic paints a very dark and chaotic picture of the humanitarian and security situation that reveals the reality of the daily lives of the Central African people. Moreover  since early August  armed confrontations in the north-west have led to a considerably deteriorated humanitarian situation in that region  where clashes have occurred between former Séléka elements and self-defence groups and groups that support the former President. It is important to note that at present the humanitarian situation is utterly catastrophic. Approximately 4.6 million Central Africans are affected by the crisis  that is  every single person in our country. There are approximately 1.6 million internally displaced persons who are in dire need of assistance  and approximately 60 000 children are at risk of dying of malnutrition.Approximately 62 000 people sought refuge in neighbouring countries  including and principally 40 500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At least 650 000 children are unable to go to school. More than 484 000  or 10.6 per cent of our population  are facing a very serious situation of food insecurity. Around 3 500 children have been recruited by armed groups. More than 13 700 people on antiretroviral medications are at risk of not being able to follow their treatments because of possible interruption of the supply chain. Less than 20 per cent of the country’s health-care facilities are working. That is the humanitarian situation caused by insecurity.Given that backdrop  the international community has now undertaken to rush to the assistance of the Central African Republic. Accordingly  3 652 military and civilian personnel will make up the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic. It will take over from the Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic  which has been in the country for several years under different designations. On behalf of my country  I would like to extend my appreciation and thanks to Cameroon  the Congo  Gabon  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad  which  for the time being  are the only countries contributing troops to the force. It is our hope that other African countries will follow their example; I understand that Burundi is getting ready to send a battalion with 450 troops.I hope to see the international community step up its efforts and continue to be supportive of the Central African Republic as it seeks lasting peace. In that respect  I would note the urgent appeal issued by many States for the greater involvement of the United Nations in resolving the crisis in the Central African Republic. Keeping in mind that the Central African Republic is a crumbling State  that appeal is for us a request for assistance for a people who are at risk and for a gesture of strong solidarity. It is therefore a matter of urgency that the International Support Mission should become operational quickly under the auspices of the African Union  taking over from the former Multinational Force of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community.Given the degree of the violence and the extent of devastation  the new multinational force needs a clear and robust mandate from the Security Council in order to provide security  bring peace to the country and protect civilians. It is also the duty of the international community  however  to provide the financial  material and logistic resources needed to meet the many challenges that my country is facing. The challenges are self-evident and enormous. Apart from providing security in the country  organizing elections  restoring the administration  providing judicial  economic and social reform are all part of the road map that was drawn up in Libreville.Those imperatives are especially topical right now as the rainy season is approaching and our people are in a state of total destitution. The already critical humanitarian situation is worsening  as demonstrated by the vast number of internally displaced persons — between 1.5 million and 1.6 million. The proliferation of arms in Bangui and the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and social atmosphere are likely to jeopardize the success of the transition. Given that avalanche of problems  the Government of National Unity has to set security  humanitarian  budgetary and policy priorities.If we are to be successful in stabilizing the country and bringing peace  we have to reinvent a new programme of disarmament  demobilization and reintegration and we have to rethink how to reform the security sector  for security is the keystone of the transition and the need for innovative approaches is greater now than ever before. We will not be able to meet those challenges unless we get four kinds of assistance: financial  technical  material and humanitarian. Our partners need to be supportive of our transition  provide urgent budgetary support and help us with their expertise.The current session of the General Assembly offers me once again an opportunity to beg the international institutions to commit to providing strong support and high-quality expertise in a coordinated  complementary  coherent and transparent way. A failure to carry out the transition will make our country impossible to govern  which would inevitably lead to a gray area at the heart of the African continent. There are already several foreign armed groups in our country. The Lord’s Resistance Army  which has been present in the south-east of the country since 2008  has killed several hundreds people  raped dozens of women  abducted thousands of children and burned entire villages. The Vakaga region has been penetrated by traffickers and poachers from neighbouring countries  including the Sudan. If the Central African State collapses  new criminal and terrorist networks could settle in the country and destabilize the entire region. While stability in Central Africa is a major concern of the international community  that concern must go beyond the minimal reactions and half-hearted commitments that are too often features of international support for political transition.I recall that Ms. Valerie Amos  Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator  and Ms. Kristalina Georgieva  European Commissioner for International Cooperation  Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response  came to my country in July 2013 and visited the devastated population of the city of Kaga Bandoro. When they returned to Bangui  they told me about the heart-rending scenes they had witnessed. They had met a woman who had lost all hope and who asked why the world had abandoned her country. This survivor cried out in distress  saying  “Do not abandon us.” And her voice is that of millions of others in the Central African Republic who are calling for help. The crisis in my country may be a national crisis  but the solution  in its four dimensions — military  security  humanitarian and financial — has to be international. There is no short-term alternative to the full involvement of the international community to save the Central African Republic. On 19 September in Bamako  French President François Hollande said that “when the law is trampled upon  when women and children are being massacred  it is then that the international community must rise up and demonstrate solidarity”. The time has come for the international community to rise up and save the Central African Republic. It did so for Mali; there is no reason why it should not do so for my country. The Central African people do not understand this kind of international solidarity  with one rule for one country and another rule for another. Now more than ever  action is needed to help a people in danger. Now more than ever  every means that has already been used elsewhere must be mobilized to avert irreparable harm. The cry of distress from that poor woman from Kaga Bandoro addressed to Ms. Valerie Amos and Ms. Kristalina Georgieva is the same cry of 4.6 million Central Africans to the international community  and it resonates like a last request to our universal conscience. A human tragedy that calls for urgent action is playing out before our eyes. Every day that passes brings its share of bloodshed  women raped  children kidnapped and millions displaced or exiled.Now more than ever  therefore  action is needed for my country’s civilian population. If nothing is done now  tomorrow will be too late. And in the face of history  the international community can no longer abjure its political and moral responsibilities."
"30",1226,"CAN",68,2013,"As we gather near Ground Zero  site of the World Trade Center mass murder  I wish first to honour the victims of terrorism. I honour all victims everywhere  including those killed and wounded at the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi.Tragically  we lost two Canadians in Nairobi  including one of our diplomats. There is no more fitting venue to honour the life of Annemarie Desloges and her service than right here at the United Nations. The crime of terror is an assault on all people. In its wake  the human family is one — united in pain  mourning and our resolve that we will never allow evil to triumph.At this moment of grief  the oneness of humankind is the theme of my remarks today.Allow me to begin with an observation drawn from the Canadian experience. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador was the last province to join Canada  but it is the site of the earliest known European settlement in the New World. L’Anse aux Meadows is more than 1 000 years old. We consider the province’s capital city  St. John’s  to be the oldest English settlement in North America  dating back to 1497.The early Newfoundland settlements are the subject of significant archeological activity. Among the artifacts commonly found is a three-handled drinking mug known as a tyg. The three handles are designed for sharing. During the seventeenth century  it was common to share eating and drinking utensils. Further research reveals that the tyg is not unique to Canadian and English history. On the contrary  cups with three or more handles are common to many of the world’s cultures. Indeed  nearly three millennia ago  Homer wrote in the Iliad of a multi-handled mug. The tyg and its many counterparts around the world are tangible reminders not just of the fact that eating and drinking are social activities  but that  as long as human beings have inhabited this planet  sustenance and the necessaries of life have been community endeavours. Human beings share out of necessity. We cooperate to survive. We form communities because that is our natural state. As Cicero observed  we were born to unite with our fellow men and to join in community with the human race.Animated by the same spirit of community  the Charter of the United Nations declares that our goals include to live together  to be neighbours and to unite. The very first words of the Charter of the United Nations make clear that the Organization is a body of  by and for human beings. It begins  “We the peoples of the United Nations” — not “We the countries” or “We the Governments” or “We the political leaders”  but “We the peoples”. That is an important reminder of why and on whose behalf we are all here today.At the United Nations  Canada targets its efforts on securing tangible results for the human family. It is much more important to consider what the United Nations is achieving than how the United Nations arranges its affairs. Canada’s Government does not seek to have our values or our principled foreign policy validated by elites who would rather go along to get along. The billions who are hungry  or lack access to clean water  or are displaced  or cannot read and write do not care how many members sit on the Security Council. But they do need to know that their brothers and sisters in humankind will walk with them through the darkness.Peace  prosperity and freedom are the conditions that have been sought by human communities from the beginning of recorded time: to live in peace  to live in prosperity  to live in freedom.Of those priorities peace is the foremost objective of the United Nations. It is no surprise that the Charter of the United Nations mentions the word peace four dozen times. Sadly  peace the word is easier to locate than peace the condition. Since the moment the Organization was created  not a day has passed without the human family being pained by war somewhere on the planet. Almost always  the suffering is felt by the most vulnerable among us. Far too often  that involves women and violence.In the context of war  rape and serious sexual violence are war crimes. I have met girls who were victims of that very war crime  and their stories are absolutely horrific. The war criminals involved must be identified  pursued  prosecuted and punished. Earlier this year  Canada and other Group of Eight nations agreed to treat sexual violence in conflict as a violation of the Geneva Conventions. I applaud the United Kingdom and Foreign Secretary William Hague for their work in this very important area. But he would be the first to acknowledge that the fight to eradicate this crime has been led by women  including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict  Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura.Tragically every year  millions of girls  some as young as nine years old  are forced into marriage. Since I began my remarks today  100 children have been forced into marriage at a rate of 1 100 per hour  or more than 26 000 per day. The effects of early forced marriage are documented and beyond dispute. Early forced marriage harms health  halts education  destroys opportunity and enslaves women in a life of poverty. A young woman once recounted her wedding date. She remembered  “It was the day I left school”. No country is immune from this scourge.This is a global problem — a problem for humankind. Forced marriage is rape — an act of violence against women. Early forced marriage is child rape — an act of violence against young girls. The practice is abhorrent and indefensible. We condemn it  even though some might prefer that we kept quiet. The discomfort of the public is of small concern  particularly in the context of a crime that calls to heaven for justice.(spoke in English)If the United Nations does not act to protect young girls  who will?Another way to protect the vulnerable is to improve the health of mothers  newborns and children so that we can reduce the number of deaths. I would like to say how proud I am of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for having led a global effort — the Muskoka Initiative — to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to improve the health of mothers and children in the world’s poorest countries. That is about half of the world’s population  and all of its potential.While those efforts  to eradicate sexual violence in conflict  to eliminate early forced marriage and to improve maternal and newborn health are essential  we must do more than react to crises. We must invest in opportunities for women and young girls. We must ensure that women participate fully in all parts of our society and in all the countries of the United Nations. That will help us build a stronger  more secure  more prosperous and more peaceful world. It is in every nation’s self-interest to ensure every young girl realizes her full potential. And it is from the perspective of the human family  one family  that we must address other threats to peace and security.Among the most urgent crises remains the violence in Syria. Canada’s position is clear: we support the Syrian people  the innocent people caught up in this senseless violence and those who show great courage in working on their behalf. We will never support a brutal and illegitimate regime that has unleashed weapons of mass destruction on its own people. Nor will we tolerate extremism and terrorism as alternatives to Al-Assad’s tyranny.The people of Canada have been generous in helping those most in need. When success is achieved  I believe that it is important to recognize it. The near-impossible work of the World Food Programme must be applauded  and Canada has responded by being the second-largest single-country donor in the world. Its work in Syria is paramount and has not gone unnoticed. I also commend the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in providing assistance to the refugees fleeing that terrible conflict  as well as the generosity of Syria’s neighbours in providing safe haven.Canada joins the entire world in seeking a political resolution to the conflict. Canada supports a peaceful  democratic and pluralistic Syria that protects the rights of all communities. But let us not confuse a peaceful  negotiated outcome with equivocation or moral uncertainty. There can be no moral ambiguity about the use of chemical weapons  particularly against civilians.Today  30 September  is a dark reminder of the price of accommodation with evil. It is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Munich Agreement  by which Czechoslovakia’s freedom was sacrificed to appease the Nazi regime. The appeasers claimed they had won peace in our time. In fact  their abandoning of principle was a calamity for the world. Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel  a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz  has been even blunter:“Neutrality helps the oppressor  never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor  never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered  when human dignity is in jeopardy  national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.”Just as we are not neutral or silent on the crimes being committed against the Syrian people  neither is Canada neutral on Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself. There can be no bargaining over Israel’s existence. While dialogue is a virtue  there can be no virtuous discussion with anyone wedded to Israel’s destruction. Today  the Jewish people are masters of their own fate  like most other nations  in their sovereign Jewish State. And like all other nations  Israel has the right to defend itself  by itself.Canada fundamentally believes peace is achievable and that Palestinians and Israelis and their neighbours can live side by side in peace and security. We  like many nations  wish to see a prosperous Palestinian State living in peace with its Jewish neighbour. That is why  although at times we have fundamental differences on how statehood is achieved  Canada is providing significant assistance to build the institutions that are vital to the establishment of a viable future State. In the West Bank  Canada is contributing greatly to economic  security and justice initiatives.Recent developments in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are indeed encouraging. I want to salute the leadership and courage of the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian Authority’s President. I commend United States Secretary of State John Kerry for his personal leadership in this area. We must all commit ourselves to this cause  united by the prospect of peace.I look forward to the day when Israeli and Palestinian children can live side by side in peace and security in a Jewish and in a Palestinian State.Dialogue is important  yes. But our dialogue must be a prelude to action  and action must mean achieving results. Action must mean making a difference. If we take the recent statements coming from the regime in Iran  some observers see encouraging signs  but sound bites do not remove threats to global security. Kind words  a smile and a charm offensive are not a substitute for real action. We will welcome and acknowledge reform  if and when it comes. By the following test we will know when genuine reform has occurred: has there been real  measurable  material improvement in the lives of the Iranian people and in the security of the world? Not yet. We will judge the regime on the basis of its actions and results.The five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany have had five rounds of formal negotiations with Iran in the past two years. While everyone says the meetings have been productive  the fact remains we have not seen any change in Iran’s actions. Next year  nothing would make Canada more pleased than to see a change in Iran’s nuclear ambitions  a change to its terrible human rights record and an end to its material support for terrorism  including for Hizbullah.Now is the time for the global community to maintain tough sanctions against Iran so that the country takes a different path on its nuclear programme. The Iranian people want peace  and they are suffering great hardship because of their Government. Canada wants the Iranian people to be able to access a life of freedom and prosperity for themselves.How do we as a human family achieve and maintain prosperity? We do so through free trade among open societies operating under transparent  consistent and fair rules. Canada continues to diversify its markets because it is a trading nation. We are aggressively pursuing free-trade agreements with other nations. Bounded by three oceans  with the second-largest land mass in the world  Canada is literally open to the world. We are both deepening existing economic relationships and building new ones. Whether with China  which is now Canada’s second-largest trading partner  or the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  where Canadian trade and investment ties are dramatically increasing  or the Pacific Alliance  which provides new and exciting opportunities  or the European Union  where we are negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement  Canada and Canadians are supporting market liberalization. In the process  ordinary lives are becoming enriched and entire societies stronger.But the quest for prosperity must never come at the expense of our commitment to freedom. Prosperity is inextricably linked to peace. After all  those who lack security usually lack the means to provide for themselves and their families. With economic opportunity  a fruit vendor in Tunisia may not have felt compelled to end his life seeking the dignity to provide for his own family. A young man in Afghanistan may never feel compelled to join terrorist elements simply to raise his children and ensure that their lives are better than the one he lived.I will always remember the 7-year old girl that I met at Zaatari refugee camp  in Jordan. Her parents had made the difficult decision to leave their home and to seek refuge in another country  braving hardship because they were motivated  like all parents  by the desire to keep their family safe. I asked the young girl how she was doing. With tears in her eyes  she said simply  “I do not like it here. I want to go home.” It was absolutely heartwrenching. And millions of people are in the same tragic position around the world — millions of members of the human family who cannot even begin to contemplate prosperity until a more basic need  their need for security  is addressed.The global family will never achieve the prosperity that is our full potential unless we address the peace and security concerns that constrain human opportunity. Everyone has an interest in contributing to the solution  because peace and prosperity ultimately ensure the freedom of the individual. That is why we need the people of these United Nations gathered here to promote that freedom: freedom from oppression  freedom from discrimination  freedom to worship  to think  to speak  to love  to believe — freedom to be.Human freedom can be exercised and  sadly  limited in far too many ways. Religious persecution continues in too many places. Since we gathered here last year  the world has witnessed bombings of mosques in Iraq and Pakistan and Catholic churches in Tanzania; attacks against Hindu  Buddhist and Muslim places of worship in Burma and Bangladesh; the bloody persecution of Christians in Syria; attacks on Coptic Christian churches in Egypt; attacks on a mosque and on a Catholic church in Sri Lanka; the detention of Sri Lankan Muslim leader Azad Sally; the murders of Catholic worshippers in Nigeria; and the Iranian regime’s ongoing persecution of the Baha’i.Canada this year opened an Office of Religious Freedom. Its mandate is to promote freedom of religion and belief as a foreign policy priority  and to combat the enslavement into fear by those who seek to intimidate and undermine the right to worship freely in peace and in harmony. We reject the pernicious notion that human dignity can be sliced up  compartmentalized or compromised. In a pluralistic society  it is impossible to protect some human rights and freedoms while infringing others. All freedoms are rooted in the inherent dignity of human beings.Whether the issue is religious freedom  sexual freedom  political freedom or any other freedom  some people ask: What business is it of ours? What interest do we have in events outside our borders? Our business is a shared humanity. Our interest is the dignity of humankind. Many assaults on human dignity have common roots. I refer to neo-fascist ideology masquerading in different forms  and the threat that it poses to individual freedom.I spoke earlier of the anniversary of the Munich Agreement. What the signatories claimed as a triumph of practical politics was in fact a craven capitulation that betrayed human dignity and bankrupted the peace it purported to secure. It was wrong then to underestimate and to appease fascism  just as it is now to underestimate its modern incarnation. Extremism that subjugates human dignity and crushes individual freedom beneath rigid ideology must be opposed for what it is.One year ago  the world lost the great Somali poet known as Gaarriye. Although his pen has been silenced  the inspiring words remain. He wrote: “And tell them this: our purpose is peace; our password ‘freedom’; our aim  equality; our way  the way of light.”. In other words  peace  prosperity and freedom — three universal human priorities. Like the three handles of a mug from which we all drink  they are three values that all humankind shares.As I close  I cannot help but reflect on the three young girls  and my heart breaks for them: the child bride who said  “It was the day I left schoo.”; the young girl who was a victim of rape and sexual violence; the refugee who said  “I just want to go home”. We are not here to achieve results for Governments or political leaders. We are here to protect and defend those three girls and 7 billion other members of the human family. Let us remember that as we embark on discussions to shape a new global agenda  focusing on those most in need.I am confident that everyone here feels the overwhelming honour and privilege it is to serve our people. It is not without great challenge and responsibility  but we all must stand up and deliver on that unique mandate for the people  for it is the people who expect nothing less."
"31",1241,"CHE",68,2013,"The world in which we live is profoundly changing  but whether it changes for the better is another matter. That is up to us. We often get the impression that great strides are being taken towards a better  more peaceful future. Unfortunately  reality imposes disappointing setbacks upon us. I recall an important step taken 150 years ago. In 1863  the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was founded in Geneva  giving rise to a global movement. Thanks to their humanitarian spirit  representatives of that organization work to provide humanitarian help worldwide for people affected by armed conflict and other violent situations. The humanitarian work of the ICRC is based on the principles of neutrality  impartiality and independence. All victims of conflicts receive the same treatment  and help is granted to all vulnerable persons. All human beings are valued equally. Alongside the humanitarian tradition shared by Switzerland and the ICRC  my country is proud of another tradition dating back centuries — neutrality. I would recall that for centuries Switzerland’s foreign policy has been anchored in peaceful coexistence among States. Thanks to our neutrality  we maintain relations with all countries. We never take sides  but we can provide support or propose our mediation. Furthermore  our neutrality allows us to offer our good offices. Humanitarian engagement is part of our history. It is an honour for us to make our neutral soil available for peace talks  and we will continue to do all we can to contribute towards peace in the world  in particular through our good offices. That impartial work is based on our belief that there are differences between people and between nations. Those differences are natural. Moreover  all human beings enjoy equal rights. The protection of human rights is a key element of the Swiss commitment. Those rights are an expression of the obligations set out under international law and must be protected. Switzerland is concerned by the widespread excesses of violence and numerous human rights violations. It calls on all States and civilian actors to renounce violence. In the Middle East  violent conflicts are imposing unacceptable suffering on the civil population. The situation in Syria has deteriorated to such an extent that This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service  room U.506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.humanitarian organizations are unable to cope. Serious and systematic violations and abuses of international humanitarian law and human rights cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Such crimes must not go unpunished  regardless of which side is responsible. That is why my country  together with 57 like-minded States  called on the Security Council in January to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. The use of chemical weapons is a particularly despicable crime. It is imperative to shed light on all facts. With that in mind  Switzerland welcomes recent developments. I stress the need for the international community to spare no effort to pave the way for another conference at the earliest possible date in Geneva. That conference should result in a negotiated and lasting solution that would take into account the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians.Switzerland is not the only country bound by the principle of equal rights. The Charter of the United Nations endows it with universal validity. The preamble reaffirms “faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women”. What applies to all human beings also applies to the States we live in. That is why  in the same sentence  after referring to the fundamental rights of all people  the Charter refers explicitly to the equal rights of nations “large and small”. Under paragraph 2 of Article I of the Charter  the United Nations seeks “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”. Paragraph 1 of Article 2 states that “[t]he Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.”I firmly believe that those principles are the keystone for the peaceful coexistence of all people and populations of this world.But are we still sufficiently aware of this? Or are we prone to lose ourselves in grandiose ideas and minor details? I have the impression that in international politics too much is said of how things should be in an ideal world and too little about reality. I cannot help but feel that excessive bureaucracy creates a kind of parallel universe that leads to increased isolation. At the end of the day  that leads to increasingly higher costs and fewer concrete results.Global problems need more than general discussions; above all  they require a search for solutions shared by all parties. The United Nations was created to find such solutions  and to that end it must be efficient  innovative and effective. Only thus will it be able to make progress in ensuring the equal rights of people and nations. Switzerland is firmly committed to contributing to that task. At present  certain developments are at odds with the shared values laid down in the Charter. I would like to address those subjects and launch a discussion on these worrisome developments.As the representative of a neutral State with a long-standing humanitarian tradition  it is with some concern that I observe the growing resurgence of power politics. I note that large States are once again choosing to exercise their power and force and that they view smaller States less and less as equal partners. I sincerely hope that this trend will be reversed as soon as possible. Otherwise  the fundamental values of the Charter  which unite the international community and to which its members feel committed  will be placed in doubt. As I have already said  the tendency towards power politics on the international stage worries me  for we believe that the countries on this planet should be free to choose their own futures  even as they respect others States and accept the rules of peaceful coexistence among peoples  without sacrificing their specific character. We believe in peaceful competition among economies. We believe in the diversity of the world — the peaceful diversity of sovereign States that treat one another fairly and as equal partners. People are free to draw up their own constitutions and to determine their own economic order and their own system of law. No State may impose its law over that of another country. Problems are not solved by diktat  but through negotiations. The shared norms and rules of international law exist to ensure that it is not simply the law of the strongest that applies. The principles of sovereignty and equal rights provide peace and stability and foster friendly relations between all peoples.Those are the convictions upon which the Charter of the United Nations is based. Do we still share these convictions today? The way in which large nations have acted in dealings with small nations recently has disturbed me because I often have the impression that force has often been placed above the law. The United Nations is active in a vast range of areas. There is perhaps a risk that it has taken on too much and lost sight of what is essential and concrete. The United Nations and its Member States often seem at a loss when the principles upon which the Organization were founded are at stake. Let us never forget what underlies these principles: the equal rights of people and the equal rights and sovereignty of nations. They are embodiments of the lessons of history  which has been a painful story of oppression  foreign domination and conflicts.Together we must decide which path we want to take. Do we want to continue squandering our strength on issues of secondary interest? I believe that we should strive  here and now  to reaffirm and live out the values of the United Nations. Let us commit ourselves to achieving a peaceful world in which people and nations enjoy equal rights and are of equal value — a world in which right prevails over might. It is up to all of us here in this Hall to do all in our power to achieve that goal. Let us start without delay. "
"32",1287,"CHL",68,2013,"I should first like to congratulate you  Sir  an outstanding public servant from our region  on his recent election to preside over the General Assembly. I would also like to express my heartfelt solidarity with the people and Government of Mexico in the wake of the storms that have seriously affected their country  and with the people and Government of Kenya  after the acts of terrorism that have had such a terrible impact. I would also like to emphasize that during this period of meetings  Heads of State and Government from almost all corners of the planet will have the opportunity to exchange views  share experiences and  most important  generate the momentum essential to building together a future commensurate with the ideals  dreams and hopes of the men and women represented here.The fundamental inspiration behind the founding of the United Nations  almost seven decades ago  was the desire to be able to depend on a place designed to bring into harmony the actions of every nation aimed at attaining peace and development  a place where all individuals  nations and peoples of the world — whatever flag they pledge to honour  whatever god they worship and whatever ideas they embrace — can feel part of one big family  the human family.That requires many things of us  but none so important as holding an open  free and respectful dialogue among ourselves  a dialogue that  far from fearing dissent  values it and is nourished by it  because it understands that only when the various nations and cultures join forces will we also see our opportunities expand.We are living in a world that is very different from the one that witnessed the birth of the Organization and of other agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank after the end of the Second World War. This new world is not the result of war or of the ideological struggles waged during the second half of the twentieth century; rather  it is the child of a revolution in knowledge  science  technology and information that has been taking place for some time and that is now knocking at our doors and creating opportunities for material and spiritual progress for millions of men and women around the world that many of us could not have imagined even a few decades ago. This new world is no longer divided by walls or iron curtains  but is connected and integrated by the bridges of increasing globalization and the massive exchange of goods  services  capital and people. In this new world we certainly face dangers  challenges and opportunities that are also new  and which in many cases transcend the borders and jurisdictions of individual countries  demanding to be tackled by distinguishing where the responsibility of some people ends and where the responsibility of others begins. Such challenges and problems can be successfully dealt with only by harnessing the force of the unity of all and the responsibility of each. However  although we know we are living in a world that is undergoing enormous transformations  many of our international organizations often seem resistant to the change that such an evolution demands  allowing themselves to fall behind instead of leading the process.Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations states that the principal purposes of the Organization include to maintain international peace and security  to develop friendly relations among nations and to promote international cooperation in the economic  social  cultural and humanitarian spheres  as well as respect for human rights and the permanent protection of human freedoms without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion. But let us be clear. None of those desires is exclusive to one nation  one era or one specific organization: they all emanate from the depths of our souls and of each human heart. For that reason  we are not here only to proclaim their value and existence but to ensure their enforcement and application. We therefore appeal not for those values to be changed or  still less  to be forgotten. Quite the contrary: we appeal for the will and the courage to put them into practice. In order to do so  we must perfect our democracies and strengthen grassroots participation  but we must also modernize our regional and global organizations. In that task  as we all know  there is a long road ahead of us.A good first step in that direction is to move towards real and far-reaching reform of the Security Council  including the enlargement of its permanent and non-permanent membership to ensure proper regional representation  as well as to strengthen its transparency. working methods and decision-making  all aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and legitimacy of its activities.In that regard  Chile  which was present at the creation of the Organization in 1945  supports the inclusion of Brazil  Germany  Japan and India as permanent members of the Security Council  as well as the African continent’s request for fair representation in the Organization. And we join in the appeals to the five countries with the right of veto to refrain from exercising that right in situations of crimes against humanity  war crimes  genocide or ethnic cleansing  since the use of the veto in such cases prevents or undermines the Council’s efforts to effectively defend the most fundamental values that enable humankine to advance. However  Security Council reform is not limited to changes in its membership and organization. It also means abandoning the logic of vetoes and replacing it by a logic of special quorums  so that the most important decisions concerning international security  which inevitably affect all countries sooner or later  can be adopted in a way that is truly representative of the community of nations that make up the United Nations. In the end  if we advocate democracy  dialogue and participation when we govern our own countries  we should advocate for those same principles when we address the form in which the United Nations governs itself. I should like to take this opportunity also to express my gratitude for the many expressions of support for Chile’s candidacy as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in the next two years and to reaffirm our strongest commitment to the principles and values that have for decades governed and guided our foreign policy. I mention in particular our full  unconditional respect for international law  the inviolability of treaties  legal equality among States  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the self-determination of peoples — all values that provide the essential foundation for international stability and peaceful coexistence among nations. In our opinion  however  those values should be complemented by the principle or notion of the responsibility to protect. That concept holds that it is the primary duty of each State to protect the population within its borders. And if a State cannot or does not want to comply with that primary duty  then the international community can and should intervene on the basis of three universally recognized pillars  namely  prevention  support and the proportional use of force in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  but only as a last resort and when strictly essential to prevent  avoid or deter genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity.In addition  my country once again reaffirms its strongest commitment to democracy and respect for the human rights of all persons  from their conception to their natural death  at all times and in all places and all circumstances  as well as our ongoing endorsement of multilateralism  of a regionalism that is open to the world  and of fair and constructive economic competition among all countries. In that regard  we reiterate our appeal not only to end the proliferation of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction but also to dismantle those that already exist. We strongly condemn the use of the chemical weapons in Syria  as well as the indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population  which has to date produced tens of thousands of innocent victims  including women and children  and has caused a serious humanitarian crisis that represents a wound to our universal conscience and seriously threatens international peace and security. We therefore welcome and strongly support the framework agreement for the elimination of chemical weapons in Syria  concluded recently by the United States and Russia  as well as the efforts made by the Secretary-General and the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States to reach a peaceful and lasting solution to this prolonged armed conflict as soon as possible.Similarly  Chile has always defended and will continue to defend the cause and rights of the Palestinian people to have a full  free and democratic State — a State that  like the State of Israel  enjoys agreed  recognized and secure borders with all its neighbours  allowing its inhabitants to live and develop in stable and lasting peace and security. We therefore recognized Palestine as an observer member of the United Nations and hope very soon to welcome it as a full Member of the Organization.With regard to regional matters  in March 2012  Chile ratified the Protocol on Commitment to Democracy  adopted by the member countries of the Union of South American Nations  and we hope that it will enter into force as soon as possible. In addition  we have reiterated our commitment to the Inter-American Democratic Charter and shall work tirelessly for the cause of democracy  freedom and the full respect for human rights in all the countries on our continent and throughout the entire world.Chile has also assumed the presidency pro tempore of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and hosted the first summit of its 33 members  at which we signed the Santiago Declaration  in which the entire region stated its commitment to democratic values and respect for human rights. In addition  we headed the first joint summit of the Heads of State and Government of Latin America  the Caribbean and Europe  at which nations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean undertook to promote sustainable development policies in order to encourage high quality investments of both social and environmental value.In the social sphere  although two years still remain before the deadline set at the Millennium Summit  we can announce with great satisfaction that Chile has attained practically all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set by the Organization in 2000. We are nevertheless redoubling our efforts to attain the remaining goals by 2015  and working to ensure that the countries that have requested our help can also achieve them. We are also participating actively in the efforts at the United Nations to define a new global sustainable development agenda beyond 2015 that follows on the MDGs and establishes specific  measurable  bold and feasible responsibilities  both for developing and developed nations  with special attention being given to ensuring that economic development is compatible with social development and the protection of the environment.In addition  Chile  together with Mexico  Colombia and Peru  took part in co-founding the Pacific Alliance  one of the most far-reaching integration initiatives in our region  designed to promote an area for the free flow of not only of goods  services and capital but also of persons  thus allowing higher growth rates and development and greater opportunities for our countries and peoples. We are delighted to see that the Pacific Alliance  which represents a population of over 210 million  one third of Latin America’s gross domestic product and more than half of its foreign trade  has  despite its recent emergence  already achieved significant results and is increasingly attracting the interest of the international community  which can be seen in the fact that it has attracted more than 20 observer countries  including Australia  Canada  China  Spain  the United States and Japan.Lastly  I should like to mention the recent approval by the National Congress of my country of legislation submitted by the Government that abolishes tariffs on imports from the least developed countries  as defined by the United Nations. That is an important demonstration of the Chilean people’s solidarity with and commitment to the development of almost 50 countries in Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean.A few days ago  Chileans marked the fortieth anniversary of the most far-reaching and lasting upheaval ever to affect our democracy in our two centuries of independent life and which ushered in a period characterized by hatred  division and exclusion not only in Chile but also in a world torn apart by the Cold War. However  in a few days’ time  on 5 October  we shall be marking another anniversary in Chile — the twenty-fifth anniversary of the start of the peaceful recovery of our democracy by the free and sovereign will of a vast majority of Chileans  which has allowed us to recover our democracy in a wise and peaceful manner and with the advice and consent of all sectors of our country. From both experiences  Chileans have learned lessons that I should like to share with the Assembly today because I humbly believe that they can shed light on how to resolve conflicts that are negatively affecting other nations of the world today.The first lesson is that we must acknowledge without reservations of any kind that even in extreme situations  including external or internal warfare  there are moral and legal rules that must be respected by all and that can never be ignored without falling into a serious and unacceptable moral vacuum. Among those rules  there is the strict respect for the human rights of all  in every time and place  under all circumstances. The second lesson is that the values of democracy  peace and civil amity are much more fragile than we usually think  so we cannot  and should never  take them for granted. They are somewhat like a tree that needs to be watered every day in order not to wither and dry up. Such care must be provided not only in deeds but also in words  gestures and formal actions  because all of them can and must be placed at the service of truth  justice  reconciliation and peace. The third lesson is that there is a very close relationship among the quality of democracy  economic progress and social justice  since all of them are mutually reinforcing and since the decline of one of them would sooner or later have an adverse effect weakening the others. Our task  therefore  is not only to strengthen our democratic institutions but also to promote economic and social policies based on freedom  responsibility  justice  equality of opportunity and the fight against poverty  and based on uniting the forces of both private and public initiative and respect for fundamental rights  because such policies are the main engines of development of our nations and peoples.The fourth lesson that we have learned in our country is that the past is over. We can discuss it  interpret it and  of course  remember it  but we cannot change it  and therefore we have no right to remain prisoner to it  because when the present is anchored in the past  the only thing we lose is the future. For that reason  our generation  which is celebrating the bicentennial of our country  has no right to bequeath to future generations the same hatreds  quarrels and divisions that caused so much harm and suffering 40 years ago. The challenge  then  is not to forget but to overcome the past with a new  positive and hopeful outlook  trying to learn from past experience in order to avoid making the same mistakes and letting it illuminate the way to the future  and to face with greater resolve and efficiency the problems and opportunities of the present and the future.Those and other lessons painfully learned by Chile enabled us to recover our democracy peacefully and to move forward over the past 25 years on the paths of truth  justice and reconciliation among all Chileans. But that was an old transition  one that  I believe  we accomplished successfully. Today we Chileans are facing another transition. This is a new  young and forward-looking transition that  before the end of this decade  will allow us to turn Chile into a developed country that overcame poverty and became fully integrated into the community of democratic and developed nations. Those are the commitments that the Government that I have the honour to lead made to all Chileans almost four years ago. We are deeply gratified to observe the solid and sustained progress of Chile towards their fulfilment.Despite the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck us in 2010 — at the time  the fifth most serious in the known history of humankind — and the global economic crisis that began in 2008 and is not over  Chile has resumed its leadership  momentum and ability to create jobs and strong growth. For example  our per capita gross domestic product  which four years ago was about $15 000  now stands at $20 000. Poverty and inequality are declining and real wages are rising rapidly. All indicators show that in key spheres such as quality education and health  we are making progress in the right direction  further stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship and better protecting our consumers  workers and the environment. At the same time  we have rebuilt virtually 90 per cent of everything destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami. Obviously  our Government is very proud of the contribution that its policies have made to the attainment of those goals. But we have no doubt that most of the credit goes to all Chileans  men and women  who have made enormous contributions to arrive at this point. If there is something that we in Chile have learned it is that in order to be able to grow and to reduce poverty and excessive inequalities  nothing works better than to rely on the skills of people themselves  expanding their freedoms and unleashing the forces of imagination  creativity  innovation and entrepreneurship that lie within the hearts of each of my compatriots and also — I am sure — the hearts of every man and woman around the world.Those are some thoughts and lessons that I  both as President of Chile and as a citizen of the world — wanted to share with Heads of State and Government. Those are the lessons and thoughts of a country that may be small on the international stage and remotely located on the world map  but that today enjoys a stable and consolidated democracy  broad and guaranteed public freedoms and an economic system that  after two centuries of republican life  has finally brought us to the threshold of development."
"33",1333,"CHN",68,2013,"This year has been an unusual one in China’s development. China’s new central collective leadership has put forward the concept of the “Chinese dream”  a dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation  and it is leading the 1.3 billion Chinese people in an endeavour to fulfil the two centennial goals  namely  to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020 and to turn China into a modern socialist country by the mid-twenty-first century. Having experienced profound changes in the past 5 000 years and especially the past century  China has reached a new historical starting point today.What development path will China take in the future? What domestic and foreign policies will it pursue? And what kind of international role will it play? I understand that those questions are of great interest to the international community. As the Foreign Minister of the new Chinese Government  I wish to give an emphatic answer to each of them.China will stay firmly on the path of peaceful development. China’s rapid development over the years has given rise to worries that China might follow the old pattern of wealth breeding arrogance and strength leading to hegemony  and various versions of the China threat theory have surfaced. However  what happened in the past should not be applied to today’s China.The outdated Cold War mentality has no place in the new era of globalization. The Chinese nation loves peace and the Chinese culture values harmony. Throughout history  the Chinese people have always embraced international exchanges and trade  not foreign aggression and expansion  and have adhered to the patriotic resolve to defend the homeland rather than the colonialist doctrine of seizing new territories.The culture of a country determines its values  and its history points the way to its future. Close to 40 years ago  it was from this rsotrum that the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared on behalf of the Chinese Government that China would never seek hegemony in the world. Today  his statement remains our unchanging commitment and conviction. China has honoured and will continue to honour its promise and remain a staunch force for upholding world peace.China pursues peaceful development and calls on all other countries to follow the same path. Since the beginning of reform and opening up  China has become increasingly interdependent with the global economy and integrated into the international system. We are committed to working with others to establish a new type of international relations  based on win-win cooperation  and to seek the peaceful resolution of international and regional disputes. With regard to China’s disputes with some countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests  we sincerely hope to resolve them in accordance with proper procedures  through negotiation and consultation with the countries directly involved. Those disputes that cannot be resolved now can be shelved for future resolution. That is our consistent position and practice. On the other hand  we will  whatever the circumstances  firmly safeguard China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolutely uphold China’s legitimate and lawful rights and interests.China will remain committed to reform  to opening up and to sustainable development. It has been five years since the outbreak of the international financial crisis. The global economy is back on the right track to recovery  but the foundations of the recovery are not solid and the speed is not fast enough. The root causes of the financial crisis have yet to be removed  and the structural problems of developed countries remain unresolved. The adjustment of unconventional monetary policies from the outside  coupled with other factors  have posed new challenges and the risk of financial market volatility to emerging market countries.Where the Chinese economy is heading engages both domestic and international attention. In that regard  I wish to inform the Assembly that both the fundamentals and the overall performance of China’s economy are sound  and China’s development prospects are bright. The leading indicators of the Chinese economy are generally good  and China leads the major economies in growth rate.In pursuit of progress while maintaining stability  the Chinese Government has followed a macroeconomic policy that addresses both immediate and long-term needs and has adopted a series of innovative policy measures with a view to promoing steady growth  economic structural adjustment and reform. We are vigorously pursuing reform  opening up  deepening economic structural adjustment and accelerating the shift in our growth model. We are implementing the basic State policy of resource conservation and environmental protection and promoting green  circular and low-carbon development to build a sound ecological environment and a beautiful China.With its increasing economic output and its changing growth model  China’s economy has entered a phase of high-to-medium growth rate. That is dictated by the law of economics  and it will ensure the sustained and healthy growth of the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy is being upgraded  and its future growth will deliver major dividends in four areas as a result of industrialization  information technology application  a new type of urbanization and agricultural modernization; reform and innovation; structural readjustment; and further opening up. It is projected that in the coming five years  China’s imports of commodities will exceed $10 trillion  its overseas investment will reach $500 billion  and Chinese tourists will make over 400 million outbound visits. That will give stronger impetus to the world economy and bring an increasing number of tangible benefits to other countries.China will firmly promote reform of the global governance system with the United Nations at its core. The United Nations is a big stage for all countries to conduct consultation and cooperation with one another. It is also a big family where people of all countries are brought together. It is our consistent position that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations form the cornerstone of current international relations and provide safeguards for world peace and stability. Respecting national sovereignty and opposing interference in internal affairs  safeguarding peace and opposing aggression  and promoting equality and opposing power politics; those are important principles that must be observed. China firmly upholds the role and authority of the United Nations  supports the United Nations in its renewal and self-improvement efforts  in keeping with a changing world  and looks forward to a United Nations that plays a larger role in international affairs. China is ready to deepen cooperation with the United Nations and get more actively involved in United Nations activities in various fields.China is committed to promoting democracy in international relations and the trend toward a multipolar world. We call for a greater representation and voice for developing countries in the global governance system and support the Group of 20  the BRICS group — Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa — and other emerging mechanisms that are playing a key role in making the international order fairer and more equitable. We also call for the reform of the international monetary and financial systems and want the role of the World Trade Organization as the main forum in the area of trade to be maintained. We are opposed to trade protectionism and are working to make economic globalization more balanced  inclusive and beneficial to all. We call on countries to enhance macroeconomic policy coordination and be mindful of the spillover effects of their respective adjustment of economic policies. We call for the strengthening of North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation to make development benefits more accessible to people of all countries.China will firmly fulfil its international responsibilities and obligations. The Chinese nation is responsible and ready to play its part. Although it remains a developing country facing the daunting task of development  China  as the second-largest economy and a permanent member of the Security Council  is fully aware of its responsibilities and the expectations placed on it by the international community. We will be fully and more actively engaged in international affairs and work closely with other countries to meet complex global challenges and tackle the difficult issues facing humankind. We will voice China’s views  offer China’s wisdom  propose China’s solutions  play China’s due role and provide more public goods to the international community.We will vigorously advocate the right vision on justice versus special interests  and we will endeavour to build a community of common destiny with other developing countries. In our exchanges and cooperation with other developing countries  we will uphold justice and place it above special interests. We will provide assistance to other developing countries to the best of our ability  so as to enable developing countries to realize independent and sustainable development.We will play a more proactive and constructive role in addressing international and regional hotspot issues to promote peace and dialogue  defuse conflicts and safeguard world peace and stability. We will maintain our escort missions and counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and increase our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations so as to contribute more to peace and security in Africa and other relevant regions.The turmoil in Syria has lasted for nearly three years  causing great suffering and trauma to both the Syrian people and Syria’s neighbours. The recent use of chemical weapons has met with universal condemnation. China firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons. We hope to see the early adoption of a Security Council resolution to support the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in launching the verification and destruction of chemical weapons  and we stand ready to make financial contributions to the OPCW for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria and to send experts to work there on the ground.China calls for an immediate end to hostilities and violence in Syria so that the necessary conditions for the verification and destruction of chemical weapons can be created. We call for the early convening of the “Geneva II” conference and faster progress on a political resolution of the Syrian issue. China seeks no gains for itself in Syria. We respect the aspirations and choice of the Syrian people. China is following the humanitarian situation in Syria with great concern. We have provided and will continue to provide assistance within our means to the Syrian people  including Syrian refugees outside the country.Recently  China has been providing emergency humanitarian aid to Jordan in the amount of ¥15 million  and has provided emergency humanitarian aid in cash worth ¥24 million to the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization for displaced people within Syria and Syrian refugees in Lebanon  respectively.China has been working to promote a peaceful settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue through dialogue. We have played a constructive role in seeking a comprehensive  lasting and appropriate solution to the Iranian nuclear issue so as to uphold the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East. The dialogue between Iran and the permanent members of the Security Council and Germany has created new opportunities. All the relevant parties should scale up diplomatic efforts and work for substantive progress in the dialogue at an early date.The Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East conflict. Guided by President Xi Jinping’s four-point proposal on resolving the Palestinian issue  China will continue to work for a comprehensive  just and durable solution to the issue.Thanks to the concerted efforts of all the relevant parties  tensions on the Korean peninsula are easing. Achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining long-term peace and stability on the peninsula will respond to the common interests of all parties concerned. It is China’s consistent position that a negotiated solution through dialogue is the right way to resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula  and the Six-Party Talks are an effective platform to promote denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Six-Party Talks. We hope that all parties will create conducive conditions  build consensus  work towards the same goal and resume the talks at an early date.International development cooperation is at a crucial stage  where we must build on past achievements to make new progress. China supports the continued and full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the early launch of intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The post-2015 development agenda should continue to focus on development and poverty elimination  give due consideration to national conditions and the various stages of development in the different countries  and respect their independent choice of development path. The agenda should give priority to strengthening global development partnerships; adhere to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities  equity and respective capabilities; improve follow-up mechanisms; step up development financing; promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation; and increase official development aid and technical support to developing countries.China welcomes the positive outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Doha in late 2012. China hopes that the developed countries will demonstrate political will and honour their commitments by scaling up emissions-reduction efforts and providing capital  technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. The Chinese Government takes climate change seriously  and the many forceful policy measures it has taken have resulted in notable progress. China will continue to play its due role in addressing global climate change.Time flies. We will soon be celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Born out of the ashes of the Second World War  the United Nations embodies the yearning of the peoples of all countries for world peace and global development. The Chinese dream is a dream of prosperity for the country and happiness for the people; it has much in common with the dream of people across the world. As a responsible Member of the United Nations  China is ready to work with all other Member States to faithfully adhere to the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations  faithfully carry out its historic mission and continue to make relentless efforts to advance the noble cause of peace and development for humankind."
"34",1367,"CIV",68,2013,"Like the Heads of State and Government who have spoken before me  I would like  on behalf of the delegation of Côte D’Ivoire and on my own behalf  to address my sincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also wish in particular to thank Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon for his leadership of the Organization and his commitment to world peace and development. I take this opportunity to reiterate to him  in the name of my counterparts in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  our gratitude for his personal involvement in the resolution of conflicts in Africa and especially in the subregion of West Africa.Before touching on the topic of today’s debate  in taking the floor for the second time before the Assembly I would like to reaffirm the gratitude of the Ivorian people for the efforts of the United Nations and the international community on our behalf. Indeed  thanks to that invaluable support  Côte d’Ivoire is now hard at work and has returned to the path of economic and social development for the well-being of all Ivorians. My country is in a period of full reconstruction after establishing credible and democratic institutions following free  transparent elections. National reconciliation and political dialogue are under way in a climate of peace. We are aware of the challenges that remain  but we are on the right path.The theme for this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  calls on us all individually and collectively to consider our capacity to meet the development challenge. As we approach the 2015 target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  it should be noted that significant progress has been achieved by most countries  and we welcome the determination of all Governments to continue their efforts to meet the Millennium commitments. Although much remains to be done and the progress made can mask various national and regional realities  the current trend appears to be irreversible  despite a particularly difficult economic environment. We must seek to build on the positive outcomes that have been achieved in a number of areas  such as primary school enrolment  vaccinations and slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS. We must also resolve issues of food security  drought  access to drinking water and combating poverty  which continue to be major concerns for our States.By adopting the Millennium Development Goals  we have the collective responsibility and ambition to improve the living conditions of our fellow citizens and thereby accelerate the development of our countries. As far as my country  Côte d’Ivoire  is concerned  progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals  which was deadlocked because of the sociopolitical crisis  has today gained new momentum  thanks to the sound performance of our economy. It is in that favourable climate that the Government has established an ambitious reconstruction programme  which is based on the national development plan for the period 2012-2015. Social investments being a priority in that programme  the programme allocates substantial amounts to education  health and basic social infrastructure. The Government has also made job creation a national priority  in particular jobs for young people  and its goal is to create 200 000 jobs a year  which is a considerable number given the size of our country. As we assess what has been accomplished  we must face the fact that the world needs greater solidarity to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore  we must adopt a comprehensive approach that will enable our countries to create sustainable development models that are more equitable and more respectful of our differences. The African continent  which lags behind in the effort to achieve the Goals by 2015  can nevertheless count on an increasing share in the global economy because of its growth rate. My country therefore supports the definition of a post-2015 agenda to forge a new consensus regarding a new generation of sustainable development goals  based on the Millennium Development Goals.The world we seek will not come about unless we meet the challenge of peace and security  as well as that of democracy  through a return to the values of the Charter of the United Nations. Too many wars and conflicts continue to tear humankind apart  undermining development efforts in numerous countries. We must collectively put an end to that situation by ensuring that we serve the interests of the people exclusively  using the tools we already have. It is by renewing the foundations of our solidarity that we will be able to counter new threats  such as terrorism  cross-border crime  drug and arms trafficking  human trafficking and piracy at sea.The attack of a rare violence that occurred in our brother country  Kenya  is an example of those threats  and reminds us of the urgent need for collective action against the threat of terrorism. We condemn in the strongest possible terms that despicable and barbarous act  which shows that the fight against terrorism is ongoing and calls for new methods of security. In these times of great suffering  I would like  on behalf of my country and West Africa  to convey to the brotherly people of Kenya and its President our compassion and support.International governance must become more democratic and increasingly embody the universal consensus and the values of our nations. Indeed  the world must be able to recognize itself in its multilateral institutions in order to effectively deal with the hazards of this new century.West Africa is aware of the threat posed to its development  the deterioration in the security environment and the proliferation of new factors of instability. Accordingly  the Heads of State of ECOWAS are rightly doing everything possible  with the support of the international community  in a determined effort to re-establish and maintain peace in our region. For that reason  we welcomed with the utmost satisfaction the re-establishment of the territorial integrity of Mali and the successful holding of presidential elections in that country. That success must not hide the major challenges still facing our region. I therefore call upon the international community to learn from the conflict in Mali and to support ECOWAS and the African Union in implementing a coherent and proactive security policy. Terrorism in the Sahel region is spreading to such an extent that entire expanses are outside the authority of States. The threat goes beyond the borders of the African continent and demands a concerted international response in keeping with the stakes involved. I would like to encourage donors and our traditional partners to provide their support to the United Nations and to our States within the framework of this strategy. We welcome the announcement of the upcoming visit of the Secretary-General and the President of the World Bank to the Sahel region in order to mobilize the entire international community and the financial institutions. If we want to end the cycle of politico-military crises in West Africa  Guinea-Bissau must also receive international support  so that we can build upon the current inclusive transition and enable the Government to organize democratic elections next November. For that reason  on behalf of ECOWAS  I call upon the international community to contribute to the financing of general elections in that country.In closing  I would like to remind our Assembly that in order to meet the challenges of international peace and security  we must redouble our efforts to deliver on the commitments made at United Nations conferences and summits. The right to development must become a reality for all  as set out in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which was unanimously adopted in September 2000. We must all draw lessons from the shortcomings of the past in order to rebuild the world gloriously for ourselves  our children and our children’s children."
"35",1410,"CMR",68,2013,"Allow me at the outset to convey to all present the apologies of His Excellency Paul Biya  President of the Republic of Cameroon  who wanted to participate in the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly but was not able to owing for constraints relating to the national political calendar. He instructed me to read out the following message:“As President Ashe takes the reins of the General Assembly  the United Nations is entering a critical period that should lead to the defining of the international development agenda that will follow the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Aware of his vast responsibility and the tremendous amount of work he will be facing during this session  I would like to convey to him the sincere congratulations of my country in connection with his election to preside over the Assembly and wish him every success in this challenging but rewarding undertaking. His vast experience in the area of diplomacy  which was made clear when he presided over the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Group of 77 and China  ensures a fruitful outcome to our present deliberations and to the work of the General Assembly for the 12 months ahead.“Those same qualities were the major strengths of his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  and I should like here to commend his dynamic and effective presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.“Lastly  I would extend our sense of satisfaction to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts in the service of peace and economic and social development worldwide.“This session is beginning in a context marked by the bloody terrorist acts committed in a mall in Nairobi  Kenya  several days ago. This is for me an opportunity to strongly condemn those acts of violence and to convey to the people and the Government of that brotherly country the deepest condolences of the people and the Government of Cameroon.“Let me  on a more optimistic note  welcome the end of the crisis in Mali  which resulted in the democratic election of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. The end of that process  which had the welcome support of the international community  represents a milestone in peacebuilding  security  national reconciliation and development in that country.“As I noted at the start of my remarks  throughout this session we must reflect deeply on the post-2015 development agenda. During the 2010 high-level debate  we noted that while progress made in achieving some of the MDGs  significant disparities persisted between countries and between regions.“We noted that  despite the progress  at the current pace of implementation very few countries would achieve all the MDGs by the deadline. With two years to go  we must point out that it will be difficult for Cameroon to achieve some of the Goals. Substantial progress has been made in reaching some of the targets. In the area of health care  which is considered to be the catalyst for economic and social development  with a view to reducing poverty  my country remains committed to the effort to combat the AIDS pandemic. The allocation of substantial resources to the fight against that disease  the distribution of free antiretroviral drugs  the effective care of the sick and the implementation of an efficient prevention programme  including the transmission from mother to child  have led to a considerable decline in the rate of HIV infection in Cameroon. From 10.5 per cent in 2000  the rate dropped to 4.3 per cent in 2012  a decline of more than 50 per cent. “Another genuine source of satisfaction for Cameroon is the progress made in the area of education. The Government has strived to continue and strengthen the numerous efforts to ensure primary education for all Cameroonians. I would underscore that the national target is to provide to all children — boys and girls — throughout Cameroon  the resources to achieve a complete primary schooling cycle. The implementation of the sectoral strategy on education has led to clear progress in the implementation of the education policy. I can mention  among other things  the expansion of school infrastructure  the improvement in the teacher-student ratio  the reduction in the number of students who repeat a school year and the improvement of girls’ education. The result of those actions is that the Cameroon today has one of the highest literacy rates in sub-Saharan Africa  with an enrolment rate of nearly 100 per cent. “But the same progress has not been achieved with respect to the targets of the other Goals. That is the case for most developing countries  including Cameroon. Hence the need to further our thinking that began in Rio de Janeiro in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and  as the President wished  to set the stage for the post-MDG development agenda. That thinking should be based on a clear assessment of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in the implementation of the MDGs in order to consider the prospects for the future international framework. “The full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals faces structural difficulties for some and temporary difficulties for others. They include climate change  the financial crisis and food insecurity. Those difficulties raise a number of important questions about how the MDGs were formulated. Were we too ambitious? Was the 2015 deadline realistic? Would an effective follow-up and support mechanism for States not have been necessary? Did we give ourselves adequate resources to ensure implementation? Clearly  Millennium Development Goal 8 — ‘develop a global partnership for development’ — was the beginning of an answer to the last point. However  that Goal will also be difficult to achieve by 2015.“All the MDGs will probably not all be achieved by 2015. We should  however  acknowledge that the programme will enable the achievement of clear progress in many areas. It has allowed us to convey the very complex language of development in clear objectives accessible to all and enabled every one to articulate simple requirements and needs to their Government. We should safeguard those achievements in framework of the post-2015 agenda. “The post-2015 agenda should also take into account the viewpoint of developing countries  which are the primary targets. In that regard  I congratulate the United Nations for having initiated a broad and inclusive process of consultations to garner the views of all  in particular those of academics and civil society organizations  with respect to the MDGs and the framework that will follow them. Consultations of that kind have been held in Cameroon. They have enabled civil society to issue recommendations for the post-MDG framework. Those recommendations are in keeping with the MDGs in terms of strengthening the actions to undertake in order to provide universal access to primary education  to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to improve access to water and sanitation.“Furthermore  in the context of the next programme  my country believes that particular focus should be placed on creating decent jobs as an engine of economic growth and sustainable development. It is in that context that  in 2010  Cameroon crafted a strategy document for growth and employment. That document is part of Cameroon’s shared development vision to 2035  through which the economic performance of my country will lead to concrete results in terms of creating jobs  reducing poverty and significantly improving the living conditions of our people  especially for women and youth. “While the creation of decent jobs should  according to Cameroon  occupy a central position  environmental issues should not be neglected. In accordance with the spirit of Rio de Janeiro  those issues will make it possible to determine the future we want for humankind and to work seriously to bring it about.“To ensure that new development goals will be achieved by the established deadline  coherent national initiatives must be supported by an effective global partnership. Therefore  in addition to the provisions that may be taken at the international level by donors — increased pledges  concessional loans  debt swaps  debt restructuring and debt cancellation — and at the national level by developing countries  it is crucial that control be better maintained over the financial and raw materials markets in order to enable countries to better withstand external shocks.“We should also consider the possibility of setting up a support fund for implementing the new development programme  as well as regular follow-up mechanisms at the international and regional levels for achieving each goal. “Beyond the difficulties I have already noted  the MDGs  like the future international development framework  can be optimally achieved only if an appropriate security environment is ensured. Unfortunately  developing countries  and Africa in particular  continue to be a stage for many conflicts. “The situation in the Central African Republic  that in the eastern part of the Democratic People’s Republic of the Congo and the turmoil following the crises of the Arab Spring in North Africa are all sources of concern that could jeopardize the development efforts undertaken by the States involved. With respect to the political  security and humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic in particular  which has reached proportions unprecedented in the history of that country  Cameroon and other States of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) have shouldered their responsibilities by sending troops to Bangui to stabilize the situation. Similarly  we have actively contributed to the establishment of a road map that should enable them to restore normal constitutional order within 18 to 24 months. “Cameroon calls on the international community to support the efforts of the Central African subregion  in particular in order to quickly operationalize the international support mission for the Central African Republic and to mobilize humanitarian assistance commensurate with the problems the country faces. “Those political  security and humanitarian crises are compounded by recurrent acts of banditry  such as abductions of civilians and maritime piracy. The development of the latter criminal activity  which poses a threat to international trade  has reached alarming proportions. According to the International Maritime Bureau  the number of acts of piracy identified along the coast of West Africa in 2012 exceeded for the first time the number of attacks in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.“To deal with that problem  Yaounde  Cameroon’s capital  hosted on 24 and 25 June  in accordance with Security Council resolution 2039 (2012)  of 29 February 2012  a joint summit of the Economic Community of Central Africa States  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Commission of the Gulf of Guinea (GGC) on maritime safety and security in the Gulf of Guinea. This was aimed at combatting piracy  armed robbery and other illegal activities perpetrated in the maritime space of the Gulf of Guinea.“The Heads of State and Government of ECCAS  ECOWAS and the CGG  meeting together for the first time since the establishment of those three institutions  decided to set up an interregional coordination centre to monitor anti-piracy efforts in their common maritime space and to pool their resources. The headquarters of the centre  whose purpose is to implement a regional strategy to combat piracy  armed robbery and other illicit acts in the Gulf of Guinea  was given to Cameroon. Everything is being done to make it operational as quickly as possible. I would here like to commend the assessment of the results of the summit by the United Nations and other strategic partners and their commitment to support the implementation of the resolutions Yaounde meeting.“As I pointed out on the occasion of the summit  in order to achieve the desired security objective  it will be necessary for all stakeholders to fully assume their role in the effective implementation of the instruments that the three organizations have put in place. As with the MDGs  the support of all of our strategic partners is crucial to effectively fight against piracy and other forms of insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea. “Anything that will promote the development of the region will contribute to improving global growth and security and represent significant progress towards ‘The future we want’ — a future of peace and prosperity for all.”"
"36",1454,"COD",68,2013,"When the nations of the world come together in the General Assembly to consider the major issues facing humankind  it is an honour and a privilege to take the floor and to express the viewpoint of one’s country. Animated by those twin sentiments  on behalf of the Congolese people I address the Assembly and through it the community of nations as a whole.At the outset  I wish to express my most sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-eighth session. I also congratulate the members of his Bureau. I further wish to hail his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for the outststanding way in which he fulfilled his term as President. I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his initiatives for peace and security throughout the world and for his personal involvement in seeking ways and means to bring peace and stability to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the entire Great Lakes region. His efforts are all the more commendable given the fact that the enemies of peace are always on the lookout  ready to strike anyone  anytime and anywhere  as we have unfortunately been recently reminded by the terrorist attack that brought such tragedy to the Republic of Kenya. On behalf of the Congolese Government and people and on my own behalf  I condemn that despicable act. We express our condolences and solidarity with the brotherly people and leaders of Kenya.We welcome the President’s choice of theme for this general debate  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He mentioned the equally relevant need to draw lessons from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  consider new and emerging development challenges  create measurable indicators  establish new types of partnership and better integrate the economic  social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. The importance of the theme chosen and the relevance of the indicators that accompany it are undeniable. Our thinking must be even more rigorous  as we witness several troubling elements in the international environment.With respect to organizing for the post-2015 period  the international community is increasingly witnessing non-compliance on the part of certain Members with the basic principles of international relations  persistent selfishness on the part of States and convulsions in the global economy. The consequences are manifold. They range from threats to peace to deadly conflicts and from globalization driven mainly by the unbridled pursuit of profit to the aggravation of poverty. That comes in addition to the food crisis  famines  diseases — including endemic diseases that had once disappeared and are now reappearing — and environmental destruction  which is the main cause of climate change and its deplorable effects.To remedy the situation  the General Assembly has established several bodies  and I welcome their creation: the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing and the high-level political forum to promote the implementation of recommendations and decisions on sustainable development. My hope is that that process will be consistent with the ongoing transformation of the Economic and Social Council and  beyond that  of the entire United Nations system  in order to better integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development  namely  the economic  social and environmental dimensions  in the new post-2015 agenda.The new programme that we are called upon to create must be universal  ambitious and able to meet the huge challenges facing humankind. It must bring about positive change  based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. In that respect  it is important to utilize the contribution of women  youth and civil society in both the design and the execution of the agenda. We should also draw lessons from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.With regard to climate change as an important issue to resolve in the post-2015 period  allow me to recall that  under the final document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288)  States pledged to abandon unsustainable long-term patterns of consumption and adopt sustainable ways of managing natural resources as the basis for economic and social development and the very future of humankind. Climate change is a threat to humankind and fundamental human rights  particularly for vulnerable populations and especially those from the African continent and island countries. Seeking to limit its impact is  for each of our countries  a responsibility that we must shoulder as a duty towards our people  a service to the human race and an act of international solidarity.Recognizing that fact  the Democratic Republic of Congo  a country of exceptional biodiversity  has always sought to manage its natural resources with a view to the future. The management policy for of our forest ecosystems is aimed at that. The Grand Inga project has also been designed along those lines. We should emphasize  in fact  that that project should eventually enable us to produce enough electricity to meet the energy needs of nearly half of Africa. It will also be clean and renewable energy  consistent with the requirements of sustainable development.Today we must begin to set the stage for the post-2015 period. In that context  I express the hope that proposals will be made during this session to translate into reality our common desire to promote the economic  social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Such proposals should cover our local  national and regional development programmes. They should also encourage bold international cooperation and reflect the will of each of our States to contribute to international peace and security.Without peace  no progress is possible. Without the minimum conditions for the safety of persons and property  all development is hypothetical. That is all the more unacceptable since a breach of the peace is the result of aggression. That is the sad recent history of my country.It is also important to remember other parallel truths that are often overlooked or hidden. Because we acted in solidarity by welcoming Rwandan refugees to our territory  the Congolese population in the eastern part of the country has been deprived of peace — a fundamental right of all persons — and they continue to count their dead. The most recent episode of the unending tragedy occurred when bombs crushed the women and children of Goma last July. It was truly a tragedy unequalled in history and which cannot leave any heart untouched. It is time to ask ourselves what will remain of international humanitarian law if welcoming refugees in distress  which is a humanitarian act par excellence  becomes sufficient reason to justify the eruption of war. The recent bombing of Goma was all the more reprehensible as it was perpetrated while the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was in the process of implementing the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework of Addis Ababa  including talks with the armed group responsible for the bombings. Nevertheless  I wish to reaffirm my country’s determination to comply with all of the commitments contained in the Framework agreement. From that perspective  my Government has already undertaken the following definitive actions: the establishment of the National Follow-up Mechanism to implement the commitments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the acceleration of security sector reform  especially the army  police and justice sectors; further progress in decentralization  by adopting the necessary implementation laws; the reform of public finance management; and the restructuring of the Independent National Election Commission. This last was immediately implemented in order to prioritize the organization of local  municipal  provincial  senatorial and provincial governor elections. A national dialogue has been organized  starting on 7 September  with the goal of seeking national cohesion to better respond to all of the challenges facing the country.Beyond those efforts on the part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the dawn of sustainable peace in the region depends on two main conditions — ending impunity in all its aspects  and the diligent execution of their commitments by the other signatories of the Framework agreement. Therefore  my country again urgently appeals to the Organization to deal with all Member States with equal rigour and to require that each one strictly respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It is clear that denouncing violations of those principles is a good thing  but punishing those who violate the principles is preferable by far  especially when those violations are ongoing and recurrent.I cannot conclude my remarks without expressing my thanks to the Southern African Development Community  the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  the African Union and the European Union for their essential role in maintaining peace in our region. I also thank the United Nations  in particular the members of the Security Council  and all of those States that have  for many years  remained at our side in order to ensure peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are all the more thankful to them  as they have participated in one of the breakthroughs of the post-2015 development agenda aimed at ensuring a better world for all.We must be convinced that beyond our differences lies a common future. Our diversity must be seen as the essential source of wealth that it is. It is high time that we  the international community  find the ways and means to enable millions of people to not simply live  but to live a life of dignity in a world where peace  security and justice are a reality for all."
"37",1501,"COG",68,2013,"At the beginning of this week  at the opening of the general debate  the international community strongly condemned the heinous attacks that have once again struck Kenya. That situation should lead us to reflect on our ability to prevent  manage and settle conflicts. Kenya’s tragedy is to be situated near the territory of Somalia  which for too long has been left to terrorist groups. The lesson is to avoid the creation of any vacuum that could serve as fertile ground for subversive movements. That is why in Central Africa the member States of the subregional community have reacted quickly to the risk of the “Somalization” of the Central African Republic ever since the beginning of the crisis there  despite our limited resources.The dialogue on the humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic that we  the partners of that ravaged country  held recently in New York  on 25 September  clearly indicated that the international community has taken stock of the challenge and has decided to resolutely provide assistance to the Central African Republic on the political  security  humanitarian  economic and financial levels  and to ensure that it has a successful transition  like that of Mali  a country which we commend and which deserves all our attention and solidarity today as it did yesterday.Therefore  beyond the humanitarian emergency  the Central African Republic must be given all the resources necessary to restore the authority of the State  enable its Administration to operate  revive the economy and prepare for elections. An international support mission in the Central African Republic is being established under African leadership. We encourage the Security Council to swiftly adopt a resolution supporting that initiative  which is aimed at creating the necessary conditions to restore peace and security  which would ensure the much-needed stability and the effective implementation of the transition road map. As a mediator and as chair of the follow-up committee of the Economic Community of Central African States on the situation in the Central African Republic monitoring that crisis  the Congo can only welcome that very encouraging development.Also in the context of my country’s neighbourhood  by participating in the signing of the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region  which took place on 24 February  President Denis Sassou Nguesso reaffirmed his commitment to a foreign policy aimed at peace and security in the world in general and in Africa  particularly in Central Africa and the Great Lakes Region. In doing so  he favoured the quest for peaceful solutions and showed his willingness to continue along that path. The various consultations he has initiated in the context of the implementation of the Framework agreement and the appeals directed to him demonstrate his approach.In that spirit  the Congo is pleased with the conclusions of the Second Meeting of States Parties to the Framework Agreement  which was held in New York on 23 September. We commend the leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  while we call for those efforts to culminate in talks in Kampala.Just two years ago  we welcomed the wave of popular uprisings — the so-called Arab Spring  which led to the fall of some political regimes in the Arab world  sometimes by force of arms. We welcomed those movements  just as we welcomed the enormous changes that transformed the European landscape after the fall of the Berlin wall  in 1989. Today  in view of the developments in some of those countries  whose populations aspired and still legitimately aspire to freedom  democracy and social justice  I cannot fail to recall the remarks that I made from this rostrum during the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly (see A/66/PV.27). I called then for greater caution and prudence  convinced that the overthrow of a political regime does not necessarily bring freedom and democracy  since they must be won and nurtured by other victories that cannot be imposed from the outside.The situations we have just mentioned are replete with lessons  not just because of the internal instability that may result from them  but also and above all because of their unpredictable negative impact on regional and international peace and security.It that regard  I shall mention other challenges to international peace and security  particularly those of the Syrian tragedy  which is unfolding relentlessly before our eyes  and the untenable Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which has consumed so many human lives and so much energy and time.With regard to the situation in Syria  my delegation strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons and welcomes the Syrian Government’s adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention and its decision to place its stockpile of chemical weapons under international control for destruction. Nevertheless  we believe that only a political solution can put an end to the martyrdom of the Syrian people and the fratricidal war that has already killed more than 100 000 people. That is why the Congo welcomes the United States-Russian agreement and the discussions under way in the Security Council on the adoption of a resolution that would mark the first steps in a process that will  we hope  in the near future  bring together the Syrian actors and all parties involved around a table in the framework of a conference for peace in Syria. In that regard  once again  we believe that the focus must be placed on finding a peaceful solution.At the same time as Syria is agreeing to eliminate its stockpile of chemical weapons  it is appropriate to recall one of the most serious threats to humankind — the nuclear danger. It is indeed urgent for the nuclear-weapon States  as well as for those that have other weapons of mass destruction  including biological weapons  to implement concrete measures enabling the elimination of those arsenals and making progress towards real disarmament  while ensuring respect for the prohibition of nuclear proliferation for military purposes. This is also the moment to commend the overtures made here by Iran concerning its nuclear programme.Last year  the Congo supported the General Assembly’s historic decision to confer United Nations non-Member observer State status on Palestine. It was a symbolic act that the Assembly welcomed almost unanimously. The new American initiative designed to relaunch the Israeli-Palestinian talks also deserves the support of the entire international community. Here too  the Congo encourages dialogue and rejects any recourse to force or violence.Given the current series of political crises and in the spirit of peace and justice  how can we fail to ask that the embargo unjustly imposed on the Cuban people for five decades be lifted? That unilateral decision is contrary to the principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations and to international order  based on non-interference in a State’s internal affairs and peaceful cooperation.The damage done by the economic and financial crisis that recently shook the world is far from being repaired; even if here and there we can see some signs of recovery  they are unfortunately not capable of relaunching sustained growth. The progress that about 40 developing countries have made has definitely led to some rebalancing of power  as the Human Development Report 2013 of the United Nations Development Programme indicates. However  the fruits of that growth are unequally distributed. Similarly  the disparities both within countries and between rich and poor countries once again raises the problem of inequality and social justice  which often causes social unrest. Between now and 2015 there will be numerous African countries that will not meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).For my own country  there has been significant progress in achieving the MDGs  especially those relating to education and maternal and child health  thanks to my Government’s efforts and initiatives in areas such as abolishing school fees  providing free textbooks  recruiting teachers and providing free Caesarean sections  vaccinations and antiretroviral treatments. However  progress has been somewhat slow in fighting poverty and promoting decent jobs. Nonetheless  combating poverty remains a major concern to which my Government accords high priority through investment programmes in health  education  professional training  infrastructure  agricultural production  forestry and mining.We have reasons to hope for progress between now and 2015. The national context is being prepared. The Republic of the Congo enjoys reassuring stability and a favourable economic environment. Lasting peace has been established. We are consolidating the democratic process  which is strengthened by a regular dialogue between the Government and the opposition on organizing peaceful elections. My country has also built a harmonious overall framework for implementing its development policy  focused on modernizing and industrializing the country on the basis of our national development plan for 2012-2016.The favourable rise in the price of petroleum products and other natural resources such as wood has enabled my country to register significant increases in its economic growth rate  now over 5 per cent per year since 2010  allowing for inflation. That economic improvement has notably benefited State revenues  which have been going up steadily. The Republic of the Congo has also benefited from substantial debt relief after reaching the completion point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in January 2010 and will from now on have more resources available for national development programmes  particularly in the social sectors.Structural reforms undertaken through the Extended Credit Facility of the International Monetary Fund have enabled us to make essential progress in managing the public finances and macroeconomic stabilization. The business climate continues to improve. Other measures have been taken to enable the Congo to speed up its achievement of the MDGs between now and 2015.The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) outlined for us “The future we want”. Ambassador Ashe  who was one of the co-facilitators of the Rio+20 process and is now the President of the General Assembly  is therefore well placed to help us to set the stage that will enable us to reach the horizon that is the future we want. “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” is the theme of the current session. It invites us to establish the foundations for another vision of development  focused on poverty eradication and human development. My delegation agrees with the President that what is needed is an ambitious  bold programme that takes new and emerging development challenges into account and that better integrates the economic  social and environmental aspects of sustainable development.The Congo  a country in the forested Congo basin  can only concur with that view. The Congo’s commitment to sustainable development at the national level  as well as at the regional and international levels  has been unflagging. It is in that context that  after having spoken for Africa throughout the Rio+20 process  the Congo has continued its active commitment within the framework of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Once those sustainable development goals have been defined  there remains the vital issue of how to finance sustainable development  which will be tackled by establishing a committee of experts on the issue.It is regrettable that the issue of climate change  which affects all humankind  is still suffering from a lack of consensus. Permit me to revisit a subject of deep concern for developing countries such as ours  namely  the issue of financing the fight against climate change  which should be a central element in our negotiations. For our part  we affirm the importance of supporting developing countries in establishing low-carbon regimes that can adapt to climate change in order to tackle the worldwide problem that humankind is facing.In regard to the programme entitled “Reducing Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Enhancing Environmental Services in Tropical Forests”  established by the International Tropical Timber Council  the Congo welcomes the consensus on the importance of participation by all countries  according to their capacity and national context  in the fight against deforestation  forest degradation and of increasing stocks of forest carbon  which is responsible for almost 20 per cent of total greenhouse-gas emissions. Our interest in conserving nature and protecting wildlife has impelled us to launch a fierce fight against poaching. In that context  next year the Congo is organizing a major international meeting on combating that scourge. Participants will include political and technical stakeholders involved in wildlife management  countries that buy wildlife products  and international organizations.The world has changed  and we must deal with the new geopolitical challenges that have helped new forces to emerge onto the international scene. Every living organism must evolve. The United Nations  which we would like to see become more transparent  dynamic and democratic  cannot avoid that law of nature.As President John F. Kennedy noted as early as in 1963  at the eighteenth session of the General Assembly “The United Nations cannot survive as a static Organization. Its obligations are increasing as well as its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its customs. The authors of that Charter did not intend that it be frozen in perpetuity.” (A/PV.1209  p. 7)We are therefore at the heart of an important and timely debate.United Nations reform is therefore urgent and possible. It must be based on the principles of democracy  justice and equality. In that regard  the cycle of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council should lead  through a consensual framework  to concrete results. That reform is part of the will of the Member States to make the Organization an institution that expresses the values of modernity and is open to the future  a sanctuary for builders of the future of the world  a world where planetary challenges require concerted global solutions  a world that is being built on the bedrock of solidarity  unity  mutual respect and tolerance."
"38",1548,"COL",68,2013,"I should like to depart slightly from protocol and start my statement by speaking about a humble woman  a Colombian named María Zabala  who has to bear the burden of immense pain in her heart day in and day out. Two decades ago  armed members of illegal groups arrived outside her house located on the Colombian Caribbean coast  determined to impose their rule of terror. In front of her and her small children  they murdered her husband and two other relatives. They forced her to leave her house and then they burned everything down. She barely managed to remove the corpses from the ashes. She buried them right there and fled from her parcel of land with her children and without any belongings. All she carried was the immense weight of her tragedy.Today  María Zabala is a courageous and inspiring leader  a leader of victims  who is working for peace in my country. In Colombia  sadly  there are many thousands of cases like María Zabala’s. It is estimated that over the past 50 years  over 220 000 people died because of the conflict. That is more than twice the death toll of the Bosnian war in the former Yugoslavia  which was an open and ruthless conflict that moved the entire world. And to that  we would have to add the injured  the people mutilated by anti-personnel mines  those who have suffered the infamy of kidnapping and those uprooted from their own land  who could amount to almost 5 million people.That is the harsh and ugly reality of a conflict that unfortunately persists to this day. It is the oldest and the last conflict in the western hemisphere. In spite of the conflict  Colombia has achieved unprecedented progress in recent years on matters of security  in the fight against poverty and inequality  and in its economic performance. We have achieved much — a great deal — in the midst of a confrontation. Imagine how much more we could have done without the confrontation. And I must confess to the Assembly that for me  as the head of the Government  it would have been easy to continue to move forward on the path that we were on and to leave the conflict unresolved  because waging war — and I know how to wage war — is easier than seeking peace.It would have been easier  but not responsible  because continuing to coexist with the conflict would be like sentencing millions of people to many more years of violence  fear  poverty and victimization. It would not be responsible towards Latin America or towards the world  as they also suffer  in different ways  from the effects of the Colombian conflict. And it would not be responsible towards my own conscience  because we have the best possible opportunity before us today — a real opportunity  and maybe the last — to put an end to the conflict. I could not die in peace if I failed to do everything within my power to seize the opportunity presented. My generation has not seen a single day of peace  and my dream is for my children and the children of all Colombians to have the opportunity to know peace. I hope that the guerrilla forces understand that the time has come to leave this 50-year confrontation behind; that the time has come to move from bullets to votes  from weapons to discussion; that the time has come for them to continue their struggle  but within democracy.Today  before the General Assembly  we Colombians want to thank the international community for the support we have received in the endeavour to bring an end to our conflict through dialogue. With the world as our witness  we wish to assert our right to achieve the peace. We are tired of being afraid  we are tired of violence  we are tired of a conflict that pits the children of the same nation against each other and delays our development. María Zabala is one victim among many  all of whom are entitled to justice  truth and reparations and to not seeing history repeat itself. That is what we are working on in our country.My Government has promoted our most ambitious bill yet  recognizing and compensating victims in the midst of a conflict. I had the honour of ratifying that bill in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. But our commitment goes beyond serving the victims of the past; our most urgent obligation today is to eliminate the possibility of new victims being claimed by the conflict. Our obligation is to end the conflict now and to ensure that the spiral of violence and pain will not continue to recur. We are doing that in accordance with our democratic tradition — of course respecting  as we always have  the rule of law — and in compliance with our international obligations. We wish to achieve an end to our conflict without relinquishing justice  much less the truth and due care of the victims. I take this opportunity to offer my thoughts to the General Assembly on the role of the United Nations and the multilateral organizations in our peace process and its future implementation. The subject is relevant and current  since Colombia is possibly the first country in the world to engage in a process of that nature since the entry into force of the Rome Statute  which will make us a model for other cases where dialogue is given priority over armed solutions  as should be the case. Former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour of Canada recently stated that international doctrine had not been successful in finding practical answers as to how to resolve the real tension that exists between peace and justice in a negotiation process. Ms. Arbour recalled examples  such as International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  which had been given immense resources but had yielded very poor results.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  established in 1994  has managed to dispose of only 40 cases out of the nearly 800 000 murders committed in a single year. In 20 years  the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has resolved barely 100 cases.Therefore  how can we simultaneously achieve the end of armed conflict  fulfil our obligation to investigate and prosecute and realize the rights of victims? That dilemma must be confronted with honesty and seriousness  and that is what we are doing in Colombia.We have adopted an integrated strategy for transitional justice that addresses the issues of truth  justice and reparations  which we hope will enable us to make the transition towards peace. We can say that we have been pioneers in the implementation of transitional justice measures in the midst of conflict  giving priority to satisfying the rights of victims. No one in my country wants the perpetuation of violence.What we are asking from the United Nations and the international community is that both Colombia’s and every nation’s right to seek peace be respected We ask for continued support in that effort  along with respect for our decisions and our approach  with confidence in the fact that our actions have never deviated from the values of the international community.We cannot investigate every action committed over half a century of violence  prosecute each and every one of those responsible and then find ourselves unable to follow through. But what we can do is to build a realistic and transparent strategy that may satisfy the rights of all the victims in the best possible way. If we understand justice and the fight against impunity in a transition as a set of measures aimed at satisfying the victims and not just as the administration of criminal processes  it will be possible to find a comprehensive solution for everyone. I refer to measures such as genuinely establishing the facts of events  the acknowledgment of responsibility  the recovery of trust  access to reparations  and measures aimed at ensuring that there will be no recurrence. In that way justice becomes — as it should be — a support for  rather than an obstacle to  peace.I want to be clear: there will be no impunity for crimes against humanity or war crimes committed in a systematic fashion. On the contrary  this is the first time that Colombia is seriously assuming the obligation of fighting impunity for crimes committed in our armed conflict. The purpose is not to sacrifice justice to achieve peace  but rather to achieve peace with maximum justice. I am saying that out of deep conviction. There is much at stake  that is  no less than an end to the half-century long conflict  as well as the fate of 47 million Colombians.We have been involved in talks for one year now  but we have reached agreements on just one of the six items on the agenda. I am still optimistic  but the patience of the Colombian people is not infinite. The guerrillas will have to decide whether they opt for an honourable and lasting peace  or whether they will continue to wage war. From this rostrum  I call upon them to understand that history has led us to this decisive moment. The time for decisions has come. If we leave empty-handed  we will doom our nation to many more years of bloodshed and pain. We cannot miss this opportunity.Future generations and history will not forgive us.Moreover  our conflict  with all its violence and cruelty  has been affected by a poisonous scourge that fuels it and is fuelled by it: drug trafficking. That illicit activity has been the main funding source for violence and terrorism in my country — and I would say in the whole world as well in recent times. Without the grim influence of drug trafficking  which fuels the fires of our war  I am certain that the war would already have ended. That is why we have included the topic of illicit drugs as a specific item in the agenda of the discussions with the guerrillas.If we manage to have the guerrillas change sides  once they have demobilized  and become an ally of the State in order to definitively curb drug trafficking and eliminate illegal crops  just imagine what could be accomplished. A Colombia without coca crops and without a conflict was once a utopia and an impossible dream  but it is one that we can now realize for the benefit not only of Colombians but of the whole world.Almost a half century ago  in this very place  the Convention that gave birth to the war on drugs was adopted. Today we must recognize that that war has not been won. I say that as the President of the country that has suffered the most deaths  the most bloodshed  the most sacrifices in that war  and also the country that has achieved the most results in the fight against this scourge and the mafias that underpin it. Last year  when chairing the Summit of the Americas  fully aware of that dilemma  I led a proposal to debate and explore different scenarios in the fight against the global drug problem  aimed at evaluating what we are doing and at seeking ways to be more effective. We commissioned the Organization of American States to conduct studies with experts  academics and people with different approaches on how to face the problem. Those studies were delivered to us in May. Different Governments are evaluating them and they should serve as inputs for discussions at all universities and think tanks  and in the context of different forums  not just from Latin America but from the whole world  because it is a global problem that requires a global solution. Because of that — because it is a global problem — we expect their conclusions to also be discussed in this body  the United Nations  which has already called for a special session on the drug problem to be convened in 2016. If we act together on the drug problem and adopt a new  modern and comprehensive vision that is free of ideological or political bias  imagine how much harm and violence we will be able to prevent. I am not just speaking about harm to people  but also harm to nature  because drug trafficking has become a major destroyer of our tropical forests and forests in general  in what can be termed a veritable ecocide.Colombia is deeply committed to environmental protection. At the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development  we put forward the proposal to establish sustainable development goals as a mandatory benchmark in the development agenda for the coming decades. We are taking an active part in the design of those goals  and they can and should be incorporated into a visionary and ambitious development agenda for all countries as of 2015. In fact  we were a member of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  convened by the Secretary-General and co-chaired by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  David Cameron  which has already presented its report. Colombia  for its part  is continuing to do a great deal. For example  a few weeks ago  we doubled the area of the largest national park in Colombia  the Chiribiquete National Natural Park  located in the very heart of our Amazon region. We designated that area a natural reserve and prohibited mining and deforestation activities in an area roughly the size of Belgium  and not just in any place  but in the area where the Amazon region has the greatest biological and cultural diversity. This very morning we are launching  with the Prime Minister of Norway and five other countries  the New Climate Economy initiative. With the support of the most respected research institutes  we will seek the best way of making economic efficiencies and the fight against poverty compatible with the preservation of the environment. In that way we are shouldering our responsibilities with respect to climate change  which has already had an impact on Colombians. We will protect the sources of oxygen and water necessary not just for Colombia’s survival but that of the entire planet.I will conclude by stating that in my country we are working and will continue to work to prevent the plight of María Zabala and millions of other victims from ever recurring. Never again! I hope that the President of Colombia will come to the Assembly next year bearing the good news that the conflict has come to an end."
"39",1588,"COM",68,2013,"At the outset  let me convey to the United States authorities our full gratitude for the always warm and fraternal hospitality they show us at this great annual event in New York at the United Nations. I also express my sincere congratulations to the President  and I wish him every success and an excellent conduct of the work of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on the post-2015 development agenda. Finally  on behalf of my delegation and myself  I join the other heads of delegations present in the Hall to express my full gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his willingness to serve our world with the commitment and self-sacrifice for which he is known. At a time when the world is facing the most serious kinds of crises  blind barbaric terrorist acts  which we strongly condemn  have just been perpetrated in Kenya  claiming dozens of innocent victims  including women and children. At a time when armed conflicts are challenging our common abilities to build a world where peace reigns  the crisis that has been evolving in Syria for two and a half years  with its litany of distress and human tragedy  should call on us to reach an early settlement of the conflict and put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people. We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons in Syria against innocent populations  just as we vigorously condemn the perpetrators of that horrible act. Let me formally draw our attention to other crises and other evils that  while they may appear to us to be minor or insignificant  are also every bit as serious. They are serious particularly because they lead to a heavy loss of human lives and  for those who live with them daily  they frequently give rise to frustration  scorn and a sense of abandonment. At the same time  those other evils actually should not even exist  because it was together in the United Nations that our predecessors unanimously  in a spirit of the equality of peoples  universal justice  fairness and humanism  decided with an open heart and free spirit to make humankind more harmonious for the well-being of our species. Indeed  it was our Organization that decided to decolonize all territories under the colonial yoke. It set the rules  laid out a path  and supported the peoples to be freed. Let me also pay tribute to the permanent members of the Security Council and to all States Members of the United Nations for the responsible attitude they have demonstrated since the creation of the United Nations to the present time in supporting national liberation movements and organizations  particularly in our continent of Africa. It is  however  regrettable that  68 years after its inception and after the adoption of the Charter  the Assembly continues to bear witness today to a situation in which the territory of a small island State — in this case my own country  the Comoro Archipelago — remains under the thumb of another State  a major Power and a permanent member of the Security Council — the State of France. And yet the Organization came out unequivocally in favour of the independence of the Comoro Archipelago  in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  and 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970  containing the Plan of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Furthermore  resolutions 3161 (XXVIII) of 14 December 1973 and 3291 (XXIX) of 13 December 1974 reaffirm the unity and territorial and integrity of the Comorian islands and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination and independence.Thus  the Security Council  through its unanimous adoption of resolution 376 (1975) of 17 October 1975  recommended to the General Assembly that the Comoros be admitted to membership in the United Nations. The Comoros therefore became a Member of the United Nations  under resolution 3385 (XXX) of 12 November 1975  which reaffirms the need to respect the unity and integrity of the Comoro Archipelago  composed of the islands of Anjouan  Grande Comore  Mayotte and Mohéli. I recall that all Member countries  including the European countries  voted in favour of that resolution. France did not oppose it.Can those who lead our States and Governments  guarantors of the independence and integrity of their territory  imagine the frustration and moral torture of a Head of State who has to deal with such a tragic situation on a daily basis? In addressing them  I am letting my heart speak. They may rest assured that all my fellow citizens do the same daily. What have we  the Comorian people  done that is so serious that history does not treat us as it does all other peoples of the world? Why must we time and time again explain or justify the united nature of our people  its history  its geography or its culture? Moreover  when some seek to persuade us that it is because a part of our population supposedly expressed a desire to remain colonized  we sincerely wonder if they are trying to relive the Berlin Conference of 1885. If that were indeed the case  are we to understand that these same people would seek to raise that issue with all peoples who wish to remain themselves or change their destiny? Since it is the desire of all people to strive for freedom  what would happen if one day the Comorian people of Mayotte called for its freedom from France? What a historical inconsistency that would be  and what norms of international law would the Organization act on?Since 6 July 1975  the date on which my country  the Comoros Archipelago  acceded to its sovereignty  the Comorians have continued to call simply for the implementation of international law. They have done so in vain. And yet  in other similar cases  certain major Powers demand compliance with the same international law and win their case. Thus  the movement of peoples among the islands of the Comoros Archipelago  which is an inalienable right  is impeded by an unfathomable and unacceptable decision of the French authorities who  in 1994  imposed a visa on travel between Mayotte and the three other Comorian islands. That visa system has to date led to the death of nearly 10 000 of my fellow citizens  making the strait that separates Mayotte and the other islands the largest marine cemetery in the world. Our common conscience requires that we act quickly.In all international forums  including the United Nations  the international community  while recognizing the right of the Comorians to recover their territorial integrity  has repeatedly called upon the two parties involved  the Comoros and France  to enter into negotiations in order to find a lasting and equitable solution to this unfortunate territorial dispute in accordance with international law. Each of my predecessors in turn undertook negotiations with the French State  but it is undeniable that we are still at square one.Since I was elected President of the Republic  I have thought a great deal about the issue and consulted widely. The responsibilities I have assumed require changing a game that has remained unchanged now for 38 years. After an initial meeting with my French counterpart  President François Hollande  in Kinshasa  on the sidelines of the Summit of La Francophonie  I understood that the new French authorities were at long last ready to find a solution to the issue of the Comoros. I noted and acknowledge that France today is prepared to play its historic role as a State that is respectful of international law  regardless of what that law may say on any particular subject. What France has recently done for Mali is the most eloquent example of that. On that note  let me join the Malian authorities and people and the African continent in general to thank the French authorities who took the responsible decision to ensure that the armed forces of the Republic of Chad and the countries in the West African region join the French armed forces in helping Mali recover its unity and territorial integrity. I take this opportunity also to welcome the presence among us here of His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita  President of the Republic of Mali  and express our joy in sharing with the brother people of Mali the sense of pride at their having recovered the integrity of their territory.Move by the same ideal and the same hope of seeing my country recover its territorial integrity  I warmly welcomed the invitation from President François Hollande to carry out a working visit to France in order to undertake serious negotiations and give a new impetus to our relations  particularly on the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte. In the wake of that visit  we signed and issued a political declaration  the so-called Paris Declaration. Before my visit  I consulted the Chairperson of the African Union Commission in order to ensure that our latest effort was in keeping with the principles upheld by our continental organization and also to consult her expertise. I take this opportunity to express all our gratitude to Ms. Dlamini-Zuma  Chairperson of the African Union Commission  for her ongoing support to our country. In thus expressing myself  I call on the entire international community to bear witness to my request that the Secretary-General provide his expertise  support and backing throughout the negotiations for the new dynamic to which we and the French have resolutely committed. I would like to inform the General Assembly that the issue of Mayotte will henceforth be on our agenda every year and that we  the Comorian authorities  are commited to reporting every year on the course of the negotiations until a lasting settlement is found to the issue of the sovereignty of my country. My country calls on the United Nations and other international organizations with which we are affiliated — including the African Union  the International Organization of La Francophonie  the League of Arab States  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Indian Ocean Commission — to provide us with their full support during the negotiations.A high joint council  the follow-up body to the Paris Declaration that I mentioned previously  will be established in the weeks ahead. It will begin its work this year by considering the problem of the movement of goods and persons in order to put an irreversible end to the human tragedies that daily afflict all Comorian families.Never has our world has been so close to achieving the objective for which we  the world’s leaders  meet in this United Nations temple at least once a year. That goal  as the United Nations Charter stipulates  is to maintain international peace and security. It would therefore be appropriate for me  before I conclude my statement  to commend the efforts of the international community that have led to considerable progress in Madagascar  thereby opening the path to the forthcoming presidential elections in that great brother country. In order to ensure that “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  which is the theme of the sixty-eighth session  is not just one more pipe dream  we need to act quickly to shelter our peoples from fear and need. Let us dare to fight injustice. Let us dare to put an end to deadly conflict. Let us dare to make peace our daily struggle and our sole reason for being  so that humankind may live in harmony."
"40",1627,"CPV",68,2013,"I would first like to salute you  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Mr. President  we are sure you will bring all your experience and wisdom to bear in the conduct of our debates and in carrying out the General Assembly’s important tasks.At the outset  I would like to commend the remarkable work the United Nations has done so that we have the opportunity to advance the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to work together today to set a new post-2015 development agenda. Indeed  that is a global challenge that  besides inaugurating a new era in global development  challenges us to meet the eight Millennium Development Goals. The focus of this session  as was declared by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  is fairness and dignity for all  a task that challenges everyone and requires new attitudes and behaviours  based on the premise that a better world is possible.Cape Verde  a small island developing State that has been independent for less than 39 years  has already achieved most of the targets envisioned and will continue its efforts to meet all the Millennium Development Goals. Thanks to a transformation agenda that we have been promoting since 2001  when Cape Verde was on the list of least developed countries  our nation has made significant progress in the socioeconomic and political arenas and has improved the people’s overall standard of living. Our focus on and investment in access to education  health care  water and food have been clear  unambiguous and systematic  as have our efforts to competitively integrate our economy into the international market  with the support of our international partners.At the same time  the transformation agenda  which is fully aligned with our MDG commitments and targets  has created the conditions for Cape Verde’s historic transition to the realm of middle-income countries  although  owing to the strong impact of the international crisis  which has to some extent put the brakes on the momentum of the country’s ongoing progress  it still falls within the lower-middle-income scale. Our indicators show that we have reduced poverty by half  and it is clearly on a downward trend. Our current challenge is the close monitoring essential to preventing any setbacks that might result from the global economic situation and its impact on Cape Verde. In fact  despite our graduation to middle-income-country status  our indicators still show high rates of poverty  inequality and unemployment  as well as insufficient access to many goods and services  and we are still short of our goal of achieving well-being and and a high standard of living for all our people.Cape Verdeans are ready to push for the evolution of the terms of the Millennium Development Goals and replace “reducing” extreme poverty with “eradicating” it  leaving none behind. Moreover  we in Cape Verde are ready to put the issue of economic sustainability at the centre of the country’s development agenda and have already begun to do so. We recognize that “transformation” in Cape Verde is more than a key word; it is an agenda for work stemming from inclusive growth. In addition  we have been creating accountable institutions  open to all  in order to ensure good governance. Based on that perspective  we have refocused our internal policy  and are thus mobilizing our national will while appealing for support from our international partners  towards the goal of reaching advanced-development status by 2030. That is what it means for us to commit to a post-2015 agenda.We are currently in a transition period. The instruments we have created on our own are not enough to respond to the questions of today or to prepare for a future moving towards advanced development  unless that is a part of a global agenda led by the United Nations and involving intensive international cooperation and partnership at both the multilateral and bilateral levels. Cape Verde is committed to that joint effort. Cape Verdeans are deeply focused on global issues  such as climate change  hunger and malnutrition and the various forms of inequality  as well as the importance of ensuring environmental sustainability and national and international partnerships in support of global development.Climate change is a pressing problem of our times that must be addressed with urgency and a great sense of responsibility. The world has reached record highs in terms of emissions and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  which is now at about 400 parts per million. That could mean the destruction of our development efforts and  even worse  the serious exacerbation of social tensions  which could potentially open the door to both national and regional conflicts. Similarly  the effects of climate change on global food security should be stressed. Ocean acidification is increasing at a rate that has not been seen in 55 million years. Ultimately  the disappearance of numerous marine species has become inevitable. We must all confront this issue  which endangers our common future  and take the necessary decisions  fulfilling our financial commitments aimed at adaptation  particularly in the most vulnerable countries.With respect to the post-2015 agenda  the issue of employment dominates the concerns of Cape Verdeans. The subject occupies the top spot among all consulted  who identify employment as essential to achieving economic and human development. Another serious issue has to do with the sustainability of social security. We need a more universal welfare system  and we must create and introduce instruments for that purpose. That is possible only with a more dynamic economy. There will be no transformation agenda if we do not create solid  sustainable foundations for social protection. To do so  we need to grow and expand wealth  as well as provide a greater number of decent jobs. We need to create a wave of modernization for society and for the competitive factors of our economy  so as to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. The larger result will be economic growth and the creation of wealth to induce the improvement of indicators that matter. We must recognize that there is room for improvement  particularly in terms of reducing State bureaucracy and increasing competitiveness  as well as in terms of making foreign investment more streamlined and more efficient for entrepreneurship. We urge our citizens to be productive  competitive and prosperous  without losing the vast Cape Verdean capacity for generosity  solidarity and responsibility.The continuation of the international crisis and its impact on all countries creates serious problems for the entire world community. In the case of Cape Verde  the situation poses serious challenges that we must overcome  namely  obstacles to the acceleration of economic growth  the promotion of employment and the reduction of poverty. At this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  we reiterate our commitment to peace and dialogue  within the parameters enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.Our vision of the United Nations is of a more cohesive and united Organization in which efforts are undertaken for the prosperity of nations. Our vision of the General Assembly is of a great forum for dialogue on the global challenges of our planet and humankind  and our vision of the Security Council is of a body with a more balanced representation that is better suited to the geopolitical developments that the world has known since 1945. This is a unique opportunity for Cape Verde  a Portuguese-speaking country  to reaffirm its commitment to cultural diversity and  in its quest for multiculturalism  which is its prerogative  to call for the Portuguese language — the fifth most widely spoken language in the world  connecting States and peoples across five continents — to be recognized as an official or a working language of international organizations  particularly the United Nations.We wish to make one more comment as we position ourselves  following the report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic on the alleged use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August (A/67/997)  which we have studied with close attention. We welcome the progress made towards dialogue  particularly the joint search for peaceful solutions  especially at the United Nations. We are against the use of weapons of mass destruction  and we will continue to align with subsequent initiatives towards their eradication. As we are against war and belligerence  we advocate for the implementation of a global strategy to combat violence. We wish to express our solidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya  as well as our unequivocal condemnation of the reprehensible acts of barbarism and human savagery that occurred last Saturday in Nairobi. We urge all the members of the General Assembly to reach a historic agreement in favour of the environment. The main objective is to implement the established Goals in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex). We also reaffirm our resolute willingness to cooperate with everyone to reduce regional and global tensions  so as to broaden the understanding of sovereignties  freedoms and human rights.Finally  we reiterate our preference for the joint definition of new goals that will stipulate the fundamentals for the prosperity of countries and for the welfare of the world’s people  crafting together a post-2015 agenda. Cape Verde is committed to making its contribution to the creation of a new goals scenario to succeed and complement the Millennium Development Goals. Our common commitment is meeting the eight Goals and our shared responsibility is creating a new post-2015 agenda in favour of sustainable development. The manner in which we do it will determine our common destiny. The importance of our decisions and the responsibility to make them within the United Nations framework are evident. Let us get to work to create a new global dynamic that leads to a joint vision for promoting progress. Cape Verde is firmly committed to the establishment of a post-2015 development agenda; that is also the future we want. We assure the Assembly that we will do everything in our power in the name of a better future  filled with freedom  equality and prosperity. The international community can count on us."
"41",1673,"CRI",68,2013,"It is a pleasure to begin this address with warm congratulations to Ambassador John Ashe on his recent election as President of the General Assembly. We wish him success in his endeavours and assure him of our support.Today is the last time that I will address the General Assembly as President of Costa Rica. As on previous occasions  my message is based upon my firm conviction of the essential nature of the United Nations to promote peace  security  development  democracy and human rights. The United Nations brings together  catalyses and protects the multilateral system and the international rule of law. Its validity  vigour  legitimacy and effectiveness are essential to all countries  but most importantly to the smaller and more vulnerable ones  especially if  like Costa Rica  they do not have armed forces. In the course of humankind’s most challenging times throughout the past 68 years  we have turned to the Organization to seek guidance and solutions responsive to the hopes and longings of our peoples. Today  we are facing one such occasion  amid contradictions. We are the authors of great achievements  but we are also overwhelmed by acute tragedies. There remain serious global challenges for which we have not crafted responses that are equally global in scope.On 2 April  we conclusively ratified the Arms Trade Treaty  a vital step that was proudly led by our country as one of the seven sponsoring countries  and a great victory for humankind. I am pleased to announce today that it has been unanimously ratified by the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica  and I pledge our support to work assidiously for its implementation. In two days  for the first time in the history of the Organization  we will hold a high-level debate on nuclear disarmament. Costa Rica will also lend its leadership on the issue. In that way  we hope to be able to move closer towards an ideal aspired to by most countries and to make progress in new conceptual frameworks for discussion. The meetings of the Open-ended Working Group on Nuclear Disarmament  chaired with effectiveness by our Permanent Representative in Geneva  Mr. Manuel Dengo Benavides  have opened up a promising path.We are working at a good rate to establish a new global agenda for sustainable development  as well as institutions to promote it. That is evidenced by the reform of the Economic and Social Council  the establishment of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and the progress being made on the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Increasingly  innovation  technology  education and culture are recognized as promoters of development  and there is a growing awareness of the need to actively incorporate young people in such endeavours. Together with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  Costa Rica is honoured to have hosted and organized BYND 2015 Global Youth Summit  an international conference on youth  development and information and communication technologies. The conference brought together young people from various parts of the world and enjoyed the able leadership from the ITU Secretary General  Mr. Hamadoun Touré. Today  I symbolically present to the General Assembly the final declaration of the conference  adopted in our capital on 11 September by thousands of young people from every continent. We trust that it will be a very relevant input for the discussion of the post-2015 development agenda.To explore options for the future  in March Costa Rica also hosted an international conference of middle-income countries jointly organized with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Its results will help to better conceptualize the needs of nations like ours and the contributions that we can make in terms of the post-2015 development agenda. As part of those initiatives  we must not overlook our duty to strive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the need to accelerate their implementation  particularly in less developed countries.The achievements I have mentioned  as well as others  have taken place under the ominous and tragic shadow of a world that remains very complicated. We are still shocked by the brutal terrorist attack committed a few days ago in Nairobi. Today I express our deepest solidarity with the people of Kenya and our strongest condemnation of that attack  and of terrorism and fanaticism. For the past two years  we have been struck by the tragedy in Syria. The incessant count of massacred and displaced persons has been as unsettling as the inaction of the international community  particularly the Security Council  to act in a timely way to contain the crimes and the violence. After a period of paralysis and confusion  it seems that at last we are approaching a solution that will lead to breaking out of that unacceptable stalemate. We raise our voice to demand that the Security Council act decisively to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria  halt the violence  seek a negotiated and democratic way out of the conflict and hold accountable those responsible for the horrible crimes committed in that country.Costa Rica insists that the Security Council should refer the Syrian case to the International Criminal Court. We also call again on the five permanent members of the Council to henceforth commit themselves to refraining from exercising the veto in cases of crimes against humanity.The Syrian tragedy underscores the need to work decisively towards the organic application of the responsibility to protect and to promote the use of mediation to avoid the emergence or the worsening of conflicts. As a concrete measure towards such prevention  we urge all Member States to join the initiative of Australia  Costa Rica  Denmark and Ghana and designate national focal points for the prevention of atrocities and on the responsibility to protect. The preventive approach is also necessary to manage universal public goods and  consequently  to exert global governance. The prevention and reversal of global warming is one of the most urgent issues on our crucial agenda. We cannot remain inactive while global warming increases  ocean levels rise and the survival of several small island States is threatened. We commend the Secretary-General’s plan to convene a summit on climate change and his promotion of the initiative entitled “The Oceans Compact: Healthy Oceans for Prosperity”. We believe that the time has come to negotiate  pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Oceans  an international agreement on that subject.Besides being an instrument for global governance and the protection of universal public goods  international law entails many other dimensions. Those include respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  goodwill in addressing border issues and observance of all the decisions of the International Court of Justice. Costa Rica is a firm believer in and scrupulous observer of international law in all its aspects. But that attitude contrasts with the absolute disrespect of the Government of Nicaragua of the most elementary norms of conduct and coexistence among States. That disrespect has led to open and unacceptable aggression against our country and to the flagrant disobedience of the orders of the Court at The Hague.In October of 2010  Nicaraguan forces occupied part of Costa Rica’s territory. Following our complaint  the International Court of Justice issued provisional measures that  among other things  prohibit the presence of Nicaraguan personnel in the zone under dispute. But Nicaragua has continued sending contingents of political activists  funded and organized by its Government. In August 2013  the Court reiterated its demand for compliance with the provisional measures  but Nicaragua has again ignored them. Their scorn demonstrates the urgent need to establish procedures that guarantee the respect of all decisions emanating from the Court  including precautionary measures. Costa Rica commits itself to work towards that goal and expects an open stance from the international community.The Nicaraguan Government  moreover  has offered blocks of the patrimonial sea of Costa Rica for exploration and exploitation of oil. It seeks to extend the limits of its continental shelf by ignoring our rights and has broken off negotiations to secure maritime boundaries. It has threatened to claim a province of Costa Rica as its own and has restarted dredging works in the zone subject to the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice. Furthermore  it is pursuing a policy of increased re-armament.The Nicaraguan and Costa Rican people wish and deserve to live in peace  but the Nicaraguan Government insists on preventing that. By pursuing a course of such deliberate and repeated misconduct  the Government of Nicaragua undermines international law and the very purpose of the United Nations.Notwithstanding the gravity of the situation  Costa Rica remains peacefully and firmly committed to the well-being and security of our population. We promote a model of development based upon harmony with nature  solidarity and social inclusion  an open economy and open trade  the development of our human resources  and innovation. We realize that development is futile if it is not founded on a profound respect for human dignity and the rights and well-being of the people. We firmly believe that respect for and promotion of human rights in all its dimensions is a national and international duty. For that reason  among others  we remain open to all special procedures on human rights  and we are engaged actively and constructively in the Human Rights Council.In facing the challenges of public safety  including drug trafficking and transnational organized crime  our country has adopted a balanced strategy whose positive results are evident in many areas  including the continued reduction in our homicide rate over the past three years  one of the lowest in Central America. Given the gravity for many nations of the challenges of drug trafficking and transnational organized crime  we join the call by other States from our region  such as Mexico and Guatemala  to re-evaluate agreed international policies and to seek more effective responses against drug trafficking  from a perspective of health  respect for human rights and impact reduction. Along the same lines  it is necessary to increase international cooperation to reduce the illegal flows of weapons and money that fuel criminal networks.The new global strategy on that enormous challenge should be the product of the open and inclusive debate during the extraordinary session of the General Assembly in 2016. We salute the Antigua Declaration of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States as a first step to leading us in the right direction towards that special session.Against the backdrop of the actions and convictions I have just outlined  we respond enthusiastically to the call of the President of the General Assembly to advance in framing the post-2015 development agenda during this session. We are encouraged by his emphasis on more active involvement by civil society in that process  the importance assigned to human rights and the rule of law as bases for development  and his openness to new ideas and institutional modalities  including alliances among multiple sectors.Costa Rica looks to the future with confidence. At the same time  we are aware of the risks and challenges that we face as a country  as a region and as part of humankind. In that future  we see the United Nations as an indispensable institution  a steadfast companion  a visionary guide and co-guardian of our tranquility and well-being. I pay tribute to its contributions and sincerely hope that they may multiply in the years to come. "
"42",1742,"CUB",68,2013,"I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)  over which Cuba currently has the honour to preside. I reiterate our satisfaction at the election of Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also reiterate our willingness to cooperate with him for the success of this session. It is an honour for CELAC to see a representative from one of its member States  in particular a Caribbean nation  preside over this preeminent body of the United Nations.Over the coming weeks  I will also speak to the Assembly about the heroic struggles of Cuba  its resistance and triumphs  the immense efforts of its people  its fidelity to principles  its revolutionary transformations and the perfection of Cuban socialism.As the first genuinely Latin American and Caribbean organization that includes all of the countries in the region  CELAC was founded with the purpose of making progress in the political  economic  social and cultural unity and integration of our America  so as to reclaim the dream of our liberators of a nation of republics that  with its almost 600 million inhabitants  its resources and its enormous human and economic potential  can decide autonomously its own destiny.The countries of our region share the conviction that the political  economic  social and cultural unity and integration of Latin America and the Caribbean constitute not only a fundamental aspiration of our peoples  but also a prerequisite for us to successfully tackle the challenges we face as a region. However  everything that has been achieved so far and the path CELAC has chosen underscore the need for our region to have a space of its own to consolidate and project the Latin American and Caribbean identity based on its shared principles and values and on the ideals of unity and democracy for our peoples. It should also reaffirm our commitment to building a more just  equitable and harmonious international order based on respect for international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and to upholding the sovereignty and the right of each State to build its own political system  free from threat  aggression or unilateral coercive measures and in an environment of peace  stability  justice  democracy and respect for human rights.Our Community is based on unrestricted respect for international law  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the prohibition of the use and threat of use of force; on respect for the self-determination  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and on non-interference in their internal affairs; on the protection and promotion of all human rights  the rule of law  at both the national and the international levels  and democracy; and on our aim to work together for collective prosperity so as to eradicate discrimination  inequality  marginalization  human rights violations and transgressions of the rule of law.We reaffirm our region’s commitment to international peace and security. We commit to strengthening the climate of peace that prevails in Latin America and the Caribbean and to consolidating a zone of peace that encompasses our region as a whole  whereby disputes between nations are resolved peaceably through dialogue and negotiation or other means  in perfect harmony with international law.At the recent High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament (A/68/PV.11)  CELAC reiterated its profound concern at the threat posed to humankind by the continued existence of nuclear weapons and their possible use or threat of use  and the urgent need to make progress towards the priority objective of nuclear disarmament and achieve the total and absolute elimination of nuclear weapons. In addition  CELAC member countries presented for the first time a joint initiative to the Human Rights Council on the right to peace  which we hope will lead to a declaration on that right for adoption by the General Assembly.CELAC has expressed its support in the strongest terms for the legitimate rights of Argentina in the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. The continuing position of our region is that the United Kingdom should agree to reopen negotiations with a view to finding a peaceful and definitive solution to that dispute as soon as possible.Our Community reiterates its support for the dialogue under way between the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia  which seeks to end the internal conflict that has affected the political  social and economic development of that sister nation for more than 50 years. We hope that that initiative will succeed in reaching an agreement in the interests of the Colombian people.We would also like to underscore the Latin American and Caribbean character of Puerto Rico and  by taking note of the resolutions on Puerto Rico adopted by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee  to emphasize that that issue is a matter of interest to CELAC.We reiterate our absolute condemnation of terrorism and reaffirm our commitment to fighting it in all its forms and manifestations  in keeping with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. However  at the same time  we strongly reject the unilateral and illegitimate assessments  lists and certifications made by some developed countries that affect countries of our region  in particular those referring to terrorism  drug trafficking  human trafficking and other similar phenomena.In recent days  as the situation in Syria has deteriorated  CELAC has reiterated its vocation for peace and its observance of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in international law  including international humanitarian law. It has urged the creation of the conditions necessary for moving towards a negotiated political solution to the Syrian conflict  which has claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people.Similarly  CELAC is working to identify independent concepts and mechanisms for cooperation  urging the international community to continue to contribute to the reconstruction and sustainable development of our sister Republic of Haiti  in accordance with the fundamental priorities and needs defined by the Haitian Government and in full respect for its authority and sovereignty and the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of countries.We have defended the sovereignty of the region  including that over our own natural resources  and we have expressed our solidarity with States members of CELAC in the face of harmful acts that violate international law  such as that of 2 July  which threatened the dignity and rights of the President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia  Mr. Evo Morales Ayma  as he returned to La Paz from a visit to a number of European countries. Taking into account the diverse processes that have shaped Latin American and Caribbean identity  the Community has also emphasized its intention to become a space that protects the rights to live  thrive and coexist enjoyed by all cultures  races and ethnic groups of the region  as well as the multicultural nature of our peoples and the plurinational character of some of our countries  especially among native communities that are promoting and recreating their historical memory  ancestral knowledge and their experience.Almost seven months after he passed away  CELAC today pays a well-deserved tribute to one of its founding members  President Hugo Chávez Frías  who presided over the founding summit of the Community with his vision and mastery. Similarly  CELAC expressed its satisfaction over the election of Pope Francis as the first High Pontiff of the Catholic Church from the Latin American and Caribbean region.The global espionage against CELAC member countries violates human rights  the right to privacy  the right of citizens to be informed  and the principles of State sovereignty and international law. It has become a source of concern  and we have taken due note of the statements made in various forums by Heads of States and Government and other leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries who have condemned and rejected the use of such practices.The member States of CELAC are proud of their shared work in consolidating our regional sovereignty so that the Latin America and Caribbean region can occupy its rightful place in the world and renounce its status as the most inequal region on Earth. In pursuing these objectives  we have decided to offer the most vulnerable countries of the region our cooperation and solidarity and to draw attention to the special vulnerabilities of the countries of the Caribbean Community  given their status as small island developing States  which limits their efforts towards sustainable development  especially in light of the significant impact of natural disasters and the negative effects of climate change.With regard to the indispensable reform of the international system  we have renewed our countries’ commitment to multilateralism  the comprehensive reform of the United Nations system  and the democratization of international decision-making forums  in particular the Security Council. We shall act accordingly on issues of equal importance  among them the process of formulating the post-2015 development agenda  which is the theme of this general debate and to which all CELAC member countries attach great importance.The members of CELAC know that there can be no lasting peace without development and without combating poverty  hunger and inequality. We are aware of the challenges that the current international economic and financial crisis poses to the future of our region and our legitimate aspirations to social inclusion  equitable growth with sustainable development  and integration. We therefore emphasize the importance for the post-2015 development agenda to consist of voluntary  universal  clear and quantifiable goals that can be adapted to distinct national realities  with the purpose of eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development. This new framework should be inclusive and transparent on official development assistance  prompt the developed countries to honour their commitments  and encourage South-South and triangular cooperation on cross-cutting issues through the participation of all sectors of society.With regard to climate change  we welcome the formal adoption of the second phase of commitments under the Kyoto Protocol  despite a lack of political will on the part of a number of developed nations that vetoed agreements on new  additional and predictable resources and on mechanisms for the effective transfer of technologies to developing countries. We will continue to work together to cope with this scourge that affects humankind as a whole today.There are many difficulties  but the important thing is that the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean have come to the conclusion that the time has come for the region  as José Martí said  to walk in close ranks  like silver in the roots of the Andes. That is why we created CELAC."
"43",1788,"CYP",68,2013,"It is a great honour to address the General Assembly for the first time in my capacity as President of the Republic of Cyprus.While it is realistic and pragmatic to acknowledge that in an anarchic international system the political and economic leverage and might of States  or even of international organizations  are asymmetric and unequal  one should never forget the founding principles of the Charter of the Organization  which were formulated as a result of the traumatic historic experiences of two world wars. Bearing in mind the aim of promoting the fundamental United Nations principles  I would like to share my deep concern regarding what is happening in various parts of the world  threatening the sovereignty of States and regional and global stability through  among other things  acts of State violence  acts of terrorism  the infringement and calling into question of sovereign rights enjoyed by States  the annexation of territories through the illegal use of force  the production and use of weapons of mass destruction  the sponsoring and harbouring of secessionist or terrorist movements  religious fundamentalism manifested through terrorist attacks  the forcible displacement of millions of people  and hunger and distress  which intensify migration flows and create demographic changes.These are but a few examples that bear out the need to evaluate  through collective debate and self-assessment  whether the United Nations principles  values and methods have indeed contributed to what we have all been hoping for — the maintenance of peace and security and respect for the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all people.I am not a romantic ideologist; quite the contrary  I am a pragmatic realist who acknowledges that in this imperfect world it is extremely difficult  even impossible  to expect the full and unquestioning implementation of United Nations principles and values. However  what is happening today risks overthrowing the current world order  calling into question the relevance and effectiveness of this international Organization.It is not my intention to cast doubt on or minimize the multidimensional contribution of the United Nations to a plethora of cases over the past seven decades. What is important is to enhance the Organization’s role and safeguard the effectiveness of its decisions  as well as its actions. Should decisions or resolutions based on international law condemning violations of human rights not be implemented or enforced  that could be seen as fostering or even rewarding arbitrariness. In that case  regional differences and conflicts could be prolonged indefinitely  serving the petty interests and expedience of their perpetrators at the expense of international law and our universal principles.I do not intend to enter into detail of what we are witnessing and experiencing every day in different parts of the world. I will limit myself to the example of my own country  a small European country that has for almost 40 years been violently divided  despite numerous Security Council resolutions calling for its reunification and the withdrawal of the occupation forces.I take this opportunity to assure the General Assembly that  despite the current economic difficulties we are facing  I am committed to working tirelessly and with determination to reach a viable and lasting settlement so that all the communities of Cyprus may live and thrive in a modern European country that fully respects the values and principles of the United Nations and the European Union  safeguards the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its people  and ensures their peaceful coexistence and prosperous collaboration.As I have already conveyed to the Secretary-General  it is my firm belief that the current status quo is unacceptable and that its prolongation would have further negative consequences for Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Therefore  a comprehensive settlement is not only desirable  but should not be further delayed. In that respect  I wish  as a leader with a sincere vision of reuniting my country  to once more call on Turkey and our Cypriot compatriots to demonstrate the same determination and commitment and become partners in the effort for the reunification of a peaceful  secure and prosperous homeland.The reference made by the President of the Republic of Turkey  Mr. Abdullah Gül  in this very Hall (see A/68/PV.5) to the 2004 proposal that  through genuine democratic procedures  was not accepted by the vast majority of Greek Cypriots for a number of substantive reasons  does not absolve Turkey from its obligations and responsibilities concerning the efforts to find a just solution and does not truly reflect the realities on the ground  as borne out by the relevant United Nations resolutions.Nonetheless  I welcome the decision of Turkey to respond positively to my proposal to hold meetings with the negotiator of the Greek Cypriot community. I hope  and at the same time expect  that this positive response will be followed by practical and substantial steps and the adoption of a constructive attitude  guided by good faith  that will contribute effectively towards reaching a settlement.In that respect  it is my strong belief that it is of paramount significance that a dynamic impetus be launched  either before or even during the negotiating process  in order to restore the confidence of the people of Cyprus in the prospect of reaching a settlement. Such an impetus can be achieved only through the adoption of bold measures that are seen as game-changers and as creating a win-win situation  not only for both communities but also for all interested stakeholders.With that in mind  I have submitted a package proposal that  among other things  includes the return of the ghost city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants  under the auspices of the United Nations and in line with Security Council resolution 550 (1984). The return of Famagusta  along with the evident advantage of reviving the hope of the people of Cyprus  will also provide a number of benefits. The infrastructural restoration of a city that has been uninhabited for 39 years will undoubtedly lead to the creation of new jobs in a wide variety of professional fields  providing a major boost to the economy of the country. At the same time  by working together  building mutual trust and enjoying the results of joint collaboration  Greek and Turkish Cypriots will come closer to the realization of the benefits of sharing together a prosperous future  just as we have done in the past.I believe that the Assembly shares my assessment that this proposal  which is complementary to the negotiating process  is to the benefit of both communities and that its acceptance would provide a much-needed stimulus to the prospect of reaching a settlement. At the same time  in order to avoid entering into a new frustrating negotiating process  the time for the start of the negotiations is not as important as that they be conducted in a comprehensive manner with clear substance  aims and targets. To that end  I consider it essential that  before the start of the negotiating process  it be clearly established that the basis and solution to be reached will adhere to the relevant United Nations resolutions  the high-level agreements and the evolving transformation of the Republic of Cyprus into a bi-zonal  bi-communal federal State with a single international personality  single sovereignty and single citizenship. Moreover  the settlement must embody our capacity as a European Union (EU) member State and fully enshrine its values and principles by enhancing the role of the EU in the negotiating process. I have to clarify that such a role played by the European Union would merely supplement and complement the United Nations good offices mission in order to guarantee not only our effective and efficient participation in the European Union  through the proper implementation of the acquis communautaire  but also the restoration of the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all Cypriots.Last but not least  an important humanitarian aspect of the Cyprus problem is the issue of missing persons. We salute the progress achieved so far. The issue must be resolved as soon as possible  regardless of the developments in the negotiations.The positive and stabilizing role that Cyprus can assume in the eastern Mediterranean — especially in the areas of combatting terrorism  fighting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and providing humanitarian assistance —has in the past few months received extensive recognition. Keeping Cyprus peaceful and stable and maintaining its constructive regional role is a primary objective of my Government. We have proven that we are a reliable and interconnecting bridge between Europe  North Africa and the Near and Middle Easts — in terms of both perception and actions — as well as a credible and stable country that gives true credence to being a safe haven. That has been demonstrated in practice several times during periods of massive humanitarian evacuations. We stand ready once more  if it is deemed necessary — and hopefully it will not be — to contribute in a substantive manner to any international call to provide humanitarian aid and facilities to the nationals of any third country.A recent and most encouraging development in our area is taking place in the field of energy cooperation. The very promising potential of hydrocarbon exploration in the Levantine basin requires that all countries in the region work closely together  bilaterally and regionally. Pertinent to that and a testament to our constructive role in the region is the fact that Cyprus has assumed a leading role in bringing neighbouring hydrocarbon-producing countries together  seeking opportunities not only for maritime boundary agreements  but also for joint efforts in exploring those hydrocarbon resources. Energy  in my opinion  should be not a source of conflict  but a catalyst for conflict resolution and regional integration.The Millennium Development Goals framework has galvanized unparalleled development efforts and guided global and national development priorities since 2000. While three of the eight Goals have been achieved prior to the final deadline  much work remains to be done ahead of 2015. With only two years left  enhanced commitment  resources and efforts are needed  as is a coordinated and integrated approach that can contribute to accelerating progress towards the achievement of all the Millennium Goals.As a small island State facing particular challenges  we understand well why the coherence of all processes leading to a single and universal post-2015 development agenda is crucial. New and emerging asymmetric challenges — such as climate change and natural disasters  terrorism  inequalities and the necessity for the prevalence of the rule of law  democracy and human rights — require renewed and collective commitment and an effective target-oriented post-2015 framework with poverty eradication and sustainable development at its heart.As the Secretary-General says in his report entitled “A life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and advancing the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015”  “the world’s quest for dignity  peace  prosperity  justice  sustainability and an end to poverty has reached an unprecedented moment of urgency” (A/68/202  para. 1) “and the world’s nations must unite behind a common programme to act on those aspirations” (ibid.  para. 120).Cyprus strongly subscribes to the joint efforts in fulfilling this task.A few months ago  my country received unprecedented international attention because of the economic crisis. I am proud to say that  due to the persistence  determination and resilience of the people of Cyprus  we are rising to the challenge and will soon lead our country to the path of recovery and growth. My political vision is for Cyprus to receive international attention yet again  but this time for all the right reasons.This points to an end in the long-standing anachronistic division of my country  in line with the aspirations of our people  especially the younger generations  to coexist peacefully in a European country that fully respects their fundamental human rights and freedoms. I am certain that all will agree that the reunification is in the interests not only of the people of Cyprus  but also of the entire international community  since a solution to the Cyprus problem will undoubtedly have a very important spillover effect on efforts to achieve a much-needed environment of stability  security and peace in our region.For our part  we are determined to rise to the challenge of this historic responsibility and do our utmost with the aim of providing a more stable  prosperous and conciliatory future in our immediate region  so that our legacy is remembered by generations to come."
"44",1812,"CZE",68,2013,"The Assembly is meeting at a time marked by significant challenges. Let me mention a few which I regard as the most pressing.The state of the world economy remains fragile  but slowly we seem to be entering a path towards economic recovery and  hopefully  sustainable growth. The security situation in many parts of the world is improving  but we are witnessing many local conflicts that endanger the overall regional balance. The conflict in Syria must come to an end on the basis of a negotiated political settlement. The danger of a nuclear conflict is diminishing thanks to the decreasing number of nuclear warheads and carriers in the possession of the nuclear Powers. Yet the currently blocked negotiations with the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be a matter of concern. Fundamental human rights and freedoms are still at risk in many countries. The gap between the rich and the poor is ever widening despite many efforts to alleviate world hunger and poverty. At the same time  some countries have managed to reduce the gap.International cooperation is essential if we want to address those and other challenges. The United Nations remains the most suitable body to pool the global efforts and resources needed for that task. The world is changing  and its traditional platform must adapt as well. From the start  we should formulate realistic plans and procedures. However  their implementation will not be possible without the necessary political will.A country’s reputation depends not only on its size or economic output  but also on its readiness to actively engage in addressing and meeting the challenges of the current globalized world. The Czech Republic  a country with the historical experience of an undemocratic regime  is ready to share its experience from its democratic transition process  as well as to offer its help  resources and know-how to countries undergoing their own democratic transition.The year 2013 will mark a turning point for European economies. The Czech economy is highly dependent on international trade  and I strongly believe that free and fair trade is one of the best tools for improving the world economic situation. The multilateral approach to trade issues should be revitalized and cooperation within the World Trade Organization (WTO) reinforced. I sincerely wish much success to the new WTO leadership.The United Nations has always played a key role in defusing armed conflicts between and within the Member States. Its role in helping to resolve the conflict in Syria is crucial. The confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria is deeply worrying. Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable. Whoever gave the order to initiate the chemical attack has gravely violated the principle of responsibility to protect the civilian population. The attack constitutes a war crime and a crime against humanity  and its perpetrators should be held accountable before the International Criminal Court.The Czech Republic welcomes the decision of the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the expeditious destruction of Syrian chemical weapons  which is now being adopted in The Hague  and looks forward to the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the issue in the coming hours.The conflict does not have a military solution; only a negotiated political settlement will re-establish peace in Syria. The Czech Republic calls on all parties  especially on the Syrian Government  to fully implement the 2012 Geneva communiqué (S/2012/523  annex). The Czech Republic supports and will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to meet the growing humanitarian needs in Syria and the neighbouring countries.The Czech Republic acknowledges developments in the transformation process of Myanmar. I strongly encourage the country’s leaders  in accordance with their public pronouncements  to actively pursue the process of amending the national Constitution in order to improve democratic standards in the country.As I mentioned earlier  the role of the United Nations in resolving armed conflicts is indispensable. United Nations peacekeeping operations are an important tool for sustainable and durable solutions to violent conflict worldwide. Having participated in United Nations operations in recent years in relatively small numbers  my country  the Czech Republic  is ready to substantially increase the presence of its military personnel in peacekeeping operations.The Czech Republic  a non-nuclear-weapon State  has always strongly advocated for the unfettered right to develop  research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless  that right should be fully exercised only in conjunction with honouring all non-proliferation obligations. The long-standing objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons may be achieved only if the non-proliferation regime meets all demands for its strengthening. The upcoming meeting of the group of governmental experts on a fissile material cut-off treaty will be a step in the right direction. The Czech Republic greatly appreciates that fact that the international community was finally able to complete the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations.I should like to share my view of the role of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Czech Republic has been actively involved from the very beginning in the discussions on the formulation of a new development agenda. We are ready and committed to take part in its implementation. As formulated by the Secretary-General in his report (A/68/202)  the MDGs have been the most successful global anti-poverty push in history and have made a great contribution to raising public awareness  increasing political will and mobilizing resources.Some of the MDG targets have been met already; some are within close reach. But the results are uneven among and within countries and there is a lot of unfinished business. I can assure the Assembly that my Government remains committed to the MDGs  as reflected in both our policies and our practical actions.The future development agenda should build on the success of the MDGs and bring together diverse development actors. I would like to support the single overarching post-2015 framework  which will link poverty eradication in all its dimensions and the promotion of sustainable development. I therefore call for the full integration of all relevant international processes  which have been separate until now  in particular the review of the MDGs and the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals.We have to make sure that the future goals will be universal for all countries but at the same time remain realistic  taking into account the actual possibilities of each country. They must be achievable and measurable. I appreciate the fact that the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda puts emphasis on inclusive growth and considers the role of innovation  technology and the private sector actors. The proposed development goal to secure sustainable energy is a very good example and should figure among the future development priorities.In December  the international community will commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The situation of human rights has improved in some areas. New human rights challenges have emerged. A great deal of work still lies ahead of us. The Czech Republic  a member of the Human Rights Council and the country of Václav Havel  will always defend human rights wherever they are violated.In conclusion  I should like to focus on issues related to the process of reforming the United Nations. The Czech Republic appreciates the dedicated work of the Secretary-General  which is transforming the United Nations into a more effective and accountable system. Unfortunately  there are not enough means to fund all initiatives. We all have to do more with less. I am sure that we will find internal reserves that will allow the United Nations to achieve the tasks entrusted to it with greater success. By performing well and by being responsive to its Member States  the United Nations will strengthen the political will of its Members to invest in multilateral forums and thus contribute to a safer world."
"45",1874,"DEU",68,2013,"Exactly 40 years ago  the two German States joined the United Nations. For Germans  that marked our full return to the community of nations. Germany supports the United Nations as the beating heart of a global order rooted in cooperation  peaceful compromise and cooperative solutions.The world has changed dramatically since then. New centres of economic and political power are emerging. In recent years  Germany has established new strategic partnerships with the new global players in Asia  Latin America and Africa.The setting of our meeting today is different from the usual one. The United Nations is undergoing renovation  which must not be restricted merely to the buildings. The United Nations must reflect the world as it is  not as it used to be. Only then will it be fit for the challenges of our age. A Security Council without permanent seats for Africa and Latin America does not reflect the realities of today’s world. A Council in which the emerging and highly populous region of Asia is represented by only one permanent seat does not reflect the realities of today’s world. Nor does it reflect the reality of tomorrow. Germany  with its partners Japan  India and Brazil  is prepared to assume greater responsibility. In essence  it is a matter of strengthening the United Nations. The authority of the United Nations depends on its being representative.We are seeking reform of the United Nations so that its power to build consensus  establish global rules and act effectively in response to crises and conflicts can be demonstrably strengthened. This is a call not only to the United Nations itself  but also to each and every individual Member State. Only if we are prepared to compromise and are willing to act together will we be able to make the United Nations strong. Germany remains committed to the United Nations. A strong United Nations is in Germany’s interests.Our cultural differences and diverse traditions are not going to vanish in the age of globalization  but it is not only the world’s markets that are becoming ever more closely interconnected: people’s expectations  hopes and ideas are globalizing too. The developments in the Arab world have shown us that a country’s stability depends primarily not on the stability of the Government but on social stability. The best guarantees for a society’s internal cohesion are respect for individual human rights  the triumph of the rule of law over the arbitrary  and broad economic  social and political participation on the part of the people. Germany is committed to democratic change and to respect for human and civil rights  not because we want to take the moral high ground but because we have learned from experience — from the painful experience of our own history.In Syria the people took to the streets to protest against a repressive regime. For more than two years now  the regime’s response has been brutal violence  which has brought countless deaths  immeasurable suffering and terrible destruction on the Syrian people and is now jeopardizing stability in the entire region. The use of chemical weapons  ascertained by the United Nations  is a crime against civilization. Its terrible dimensions have consequences that extend far beyond Syria. All the facts available to us show that the regime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons.The use of chemical weapons cannot be allowed to go unpunished. That we owe not only to the victims in Syria  but also to future generations. Those responsible for using such weapons must be called to account before the International Criminal Court  which must at last be able to begin its independent investigations. We welcome the agreement reached in the Security Council yesterday. The chemical weapons in Syria must be completely destroyed in accordance with a firmly agreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide financial and technical help to destroy those chemical weapons. A world without weapons of mass destruction would be a better world.We must take advantage of the opportunity for a political process offered by the agreement on destroying the chemical weapons. After all  people in Syria are still being killed every day by conventional weapons. But there will be no military solution in Syria. Only a political solution can bring lasting peace to Syria. That would include an immediate ceasefire. I am pleased that there is at last a timetable for a possible peace conference  details of which still have to be clarified even after yesterday’s decision in the Security Council. Only with a substantive political process can we counter the destabilization of the entire region.To date  Germany has made available more than €420 million to ease the worst of the suffering of the Syrian people. But despite all of the outside help  millions of Syrians are fleeing. Ever more people are at acute risk of starvation  and very soon they will also be at the mercy of the cold weather. They do not have even the most basic medical care. We must seize every opportunity to provide humanitarian access to the suffering population as quickly as possible. Amid all the devastation and hatred  the United Nations and its staff are the face of compassion and  for many Syrians  the only hope. I would like expressly to pay tribute to their work and commitment.The tragedy in Syria underlines the extraordinary and growing importance attached to disarmament aimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction and the strengthening of the non-proliferation regimes. Attaining a world free of weapons of mass destruction is our generation’s prime task for the future. Disarmament is a crucial issue for the future of humankind.Iran must allay the international community’s doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. We welcome Iran’s announcement this week that it is prepared to do so. The talks with the Iranian Government were encouraging. They open up a window of opportunity. Now it is imperative that we rebuild trust. Germany is ready to conduct negotiations in a constructive manner. However  the new words coming out of Tehran must be followed by deeds  and not at some unspecified time in the future  but right now. But  I repeat: a fresh start has been made.We welcome the great commitment shown by President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry in giving fresh impetus to the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian leadership. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas deserve our respect for their courage in embarking together on that course. They have our full support as they pursue that course towards a negotiated agreement. Only a negotiated two-State solution can reconcile the legitimate interests of the two sides.This week in New York has been an encouraging one for the world. I am gratified that it was not military solutions but the struggle for political and diplomatic solutions that came to the fore. The international community must continue to follow such an approach.Beyond crisis diplomacy  the United Nations is the central forum for setting binding objectives for the international community. Just a few days ago  the General Assembly agreed on the next steps for drawing up a new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. Germany wants to make a contribution in that regard with its experience of combining economic prosperity and promoting political participation and sustainable management.Sustainability and combating poverty are not only key social issues; they are also key foreign policy issues.In formulating the future agenda  greater attention needs to be paid to human rights protection and good governance than has been the case in the past. The new agenda must incorporate all three dimensions of sustainability and take account of economic  social and environmental aspects. With such a comprehensive approach we can also strengthen the fragile statehood in many countries and eradicate safe havens for terrorists. Social stability is the best protection against radicalization and extremism.German foreign policy is a policy for peace. It focuses on crisis prevention. We Germans accept our responsibility for international peacekeeping. We focus on personal and social development. We focus on strengthening civil society. We want to contribute to a global process in which we — in the North  South  East and West learn from each other and develop joint solutions by working together. Germany will continue in future to use its economic clout and full political strength to promote peace and the balancing of interests.The digital age brings with it entirely new opportunities and challenges. We need an Internet in which freedom  security and the protection of privacy are appropriately reconciled. Just as we have to regulate international financial flows in order to prevent global crises  so we need binding rules and standards for global data flows. That is why Germany has submitted to the Human Rights Council an initiative regarding the protection of the right to privacy in the digital age. Everyone using the Internet should be able to be sure that their rights are being respected worldwide vis-à-vis private companies as well as vis-à-vis States. Not everything that is technically possible must be allowed to happen  nor is everything technically possible legitimate.Germany remains firmly anchored in Europe. Europe is a community of shared cultures  bound together by a common destiny. Close union among the nations of Europe is and will remain the response to our history and to our future in a world of change. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in European foreign policy. Europe will continue to use its clout  its influence and its resources to uphold peace and justice  to encourage development and cooperation and to promote climate protection and disarmament throughout the world.That is Germany’s twin obligation: a strong united Europe in the world and a strong  effective United Nations for the world."
"46",1933,"DMA",68,2013,"I would like to begin by congratulating you  President Ashe  from our sister island of Antigua and Barbuda  which is also a member of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. The Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica are proud of your appointment and wish you success in presiding over the General Assembly. We also express our appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his guidance during the sixty-seventh session.Thirteen years after collectively committing to meeting the needs of the poorest among us by attaining our noble Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we have made some progress globally  but we are still far from fully reaching our targets. Despite the challenges brought about by an increasingly hostile global environment  Dominica has made meaningful progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Government of Dominica has accepted that it is through the development of our human resources that we will be able to truly attain development that is inclusive and sustainable. As a result  our Government has kept our people at the centre of development.We have been able to bring significant improvements in the lives of our people and to attain all the Millennium Development Goals  despite our limitations. We have reduced poverty and hunger by more than half. Our children  boys and girls  now have universal access to both primary and secondary education  as well as expanded access to post-secondary education and training. Our girls and women are not only being treated as equals with boys and men but have received tremendous support in improving their living conditions. Our elderly people and children enjoy free access to public health care.Dominica has continued to maintain its coveted title of “nature island of the Caribbean” by adhering to self-imposed sustainable environmental practices over the past several decades  a model that we hope more States around the world can emulate.As we approach 2015  we must resolve to take stock. We must be forever mindful that those who are condemned to poverty still await our intervention. The more than 1 billion people who have known only darkness at the end of each day long for at least one light bulb in a rural home so that their children can have opportunities for a brighter tomorrow. We have run out of excuses for why we are still waiting to act or cannot act. Rest assured that our people will judge us harshly for failing to make a difference in their lives.Despite the current global challenges  South-South cooperation continues to play a significant role in helping small countries like Dominica to achieve their Millennium Development Goals. The Government and people of Dominica express their sincere gratitude to the Governments of the People’s Republic of China  Venezuela  Cuba  Morocco  the European Union  the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and other bilateral and multilateral partners for the tremendous contributions they have made  and continue to make  in the development of our human-resource capacity and infrastructure and in the implementation of our public-sector investment programme.Our commitment to the MDGs should consist of a redoubling of efforts towards a post-2015 agenda that will bring about development that is inclusive and sustainable. The outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex) initiated an inclusive intergovernmental process for preparing a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs). My delegation believes that in order to arrive at a global development agenda for the post-2015 period  there must be close linkages between the processes of the MDGs and the SDGs. The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore aligns itself with the theme set by you  Mr. President  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”.It is imperative that the development agenda beyond 2015 remain the focus of the United Nations  particularly in terms of relieving poverty and protecting our planet. A meaningful agenda must take into account the significance of the need for an international legally binding commitment to combating climate change  the development and deployment of sustainable energy  the sustainable use of the oceans and marine resources  sustainable industrial development  and international peace and security.My delegation applauds the leadership and vision shown by the Secretary-General in declaring sustainable energy to be one of the priorities of his second term. We also congratulate the Secretary-General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change  as well as colleagues within and outside the United Nations system  for their timely recommendations and for bringing needed visibility to the subject of sustainable energy. Their recommendations form the basis for one of the most important initiatives ever launched by a Secretary-General  namely  the Sustainable Energy for All initiative  launched in 2011. Through that visionary step  the Secretary-General has closed the gaping energy-poverty gap in the MDGs.Actions that will benefit our peoples should be at the heart of the functions of the Assembly. The Commonwealth of Dominica and other small and low-lying developing States that are members of the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative are grateful to the Secretary-General for his dedication  personal commitment and actions in helping to make the Sustainable Energy for All initiative a reality. That initiative stands to benefit our people across the developing world and to contribute to more efficient energy systems in developed countries.The Commonwealth of Dominica maintains that sustainable energy is the foundation for long-term socioeconomic development. For that reason  Dominica is pleased to have joined the Sustainable Energy for All partnership. My Government  with assistance from its development partners  is committed to increasing renewable energy generation from the current 30 per cent from hydro to 100 per cent by adding geothermal energy to the mix. Our goal is to become not only carbon-neutral but carbon-negative by 2020. That ambition will be achieved by exporting renewable energy to our neighbours  Guadeloupe and Martinique  via submarine cables. We thank our partners  and especially the Clinton Climate Initiative  part of the Clinton Foundation  for their support in this endeavour.That transformation to a sustainable energy sector will deliver multiple significant benefits for Dominica  including increasing employment from new energy-service companies  minimizing foreign -exchange transfers for petroleum imports  reducing the cost of energy and minimizing the volatility and unpredictability of energy prices. Recognizing the inextricable link between energy and development  we expect that sustainable energy will find its rightful place on the agenda of the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in Apia  Samoa  in 2014.The Commonwealth of Dominica is privileged to be the chair of the 31-member Steering Committee of the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative  which is charged with guiding the development of the Initiative. I would therefore  on behalf of our members  like to express our sincere appreciation to the Governments of Denmark and Japan for their recognition and their financial support to the Initiative. The Initiative is well positioned to help tackle the effects of climate change while at the same time transforming energy sectors in small island developing States such as Dominica.Our Danish partners took the first bold move to support the Initiative  which was the catalyst for support from the Government of Japan. Assistance from Japan will be invested in the first-ever ocean thermal energy feasibility study in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Ocean thermal energy is a resource common to all SIDS and represents a vast sustainable energy resource that  once developed  could also address a number of key climate-change adaptation challenges for islands  specifically in the area of fresh water and improved food security.About two thirds of the world’s surface is covered by oceans and seas connecting almost 90 per cent of the world’s population. Oceans and seas remain the source of food and livelihood for nearly 1 billion people. A post-2015 agenda must address the important role of seas and oceans to the survival of peoples throughout the world  especially those who live on islands. A sustainable development goal on oceans should therefore ensure that all fish stocks are harvested sustainably and preserve the health of the marine environment. That will require the protection of marine areas  the reduction of ocean acidification  the elimination of marine pollution and the cessation of disruptive fishing practices.There is general consensus that sustainable development and poverty eradication should form the core of the SDGs and the post-2015 development agenda. We cannot address the issue of poverty eradication without addressing the issues of wealth creation and economic growth. Developing countries  SIDS in particular  will be able to secure inclusive and sustained economic growth only through the development of the energy  agriculture and tourism sectors and associated industries. Broad-based job creation and the achievement of social goals  such as education  women’s empowerment and health care  require sustainable industrial development.It must be underscored that  in the twenty-first century  industrialization must be inclusive and sustainable if all our present and future generations are to benefit. It must incorporate all citizens and be strategically tailored to preserve livelihoods for future generations.Sustainable development goals  however  cannot be achieved in the midst of wars between or within nations. The Commonwealth of Dominica condemns the act of terrorism at the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi. We extend our condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya and to the families of the Kenyans and the foreign nationals who met their deaths at the hands of those who have no respect for human life. We must continue to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.The economic embargo against our brothers and sisters in Cuba continues to be a concern for us in the Caribbean. Unilateral actions by the United States of America continue to be the root cause of the suffering of our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Cuba. Our region of the Caribbean continues to witness the unheeded call for the lifting of a half-century economic embargo on our brothers and sisters. We call on the Government of the United States to support the full integration of the Cuban people into the global trading system. That will help to improve their lives and allow the world to benefit from the tremendous contributions they are capable of making  especially in the areas of science and technology.The ongoing civil war in Syria continues to present a major challenge to the international community. The Commonwealth of Dominica joins CARICOM in unreservedly condemning the use of chemical weapons  which is a gross violation of international law. We call on all parties involved in the conflict to bring an end to the hostilities  which have claimed the lives of far too many innocent civilians  especially children. The world is watching. The role of the United Nations is central to resolving the Syrian conflict. My delegation supports the call of the Secretary-General for resolution through dialogue and not through the use of military force or any other such action. Lasting peace can be achieved in Syria only through a negotiated political settlement that will facilitate reconciliation. What is required is the will of the international community to further that process. We commend the efforts of the United States of America and Russia in attempting to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria and move towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.As we prepare for Samoa 2014  the Commonwealth of Dominica is keen to make concrete progress for SIDS aimed at creating a future of prosperity and opportunity for all of our peoples. In that regard  my Government calls for a renewed political commitment by all countries to effectively address the special needs and vulnerabilities of SIDS. We believe that this will require consolidated effort focused on pragmatic actions for the further implementation of the Barbados Plan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy. Dominica laments the fact that international financial mechanisms have failed to fully recognize and support the vulnerabilities of SIDS  which must be allowed access to financing for development. The United Nations system needs to be strengthened to implement the Barbados Plan and Mauritius Strategy.On 2 April  the Commonwealth of Dominica was one of an overwhelming majority of Member States that voted in favour of the first international treaty to regulate the trade of conventional weapons — the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). Today  we are pleased that the ATT is now a reality. That is a significant milestone  as such regulations will serve to curb the illicit international sale of conventional weapons to unscrupulous parties. Moreover  the Commonwealth of Dominica is satisfied that the ATT will close loopholes that allow terrorists and other criminals to arm themselves and endanger innocent lives. To that end  my delegation is pleased to announce that Dominica has added its name to the list of signatories to that Treaty.Dominica  the nature island of the Caribbean  continues to navigate through waters made turbulent by a hostile international financial and trading system  the continued impact of climate change  the movement of small arms and light weapons from North to South  and the international trade in illegal drugs and the violence that they visit upon us. For those reasons  we again reiterate the importance of international support for SIDS. A post-2015 global development agenda must continue to build on the gains achieved under the Millennium Development Goals. It must focus on the sustainable use of resources to reduce the impact of climate change  to protect our seas and oceans and to promote the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources in the generation of energy able to power sustainable industrial development.The International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in Samoa in 2014  presents an ideal opportunity for the international community to collectively chart a path towards the sustainable development of SIDS and to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. The Commonwealth of Dominica remains committed to the progress made thus far  and it looks forward with eager anticipation to the forging of durable and sustainable partnerships."
"47",1977,"DNK",68,2013,"In the twenty-first century  old distinctions between North and South  and developed and developing countries are beginning to lose their meaning. We are witnessing significant shifts in the geopolitical balance  in population dynamics and in economic power between Member States. As documented in this year’s United Nations Human Development Report  many developing countries are experiencing faster economic growth. Emerging economies now produce the majority of the world’s goods and services  and three quarters of the world’s economic growth is said to depend on their dynamism.Today  emerging economies and middle-income countries are an important part of reshaping the global economy. In a globalized world  with dramatic shifts of power and influence  a strong United Nations is more relevant than ever before. We need the United Nations  with its unique legitimacy and its universal membership. We need a United Nations that can contribute to global challenges with common solutions. We need a United Nations that reflects the changing political landscape  including through a reformed Security Council. Above all  we need a United Nations that can help to mediate  prevent and resolve armed conflicts. For the United Nations to be able to contribute effectively to resolving armed conflicts  it is crucial that the Security Council show leadership and prove that it can fulfil its primary purpose and responsibility of cooperating to resolve international crises and to promote universal respect for human rights.Today  the total number of people uprooted by conflict or persecution is close to 45 million  the highest level in 18 years. That illustrates the human suffering and costs of conflict  which we must do our utmost to prevent and resolve. An integrated approach to preventive diplomacy  peacebuilding  peacekeeping and the prevention of atrocities is crucial. The cure for armed conflict and instability is to invest in democratic structures that protect civilians and their human rights and contribute to socioeconomic progress. In recent years  the Security Council has increasingly integrated the rule of law  human rights and the protection of civilians into its mandates for United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions. That is an encouraging development that Denmark supports fully.Denmark agrees with the Secretary-General that building societies that are resilient to crimes of atrocity increases the prospects of long-term peace and stability. The unacceptable human suffering in Syria is a tragic reminder of the consequences when no early action to prevent crimes of atrocity is undertaken. Advancing the primary responsibility of States to protect their populations should be a concern for all Governments. The responsibility to protect is consistent with existing obligations and international human rights law  humanitarian law and refugee law  which are binding on all States. Denmark calls on Member States to join the global network of responsibility-to-protect focal points  which works to integrate the prevention of atrocities in national policies  and to engage with other Member States and regional organizations in order to build capacity and cooperation before crises and conflicts break out.At the same time  we must ensure accountability for human rights violations and for crimes of atrocity in the past. The perpetrators of those crimes must be brought to justice. While the Security Council last Friday took an important step to address the crisis in Syria  Denmark reiterates its call on the Council to refer the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court.Sexual violence in conflict is one of the most persistent injustices in the world today  and often one of the most neglected. We must combat sexual violence as a method of warfare. Likewise  we must promote the participation of women in peacebuilding and in social and economic recovery. Denmark strongly believes that no durable peace can be attained without the full and equal participation of women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes.Building sustainable peace and long-term stability remains one of the most difficult challenges for the international community and the United Nations. But the investment is well worth it. We must support country-led and country-owned transition strategies in building paths towards resilient societies. Conflict and violence have devastating effects on development. The complex situation in fragile States represents perhaps the greatest challenge to combating poverty  as low-income fragile States are those most off-track in terms of reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is therefore essential that the central roles of State-building and peacebuilding be duly reflected in the post-2015 framework.The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States  led by the g7+ countries  provides peacebuilding and State-building goals that call for a global effort to strengthen people’s security  to reduce violence  to increase people’s access to justice  to generate employment and to improve livelihoods. We urge that the experiences and lessons learned from the New Deal become a source of inspiration for discussions on the post-2015 development framework.The process of establishing the post-2015 development agenda should result in a single universal framework with one set of goals that can unite the world in a strong effort to eradicate extreme poverty  promote sustainable development and ensure all people the right to a better life. Denmark welcomes the outcome document of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other Internationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities (resolution 68/3)  adopted last week  which provides a first important step towards that vision.At the same time  unfinished business from the MDGs must figure prominently in the post-2015 development agenda. The focus should be on ending extreme poverty in one generation while promoting sustainable development in all its dimensions. The empowerment of women and girls and access to basic services  such as health and education  must not drop off the agenda. On the contrary  we must commit to doing more to close those gaps.Denmark is committed to shouldering its share of collective responsibility. In 2012  Denmark provided 0.83 per cent of its gross national income as official development assistance  and it has been fulfilling the international target of 0.7 per cent since 1978. Also  we are strengthening our efforts to work in partnership with private business and other non-State actors to increase investments in developing countries  especially in Africa.As also highlighted by the Secretary-General and the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda in their reports  a new  coherent post-2015 framework must be firmly anchored in human rights as universal values and enablers for sustainable development. Such a framework must build on the core principles that underpin the international human rights framework  namely  participation  accountability  transparency and non-discrimination. It must address the human rights of all groups in our societies and pay special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples.We are losing ground when it comes to inequality within countries where we see a widening gap between rich and poor people. The 1.2 billion poorest people account for only 1 per cent of world consumption  while the billion richest consume 72 per cent. Inequalities and their underlying causes must be addressed in the post-2015 development agenda in order to effectively eradicate extreme poverty  underpin socioeconomic progress and prevent instability.Gender-based discrimination  including the denial of the rights of women and girls  remains the single most widespread driver of inequalities in today’s world. For Denmark  it is critical that gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights be reflected in the post-2015 agenda. That was also underscored by the High-level Panel report.Macroeconomic policy is essential in addressing inequalities. Equitable socioeconomic progress and a fair distribution of resources are important for developed and developing countries alike.Scientific evidence  as just presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  makes it clear that climate change has become a threat multiplier. More frequent natural disasters impact on the most vulnerable people and add another layer to fragility  inequality and instability. Unsustainable production and consumption increase the stress on natural resources and ecosystems. The level of carbon dioxide emissions today is 46 per cent higher than the 1990 level. The United Nations and its Member States must promote innovative technologies and new solutions to water  food and energy scarcity  deforestation and high carbon emissions. Jointly  we must push the transformation to a green economy.Green growth is necessary if we are to deal effectively with increased demands for resources over the next 15 to 20 years as the global population grows. Green growth is about opportunities for all  not about obstacles for some. The access to and management of energy and water resources are two important elements. Governments cannot do it alone. We need active involvement and a close partnership with the private sector  including businesses and private foundations  as well as with civil society and public institutions.We welcome the Secretary-General’s invitation to a summit in September 2014 that will serve to maintain the momentum of the climate negotiations. It is crucial to set an ambitious international agenda for tackling the consequences of climate change. Denmark’s long-term energy policy goal is clear: our entire energy supply should be covered by renewable energy by 2050. Denmark stands ready to support a global agenda towards limiting global warming to 2° Celsius. Our contribution to the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative is part of that support  including the establishment of an energy efficiency hub in the new United Nations City in Copenhagen. Denmark will also work for an ambitious and operational outcome of the the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to take place in September 2014.At the country level  Denmark supports a United Nations that can inspire change and deliver concrete results that will benefit populations  strengthen their confidence in political processes and pave the way for long-term stability and development.We condemn the indiscriminate violence that we witness in Syria. Not only does it harm civilians in the most tragic way  it also undermines regional stability as a whole. With the conflict in Syria  we are confronted with a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented proportions. Last month the world witnessed a further escalation of the conflict with the horrendous chemical attack in Ghouta. Denmark strongly condemns all use of chemical weapons  and we are convinced that a strong international reaction is required. It is crucial that those responsible for that grave violation of international law be brought to justice and that future use of chemical weapons be effectively prevented.From the very outset of the tragedy in Syria  Denmark has emphasized the need for a political solution to end the human suffering. We welcome the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2118 (2013)  on the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. Denmark continues to strongly support the efforts towards the “Geneva II” conference.In Egypt  an already fragile situation has worsened significantly over the past months  during which tragic events have led to a heavy loss of civilian lives. Democracy and dialogue must return. Progress in Egypt can come about only through a peaceful  inclusive process. Many challenges still lie ahead with regard to the implementation of the road map for a return to democratic and civilian rule in Egypt. We urge the Egyptian authorities to accept the support of the international community for that process. The United Nations can play an important role in supporting respect for human rights  democracy and the rule of law.Progress in the Middle East peace process remains critical for improving regional stability. Denmark welcomes the United States initiative aimed at resumed direct negotiations. All parties must now truly seize the opportunity for peace and work constructively for a sustainable two-State solution.In Afghanistan  we welcome the process towards full national ownership  which is crucial for the long-term future of the country. Afghan authorities are taking over still-greater responsibility for security and institutions. There is  however  a clear need for a continued  strong political commitment from the international community in order for Afghanistan to succeed in that goal. The Afghan Government and its international partners must live up to the July 2012 Tokyo declaration on partnership for self-reliance in Afghanistan. Denmark will remain a strong partner to Afghanistan on its way to democracy and improved livelihoods. The United Nations assistance to Afghanistan in managing the transition process  including the upcoming electoral processes  will be essential now and in the years to come.Peace and security in the Sahel region have lately been challenged by violent extremism  the presence of armed groups  the expansion of transborder organized crime and increasing environmental and climate-change pressures  which jeopardize development gains. Denmark supports the implementation of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel. Throughout the Sahel  the influence of civil society on national and international decision-making warrants attention in order to deepen and consolidate the ongoing stabilization and peace efforts.Together with the United Nations  the African Union and African and international partners  Denmark is committed to supporting the efforts in Mali and the Sahel to facilitate reconciliation through inclusive dialogue and the active engagement of civil society. We also support the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali as a strong United Nations peacekeeping Mission.Somalia’s New Deal Compact will be crucial for reconciliation and peacebuilding and will set the priorities for the next three years. It is important that peace and development be dealt with in an integrated way  and that there be mutual commitment to develop and follow up on the Compact for Somalia. We welcome the explicit use in the Compact of the peacebuilding and State-building goals from the New Deal Compact  and the strong ownership by Somalia to implement the principles of the New Deal.The unregulated and irresponsible international trade in arms has had devastating effects. Earlier this year  the General Assembly made history by adopting the Arms Trade Treaty. Denmark supports the swift entry into force and effective implementation of the Treaty. Denmark is committed to assisting States  on their request  to meet their obligations under the Treaty.We once again call upon Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply with international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We welcome all efforts to resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme.The United Nations is more relevant than ever at a time when strong multilateral cooperation is needed to cope with global challenges that transcend national borders. No country can confront those challenges on its own. Seen from the perspective of Denmark as a small State  the United Nations could and should inspire change and help States take action when moving forward towards 2015 and beyond."
"48",2022,"DOM",68,2013,"At the outset  I wish to express my congratulations to the President of the General Assembly upon his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I wish him the greatest of success in his task and in his efforts to promote the initiatives proposed for his term.I am here as a representative of the Dominican Republic  which was one of the signatories in 1945 of the Charter of the United Nations  which entrusts the Organization with the monumental task of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In the 68 years since its inception  there has not been another world war  but today we are facing a cataclysm that is just as lethal and destructive as a war of planetary dimensions: global poverty. It is a war with casualties in the millions  which calls for a radical change in the economic paradigm and for the forging of a new culture — the culture of sustainability. As I address the Assembly  there is no doubt in my mind that to triumph over such a daunting challenge  all nations must make difficult decisions  which will require the full weight of our collective responsibility.Allow me to refer to the extensive and detailed document adopted at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) last year (resolution 66/288  annex)  entitled “The future we want”. In that text  Member States renewed their commitment to sustainable development and to the promotion of a future that is sustainable in economic  social and environmental terms for our planet and for present and future generations. That declaration shows that the leaders of the world’s nations are committed to doing what is needed to attain that future. We therefore have a road map with profound implications.Let us acknowledge that we are taking on an overwhelming responsibility  because we are committing ourselves to building a reality that is totally unprecedented in the modern world. Let us acknowledge that development to date has not been sustainable in any way. It has not been sustainable either socially or economically. It has been even less sustainable in environmental terms. The systems of production that we have used to achieve economic growth have been based on methods that have proved to be harmful to the environment  and the systems that we have used to distribute the wealth produced have created deep chasms of social inequality and exclusion.Over time  we have reached a situation that we now consider to be intolerable: a world in which more than 1 billion people are living in a state of extreme poverty and hunger; a world in which many millions of human beings lack adequate health care  drinking water  good-quality education or decent employment; and a world in which extreme malnutrition and social exclusion prevail to a morally unacceptable extent. If we aspire to a world where development is sustainable  we must first accept our shared responsibility for all parts of all societies  and agree that it is time for actions  not words.To translate a commitment of such a magnitude into reality  it must be based on achievable actions and attainable goals  and we must be prepared to take bold action  as we are doing in the Dominican Republic  on several unprecedented fronts. We are putting citizens at the centre of our policies and making the fight against poverty and inequality our top priority. We are implementing a new development model based on a long-term national strategy built on the pillars of three fundamental social pacts: a fiscal pact  a pact for education and a pact for electricity. We are building transparency into Government actions and establishing citizens’ groups to oversee and monitor purchasing and contract systems. We are making support for small-scale agricultural producers a priority. We are doubling the budget for free and compulsory public education. We are extending the school day  and we are putting a permanent end to illiteracy.Following the commitments made at the Rio+20 Conference  we have taken a few steps forward and are moving towards an agreement on a road map that will lead us to sustainable development and to the eradication of extreme poverty. We have implemented a process to determine as accurately as possible what the sustainable development goals for the post-2015 international development agenda should be.We are pleased to note that we all agree that the greatest challenge the world faces is to eradicate poverty and  for that reason  that goal has been given top priority on the agenda of our people and our Organization.Our countries have common problems  but our economic  social  historical  geographical  demographic and cultural realities are different. Each of those dimensions plays a role in how those problems may or may not be addressed and resolved. Moreover  our responsibilities for the creation of or the aggravation of those common problems  such as climate change  are clearly differentiated.My country  the Dominican Republic  suffers the consequences of climate change  because of its geographical location in the path of annual hurricanes and tropical storms. For that reason  we are working to strengthen and improve our preparedness for the management of risks associated with natural disasters. We are building a collection centre for emergency assistance and are working on the creation of a centre of excellence  dedicated to the education and training of human resources for assistance in disasters  which will serve the nations in the entire Caribbean region.Next month  from 18 to 20 November  the Dominican Republic will host the third International Conference on the HOPEFOR initiative  to which all Members of the United Nations are cordially invited.Universal sustainable development is a goal that requires a new vision and approach on the international stage. In order for development to be sustainable in our nations  we must undertake structural reforms that will change many of our policies and our economic and social systems  turning them inside out  the way a sock is turned inside out. With sustainable development  we have taken on a commitment of biblical proportions  a universal commitment to care for our brothers and sisters  especially for those who most need to be elevated to the conditions required for adignified human life.The Organization is helping to point the way with the launch of parallel processes of study  discussion and analysis; panels of eminent persons; consultations with regional economic commissions; the Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network; and the open-ended working groups that are contributing to marking the path.We would therefore like to take the opportunity to express our appreciation for the work done by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in putting documents in the hands of Member States that will serve as a guide for our debates and our decisions. One such document  An Action Agenda for Sustainable Development  a report prepared for the Secretary-General in June by the Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network  is a bold and optimistic platform. It is an exhaustive and practical plan that requires a collective commitment that we cannot shirk. All reports agree that we cannot continue treating the part of the planet that each of our nations occupies as if the resources that nature has generously put within them were inexhaustible. The world’s forests  water supplies and mineral resources are decreasing  and animal species are endangered. At the same time  we continue to use methods of cultivation that poison or impoverish the Earth and methods of industrial production that poison the air we breathe.We must revise the very methods by which our economic growth is driven. That is not a new concern for the United Nations. We have been talking about sustainable development for decades. What is new now is that the situation has become a matter of urgency.The time for words and promises is over. The time for action is now. We must step up the pace to establish the foundations of sustainable development  because time is running out. We must address the purpose  knowing that what we do or do not agree upon in this session of the General Assembly may determine whether the future of our peoples  or rather  the future of humankind  will be promising or miserable. That presumption may seem exaggerated to representatives of larger or more highly developed nations. If so  we invite those nations to look beyond their borders and to consider the peoples of the nations from which they seek cheap labour. They must look at the peoples whose human resources they employ to produce their goods and services. They must look at the peoples in the countries that need the industries of the developed countries to process their mineral exports and at the peoples in the countries where they want to market their products.For many of those people  the situation is intolerable. That is why we are pleased to note that the documents that have already been written and which are intended to serve as a platform for our debates and decisions have an optimistic tone. They give us  for example  the assurance that if we act now  the problems we face will not become insoluble.Universal sustainable development  which addresses the challenges that have been so clearly identified  will translate into social justice in the world. It will also translate into peace  international peace  the achievement of which is a strategic goal of the Organization.To speak of eradicating extreme poverty  measured in terms of living on an income of less than $1.25 a day  sounds like an enormous goal  especially because it is estimated that some 1.2 billion people in the world suffer from poverty. In reality  that is just one step in a long journey. If those who are now below the income level of $1.25 per day are elevated to an income level of $2 per day  we will have eliminated what we now call extreme poverty. However  we all know that human beings cannot meet their basic needs on an income of $2 per day. The difference in hardship between the one income range and the other is not very noticeable. What happens is that talking about poverty in statistical terms does not allow us to visualize  much less feel  the reality of the human misery and desolation behind the numbers and the percentages. How can we understand the pain of a father and mother who have suffered the loss of their child when the words in which we are informed about that family tragedy are that every 10 seconds a child dies from hunger-related causes in the world?Let us put ourselves in the place of parents of families living in a state of extreme poverty. They have to raise their children in extremely unsafe living conditions  without sanitation or safe drinking water  without sufficient resources to buy medicine or to provide each child with food to ensure proper nutrition  without resources  without a bed or mosquito net to protect him from insects that transmit serious diseases. They have to decide which of their children can go to school and which cannot  or which of their children have to work and which do not.We know that a difficult road still remains ahead before we can agree on a satisfactory arrangement for all in regard to the post-2015 international development agenda and the most effective ways to implement it. Let us remember that what we need is not a new commitment. We have had many commitments to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. We have had the World Food Summit of 1996  the Millennium Summit in 2000  another World Food Summit five years later in 2002  and the recent Rio+20 Conference in 2012. What we need now is for those commitments to finally be translated into political action.Although sustainable development may sound like an economic concept  it really is a political concept. That is why we are discussing it here  at the Organization  which is a forum of States and therefore a political forum. Economists measure the dimensions or the pillars of reality in economic terms. Economists and other specialists can set the goals that must be reached for a sustainable development that meets their exact specifications. But political decisions are the driving force. Political decisions are what ultimately determine whether or not the goals are achieved.We therefore have the primary responsibility. It depends on us to put the declarations of good intentions into action."
"49",2069,"DZA",68,2013,"I would like first of all to warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  and his predecessor Mr. Vuk Jeremi. on their excellent work. I would also like to commend our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the steady enhancement of the role and status of the United Nations under his leadership. The designation of the post-2015 development agenda as the central theme not only of this general debate but also for this entire session is a timely reminder of the role of the United Nations in promoting peace and prosperity throughout the world  for the benefit of all humankind. Indeed  more than ever before  we need the visionary role of the United Nations in order to face up to the ills besetting humankind. The growing challenges arising from our increased interdependence are exacerbated by a multidimensional crisis that adversely affects our economies and governance and has disastrous social and humanitarian consequences. The only worthy response to the upheaval and dangers of our day is a determined quest for peace  justice and solidarity  in order to build with confidence that better future that we must bequeath to future generations.Consideration of the post-2015 agenda warrants a serious relaunching of the debate on development issues  particularly in terms of the elimination of poverty  a phenomenon that continues not only to affect the dignity of millions of human beings but also to threaten their lives. The international community should be primarily concerned at the lack of significant progress in its fight against poverty. Overcoming poverty is a long-standing endeavour that requires appropriate public policies coupled with effective international cooperation and consistent productive flows of investment  as well as greater complementarity between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions  with a view to exploiting synergies in the context of the peace-security-development triad. That means that new objectives for 2030 must be part of a global integral approach that reflects the disparities among regions  an improvement of the balance between urban and rural development  the strengthening of the capacities of poor people  good governance  the fight against corruption and the protection of the environment. In fact  it is a question of reaching an ambitious global agreement for the promotion of sustainable development containing commitments stemming from the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility  in particular for the mobilization of the financing needed for capacity-building and the transfer of know-how and technology.Under its 2010-2014 five-year plan  Algeria is implementing a human development strategy that sets forth ambitious policies to promote social justice and balanced regional preparations  within a framework of strict resource management  where the education  health  housing and infrastructure sectors continue to be given priority  backed by investment in economic growth. Those extensive efforts are naturally supported at the international level by multifaceted assistance to countries affected by crises and natural disasters and by the effective integration of debt relief for the poorest countries in Africa and other parts of the world.At the same time  Algeria is projecting its own development in the context of the historic coherence of the great Arab Maghreb Union project that the peoples of the region aspire to profoundly. That overall initiative came from the agenda of the President of the Republic  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  and is aimed at making all Algerian men and women free from fear and need.The celebration this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization of African Unity-African Union under the theme of “African Renaissance” is an important milestone in the rise of our continent on the stage of history  giving us grounds for hope and ambition  as well as promises of African solutions for the problems of Africa  with the assistance of the rest of the international community. Algeria is participating in that shared destiny of the African peoples  and we welcome and are gratified by the progress made towards the recovery and economic development of the continent and the considerable rates of growth that have been recorded. We are also gratified at Africa’s steady progress towards conflict prevention and settlement. We also welcome the achievements of good governance  human rights and pluralist democracy. Algeria is particularly delighted at the liberation of the regions in the north of Mali from the claws of terrorist and criminal groups as well as the restoration of the constitutional order in this fraternal country with the clear success of the presidential elections.Algeria  which remains the target of international terrorism — as we were reminded by the violent terrorist attack carried out against the Tiguentourine gas complex early this year — is making an effective contribution to the joint efforts to promote collective security in the Sahelo-Saharan region as well as in the rest of Africa and beyond. Whether it is a question of Somalia  Darfur  relations between the Sudan and South Sudan  the Great Lakes region  the Central African Republic or efforts to restore constitutional order in a number of brotherly countries  Algeria is harmoniously blending its voice and efforts with those of the African Union.Algeria  which is resolutely committed to the right of peoples to self-determination  supports the intensification of the efforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara  Mr. Christopher Ross  to prevail on the two parties to the conflict — the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front — to agree in negotiations on the lifting of all obstacles  so that the people of Western Sahara can freely determine their own future. Algeria is naturally supportive of the Arab peoples  who are experiencing difficult transitions and are confronting multiple challenges in a particularly delicate phase of democratic and socioeconomic transformation. We encourage the promotion of political solutions to governance crises as well as the management by consensus of these critical transitional periods. Clearly  military solutions are neither possible nor desirable in the context of the polarization of societies and the exacerbation of partisan interests and dissent.Algeria reaffirms its rejection of the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction. In that regard  we categorically condemn the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict  regardless of who the perpetrators were or the circumstances. In welcoming the initiative of the Russian Federation and the Russian-American agreement as well as the adherence of Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention  Algeria calls for the creation of political momentum towards the holding of the Geneva II conference and the attainment of a political solution among the parties in Syria. We reiterate our encouragement and support for Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as he leads those praiseworthy peace efforts.In a Middle East mired in dangers and crises  a just settlement of the question of Palestine remains at the heart of any serious effort to stabilize the region. While welcoming the efforts of the United States  which led to a resumption of negotiations  Algeria expresses the hope that the international community can redouble its efforts for the rapid establishment of an internationally recognized Palestinian State within the borders of June 1967  with Al-Quds as its capital.The legitimacy of the United Nations must be strengthened and its role enhanced  and to that end its reform must not be unduly delayed. We must ensure that the General Assembly remains participatory in nature and must increase the economic  social  humanitarian and environmental functions of the programmes  entities and agencies of the United Nations system. We must also agree on a democratic reform of the Security Council that covers its working methods and its composition and ensures equitable representation  taking into particular account the African States’ Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations must be heeded when  from within the democratic framework of the General Assembly  it issues statements of strong positions that reflect the universal conscience  whether it is a question of strengthening the foundations of international humanitarian law and protecting civilians or specific situations  such as the long overdue lifting of the economic blockade that has been imposed on Cuba for decades now and the current one imposed on the Gaza Strip. The will of the international community that is so often reiterated here must prevail.Algeria is working within the organizations and groups to which it belongs and with its other partners towards the elimination of the many obstacles to building peaceful  well-balanced and just international relations. We are nurturing the virtues of dialogue  and we place our hopes in the Alliance of Civilization and mutual respect among religions. Algeria is deeply dedicated to the heritage of the values shared by all humankind  beginning with the sacred nature  value and dignity of human beings and the promotion and protection of all human rights. It is this commitment that inspires Algeria’s candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2014-2016 period. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action  and Algeria  moved by a high sense of responsibility  would like to dedicate itself to improving the effectiveness of the Council  strengthening the universal and interdependent nature of human rights and mobilizing the international community in this lofty collective endeavour.As a member of the Council  Algeria will share its experience in human rights and in the rights of peoples. We will endeavour to improve our own performance by  inter alia  adapting our national legislation and harmonizing it with the relevant international treaties and promoting the inclusion of all segments of society  including women  who now comprise 31 per cent of the deputies elected to the People’s National Assembly last year. All of these factors make Algeria a good candidate for the Human Rights Council and have won it the support of the League of Arab States  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the African Union.Almost 40 years ago  in 1974  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  who was at that time Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria and President of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session  made significant history here by putting an end to the usurpation of the people of South Africa’s representation by the apartheid regime and by welcoming to this Hall for the first time the Palestine Liberation Organization  thus opening up two significant paths towards peace. Since then  prodigious advances in science and technology  which have increased the power of humankind over nature  and changes in the very fabric of the international community have only increased the expectations of our peoples  for whom the United Nations remains the best refuge. May God inspire us to work in the best interests of our countries and our peoples. "
"50",2116,"ECU",68,2013,"It is an honour  Mr. President  for me to address the General Assembly. Things have changed since I was first here  and not only because time has passed and we have all become a little older — not that old age is a problem. The problem is how we approach it and  indeed  how we approach disability. That is why Ecuador believes that  in the context of the 2015 and post-2015 development agenda  we should include quantitative targets with measurable goals for persons with disabilities  together with international cooperation. Let us never again adopt a development agenda that fails to take account of persons with disabilities and their families. We must take specific measures to incorporate disability at the global  regional and national levels with a view to achieving verifiable results.As I was saying  things have changed since my first visit to the General Assembly Hall. Many words have reverberated within its walls  and ended up who knows where. Much has been said  and perhaps even the most patient among us is becoming a little exhausted. Our address  which may contain many impromptu comments  states things as we find them. I see  as others perhaps have  that every day it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach this colourful  cosmopolitan city. I do not think that is what its inhabitants want  for with their clamour they seem to be celebrating the diversity of the world that is characteristic of New York. It is in fact the bureaucrats that put obstacles in our way  drawing lines that are frequently difficult to cross.What shall we do in future years in the face of the obstacles that sometimes isolate the United Nations Headquarters? How can we  with the agreement of all  ensure that the Charter of the United Nations is respected? The host country  which is well aware how diverse the Organization is  wants to be the sole arbiter of who can come and who cannot  on the basis of its own likes and dislikes.That very powerful State has also taken it upon itself to spy on us  on the pretext of safeguarding its own security. It is true that human beings everywhere have lived through times of fear and terror. There is good reason to be vigilant. But the history of humankind  and consequently of the Organization  is in part the recording of an evolution in the rights of every one of us. We have been building and reinforcing rights that we consider to already have been established  such as the privacy and inviolability of communications. It is therefore regrettable that  at a time when technological advances have enabled every man and every woman to communicate with every other man and every other woman throughout the world  an Administration has set up a global surveillance system that knows no borders  that does not differentiate between friends and enemies and that fails to distinguish between criminals and law-abiding citizens.Let us be frank: it is not the existence of a system that intrudes upon the private life of every person in the world that surprises us. We all in fact suspected that such a system existed. No  it is its sheer scope that confounds us — a global espionage system that knows no limits  without even respect for the bounds of common decency  and without regard for the sovereignty of States and the right to privacy and freedom of expression of all citizens.It cannot be denied that the bonds of trust between States and Governments  which underpin negotiations  among other things  and effective agreements to combat international organized crime  including terrorism  have been seriously compromised by the unrestrained actions of the United States  which has taken it upon itself to spy on our communications. Many of the countries affected have requested  on behalf of their Governments and citizens  that the United States Government account for its universal espionage programmes  but have not to date received a satisfactory response.On numerous occasions  we have heard the representatives of the United States Government express to the United Nations their readiness to discuss the issue. My delegation is willing to initiate such a discussion forthwith  in a frank  clear and open fashion  and believes that there is no better forum for doing so than the Assembly and its Committees  without excluding such other entities as the Human Rights Council.Because we believe that this is the forum in which to defend the right of all peoples to be respected  beginning with respect for their territorial integrity  we are reitereating  for the umpteenth time  that the time has come for the Israeli settlements to cease and for Palestine to be respected and recognized within the 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital.Along the same lines  we would like to make a democratic appeal: 188 of the Organization’s 193 Member States have clearly stated that it is time to end the unjust embargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba. Cuba is part of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas. Cuba is a member State of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Cuba is part of the international community  and its people cannot continue to suffer the harmful consequences of that embargo.We also would like to reiterate our belief that dialogue can resolve the Malvinas Islands conflict. The United Kingdom must accede to what has been called for at the United Nations so often  that is  to sit at the negotiating table and leave the history of overseas territories to the shameful past. The Malvinas lie very close to Argentina  and quite far from the United Kingdom.Allow me briefly to mention that  in my country  we have recognized the rights of nature. We have to wager on different things. We must rein in the capacity to devastate of those who want unlimited growth even at the cost of ecological balances. Once disrupted  nature itself will restore those balances and all of us will be cast out  with not even a trace remaining of what we arrogantly call civilization.We have therefore decided to raise our voice against the high-handedness of some multinational firms — and in that regard have had the support of other Governments — whose unbridled pursuit of unlimited profit subjugates human beings for the sake of capital  damages the environment and violates human rights  all the while having us believe that it is possible to bring a State and its people to its knees.Ecuador has stood up to the defamatory campaign of one such company. In 2011  Chevron was ordered to pay $19 billion in response to the claim lodged by 30 000 inhabitants of my country who were affected by the devastating pollution that firm left behind in the Amazon. I should make it clear that it was not the State of Ecuador that sued the corporation  it was our people.We must also denounce the overwhelming statistics showing how arbitration tribunals fail countries such as mine  which  paradoxically  can serve to shed light on the web of intersecting interests among businesses  arbitrators and lawyers associated with such tribunals. We in South America have undertaken various initiatives  such as the establishment of a dispute-settlement centre within the Union of South American Nations. The centre will play a key role in reconfiguring the balance between national public interests and multinational private profits.My country condemns the violence being experienced in Syria  as well as serious violations of international law and human rights  regardless of their source. From the outset  Ecuador has argued that a military solution is not a way out of the crisis in Syria. We must always address armed conflicts head-on  setting aside any manipulation in sole pursuit of outside interests. We should allow comprehensive solutions based on international law to bear fruit and flourish.In that context  the situation in Syria  a millennial nation facing a terrible period  deserves our sincere and sustained attention  for hundreds of thousands of human lives have been lost and thousands of others constantly confront danger.Ecuador welcomes as a positive step Syria’s recent accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. We look forward to the final results of the investigations by the United Nations on all claims of chemical weapons in Syria  because only on the basis of those results can the international community be confident of having a sufficiently broad and much more credible overview.As an executive member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Ecuador joined the consensus on the adoption of the decision on chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. We did so because we believed that decision reflected the endeavours of the international community to preserve peace  defend the lives of Syrian citizens and move towards a political solution to the crisis.We also note  and we consider it very important  that the Security Council’s decision should not be interpreted by any State as a justification for unilateral action that violates international law  which prohibits the use or the threat of the use of force and calls for respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States. As a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention  we condemn the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party. We also reiterate the obligation of States to refrain from providing any type of military support to non-State actors.Those are some of the topics that cause us major concern. There will be more  voiced by others  so that we can ultimately approach the world with hope and restore our human capacity to be able to continue believing in what inspired the establishment of the United Nations: dialogue for the sake of peace  as well as democracy  justice  inclusion and equality and as an antidote to war."
"51",2161,"EGY",68,2013,"It gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. John Ashe and his friendly country  Antigua and Barbuda  upon his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia  for his efforts during the previous session.I reiterate our support to the Secretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes and principles of the Charter. I also welcome the choice of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the main theme of this session  considering the high priority that the United Nations and the peoples of the world accord to the achievement of development in all its dimensions.Allow me to deviate from customary practice for a debate in the General Assembly by conveying to the Assembly a message that comes not only from the President of Egypt  Mr. Adly Mansour  but from the people of my country — the Egyptians who laid the foundations of human civilization and have recently inspired peoples around the world. Egypt holds a unique position in the history of humankind  past and present. Its status  role and influence derive essentially from its culture and civilization. It would have been a historical inconsistency had the will of the Egyptians remained shackled at the dawn of a new century  and had our youth remained deprived of the right to design their own destiny and future. It was therefore natural for our people to take to the streets on 25 January 2011 to declare their determination to build a democratic and modern State in which their children could enjoy freedom  dignity and social justice.This is the Egypt that millions of my countrymen and women chose then — the same Egypt they yearned for on 30 June 2013. In doing so  they showed the world that the will of the people cannot be broken and that it can grant authority  just as it can remove it from the hands of those who abuse it.The Egyptians have an ambitious vision for the future that can be achieved by working systematically in a reasonable time frame. Its success is based on a society that is open to all peaceful political currents  that pluralistically embraces the diversity of all its members  and that inclusively ensures the equal rights and duties of all citizens through the rule of law and equality before justice. The principles and practices of this vision are consistent with the fundamental rules that govern democratic practices throughout the world  in particular respect for peaceful dialogue  the rejection of violence  the rule of law and respect for human rights.Our conviction that Egyptians have the right to fulfil such a vision underpins the road map that Egypt has been implementing since 3 July. That road map includes a national agenda to build the institutions of a democratic State in a specific time frame. All Egyptians are invited to participate in all phases of the political process  as long as they are committed to renouncing violence and terrorism or incitement thereto.Work is under way  in line with the road map  on several tracks. To date  it has succeeded in establishing the principles of justice  freedom and democracy as bases for governance. Work is under way on the new constitution  to be followed by parliamentary elections and presidential elections  bringing the transitional phase to an end by next spring. We are determined to fully implement the road map. This requires us to give the utmost priority to preserving security  enforcing the law and countering any attempts to intimidate or humiliate us or hinder our efforts. Some parts of Egypt were recently hit by desperate terrorist attacks. Among their victims were Egyptians from all walks of life — men and women  young and old  Muslims and non-Muslims. Those hideous acts of terrorism sought to undermine the democratic process and to destroy our economy. I would like to emphasize and reiterate in the strongest terms our full confidence that the brave Egyptian people  who succeeded in imposing their will  can eradicate terrorism within the framework of the rule of law. I trust that the international community will stand firmly with the Egyptian people in the fight against those who commit or advocate for violence  and will accept no attempt to justify or tolerate it.I take this opportunity to convey my deep condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya and Pakistan on the loss of innocent lives as a result of the latest terrorist attack.The message I am carrying from Egyptians  particularly our youth  who are joining me here today and representing their ancient country  would not be complete without mentioning Egypt’s aspirations to enjoy more democratic international relations and stronger ties of cooperation between our people and the rest of the world. Those relations should be based on the principles of independence  mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and on a foreign policy founded on equality and a constructive  civilized vision for the future. Egypt’s foreign policy is now a reflection of the will of our people  and it is formulated in line with our national interests and security with no regard to any other consideration.We fully recognize that Egypt’s national security is linked to the security and concerns of our Arab nation. Given its geographical location  history and identity  Egypt is committed to continuing to defend the interests of its African continent  to address the issues of importance to the Islamic world  to spread the Islamic values of moderation and tolerance  and to promote dialogue among divine religions. Egypt also remains committed to tackling the challenges facing the South at a time when the world is witnessing an imbalance of power.I would now like to briefly highlight Egypt’s position on several issues of high priority in our foreign policy.In Syria  the tragedy has now extended to the resort to chemical weapons. We strongly condemn their use and support the agreement reached between the Russian Federation and the United States  as well as Security Council resolution 2118 (2013). While the humanitarian crisis resulting from the fighting continues to intensify  the Syrian State itself is on the verge of disintegration. It is imperative to reach a political solution as soon as possible that would establish the freedom  dignity and democracy to which the people of Syria aspire and preserve the unity of the State. We hope that can be achieved through the holding of the “Geneva II” conference  so that a transitional authority can be put in place to end the civil war and the foreign interventions that we have long warned against.The Palestinian question remains the main source of tension in our region. Palestine is still suffering the effects of the ongoing Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the intensification of settlement activities. The hope for achieving a two-State solution was until recently on the verge of fading away irrevocably. Given that bleak scenario  we welcome and appreciate the recent efforts of the United States to advance the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The commitment of both sides to engaging in a process of time-bound negotiations is a significant development. We should all support the ongoing negotiations so that they may lead to the final settlement of the Palestinian question  which has continued since the past century.Egypt will continue to support the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on all the territories of the West Bank and Gaza and in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant terms of reference. I reiterate that the needs of the Gaza population must be met. The failure to do so has become politically and morally unacceptable. We therefore call on Israel and the international community to shoulder their responsibilities and ensure that the Palestinians in Gaza have access to basic supplies. We are ready to cooperate with the Palestinian authority and all concerned parties to agree on appropriate arrangements that guarantee the delivery of provisions in legal and transparent ways.The Assembly will agree that a new Middle East will not emerge until the right to equal security is ensured and the threats posed by the existence in our region of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are eliminated. The situation threatens the credibility of the non-proliferation regime and the United Nations. For that reason  and to preserve that credibility  I would like to introduce to the Assembly today an initiative consisting of the following steps.First  we must invite all countries of the Middle East and the five permanent members of the Security Council to deposit official letters with the Secretary-General stating their support for declaring the Middle East a region free from nuclear  chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.Secondly  the countries of the region that have not signed or ratified any of the international conventions on weapons of mass destruction should commit  before the end of 2013  to simultaneously signing and ratifying the relevant conventions. They should also deposit documentation of their accession to those conventions with the Security Council. I invite the Secretary-General to coordinate such steps so that they are carried out simultaneously to ensure their success.Those actions translate into the following. Israel must accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear State  ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention  and sign and ratify the Biological Weapons Convention. Syria must ratify the Biological Weapons Convention and take the remaining steps it has pledged to take in relation to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Egypt must ratify the Biological Weapons Convention and sign and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention  provided that all countries of the Middle East complete measures of accession to the international conventions prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and related arrangements and treaties.Thirdly  we must pursue international efforts to ensure that the delayed 2012 conference to establish a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction is convened as soon as possible  preferably before the end of 2013 and by the spring of 2014 at the latest.Egypt’s roots go deep in Africa. We are proud of the many positive changes that Africa has witnessed and of the strides the continent has taken towards democracy and development. Yet Africa remains in need of concerted national  regional and international efforts to enable the continent to resolve its conflicts and challenges. Accordingly  Egypt will soon establish an Egyptian agency for development partnership. Most of its future resources will be directed to African countries so that they can benefit from Egyptian technical expertise and assets.We cannot talk about democracy in current international relations and the rule of law at the international level unless comprehensive and substantial reform of the United Nations takes place  so that the Organization is better able to respond to challenges and to meet the aspirations of peoples worldwide. The only logical and sound way to achieve that desired outcome is the reform and expansion of the Security Council. Egypt therefore renews its call for an end to the monopoly of permanent members over the decision-making process in the Council and for the rectification of the historical injustice inflicted on Africa. The continent does not have a permanent seat on the Council and is poorly represented in the category of non-permanent members. Africa will not renounce its demands to obtain the permanent membership it deserves  as specified in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.In conclusion  I would like to highlight our priority issues within the United Nations system. They include strengthening the international human rights framework  addressing the absence of democracy in international relations  accelerating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  realizing nuclear disarmament and fighting corruption  including recovering the assets stolen by key members of the regimes recently brought down by our peoples. We reiterate that we are determined to continue empowering women nationally and internationally  to protecting human rights  and to allowing our youth to contribute effectively to the elaboration of Egypt’s vision for the world and for its future. I take this opportunity to welcome the appointment a few months ago by the Secretary-General of a Special Envoy on Youth who comes from the Arab world. We must also exert concerted efforts at the international level to combat terrorism and strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to coordinate those efforts and address the root causes of terrorism.In conclusion  I truly hope that the message I have delivered on behalf of the people and the President of Egypt has been received by the Assembly today. I also hope that the aspirations it identified will be realized so that we may achieve progress  peace and development and that next year we may reap the fruits of our labour. "
"52",2185,"ERI",68,2013,"Let me first join previous speakers in expressing my delegation’s deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims and to the people and the Government of Kenya on the terrorist attack at Westgate Mall in Nairobi.It is almost two generations now since Eritrea first begun to lodge petitions for justice with this body. Sadly  in all of those instances  the Assembly has persisted in ignoring Eritrea’s pleas  shuttering its doors as a “closed monastery”. Those setbacks notwithstanding  Eritrea remains firmly convinced that the promotion of peoples’ rights and interests and mutual respect among the community of nations will remain precarious without an international body that upholds the supremacy of international law and justice. As such  our choice  like those of other peoples  has been and remains the funnelling of efforts towards expediting the reform of the United Nations.To focus exclusively on the harm done to the people and State of Eritrea may convey the false impression of an aberration in an otherwise effective and well-functioning United Nations. As it is  the particularity of our case only amplifies the wider backdrop of a United Nations debilitated by chronic weaknesses and shortcomings. In any event  my message today will focus primarily on the urgency of reforming the United Nations and redressing the injustices committed against the people of Eritrea as well as other peoples of the world.The negative experiences during the first 50 years of the existence of the United Nations and the paralysis and constraints under which the United Nations had to operate in the context of the realities of the Cold War in a bipolar world accentuated the need for structural reform of the United Nations at that time. In Eritrea’s case  our inalienable right to independence was trampled at the onset of the Cold War  since the country was perceived as a mere pawn in the overriding strategic rivalry of both super-Powers. Our liberation struggle was likewise suppressed by both super-Powers in an alternating fashion because of the same strategic considerations and shifting alliances.Yesterday’s history is too fresh in our minds to induce in us any nostalgia for the Cold War. Our call for reform of the United Nations is thus not influenced by some innate preference for the return of the old  bipolar configuration to replace the prevailing unipolar world order. The fact is that the United Nations should have undergone incremental reform and revitalization during the 50 years of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War was certainly the most auspicious moment for undertaking that belated task.Indeed  it is now clear in retrospect that had such reforms occurred then  the wars and destruction that have unfolded in the past 20 years could have been avoided. However  the major Powers that controlled the General Assembly and the various institutions and agencies of the United Nations  through partial hegemony  felt after 1991 that they were better positioned to secure and consolidate their total domination of the United Nations. They blocked any reform of the United Nations  and so that historic opportunity for international peace and justice to prevail was lost.In the past 20 years  we have witnessed excessive control over global resources and the creation of spheres of influence  which has triggered international instability; the use of force and coercion as primary instruments for controlling global resources while preventing and denying others the opportunity to acquire comparable military capabilities and technology; and the deployment of international financial institutions  including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  in order to control the global economy  leading to an intractable global financial crisis with lethal ramifications for the majority of the peoples of the world. We have also witnessed the misuse of the mass media and cultural centres in order to create false images and to promote decadent value systems  intimidate peoples and demonize any dissent; and the employment of various subterfuges in order to control  directly or indirectly  all international  continental  regional  governmental and non-governmental bodies. Those manifestations of the current world order can be corroborated  beyond abstract analysis  by numerous specific cases and evidence related to particular events  places and time. That is precisely why the twenty-first century requires a revitalized United Nations that transcends a bipolar or unipolar world order  and that is firmly rooted in the supremacy of  and respect for  international law and justice.As I have intimated  Eritrea  like other African States that were formed during the colonial scramble  should have attained its sovereign independence during the process of decolonization that transpired in the aftermath of the Second World War. The inalienable national rights of the Eritrean people were  however  compromised to serve the strategic interests of the United States  which had emerged as a triumphant Power. Eritrea was therefore doomed to colonial rule by proxy. The people of Eritrea had to endure colonial suppression for almost 40 years under successive regimes  which were propped up  alternately  by the United States for the first 23 years and by the former Soviet Union for the subsequent 17 years. The Eritrean people had to wage their liberation struggle under those conditions  which exacted heavy sacrifices from them to achieve their independence in 1991. That historical truth  coupled with other similar phenomena  illustrates the perils of a world order that is driven by the rivalry of domineering super-Powers  and highlights the need and urgency for an effective United Nations.The Eritrean people were neither compensated for the transgressions meted out to them nor given respite in the subsequent years. As they embarked on the arduous task of rebuilding their war-torn country  they again became pawns in the broader Horn of Africa/Middle East chessboard of domination and influence and have suffered unjust and distorted policies for the past 20 years. In that respect  border conflicts that do not have political and legal justifications and that were never raised prior to the independence of Eritrea in 1991 were subtly fomented to ensnare Eritrea in a spiral of crises.Although the Boundary Commission had rendered its final and binding decision in 2002  the spurious border conflict that erupted under the Badme rubric continued to simmer for 11 years due to obstructive violations by the United States Administration. The Eritrean people were also subjected to a sustained human trafficking campaign and illicit measures aimed at undermining economic growth and development  as well as diplomatic and propaganda campaigns of demonization.Going even further  United States officials imposed unlawful sanctions against Eritrea in 2009 through the Security Council. Four years on  they insist on maintaining the sanctions  despite the lack of any evidence or justification  by relying on the widely discredited reports of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea.Beyond Eritrea  the same approaches and policies have exacerbated crises and further undermined stability  development and cooperation in Somalia and other parts of the Horn of Africa. Despite that massive hostility and in the face of tremendous odds  the people and Government of Eritrea have remained steadfast  prioritized development efforts and the improvement of citizens’ lives  and have worked persistently to make their modest contribution to regional peace and stability  including by fighting terrorism and piracy. Their achievements  given the difficulties they faced  have been remarkable  even though they fall far short of their aspirations.Looking forward  the people and the Government of Eritrea are prepared to link hands with regional and international partners  including the United Nations  and to work for the betterment of their country for peace  stability and regional integration in the Horn of Africa and a fairer and more just world.The transgressions that have been perpetrated against the people of Eritrea and other peoples in the past 20 years speak to the persistence of an unfair and unjust global order and the absence of a strong and representative United Nations. And yet  the telltale signs of the advent of a new  promising era are discernible. In that context  I add the voice of the Eritrean people to other voices in the world to urge the General Assembly to keep the flicker of hope alive in its current session and to adopt timely resolutions aimed at a fundamental reform of the United Nations. The fact is that the Assembly has legal  moral and historical obligations and responsibilities entrusted to it by the peoples of the world that it cannot shrug off.In conclusion  I urge the United Nations to adopt practical resolutions that are commensurate with its legal  political and moral responsibilities in order to  first  uphold the rule of law; secondly  bring to an end the invasion of our sovereign territories; thirdly  lift the unlawful and harmful sanctions against Eritrea; fourthly  terminate interventions that jeopardize the peace and stability of the peoples of the Horn of Africa; and  fifthly  deter all acts that breed crises  loss of life and destruction."

The decisions we take here present the international community with a body of opinion that is difficult to rebut. This is the debating Hall of global legitimacy. We are all permanent members here  and it is here that multilateralism takes on its full meaning and effect.Spain has faith in the United Nations and is firmly committed to the Organization  because we subscribe completely to the purposes and principles it embodies. Our commitment to the United Nations is not mere rhetoric. Spain is the sixth largest contributor to the system. That commitment legitimizes our aspiration to serve the goals of the United Nations in the Security Council in the 2015-2016 biennium. We shall do so in the same spirit of dialogue and consensus as on the most recent previous occasion when the Assembly placed its trust in Spain. In the 10 years that have passed since then  my country has continued to demonstrate by its actions its resolve to faithfully serve the goals of the United Nations — the maintenance of international peace and security  the peaceful resolution of conflicts  international cooperation for development and the promotion and observance of human rights.The maintenance of international peace and security is a prerequisite for the progress of humankind. Spain believes firmly in the threefold values of peace  security and development  which is why more than 130 000 Spanish soldiers have served in United Nations peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions in every region of the world since 1989. Spanish troops are currently serving under the blue flag of the United Nations in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  where since 2006 they have helped to ensure peace and stability in a country that is located in a particularly turbulent region.Spain works to promote disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control  and it took an active part in the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations. We have also participated in various international initiatives to prevent nuclear terrorism. Spain has suffered the violence of terrorism and knows that new threats from non-State factions call for a global response through international cooperation. We must comprehensively implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and arrive at a global convention to combat that menace  which transcends borders. The people of Spain know from experience that the responsibility for terrorism lies with the terrorists alone; it is exclusive to them and non-transferable  whatever its perpetrators may claim. We should always honour the memory of the victims  which is key to denying social or moral legitimacy to terrorism of any kind.Our commitment to working for peace and security in the world was made evident this year during the crisis in Mali. Spain initially supported the African-led International Support Mission in Mali  and thereafter the deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Spanish troops in the European Union mission in Mali are training the country’s armed forces  which are responsible for ensuring the country’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity  with full respect for human rights. Mali is defeating terrorism and has regained its territorial integrity  an unquestionable success that we can all be proud of. But it is only the first step. The return to constitutional order  with the holding of presidential elections  marks the start of a second phase of building the open and inclusive institutions that are essential to Mali’s future. In the long term  we must continue to support development throughout the Sahel as the only way to promote security  democracy and prosperity in the region.The entire Assembly should welcome the role played by African organizations in that crisis. Special recognition is due to the African Union  which celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year. Spain has very close ties with Africa. That continent’s concerns are ours  too. We participate in the African Union’s summits and in funding the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  and we were the first non-African country to contribute directly to the African Union Commission’s budget. Spain has launched a strategic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and continues to strengthen its ties with other regional organizations in Africa. We back up those commitments with genuine support. Over the past four years  Spain has contributed €100 million to ECOWAS and the same amount to the African Development Bank.For the past two years  we have been witness to the courageous and determined efforts of Arab peoples to assert their dignity  consolidate their democratic systems and exclude those who promote violence and the violation of fundamental human rights. The road to democracy is not easy  but there cannot and must not be any turning back. Democracy has to be an effort undertaken by all of society  working towards coexistence and inclusiveness  an effort which is based on dialogue  tolerance and respect for human rights. That undertaking should be embraced by every country  not just at the political level but also at the social and economic. To support those processes of democratic governance  Spain has launched the Masar programme  aimed at Governments and civil society in North Africa and the Middle East.The Assembly is aware that the situation in Syria has become an intolerable  heartbreaking human tragedy  as well as a growing threat to regional and international peace and security. The brutal attack with sarin gas against civilians in Damascus — confirmed by the report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic (see A/67/997) — has been widely condemned in the international community  which firmly believes that that act must not be repeated or go unpunished. The proposal by Russia and the United States that will allow international control and the subsequent destruction of all stocks of chemical weapons in Syria has been applauded by all. It is now necessary for the Security Council to adopt a resolution to establish a legally binding prohibition on the use of chemical weapons in Syria and to ensure their mandatory destruction. Much rests on that question. As the Secretary-General remarked  it constitutes a challenge to international security  one that if not resolved will represent a collective failure. Spain firmly believes that only political dialogue between the parties will put an end to the increasingly violent conflict  as was highlighted by the report (A/HRC/24/46) presented to the Human Rights Council. Therefore  we support the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria  to promote a political transition in Syria. Spain is confident of the success of the “Geneva II” conference. In that respect  I reiterate before the Assembly my call to the parties to demonstrate a constructive attitude. Spain will continue to bolster the opposition forces in order to ensure an orderly and inclusive transition to democracy. Finally  it is essential to maintain the humanitarian effort to help reduce the suffering of Syria’s internally displaced population and that of the refugees in neighbouring countries.In a related context  I wish to emphasize that the Middle East peace process is taking on a new perspective. Last year  in this very forum  it was decided by a significant majority to recognize Palestine as a United Nations Observer State. The current negotiations are perhaps the last chance to reach a just  comprehensive and lasting peace for the two States  Israel and Palestine  to live in peace  security and prosperity. At this crucial time for the region  the political leaders concerned  with the support of the international community  must take the bold decisions necessary to achieve the historic goal of peace  and thereby promote stability in the entire region and the world.My country is a staunch advocate of dialogue and the use of peaceful means for the settlement of disputes. We believe that conflict prevention is one of the main instruments for ensuring peace and security. Therefore  we have participated in the Peacebuilding Commission  the establishment of the Alliance of Civilizations and the establishment  with Austria and Saudi Arabia  of the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue. We believe in mediation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. That is why we are a member of the United Nations Group of Friends of Mediation. Within the Group  together with Morocco  we have launched the initiative on mediation in the Mediterranean region  which has recently started producing results. The General Assembly has developed a consolidated  universal legal doctrine on decolonization  which Spain has endorsed wholeheartedly. Once again  I must submit to the Assembly the question of Gibraltar  which the Organization included in 1963 in the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories awaiting decolonization. The only such territory remaining in Europe  it affects our territorial integrity.Since that date  the United Kingdom has ignored the mandate of the General Assembly and the commitment made to Spain in the 1984 Brussels Declaration. That anachronism continues to inconvenience the citizens of Gibraltar and the surrounding area. Resting its case on the legitimacy granted by the universal doctrine of the General Assembly  Spain once again reiterates its call to the United Kingdom to resume bilateral dialogue and regional cooperation. Western Sahara remains one of the unresolved issues at the United Nations. Spain supports the search for a fair  lasting and mutually acceptable solution  one that provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara within the framework of the United Nations and in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Accordingly  Spain fully endorses the work carried out in that respect by the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy.I would like to highlight the contribution of Latin America and its regional organizations to multilateralism. Their constructive input on global issues  such as the environment and development  is of fundamental importance. During the forthcoming Ibero-American Summit in Panama  we will address global challenges in the political  economic and social contexts and offer some joint responses. The General Assembly has declared 2013 the International Year of Water Cooperation. The human right to water and sanitation is essential for sustainable development and the fight against poverty. That is why  in 2008  Spain set up the Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation  endowed with $1 billion for projects in Latin America. Moreover  conscious of the strategic value of water in ensuring peace and security  Spain and Algeria have planned to launch a water strategy for the Western Mediterranean. Thanks to the work of the United Nations  there is broad awareness of the crucial importance of the fight against climate change  which is a direct and immediate priority. Next year will be the year of the small island developing States and will provide an excellent opportunity to jointly address the problems they face. Their efforts to adapt to climate change and to mitigate its harmful effects must be supported  as they produce the least pollution yet suffer the most from its consequences. As a nation  Spain acts in solidarity and has made every effort to promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has channelled its solidarity through the multilateral system of the United Nations in the belief that that system guarantees the principle of neutrality in the allocation of funds to effectively achieve the ultimate goal  namely  the eradication of poverty.In 2007  Spain  together with the United Nations Development Programme  established the MDG Achievement Fund  which has had a real impact on the lives of 20 million people through more than 130 programmes in 50 countries  disbursing almost $1 billion. The evaluation of the Fund  which concludes its activities this year  will be a key reference both for analysing compliance with the MDGs and for developing the post-2015 development agenda. The preparation of that agenda is the central theme of this session of the General Assembly. For Spain  the post-2015 agenda should be focused on truly sustainable development  should be universal and should acknowledge the importance of transparent institutions in achieving inclusive growth.We must therefore clearly define the sustainable development goals in order to complete the process that began in Rio de Janeiro last year. However  it must not be forgotten that only a little more than two years remain to achieve the MDGs. While we can be pleased with the progress made in many areas  there is still a long way to go. As the Spanish economy starts to grow again  we will significantly support these efforts with generous  intelligent and effective investment in development cooperation. My country’s solidarity can also be seen in terms of humanitarian aid  for which Spain is the world’s eighth largest donor. The United Nations is able to respond to humanitarian crises in West Africa and the Sahel faster and more effectively  thanks to the World Food Programme humanitarian aid storage and distribution centre that we built in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.Spain has always been a crossroads of cultures  religions and traditions. Ours is an open  pluralistic and tolerant country that respects and integrates the diversity that comes with globalization. The protection and promotion of human rights is a responsibility of the institutions to which all citizens must contribute. Spain was the third country in the world to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  and I urge other States to do likewise.We also take a special interest in promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. That is why we joined the Philippines in co-facilitating the outcome document of the High-level Meeting on the Realization of the Millenium Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities (resolution 68/3)  which took place just a few days ago. I am proud to say that in recognition of that commitment  Spain has been awarded the Franklin D. Roosevelt International Disability Rights Award  which Her Majesty Queen Sofia accepted a few days ago in this very city.We will also continue to support the work of UN-Women  as we have since its inception. Equality between women and men  the full participation of women in all areas  and efforts to end violence against women and girls are indispensable for true development and constitute a priority for Spain  both nationally and internationally.Our commitment to multilateralism is inseparable from our desire for a decisive and efficient United Nations. That is why this session of the General Assembly must tackle the issue of Security Council reform  which can be achieved only through the broadest possible consensus founded on the principles of accountability  transparency and cooperation  with a view to enhancing the legitimacy of and support for the Council’s actions.It is also necessary to bring the Organization into line with its means and to rationalize resources so that  together  we may achieve more with less. We therefore give our unconditional support to the progress being made towards system-wide consistency and the “Delivering as one” initiative  to which Spain is the leading contributor. At the same time  the universal character of the United Nations means that we must preserve its multilingualism.In 2005  Spain announced its candidacy to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2015-2016 biennium. My speech today has underlined the main reasons why I believe that Spain has shown  not with mere words but with concrete actions  its readiness to serve the United Nations in the Security Council  with the same commitment to dialogue and solidarity that we have shown since joining the Organization. We have but a single objective: to uphold human dignity. All our efforts in favour of peace  freedom  democracy  justice  human rights and sustainable development are directed towards that goal. Spain knows that its efforts to uphold human dignity will bear greater fruit through the United Nations  just as the General Assembly may be sure that  in this endeavour  it can count on Spain."
"54",2257,"EST",68,2013,"The central theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is sustainable development. With its three main pillars this constitutes a comprehensive agenda  even more comprehensive with all of its prerequisites: conflict prevention  bringing peace and security to war-torn countries and bringing perpetrators to justice through the implementation of international law. Helping the weakest to help themselves  shaping economies that pay focused attention to social-agenda and environmental issues and that effectively use e-technologies  protecting human rights and supporting the rule of law and democracy — these are all integral parts of sustainable development.The report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda notes that Governments bear the primary responsibility for assuring sustainable development and for improving the lives of people in their territories. Sustainability can be truly implemented  however  only if we instil it in the core thinking of Governments  societies  individuals and the international community as a whole.Let me start with what is clearly and without a doubt the most unsustainable situation in the world at the moment: the conflict in Syria. It has been repeated thousands and thousands of times  and must continue to be repeated over and over again  that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable under any circumstances and requires complete and unreserved condemnation. It is clear that chemical weapons must be destroyed quickly and verifiably. Therefore the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security Council must — and I emphasize must — move forward and agree on the legally binding terms to resolve that issue  preferably under Chapter VII of the Charter  as soon as possible.Even without the use of chemical weapons  the military actions and brutality which have occurred in Syria have created suffering and a humanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions. More than 110 000 people have been killed  and millions of refugees and internally displaced persons are scattered around the This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service  room U.506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.region. About 7 million Syrians are in urgent need of assistance.While there is no quick or easy fix to that complex situation  we must keep doing what we can to ease human suffering. Estonia is one of many countries that have been focusing on helping those who have been forced to flee from their homes and protecting the most vulnerable members of society: women and children. I would also like to praise the good work of UNICEF  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and humanitarian workers in Syria who often by risking their own lives  have been able to organize and deliver assistance.Evidence collected by the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry indicates that war crimes  crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations have been systematically committed in Syria. Estonia is among the countries that joined the Swiss initiative in January  asking the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. It is the responsibility of the international community to protect  if a Government fails to do so.In contrast  let me turn to a country and conflict where hope has been restored recently. That presidential elections in Mali were carried out in a peaceful and transparent manner has paved the way for optimism. The newly elected President has many important tasks ahead  beginning with reconciliation between the southern and northern parts of Mali. I wish Mr. Keita all the luck and energy he will need to rebuild his country  and I can assure him that Estonia stands among the countries that will continue to help if needed.I venture to say that another country whose future looks promising is Afghanistan. I believe that responsibility and ownership make people masters of their own fate  and I can see the willingness of Afghans to avail themselves of that opportunity. The international community must continue to assist that country in order to ensure that their efforts will bear fruit. As a long-term partner of Afghanistan  Estonia remains committed to assisting with the training and financing of Afghan security forces after 2014  while continuing to support educational progress  women’s empowerment  the rule of law and health care.It is also sadly true that conflicts can at times be alarmingly sustainable. For years  Estonia has emphasized that protracted conflicts around Nagorno Karabakh and in Georgia and Moldova must not fall off the radar screen of the international community. Without the will of all the involved parties  no lasting solutions can be found.Every year  over half a million people die as a result of illegal or irresponsible arms transfers. Enormous amounts of money and resources are spent on arms  often at the expense of far more vital needs. We view the adoption in June of the Arms Trade Treaty  within the framework of the United Nations  as a historic milestone for the world community.As a responsible member of the international community  Estonia strongly supports and contributes to the activities of the International Criminal Court and the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security Council. We continue to call for more States to ratify the Rome Statute and the amendments to the Rome Statute relating to the crime of aggression. Universality is key to ensuring that the perpetrators of the worst crimes of concern to the international community are held accountable. Accountability and the prevention of atrocities have been the priorities of Estonia as a current member of the Human Rights Council. In the Council  we also focus on the rights of women and children and on their disproportionate suffering during armed conflict.The post-2015 sustainable development agenda should transform the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into Sustainable Development Goals. In the meantime  we have learned that the MDGs should have focused more on reaching the poorest and most-excluded groups in society. The main challenge of the post-2015 negotiations will be to formulate and reach global agreement on one concrete and measurable set of development goals that would keep the three dimensions of sustainability in its core and maintain a strong focus on poverty eradication. The targets should leave no one behind and be applicable and achievable in every country.In many societies  women and girls are the main drivers of development. Not allowing them to fulfil their potential through education  decent job opportunities and essential health services is to disregard the potential of one half of humankind. It is also important to remember that persons with disabilities have been one of the most excluded segments of our societies  although they often have serious difficulties with access to basic social services and decent job opportunities.Official development assistance will continue to play an important role in the sustainable development of many countries in the future  but it cannot compete with the flow of international private investment nor with domestically mobilized resources. Therefore  synergies between different sources of finance  better policies and strong national ownership are necessary. Nonetheless  the main drivers of sustainable development are inclusive and responsible economic policies. A key enabler of growth is the bold use of modern integrated circuit technology solutions. They promote better governance  access to public services  job creation  transparency  accountability and civil society participation.That brings me to two issues of worldwide importance: cybersecurity and Internet freedom. The two are intrinsically linked and in no way incompatible. Moreover  they will require a multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance. Freedom of opinion and expression  online or offline  is a cornerstone of every democracy and constitutes a fundamental human right. Last year  the Human Rights Council affirmed that very same principle. I am glad that the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Cyber Issues affirmed that international law is essential in promoting an open  secure and accessible cyberspace.In our fight against cybercrime  it is essential to raise awareness and to work on prevention by everyone  from private computer users to large critical infrastructure and cloud providers. Raising the awareness of political leaders and national governments is equally important; cybercrime may have serious consequences for national security as well as national wealth. Yet the Council of Europe’s 2001 European Cybercrime Treaty — renamed the Convention on Cybercrime because participants are from all over the world  and also known as the Budapest Convention — remains thus far the only legally binding international instrument that addresses cybercrime. Needless to say  the more countries accede to it  the more functional it will become. We find it odd that those countries with the largest sources of cybercrime have not acceded to the Convention  while in other areas they stress the primacy of international law.The United Nations has had and will continue to have a leading role in making the world sustainable. Yet Governments can do and must do their own fair share. Estonia  for example  proudly continues to support the initiatives of civil society in contributing to sustainable development. Approximately one half of the world’s countries have joined our 2008 initiative “Let’s Do It!” to make people’s environments cleaner and our planet environmentally happier.Let us remain alert and tuned in to every single detail that prevents us from advancing our common well-being  be it in developed or in developing countries. Let us be united in that common effort."
"55",2303,"ETH",68,2013," It is with great pleasure that I congratulate the President on his election to his high office to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  which is being held under the theme: “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. I wish to assure the President of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I would also like to commend his predecessor for the able leadership he demonstrated during the previous session.Let me begin by condemning the terrorist attacks in Kenya that claimed the lives of innocent civilians and left many more injured. I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of Kenya  as well as to the families of the victims of that callous attack. That incident once again demonstrates the need for us to renew our commitment to fight terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations.I am addressing the Assembly today not only on behalf of my country but also as the representative of the African Union (AU)  which Ethiopia has the honour of chairing this year. It is a welcome coincidence that Ethiopia  which played host to the founding Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  50 years ago  has assumed the rotating chairpersonship of that premier continental organization at a time when its golden jubilee is being celebrated. We were very pleased to host the Special Summit of African Heads of State and Government  which marked the OAU/AU jubilee on 25 May  and I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who sent delegations to Addis Ababa to take part in the celebration and conveyed messages of support and solidarity to the African Union. Since the fiftieth anniversary will be a year-long event  we would like to continue to mark the historic milestone during this session of the General Assembly by reflecting on the relations between the United Nations and the then Organization of African Union and today’s African Union over the past half-century.When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in 1945  much of Africa was under the yoke of colonialism. Since then  our continent has been liberated from the remnants of colonialism and other forms of subjugation. Today  it is gratifying to note that African countries constitute one of the largest groups in the General Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation for the invaluable contribution of the United Nations to the decolonization process. However  we should not lose sight of the fact that not all the challenges we faced in that struggle have been definitively settled; nor can we say that the process of decolonization has come to an end in all its forms. We should therefore renew our commitment to completing the decolonization process in Africa.In accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter  the United Nations has indeed worked closely with the African Union and other regional mechanisms to advance its primary objectives. Over the past five decades and more  cooperation and partnership between the OAU/AU and the United Nations have significantly expanded and deepened in a wide range of aspects and fields. We acknowledge with deep respect the meaningful cooperation that the United Nations has provided to the then OAU and now to the African Union in addressing our continent’s multifaceted challenges. Despite that fact  we are also cognizant of the fact that a lot remains to be done to further enhance the cooperation and partnership between the African Union and the United Nations in the context of the changing dynamics within Africa and in the world at large. I earnestly hope that this historic occasion will afford us a unique opportunity to reflect seriously on our challenges and shortcomings with a view to strengthening our cooperation and partnership so as to better respond to the changing environment. I believe we should adopt a flexible and innovative approach in implementing Chapter VIII of the Charter in order to enhance our partnership and address our common challenges.We are celebrating the OAU/AU’s golden jubilee at a time when the stereotypical narrative of Africa as a continent afflicted by poverty  disease and conflict has slowly begun to change. In spite of so many persistent difficulties  Africa has indeed turned the corner in reducing the number of conflicts plaguing the continent and in promoting democratic governance  as well as in fighting poverty through accelerated economic growth and development. With its enhanced peace and stability  rapid economic growth  natural resources and growing middle class  Africa is definitely on the rise  and that is attracting much attention from the rest of the world. The twenty-first century will be an African one if we do indeed harmonize our efforts to maintain — in fact  speed up — the rapid economic growth that Africa has been registering for the last decade or so. We have every reason to be optimistic that an African renaissance is around the corner. That positive development is unquestionably encouraging  but we recognize that we can achieve our aspirations for a peaceful  prosperous and integrated Africa only by bringing about structural transformation. That is why we are capitalizing on the golden jubilee celebration to chart a transformation agenda for Africa to be implemented over the next 50 years. At our most recent session  in May  we also adopted our AU Commission’s strategic plan for the period 2014-2017  whose main objective is to lay a solid foundation for the realization of our vision in the short and medium term.It is indeed opportune that we are crafting our transformation agenda when intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 global development framework have begun in earnest. I am glad that the Assembly will debate that issue at this session  and I commend the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  co-chaired by the Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  for presenting their comprehensive report  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  to the Secretary-General. I hope that the report will provide valuable input for our discussions of the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” during this session.Africa considers this issue to be of paramount importance and has formed a high-level committee of Heads of State and Government to develop a common position and galvanize international support in order to ensure that the successes achieved thus far in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals are sustained and its development priorities beyond 2015 are fully taken on board. As the able Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) has aptly put it  what Africa needs is structural transformation  not structural adjustment. The development agenda we are trying to set for Africa over the next 50 years is also aimed at achieving that fundamental objective  with a view to eradicating poverty and ensuring sustainable development. With respect to the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  we intend to come up with a well-thought-out African position as an outcome of the initiative of our troika: the African Union Commission  UNECA and the African Development Bank.In that context  we want to achieve a green revolution in Africa and ensure food security for our peoples. The theme of the African Union in 2014 will be “Agriculture and food security” and will promote the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme  which will allow us to reinforce our commitment to the transformation of the agricultural sector in Africa.We are also convinced of the need for Africa to industrialize in order to accelerate its economic growth  generate employment  increase income and diversify exports. That can be done on the basis of our factor endowments and taking into account the need for us to increase added value and exploit forward and backward linkages. It cannot be emphasized enough that overcoming poverty is impossible without structural transformation and value addition  which makes industrialization not an option but a must — an unavoidable necessity for Africa. Let me state here how grateful we are to all those who have made partnerships available to us to ensure that Africa develops the capacity for modern and affordable energy  without which industrialization would be impossible to achieve.Furthermore  we would like to invest in infrastructure  which has been neglected over past decades  in order to promote intra-African trade and fast-track regional integration. We are also committed to redoubling our efforts to improve the overall well-being of our society. In particular  we believe that Africa should reap the benefits of its demographic dividend by investing in its people. Educating our youth and upgrading their skills is critical to the effective use of our human capital. Therefore we very much hope that the post-2015 global development framework will be aligned to our development priorities and needs.We in Africa certainly recognize that we cannot realize our development aspirations in the absence of durable peace and security. That is why we have concentrated tremendous efforts in addressing the scourge of conflicts on our continent. We are indeed very pleased to note the drastic decline in the number of conflicts in Africa during the last decade  with the exception of a few situations. But we also understand that there is a new security dynamic on our continent  with the rise of popular dissatisfaction associated with demands yet unmet.In that regard  the African Union has been exerting efforts to assist Egypt — a member State whose contribution to the decolonization process on our continent and to African unity has been second to none — to overcome its current difficulties in the spirit of African solidarity. The African Union is also extending all the necessary support to Tunisia in order to ensure a successful political transition through the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of elections.On the other hand  we welcome the successful conduct of elections in Mali that paved the way for the restoration of constitutional order in that country. The African Union is indeed firmly committed to continue assisting Mali in its efforts to ensure lasting peace  security and development. We derive satisfaction from the significant progress made in Somalia towards peace in the country  and we are also encouraged by the agreement reached between the Federal Republic of Somalia and the Juba Interim Administration  which constitutes a significant milestone in promoting peace and national reconciliation. The New Deal announced at the Somalia Conference in Brussels on 16 September will certainly strengthen the momentum for the reconstruction of the country and building peace there.The security and humanitarian situation in Central African Republic is still a matter of serious concern. I wish to reiterate our call to the United Nations to provide multifaceted support to the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic  which will be deployed in that country to protect civilians and restore security and public order. On the other hand  the escalation of tension in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo also poses threats to the peace and security of the Great Lakes region and the continent as a whole. The only durable solution is for both the Government and the armed opposition to conclude their peace talks under the auspices of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). In that connection  I would like to welcome the outcome of the ICGLR Extraordinary Summit held in Kampala on 5 September 2013 and High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held in New York on 23 September in New York under the auspices of the President of the Assembly.With regard to relations between the Sudan and South Sudan  the African Union  in close collaboration with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  has established an ad hoc investigation mechanism to verify allegations made by the two countries regarding each country’s support for and harbouring of dissident elements that act against the other. The team is carrying out its work  and I am hopeful that the outcome of the investigation will help the two countries to move forward in the implementation of the agreements they have signed and in the normalization of their relations. On a more practical level  the summits and the regular engagement that the leaders of the two countries are having will go a long way in breaking the impasse and resolving some of the difficult outstanding issues.I would like to raise one important issue that has been a matter of serious concern for us in our efforts to promote peace  security and national reconciliation on the continent and regarding which there is a strong consensus in Africa. Time and again  we in Africa have affirmed our unflinching commitment to fighting impunity and promoting democracy  rule of law and good governance throughout the continent  in conformity with the Constitutive Act of the African Union. That commitment has been empirically validated by bold actions taken recently by the African Union.When it comes to the International Criminal Court (ICC)  many of our member States ratified the Rome Statute faithfully  subscribing to its cardinal objectives and principles. Unfortunately  the manner in which the ICC has been operating has left a very bad impression in Africa. Instead of promoting justice and reconciliation and contributing to peace and stability  it has degenerated into a political instrument targeting Africa and Africans. This is totally unacceptable  and that is why Africa has been expressing its serious reservations against the body.It is regrettable that our repeated request to the United Nations Security Council to defer the proceedings initiated against President A1-Bashir has been neither heard nor acted upon. We have also received no response to our request for a deferral of the ICC investigations and prosecutions in relation to the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya  in line with the principle of complementarity  to allow for a national mechanism to investigate and prosecute the cases under a reformed judiciary provided for in the new constitutional dispensation.In light of the encouraging developments in Kenya with the adoption of the new Constitution  the reform of the judiciary and the holding of successful legislative and presidential elections  we believe it is very critical to support the peacebuilding and national reconciliation processes in the country. The recent decision of the ICC in relation to the Kenyan situation is unhelpful and adversely affects the ability of the Kenyan leaders in the discharge of their constitutional responsibilities. Therefore I would like to take this opportunity to once again urge the Security Council to respond to our requests.In an increasingly globalized and multipolar world  Africa obviously needs to forge multiple partnerships to realize its development aspirations and assume its rightful place in the international arena. It gives me great satisfaction to note that Africa’s strategic partnership with both developed and emerging economies has expanded and deepened in recent years. That is the path we wish to pursue. Africa needs the solidarity of all sections of the international community  and it is our hope that all the necessary support will be extended to Africa in the spirit of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which underlined so emphatically the special situation of Africa. That  in our view  should be the spirit with which the deficit in the implementation of Millennium Development Goal 8 must be treated during the very short time remaining.In conclusion I wish to underline Africa’s enduring commitment to this indispensable global body — a universal organization whose viability is an existential necessity. It is in that spirit that Africa will continue to nurture its close cooperation with the United Nations."
"56",2349,"FIN",68,2013,"We have convened here in New York at a time that poses enormous challenges to the authority and credibility of the United Nations. First  we are at a crossroads where we have to decide the future course to attain sustainable development. Speaking for Finland at the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  I stressed that  faced with advancing climate change and the accelerating loss of biodiversity  we might  at best  have only a few decades in which to reach ecologically  socially and economically sustainable development. Decisive action based on a sense of urgency is needed to turn the tide globally before it is too late. Either we succeed in that together or we are going to perish together.This week  we have taken stock of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. They have been a powerful tool to direct our action. In the near future  we are expected to agree on a new development agenda  a new set of goals that  in my view  could be called sustainable development goals. A green economy is not a luxury  but a prerequisite  for poverty reduction and sustainability. In short  the new agenda must be even bolder and more ambitious than the previous one. Its implementation will require action in all countries.Secondly  we are facing a failure of the United Nations to act in its core domain  that is  in maintaining peace and security. One hundred and ten thousand people have been killed and 2 million people have been forced to leave their homes in Syria  where a tragic civil war has been going on for more than two years. The United Nations has been unable to act to end that appalling bloodshed. That is another of the major challenges for the credibility of the United Nations. Let me elaborate on those challenges. With more than a threefold increase in the world’s population since the founding of the United Nations and with unprecedented technological progress and the ever-increasing exploitation of natural resources  the world has changed irrevocably. We must now arrange our existence with our natural environment in a new way. As the Secretary-General has said  sustainable development is the pathway to the future. Ecological sustainability — respecting the planetary boundaries — is the foundation for all development. The alarming trend in climate change underlines the urgent need to heed those limits. We must work together towards a comprehensive climate agreement by 2015. The consequences of climate change are already to be seen worldwide. The impacts are predicted to intensify in the coming years and decades. For instance  billions of people lack access to safe water sources and sanitation. Without radical reforms  that number is expected to rise dramatically. There is also significant potential for conflicts over water and other natural resources in the coming years.Considerable progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty. Millions of people have had a chance to lift themselves out of poverty. However  inequality still persists  and in many cases is increasing both within countries and between them. In several countries not a single Millennium Development Goal will be attained. More than 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty  and they are falling behind. Poverty can be eradicated only within the context of sustainable development. Development must be ecologically  economically and socially sustainable. It must be firmly anchored in human rights and the values encapsulated in the Millennium Declaration. Peace and security are a precondition for sustainable development. The post-2015 process must also include a financing strategy for sustainable development. We are honoured  together with Nigeria  to be co-chairing the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  mandated by the Rio+20 Summit. We will work hard to achieve a strategy proposal that is action-oriented and inclusive and covers a broad range of different aspects of development financing.I am convinced that sustainable development financing must be based on national resource mobilization and management. Nations should mobilize their own resources through inclusive economic action and through responsible international trade and investments. Developing national taxation systems and tax-revenue collection  as well as addressing unregulated capital flight and putting an end to illegal tax evasion and tax havens  should be central elements in sustainable development financing. Our own national experience shows that taxation is an effective means of addressing inequality.Direct foreign investment can be a driver for growth and development. Investment should be sustainable  accountable and adhere to norms of corporate social responsibility in creating economic and social development. The current proliferation of bilateral investment agreements  already numbering in the thousands  is not the best way to manage investment flows or set the rules they should follow. As part of our efforts to promote sustainable and fair financial governance  Finland supports efforts to create an international investment regime that is transparent  balanced and equitable.The sustainable development goals must be universal  and they must integrate different dimensions of development. Fears that sustainable development would challenge the traditional development agenda are unfounded. These agendas are not competing  but complement each other. We must do our utmost to agree on a new way to sustainable development in the very near future. Our planet and its citizens cannot wait. We  the States Members of the United Nations  are shouldering a great responsibility in that respect. We must be able to deliver as the United Nations.We also have more traditional security challenges at hand. The conflict in Syria has seriously undermined the authority and credibility of the United Nations. The United Nations has not been able to act in its core domain in maintaining peace and security. Both the Syrian Government and the international community have failed to implement their responsibility to protect.The situation in Syria started as a peaceful and justified call for reforms. The Government’s response then turned it into an increasingly violent conflict and a breeding ground for terrorist extremism. That has led to humanitarian suffering  which has already reached historic proportions. The use of chemical weapons on 21 August near Damascus can be a turning point in the conflict: the universal condemnation of their use as a war crime for which those responsible must be brought to justice through referral to the International Criminal Court. Finland welcomes the agreement reached on a strongly worded Security Council resolution to collect and destroy chemical weapons in Syria under international control. There can be no impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities. The agreement has to be followed through with a political solution to the conflict. That is the only way to stop the violence. That means negotiations. The international community  the parties to the conflict and especially the Security Council must take responsibility for working towards political negotiations. We continue to support the initiative of the United States and Russia of proposing the “Geneva II” conference  as well as the mediation by the United Nations and Arab League Joint Special Representative  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. All permanent members of the Security Council must shoulder their responsibility.The humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people continues. We all must intensify our work to help the refugees and support the neighbouring countries bearing the heaviest burdens. The United Nations will also need to have a strong presence in Syria after the arms have fallen silent. Finland stands ready to contribute to a possible United Nations peacekeeping operation to be established in Syria.The resumption of direct final status negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis is long-awaited and most welcome news. Since the Oslo agreement 20 years ago  it has been clear that the best outcome for all the parties is a two-State solution  which can accomplish a reign of peace and security for the two peoples. We may still have at hand perhaps the last chance for such a resolution of the conflict. When I say “perhaps the last chance”  it is not because I think there may be more chances later  but rather it is because  at worst  the last chance may already have been missed. But it is our duty to make the effort to achieve a negotiated two-State solution.Finland commends Secretary Kerry’s dedication and the personal commitment demonstrated by the parties. The entire international community must lend all its support for the negotiations to succeed. That must be concrete and effective support. The role of regional partners is crucial  and I welcome the efforts made by the League of Arab States in reviewing the Arab Peace Initiative.The situations in both Syria and the Middle East and between Israel and the Palestinians have been the subject of important mediation efforts. I call for stronger political will and determination to resolve those conflicts. The parties must work harder and the Security Council  especially its permanent members  must shoulder their responsibility. While those efforts have yet to meet with success  I believe that we also have ample evidence to show that mediation works. Measures under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations deserve more attention  although sometimes action under Chapter VII is also needed. Finland and Turkey continue to co-Chair the Group of Friends of Mediation and to work to strengthen preventive diplomacy  including mediation in the United Nations.Mediation can succeed only with political will from the parties and the international community. Successful mediation also calls for the full and equal participation of women at all stages. Women are certainly most often the victims of conflicts  but we should also understand that they are essential participants for any mediation efforts to bear long-lasting success.Efforts to promote peace and security in the Middle East should go in parallel with the pursuit of the long-time goal of the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in that region. I encourage all regional parties to continue to engage constructively with the facilitator and the four conveners  as well as with one another  to pave the way for a conference on the establishment of such a zone.All our failures and disappointments notwithstanding  there has also been one true success story for the United Nations this year. I am referring to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)  which was adopted in April after decades of effort. It was a success not only for the United Nations system but for the whole international community and the arms control regime. The importance of the Treaty has been confirmed by the growing number of signatories after 3 June  when the ATT was opened for signature. We hope and expect that the signing of the ATT by the United States will be followed by the signing of all other permanent members of the Security Council as well. I should also like to congratulate those countries that have already ratified the Treaty  thereby paving the way for its early entry into force. My own country  Finland  is well on its way to ratifying the ATT as soon as possible.Only when the Treaty enters into force and is implemented will it make a real difference in saving lives  minimizing human suffering and lessening criminality and threats to civilian populations by providing the highest common standards for the trade in arms  ammunition and components. Once again  I should like to thank and congratulate the non-governmental organization community for its dedication and tireless efforts in favour of the ATT. They never lost their faith and pushed Governments hard to achieve that result. But our work is not yet done. Together we must continue to secure the 50 ratifications needed and ensure more to support for the ATT. We must also persuade those countries that abstained in the voting to support a regulated arms trade and the Treaty so as to make it universal.Finland  as one of the seven co-authors  has from the beginning been and will in future be very much involved with the Arms Trade Treaty. This week  the co-authors organized a high-level event to promote the signing of the Treaty. We are also prepared to assist countries that have difficulties in ratifying and implementing the Treaty. When implemented  the Treaty should also have a major impact on development  particularly in the least developed countries  where conflicts are a major obstacle to development.The success or failure of the United Nations ultimately depends upon us  the Member States. There is no alternative to the United Nations. Let us give it a chance. That is what our peoples expect from us."
"57",2393,"FJI",68,2013,"At the outset  I wish to congratulate President Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and express my confidence that under his able and wise guidance  the Assembly will successfully accomplish its many tasks. I would also like to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of last year’s President  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  and extend my appreciation for the effectiveness with which he directed the work of the Assembly at the previous session.Fiji reached a pivotal moment in its history earlier this month  when His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji promulgated the nation’s new Constitution. This Constitution introduces the first genuine democracy that Fiji will enjoy since we gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. Forty-three years and three Constitutions later  we finally have a Constitution that is worthy of the Fijian people. It is a Constitution that meets the test of a genuine democracy  that upholds the legal and moral basis of a common and equal citizenry without denying anyone’s individuality or culture. The 2013 Fijian Constitution enshrines principles that are at the heart of all the world’s great liberal democracies: an independent judiciary  a secular State and a wide range of civil  political and socioeconomic rights. It recognizes the indigenous peoples of Fiji and their customary practices  protects the rights of the predominantly indigenous landowners and those of their tenants  demands accountability and transparency from Government officials  builds strong and independent institutions and replaces our old weighted electoral system with one based on the principle of one person  one vote  one value. That historic achievement is the culmination of a path that Fiji embarked on in 2007 to establish a modern and stable society that can be a proud and responsible part of the global community. For years we struggled to be a nation under a system that created different classes of citizens and in which the votes of some Fijians counted more than others. How could we be one nation when our fundamental law said that we were not one people? The very idea of a just and equal society  of an accountable Government and of loyalty to the nation State was being eroded from within. There were too many elites who thought the best way to entrench their own privileges was to sow the seeds of division and undermine our independent institutions. The removals of the Government in 1987 and 2000 were the most radical expressions of that dysfunction.As a result  tens of thousands of Fijians suffered  and many made the decision to leave their home forever — to leave Fiji. As I have said before  that is one of the most shameful episodes of our history  and I am determined that it must never  ever happen again. We must never allow a fellow citizen to be second class or to be less than an equal of his neighbour. Surely  such a basic principle as that deserves the full support of all nations that would never accept any less for their own people.So we have set out to make a change for the good  a permanent change that would set the nation on a straight course and allow Fiji to finally reach the potential it had when we so enthusiastically embraced our independence. It has been a long journey  and we have faced numerous challenges along the way. But it is with great pleasure and deep honour that I stand here today and say: our national compass has finally been reset. Under the new Constitution  we are heading towards Fiji’s first genuinely democratic elections by September 2014 and a much brighter future as one nation.With every month that passes  we are building the foundations of our new parliamentary democracy. Unlike in the past  we are building a credible and fair system that will guide that process. Four political parties have registered thus far under the new laws  which create transparency and accountability  and close to 540 000 Fijians — out of an estimated 620 000 eligible voters — have registered for the 2014 election.Many modern  stable democracies have gone through their own turbulent periods. Some have gone through decades of instability and bloodshed  while others have had a single defining moment. Those events changed the course of history. They turned their countries from bastions of elitism and oppression into nations of freedom  equality and true democracy. The United States has its Bunker Hill and Civil War. France has the storming of the Bastille and the French revolution. Australia has the Eureka Stockade  and Britain has had a bloody history as it struggled to establish a constitutional monarchy. We Fijians have also had our share of turbulence.Regrettably and to our great disappointment  some of our oldest friends had no faith in us. They abandoned us and sought to punish us with sanctions. We sought their assistance and understanding  but they turned their backs on us. They chose to support a form of democracy  governance and justice in Fiji that they would never have accepted for themselves. We hope that they see now that we were true to our word. All nations struggle over time to overcome their unique challenges  to correct historic sins and to be worthy of the principles on which they were founded. We in Fiji are no different. Our isolation led us to seek out new relationships  which have proven fruitful. Now  our standing in the world has never been stronger. A key principle that has guided Fiji’s political development and foreign policy and is soundly grounded in the Charter of the United Nations is that we determine our own destinies as sovereign States. At the same time  we recognize the necessity of collaborating with all Member States of the United Nations with the aim of supporting sustainable world peace  substantive justice  dignity and respect for all. It is that spirit of collaboration that has inspired us to go beyond parochial interests and reach out to help others. That spirit enjoins us to be loyal to common ideals  goals  values and principles. They remain our guiding beacons as we navigate our way in this millennium.The theme set by the President to guide the general debate at this sixty-eighth session  which is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage ” is most fitting for the juncture at which the United Nations stands. In the midst of increasing poverty and underdevelopment and during an era of unprecedented wealth accumulation and technological advances  the rift that divides the rich and the poor zones of the world ever widens. We must therefore not lose focus on one imperative of our time: equality among nations  big and small  is central to the relevance  credibility and even survival of this global Organization.In that regard  we are encouraged by the progress made thus far in the General Assembly towards expeditiously launching the follow-up mechanisms agreed at the Rio+20 Conference in 2012. Throughout the course of this year  the Group of 77 and China has emphasized that the road map towards a post-2015 development agenda needs to address the implementation gaps of the Millennium Development Goals  with poverty eradication remaining an overarching goal. The new development agenda must be universal  applicable and relevant to all Member States. Let me also stress that the new development agenda should be centred on economic development that supports both social inclusion and environmental sustainability.Our common desire for a transformative global development agenda beyond 2015 can best be achieved through collective efforts and an enhanced global partnership. Such efforts must place the development and well-being of people at its core. If the international community and national Governments seriously commit to an agenda for meaningful transformation at the structural  institutional and normative levels  the post-2015 development agenda has the potential of achieving a paradigm shift in global conditions.Fiji’s commitment to being a good global citizen is manifested through our ongoing engagement with the United Nations and its associated agencies and secretariats. Our decision to take on the mantle of chairing the Group of 77 and China for the year 2013 was informed by the fact that Fiji embraces its rights as an equal Member of the United Nations and that we must therefore also carry all the due responsibilities expected of us within this great family of nations.Fiji’s commitment to United Nations peacekeeping remains unwavering. It is a source of great pride that  for a nation of our size  we are able to make a meaningful and significant contribution. For the past three decades  we have always responded to the call of the United Nations to serve  including in the most difficult circumstances around the world. While we fully recognize the risks involved  Fiji’s confidence in its peacekeepers prompted us to provide troops to the Golan Heights this year to assist the United Nations in a time of need. The many years of service of Fijian troops in the Middle East region  particularly in Lebanon  Iraq and Sinai  are an asset that our troops take with them to that mission. Fiji also sees police peacekeeping and contributions in the corrections and justice sector as important in building local State institutions that can be run by local authorities once peacekeeping missions end  and we are building on our many existing commitments in that regard in Liberia  Darfur and South Sudan.It is up to us in the General Assembly to ensure that all support possible is given to troop- and police-contributing countries serving on the ground  including through clear and appropriate policy guidance. For the good of the countries concerned  we must not abdicate that responsibility. I urge us all to work together in the United Nations to provide such concrete policy guidance  particularly as we see peacekeeping missions evolve into multidimensional and complex missions that differ greatly from early United Nations peacekeeping missions.As a Pacific island nation  Fiji reaffirms its support for the efforts of small island developing States (SIDS) to achieve sustainable development. Not only are SIDS acutely vulnerable to the effects of climate change  such as sea-level rise  ocean acidification and the increased frequency of extreme weather events  but for some of us the threat is to our very existence. Our response to the plight of those most at risk must therefore be characterized by a requisite sense of urgency.The convening of the third International Conference for Sustainable Development of SIDS in 2014 will be critical to addressing  in a very specific and concrete manner  the many challenges faced by SIDS. It is an opportunity for the international community to renew its commitment to the implementation of the decisions and agreements pertaining to SIDS. As the international community discusses the post-2015 development landscape  including a successor to the Hyogo Framework for Action  we must ensure that a new model accounts for and addresses the risks we face. This is particularly relevant for SIDS  where hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses occur as a result of so-called natural disasters every year. Protecting development gains and investing in disaster resilience is vital to sustainable development.The United Nations efforts to eradicate colonialism must forge ahead within the context of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee  of which Fiji is a member. Through the Pacific regional body known as the Melanesian Spearhead Group  Fiji works together with other members of the Fourth Committee to accelerate the process of decolonization.In reforming and developing its information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure  Fiji has adopted a comprehensive approach by combining a national framework for ICT development with effective and pragmatic policies and initiatives to deliver results directly to the Fijian people. That approach is bearing fruit. Fiji has achieved 95 per cebt mobile coverage  including 3G; concluded one of the region’s first open auctions for the 4G spectrum; and is implementing a number of innovative initiatives to increase affordable access and improve services  including in the most remote parts of our country.The International Telecommunication Union  in its annual review of more than 150 countries’ delivery of ICT infrastructure and services to their populations  gave special recognition to Fiji as a developing country. Fiji tied for the third largest improvement of any country and is ranked fourth globally in percentage terms  having improved by 14 per cent.As the first country to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Fiji has kept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. While some disconnect exists between what is contained in international instruments and what is or is not implemented  we need a commitment to clear steps to turn words into actions in order to facilitate the sustainable management of ocean resources and make equitable the share of benefits from their utilization.Fiji hosted the inaugural Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF) last month. Its formation makes the PIDF the only South-South organization in the Pacific region that provides for a multi-stakeholder platform where Governments  the private sector and civil society can discuss what we Pacific Islanders need to do to achieve sustainable development.We look forward to a productive sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Let me reiterate our full support and cooperation with President Ashe and all members with a view to advancing the objectives of the United Nations and the aspirations of the global community."
"58",2440,"FRA",68,2013,"It is an honour for the United Nations to act everywhere where the freedom of peoples is denied. It is an honour for the United Nations to act where fundamental rights are compromised. It is an honour for the United Nations to intervene where extremism threatens the security of the world. It is an honour for the United Nations to act on behalf of peace.In Syria  the situation is becoming urgent because 120 000 people have died over the past two and a half years — 90 000 in the past year alone. One-fourth of the population is displaced. Millions of Syrians have become refugees and the country has been destroyed. The worst happened on 21 August in Damascus  when chemical weapons were used against civilians  including women and children. United Nations inspectors  sent officially on behalf of the Organization have  established unequivocally and with certainty the use of these weapons. In the face of this horrifying crime  France sought a strong reaction to punish this violation of international law and to dissuade Bashir Al-Assad’s regime from committing new massacres. This pressure exerted by my country  along with others  in particular the United States  has seen some initial results. Negotiations are under way as we speak to ensure the verification and destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. However  if these negotiations are to attain their ultimate end  I have set out three requirements. The first is that any text must clearly make it possible for the Security Council to become seized of this issue of chemical weapons at any given moment. The second requirement is that the draft resolution we are preparing provides for coercive measures under Chapter VII in the event that the Syrian regime fails to respect its commitments. Since the agreement signed between the United States and Russia has the same provision  that is all the more reason to include it in the draft resolution. The third requirement is that those who have committed these crimes must be held accountable before justice. But we cannot limit ourselves to this draft resolution  which must be adopted soon. We must end this war  the deadliest since the beginning of the century. The solution is political. Too much time has been squandered  and I will not refer again to the blocking of action in the Security Council. During this period  not only has the regime increased its violence  but terrorist groups have also taken advantage of the international community’s inertia  to the detriment of the democratic forces found within the Syrian National Coalition. This is why the “Geneva II” conference must be held as soon as possible. For France  however  Geneva II is not just a talk shop. It must be a conference to define the objective for putting in place a transitional Government with full executive powers  mandated to re-establish civil peace  to protect all communities and to organize elections in due time. I am sometimes asked about participants in this conference. My response is simple. All countries — and I repeat  all countries — that accept the goal of installing a transitional Government and clearly acknowledge their commitment to a political solution will be welcome at the conference. Of equal urgency is the humanitarian situation. In Syria  the displaced are in the millions  and there are now more than 1.5 million refugees in Turkey  Jordan and Lebanon. The prolongation of the crisis poses a direct threat to the unity and security of Lebanon  nearly 20 per cent of whose population is now of Syrian origin. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having organized the first meeting of the International Support Group for Lebanon. France is committed to that country because we know how much it has suffered in recent years from disturbances in the Middle East and how much it needs to be supported today in its efforts to host refugees.There are serious concerns in that part of the Middle East  but there are also glimmers of hope. The first is the resumption of negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Only that will enable peace to be achieved. It requires the coexistence of two States  both with safe and recognized borders. We must do everything to ensure that the opportunity that now exists for Israelis  Palestinians and the entire region is seized to finally bring an end to a conflict that whose regional and international repercussions are well known to us all. Negotiating peace between Israel and Palestine would be an historic act.The second glimmer of hope is found in the statements of the new Iranian President  which reflect an evolution. I will not exaggerate them  but the question now is to know whether those words will be translated into actions  in particular concerning the nuclear issue. For the past 10 years  our discussions have not progressed  leading the the international community to adopt increasingly severe sanctions. The situation is dangerous  as we all know. Therefore  France expects from Iran concrete gestures reflecting that country’s renunciation its military nuclear programme  although it clearly retains the right to pursue its civilian programme. That is why I have chosen to engage in direct and open dialogue with President Rouhani. I will also say from this rostrum that while I am in favour of dialogue  I remain firm on the serious issue of nuclear proliferation.The Middle East is not the only region of the world that is of concern to us. Africa has fallen prey to terrorism  and the barbaric attack in Nairobi confirms that to us once again  tragically. Victories are possible against terrorism. In Mali  with the clear mandate of the Security Council  African and French forces  with the support of Europe  intervened in response to the appeal of the authorities in Bamako and brought an end to a broad terrorist offensive. Today we see the results. Mali has regained its territorial integrity. It has ensured the security of its population  and it has even been able to hold  on the scheduled date  a presidential election that has been recognized as incontestable. I welcome the new President of Mali  Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar .eita. His election is evidence of a great victory for West Africa against terrorism.However  the threat continues to weigh heavily on the Sahel and in Libya  where weapons are uniquitous and where terrorist groups have found refuge. We must assist the Libyan authorities to ensure the security of their territory and of their population. France is prepared to do so.I would like to sound an alarm  as I did last year with respect to Mali. The warning here is about the Central African Republic — a small country that has been ravaged by coups and conflicts for years. Today  chaos has taken root and civilians are yet again its victims. We must bring an end to the abuse  which is also sectarian in nature. That is why I would like the Security Council to issue a mandate and provide the logistical and financial means to create an African force  with its first mission to re-establish stability in the Central African Republic.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  women and children are victims of violence every day in the Kivu region. Again  it is essential that we continue to strengthen the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  to implement the Addis Ababa agreement  and to reject all external interference.We must learn from the experience of recent years. Everywhere chaos reigns  terrorism takes root and grows. That is the case in Somalia  and the horrific attack against Kenya reminds us that Al-Shaabab-affiliated groups  while they have been defeated  have not yet been eradicated. That is why the international community must help African States to protect themselves.France will convene  late this year  a meeting on peace and security in Africa. France has invited all African countries; Europe will be represented  as will the United Nations. The purpose of the meeting is to enable the establishment  training and equipping of African armies to ensure the security of the continent and combat all traffickers  particularly drug traffickers  and piracy. Africans themselves must ensure their security  but we cannot leave them to face the terrorist threat alone. The best weapons we have are our development policies  because poverty  unemployment and inequality provide fertile soil for violence and insecurity. Again  France calls for the mobilization of the international community through new funds that we must create to finance the necessary infrastructures and to enable access to essential public services.France is fighting  along with Europe  for the introduction of innovative financing. My country’s tax on airline tickets  which helps finance the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID)  has brought in more than €1 billion since 2006. My country has decided to increase that tax by a further 10 per cent to enhance our fight against the great pandemics: HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. With Europe  France has also established a tax on financial transactions. I have decided to allocate 10 per cent of that income towards such development-related actions as access to water and renewable energy  because with development assistance we can help the poorest countries to ensure their future  and thereby their security  and to respond to global warming  which concerns us all.France is available to host the 2015 climate conference. This matter  too  respresents a threat to our own security  because one report after another states that if we do nothing  by the end of this century the temperature of the planet will have increased by three or four degrees Centigrade  with the well-known consequences of flooding in some places  droughts in others. Those direct threats would in turn endanger peace throughout the world. We must therefore seek an agreement at the 2015 climate conference.The foundations of the commitment are well known. The agreement must be equitable. Each country must do its part. The developed countries obviously must make he greatest effort. Emerging countries must protect their development  but they must also understand that they are directly threatened by global warming. The least developed countries  those that are the most fragile and vulnerable  must be aided in the transition. That is the purpose of the fund that was created in Durbin. The agreement must also be binding; it cannot simply be a reiteration of principles. It cannot simply be wording in resolutions that are not translated into concrete actions. If there is no assessment and there are no sanctions  there will be no progress and global temperature will inexorably rise.My message is simple. In any domain  whether international security  nuclear proliferation  development or climate change  the worst threat is inaction  the worst decision is to take no decision  and the worst danger is to not see any. And the United Nations bears the responsibility to act. Each time the Organization appears powerless  peace is the first victim. That is why I am proposing that the permanent members of the Security Council define a code of conduct such that in cases of mass crimes  they may collectively decide to renounce the right of veto.It is also my hope to see the Secretary-General’s powers of inquiry strengthened to enable the United Nations to ensure — as it has done in Syria — that the truth is established in all instances  carry out investigations and act on the results. The Assembly has the sovereign right to take such a decision. Our credibility depends upon our capacity to intervene quickly and effectively in ensuring respect for international law  punishing violations and promoting development to preserve future generations. Our legitimacy flows from the Charter of the United Nations. We must be worthy of it. Within that framework  France will always assume its responsibilities in all domains."
"59",2465,"FSM",68,2013,"I am pleased to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I thank our outgoing President for his excellent leadership. Allow me also to extend my respect and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring commitment to the mission and ideals of the United Nations.Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  the international community has supported the principle that the best form of development is one that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Since that time  however  production and consumption patterns have become increasingly unsustainable  driven primarily by a desire to develop economies at any cost. The Federated States of Micronesia has therefore proposed the following approach to global development beyond 2015. First  any post-2015 development agenda must move beyond addressing basic human needs and focus on sustainable development. Secondly  in order to ensure that sustainable development is carried out in a dynamic and inclusive manner  the post-2015 development agenda must honour the environmental  economic and social pillars that make up sustainable development. Finally  international cooperation and assistance are crucial to fostering sustainable development globally. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have posed significant challenges. We continue to look to the international community for assistance to overcome those challenges as we develop the sustainable development goals.As this body considers a post-2015 development agenda  let us not forget one important point: development and the environment are inseparable. No country can develop its economy without degrading its natural environment to some significant degree. While society strives for economic progress  the natural environment that sustained our ancestors through thousands of years has come under attack.Climate change is  without question  the gravest threat to my people’s welfare  livelihood and general security. It is the survival issue of our time. Our sustainable development is threatened by the harmful effects of excessive greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere  the effects of which poison our root crops  destroy our reef systems and drive many of our people from their ancestral homes. All of us  developed and developing countries alike  have a stake in finding ways that minimize man-made damage to Mother Earth.Only the international community can effectively take up that cause. To that end  the comprehensive climate change treaty planned for adoption in 2015 must impose legally binding commitments. These commitments must reflect a level of ambition far higher than under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Pre-2020 mitigation action must also be ambitious enough to close the emissions gap.I reiterate the hope that the world will address the dangerous growth of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by phasing down those chemicals under the Montreal Protocol. Micronesia was the first to submit an innovative proposal in this regard. We welcome the newly announced agreement between China and the United States to phase down HFCs. We also welcome similar developments around the globe. Achieving a phase-down of HFCs under the Protocol will build confidence and momentum for significant action on climate change in the future. Another notable contribution is the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leaderhip  under which every Pacific Island Forum leader pledged to strengthen their country’s efforts to fight climate change.As we move towards the post-2015 development agenda  let us not lose sight of the enormous importance of the world’s oceans. We call for the establishment of a sustainable development goal on healthy  productive and resilient oceans. In turn  we should expect a greater share of the benefits from the world’s oceans. Let me stress the central role that the effective management of all fisheries must play in sustainable management. Bycatch and  particularly  discarded bycatch threaten effective fisheries management. This is a serious conservation problem  because valuable living resources are wasted. Moreover  it threatens our food security and nutrition needs.Similarly  we agree that it is essential to include the goal of sustainable energy for all in the sustainable development goals that are under discussion here in New York. The transition to sustainable energy places a huge fiscal burden on our national accounts. I commend Tonga for spearheading the Pacific Regional Data Repository for Sustainable Energy for All.The Federated States of Micronesia looks to the international community for economic cooperation and support. With limited resources  we have undertaken some bold initiatives.First  we operate under a nationwide integrated disaster risk management and climate change policy that mainstreams climate change into our primary governmental and economic decision-making processes. This policy places special emphasis on strengthening the application of traditional knowledge of ancient conservation practices  which are threatened by sea-level rise  ocean acidification and other effects of excess global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally  our legislative branch recently ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. We will soon submit the instrument of ratification.Secondly  we have taken significant steps in conserving our limited land and fragile marine ecosystems through the Micronesia Challenge. We have undertaken this Challenge because our nation is made of many small low-lying atolls. Our people are wise stewards of our land and sea  working with the environment to provide sustenance for us all. As the preamble to our Constitution says  “The seas bring us together  they do not separate us  our islands sustain us  our island nation enlarges us and makes us stronger... Our ancestors who made their homes on these islands displaced no other people. We  who remain  wish no other home than this.” Thirdly  we recently adopted a national policy that aims to ensure a sustainable energy supply and an environmentally sound energy policy. Historically  Micronesia has imported all of its energy in the form of fossil fuels. We have begun to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. There are already a number of renewable energy projects up and running in many parts of my country  thanks to the assistance of our generous development partners. My country has adopted very ambitious targets in this regard.In order to continue implementing our national development policies  we call on the major donor States to honour their official development assistance (ODA) target of seven tenths of a per cent of gross national income by 2015. We look forward to the discussion in the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing. Technical assistance as a component of ODA is also crucial  particularly in the form of appropriate technology transfers and capacity-building initiatives.Sustainable development must be supported by all of its pillars — not just economic and environmental concerns  but also social considerations. Our people are our most valuable assets. Therefore  we are tailoring an approach that is inclusive of all our people  with special attention to the circumstances of our women  youth  the elderly and disabled persons. Their advancement must be mainstreamed into our discussion on a post-2015 development agenda.Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart and kidney diseases continue to be a challenge. We must address them through the sustainable development goals. This is a global crisis  demanding a global solution. If not controlled  it could undermine sustainable development and degrade the quality of life of our people.We welcome the High-level Meeting on Disability and Development (A/68/PV.3) that took place two days ago. I was impressed by the achievements of the speakers and their inspirational leadership in this forum. We support the outcome document (resolution 68/3) of the High-level Meeting.The Federated States of Micronesia places a high priority on the harnessing of advanced information and communication technologies for our socioeconomic development  especially in the areas of distance education  health  and natural disaster early warning. We thank the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for the assistance that they have offered to improve our telecommunications and to enable our country to obtain fibre optics. We also welcome cooperation and support from the International Telecommunication Union and our development partners.Human trafficking continues to be a serious crime  affecting all nations and causing untold human misery and economic harm. My country is striving to protect its population from this scourge. We support the efforts of the United Nations to stop human trafficking  and we hope to implement the United Nations Blue Heart Campaign against Human Trafficking in all forms in Micronesia. The ongoing tragedy caused by human trafficking demands that it be prioritized and addressed by the entire international community.The global development agenda will be shaped by the launching of the sustainable development goals in 2015. Many processes will influence the selection and monitoring of those goals  including the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development  which has now been replaced by the high-level political forum. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of the new forum  which will take on the monitoring of the implementation of sustainable development commitments. These are outlined in the Barbados Program of Action  the Mauritius Strategy and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288).The second event that will shape the sustainable development agenda is the comprehensive climate change treaty  whose adoption is planned for 2015  and for which we support ambitious  binding commitments. Thirdly  preparations for the Third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in September 2014 in Apia  Samoa  are now under way. Micronesia and other small island developing States recognize the international community’s goodwill and renewed willingness to help our countries address our priorities and challenges.Fourthly  I would also like to commend the Secretary-General for his vision and support of the wide range of issues so critical to small island developing States. His advocacy for next year’s high-level summit on climate change and his focus on climate change themes will generate the political momentum for a post-2015 development agenda to guide all stakeholders.We recognize the central role that reliable data plays in government planning and the crucial need for capacity-building  which must keep pace with the changing dynamics of basic governance in the international landscape. The remoteness of our islands  limited national capacities  and the complex requirements of the United Nations make our development efforts even more difficult and expensive. We therefore look to the specialized United Nations agencies for urgent assistance.In closing  let me express my sympathy and solidarity with those people around the world who are facing immediate threats to their survival. I am horrified by the killing of innocents  especially women and children  in Syria and elsewhere. We in our peaceful islands condemn violence. But what can a small island nation in the Pacific do? What can any country  large or small  do? The answer  we believe  can be found only within our Organization. The world in which we live is too interdependent for us to stand aside while generations of internal conflict harden into unending hatred and bloodshed. We are all stakeholders. We must put an end to the senseless killings around the world. I call upon this Organization to employ its collective will to pursue the ideals of our Charter. I know in my heart that the goal is achievable. The future we want is enduring peace and prosperity for our world."
"60",2508,"GAB",68,2013,"I am honoured to take the floor on behalf of Gabon at the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President and I assure you of Gabon’s full support. I also pay tribute to the remarkable work of your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wish to reiterate our confidence in the cross-cutting work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  as well as the important organizational reforms undertaken.I would also like to congratulate Mr. Boubacar Keita of the Republic of Mali and His Excellency Mr. Hassan Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran on their elections in their respective countries. This session has opened in a context marked by the terrorist attack against a shopping centre in Nairobi that killed many innocent people  including children. It was an intolerable act and I express  here in the Hall  my country’s strongest condemnation of the perpetrators. I also express my own and my country’s deepest condolences to the victims’ families and the people of Kenya. Gabon offers its support to the Government of Kenya at this trying time. As a target of terrorism  Africa should receive the international community’s full support and solidarity in its fight against the threat.Poverty fuels extremism throughout the world  and the fight against that scourge must remain at the heart of our policies. Our peoples  especially the youth  demand greater socioeconomic progress from us. I therefore welcome the opportunity at this session to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda and consider the necessary action remaining to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs have provided a global solidarity pact for our countries’ socioeconomic development. I would like to emphasize here that Gabon has achieved noteworthy progress in poverty reduction  food security and education. We have significantly reduced infant and maternal mortality  HIV/AIDS prevalence and malaria mortality. We have strengthened women’s participation in the political and economic life of the country. Despite the efforts made by States  it must be recognized that some of the MDGs will not be achieved as expected  owing mainly to unfulfilled commitments and reduced funding.In that context  Gabon draws two main conclusions: the importance of strengthened governance and the need for further efforts in education and health aimed at more equitable and inclusive growth. As members begin to consider the post-2015 development agenda  I wish to note that Gabon seeks a post-2015 development agenda with a particular focus on Africa’s priorities; it would include the unrealized MDGs among the future sustainable development goals and would take into account specific issues such as energy  access to clean water and sustainable agriculture. My country also seeks an agenda based on predictable funding that combines public and private funding  innovative financing and global partnerships. That agenda should stimulate direct investment and increase our share of international trade. It must promote the transformation of our economies with a view to inclusive and sustainable growth.Such an approach has led me  as the Chairman of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community  to propose to my peers — who have accepted — the creation of a fund of $200 million for the training and employment of young people  entitled “Train My Generation”. Its goal is to enhance the role of youth in our countries’ development efforts. In that spirit  at the fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development  I proposed to my peers that by 2020 Africa should be able to convert its raw materials prior to exportation. Using that approach  Gabon is already processing 40 per cent of its timber locally  thereby doubling employment in that sector.In the context of the post-2015 development agenda  improved assessment and monitoring of countries’ progress will become important. To that end  Gabon has proposed a sustainable development index that will combine the human development index and countries’ ecological footprints.Our quest for sustainable development must also ensure a binding climate treaty. Our best global experts tirelessly draw attention to global warming. The very existence of some States is threatened. It is necessary to state that we remain prisoners of our own interests and climate sceptics. For its part  Gabon has assumed its responsibilities by implementing measures such as our land-use programme and our environmental programme. Can we advance towards a post-Kyoto agreement in 2015 through strong and courageous steps in the interest of future generations? That question should cause greater concern. That is why I fully support the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene a summit on climate change in 2014.In addition to climate  biodiversity is threatened by poaching and the illicit trade in protected species. Elephants and rhinoceros are especially threatened owing to the illegal trade in ivory and horns. That phenomenon has become both an ecologic and an economic challenge; it is a transnational crime that threatens States’ security. Along with the Federal Republic of Germany and other States  we have initiated a debate on that issue. On 26 September  here at the United Nations  an event will take place on the sidelines to mobilize support on the issue. We would be honoured by the presence and participation of members of the Assembly in the discussions. I also call on the United Nations to integrate that issue into its cooperation efforts with the African Union. In May in Marrakech  Morocco  in the presence of the African Development Bank  I proposed the creation of a trust fund aimed at strengthening capacity-building in Africa and other efforts. Clearly  sustainable development must be based on good governance  equality  access to justice and the protection of human rights and democracy. In Gabon we are striving  with all national stakeholders  to strengthen those areas. We are collecting biometrical data in order to enhance election transparency  thus strengthening democracy. Furthermore  our election to the current Human Rights Council is in line with our commitments  particularly in terms of promoting and protecting the rights of women and children. During this twentieth anniversary year of the Vienna Declaration  Gabon will promote economic  social and cultural rights and seek to combat racism  hatred and violence throughout the world. It is on the basis of those commitments that Gabon will present itself as a candidate for the presidency of the Human Rights Council in 2014.Africa is more hopeful for its future  but if that hope is to be realized throughout the continent Africa must be able to resolve crises preventing its development. Allow me to list some crisis situations. First of all  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Gabon is still concerned by fighting in the eastern part of the country  where women and children are paying a high price. We welcome the increased efforts on the part of the United Nations to implement Security Council resolution 2098 (2013) and the commitments made by the parties to the Framework Agreement signed in Addis Ababa. All countries in the Great Lakes region must support efforts by the United Nations. We would also encourage the efforts on the part of the Government to ensure that elections are held soon.Gabon supports the transition in the Central African Republic  for which we have worked with members of the Economic Community of Central African States. We hope that the numerous stakeholders will adhere strictly to the transition framework. Nevertheless  we are still concerned by the humanitarian and security situation in the country  as well as by the renewed activities on the part of the Lord’s Resistence Army. We welcome the establishment of the International Support Mission to the Central African Republic by the African Union  which will take over from the Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic. Gabon calls for a contingency plan to be put in place for the new mission. I would like to thank France  which is supporting efforts on the part of the subregion to ensure that peace returns to the Central African Republic.In Mali  at the height of the crisis  Gabon responded to a funding appeal by the African Union  which was launched to support its efforts in that country. We commend the positive political change that has taken place in Mali  proof of which can be seen in the presidential elections and the decision by the people of Mali to elect President Keita. I would like to wish him all the best  and I call upon the international community to support the reconstruction of Mali. With regard to Western Sahara  Gabon welcomes efforts to bring about dialogue and negotiations by the Organization. My country would also like to reiterate that it supports the Moroccan initiative for Western Sahara  which we believe is a courageous and realistic proposal  one that could lead to a lasting settlement. We call upon the different players to reach a constructive and dynamic compromise  the results of which will benefit the unity of Africa. Africa should be able to respond to new threats to peace and security  including transnational crime  the illicit trafficking in small arms  and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea  which the Atlantic coast is now experiencing. Following the Summit of Heads of State and Government on Maritime Safety and Security in the Gulf of Guinea  which was held in June in Yaounde  we adopted a strategy for combating those threats. Gabon is ready to make contributions towards the measures that were adopted at the Summit. I also welcome efforts by the Security Council to address the problem  particularly through resolution 2018 (2011). Africa cannot face up to the challenges of peace and security alone. Its efforts must be given better support  because instability in Africa will have repurcussions in other regions. I thank our partners  particularly France  Japan  Germany  the United States  the United Nations and the European Union  for their significant contributions towards such efforts.In the face of those new threats  it is important for the United Nations to continue to enhance its cooperation with regional African organizations. Furthermore  we must ensure the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty  which was the first legally binding instrument on the matter adopted by the General Assembly  in May.In a world stricken by tensions and crises  we must continue to work towards ensuring that the Organization can better fulfil its mandate in the area of international peace and security  with a particular emphasis on conflict prevention  while supporting peaceful resolutions to emerging crises. The crisis in Syria has already claimed many lives  and we have seen an unacceptable escalation in the form of the use of chemical weapons. We strongly condemn the use of such weapons  and Gabon calls for the destruction of all stockpiles of chemical weapons throughout the world. With regard to the investigations being carried out by United Nations inspectors in Syria  we call upon all parties to fully cooperate. Furthermore  Gabon supports all diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political solution that will allow us to emerge from that crisis. In the event that its efforts are blocked  the Security Council must take measures.With regard to Palestine and the State of Israel  the possibility of resuming talks with the impetus of the United States must be welcomed. Gabon still supports the broadly accepted view of two viable States  Israel and Palestine  coexisting in mutual security and respect within recognized borders. With regard to the embargo on Cuba  Gabon reiterates its position in favour of lifting that ban because of its negative impact on the well-being of the Cuban population.It is our obligation to transform our international institutions in order to make them more equipped to meet current challenges. The reform of the Security Council  enhancing the role and authority of the General Assembly and the reform of the Economic and Social Council are all to be wished. It is essential for our common future that we assume that responsibility  in the spirit of the Charter. Assuring such a future calls upon our shared but differentiated responsibility and forces us to act for the well-being of humankind. On the basis of those convictions  Gabon will continue to be committed  within the Organization  to working for peace and development  which is also at the heart of the vision that I have proposed for the future of my own country  a future I wish for all countries."
"61",2555,"GBR",68,2013,"In my lifetime  the world has been sliced up and labelled in many different ways: East and West; communism and capitalism; North and South; Christian and Muslim; developed and developing  and so on. But as we meet today  the most important fault line is not one of geography  or ideology  or religion  or wealth; it is the divide between those societies which are open and those which are closed. Open societies choose democracy and freedom at home  and engagement and responsibility abroad. Closed societies suppress the liberty of their citizens  draw a veil across their actions and withdraw from our shared international life.We must be honest — the forces of insularity and isolationism have gained momentum in recent years. Discrediting democracy feels easier. Authoritarian States point enthusiastically at the ongoing fallout of the 2008 financial crisis — proof  they say  of a broken Western model. They feel vindicated; their citizens may be less free  but their growth rates outstrip those in the West. At the same time  in many of the States affected by the financial crash  austerity has given rise to a period of introspection. The impulse is to turn inwards rather than face outwards.And so a crisis of confidence has threatened to take hold in parts of the developed world. It is not surprising to hear some argue that liberal democracy has had its day and that our multilateral system is becoming obsolete. But those who make these claims are wrong. They are drawing the wrong conclusions from recent events.The real lesson of the past five years has been the remarkable resilience of open societies and the acute need for international cooperation in today’s world. Liberal democracies in Europe and across the Atlantic have weathered profound economic difficulty. The eurozone did not fall over  as many said it would. By working together  disaster was averted and the sovereign debt crisis is being managed.In Europe we have maintained stability at a time of great upheaval because  for the most part  our citizens have expressed their frustration peacefully and through the ballot box. And where there has been unrest  mature democracies have managed it with relative success. And so  just as the events of recent years have revealed the weaknesses of some Western economies  they have also underscored the great strength of open societies — the ability to evolve and adapt. Open societies do not fear change  and in the twenty-first century such openness to reform is critical to lasting stability and success.Democracy  free speech  participation  equality before the law  the right to peaceful protest  the right to be educated  the chance to work — these are not Western values; they are the political and economic freedoms sought by citizens everywhere  and they are gaining force in every country around the globe. Governments that ignore them are fighting a losing battle. Democracy did not fail in Egypt; a single set of elections failed. Egypt now needs to return to the path of inclusive democracy. The democratic urge remains as strong among the people as it was when they first rejoiced in Tahrir Square.In other parts of the region  while the picture is mixed  important progress has been made. In Libya  the General National Congress is working towards elections in early 2014. Morocco has a new Constitution and  for the first time  a Prime Minister elected by Parliament. Although difficult challenges remain  Yemen has chosen reconciliation  dialogue and democracy over violence. Tunisia is also focused on building a new democracy and economic growth  with progress towards a new Constitution  and further elections expected in 2014.Yes  these nations will undergo more turbulence. That is certain. Well-functioning democracy cannot emerge overnight  be exported from the West or dropped on a country from 8 000 feet — that much we have learnt from the failures of the past. Developing the culture and institutions needed — the rule of law  plural politics  human rights — is a painstaking process for every country involved  and it requires strategic patience from the rest of the world.But while the road to democracy is difficult  the direction of travel is set. Everywhere we look  people are standing together against discrimination and for equality; against oppression and for liberty. A wave of openness has emerged  transcending borders and cultures. Men and women of every creed  faith and colour are calling for fair opportunities and demanding to be heard.The United Kingdom is clear. We are on the side of all those who support political freedom and economic empowerment. There will be no pulling up of the drawbridge from us; no heading into retreat. We will resist any impulse to turn our back on the world.In North Africa and the Middle East  we are helping States put in place the building blocks for their democracies. Whether by training Libyan officials to supervise fair elections  or supporting a free media by training journalists in Morocco  these are the nuts and bolts of successful democratic transition.We are also supporting these countries’ economies through our stewardship of the Group of Eight Deauville Partnership this year  leading efforts to boost trade and investment in the region  helping small- and medium-sized enterprises and  crucially  promoting greater participation by women. And we have kept the political spotlight on the need to return assets stolen by the former regimes in those countries.In Syria  our priority is to help bring about a political settlement. The foundations for a settlement were agreed in Geneva last year — establishing  on the basis of mutual consent  a transitional governing body with full executive powers. We are in close touch with our partners about convening a second Geneva conference as soon as possible. No meaningful political solution can occur without the moderate Syrian opposition. We recognize the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people  and we recognize their commitments to the Geneva process and to building a secular  democratic and pluralist Syria that ensures equal rights for all.On the issue of chemical weapons in Syria  on 21 August the Al-Assad regime committed a war crime under international humanitarian law  launching a large-scale chemical-weapon attack on its own people — the first attack on this scale for 25 years and 88 years after such weapons were universally banned. As President Obama said here on Tuesday (see A/68/PV.5)  it is an insult to human reason to suggest that the regime was not responsible for that war crime. The international community must react  and react in unison. That is why we hope to adopt later today a Security Council resolution establishing binding legal obligations on the Syrian regime for the removal and destruction of Syria’s vast chemical-weapons arsenal.On Wednesday  I announced that the United Kingdom would provide a further $160 million of humanitarian support for the Syrian people  bringing total United Kingdom funding to $800 million — £500 million — our biggest-ever response to a humanitarian crisis  much of which is aimed at helping the many children caught up in this tragic conflict.The world has raised close to $1 billion of humanitarian support this month  and I hope that others will step up and contribute. Most importantly  I call on all parties inside Syria to allow humanitarian agencies to operate without hindrance or the threat of violence. Unless that urgent humanitarian access is given  no amount of money can alleviate the scale of the Syrian people’s suffering.I welcome President Rouhani’s comments on Tuesday that he wants a constructive engagement between Iran and the rest of the world and that he wants to engage immediately in time-bound talks on the nuclear issue. Those are encouraging words which I very much hope are matched with genuine action. I am pleased that negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme will restart in October. If Iran’s words are followed by concrete steps  then there is a real opportunity to make progress in resolving the serious international concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme. We also look to a more constructive approach from Iran in helping resolve the crisis in Syria  and we have made clear to Iran that we are ready  as the United Kingdom Government  to improve our relationship on a step-by-step and reciprocal basis.One thing that would fundamentally transform the Middle East is a conclusive two-State agreement to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — an agreement based on 1967 borders with agreed land swaps that leads to a sovereign and viable Palestinian State living in peace alongside a safe and secure Israel  a universally recognized Palestine alongside a universally recognized Israel.I commend the dedicated efforts of Secretary Kerry and the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas  which have enabled direct peace talks to resume. I sincerely hope that both parties will make every effort to keep talks going  including a halt in the building of new settlements. The international community must fully support the parties as they make the difficult decisions that are necessary for achieving a lasting peace. Britain stands ready to play its part.As we wind up our military operations in Afghanistan  the United Kingdom continues to work with the Afghan Government to ensure a successful transition. The Afghan National Security Forces are now leading on security and continue to grow in confidence and capability. That is a significant achievement. In the United Kingdom  we recognize the serious challenges still ahead for Afghanistan  but we strongly believe that there is room for optimism about the country’s long-term future. This is a crucial time for Afghan men  women and children  as they prepare for elections in 2014  which must be credible  transparent and inclusive.Poverty is as great a threat to stability and freedom as are conflict and oppression. Thus  despite the strain on our finances  the United Kingdom has met its target to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on development assistance. We are the only country in the Group of 20 (G-20) to have done so. Following the global economic crisis  we said we would not balance our books on the backs of the world’s poorest and we have held true to our word.On Monday  we announced that we would provide $1.6 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. That is 10 per cent of the Fund’s replenishment  so long as others join.Women and girls remain at the heart of our development agenda. They are the key to economic growth  so investing in girls’ education is the single most effective thing we can do to break the cycle of poverty. We must end gender inequality  which is the root of violence against women. That ambition is at the heart of the United Kingdom’s initiative to end sexual violence in conflict  and I would encourage all States that have yet to do so to endorse the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. Over 115 States are already committed; we are sending a message to the victims of those devastating crimes that they are not alone and that their attackers will be punished.We have also used our presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8) to focus on three areas where we can support global prosperity — boosting trade  ensuring better transparency to help developing nations benefit from resources that are rightfully theirs  and cracking down on tax evasion and closing tax loopholes. That was just the start of our work on that agenda  and we are pleased that the United Kingdom’s trade  tax and transparency priorities have been fully reflected in agreements reached by the G-20  including extending the commitment to resist protectionist measures by a further two years to the end of 2016  so that trade remains as free and open as possible.Whether it be in the G-8  the G-20  the European Union  NATO or the Commonwealth  or as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council  the United Kingdom will continue to be an active and engaged player in the world. The biggest problems we face are problems we share.Take climate change  for example — the report issued this morning by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that sea levels are already rising and that ice is melting faster than we had expected. The report is an authoritative rebuke to all those who persist in claiming that man-made climate change does not exist. The United Kingdom will continue to cut our emissions and give over $6 billion to assist developing countries to do the same and adapt to environmental changes.But if we are to halt the devastating effects of climate change  we must listen to the science  act now and act together. We thus welcome the Secretary-General’s announcement of a leaders’ summit next year as a key step towards all nations agreeing to a deal in 2015 to take action to avert the crisis.We are all affected by the scourge of terrorism. Whether it is a soldier brutally murdered on a quiet London street or innocent shoppers gunned down in a busy Nairobi mall  we are all vulnerable. Following the recent horrific events in Nairobi  the United Kingdom is working closely with the Governments of Kenya  Somalia and countries across the region to tackle the issue. Our global response to terrorism must be robust  intelligent and cover all those areas where our work together can make a genuine difference. Alone we can take small steps forward  but together we can take giant leaps.That much was clear earlier this year when we signed the world’s first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution 67/234 B) to better regulate the global sale of weapons. The United Kingdom is proud of the role we played in delivering it  and we urge any countries that have not signed it to do so. The Treaty reminds us that  with enough political will  we can come together and do the previously unthinkable  and that should embolden us to do still more.The United Nations has many virtues  but it also has serious shortcomings that must be faced. The United Nations has no greater friend than the United Kingdom  but it does not adequately reflect the world we live in today. The Security Council must be reformed. Unless more room is made at the top table  it will fast become an anachronism  a relic of a different time. That is why the United Kingdom continues to support permanent seats for Brazil  India  Germany and Japan  and permanent African representation  too. We call on all States to play their part in this forum  and in our other international institutions  just as we will play ours.We are at our best when we engage constructively with one another and when we are ambitious in pursuing our shared goals. That is as important for those countries whose economies and influence have grown and transformed over more recent years as it is for the old  established Powers. Greater influence means greater responsibility. The world is a better place because Brazil is taking a lead in tackling deforestation  because Mexico has enshrined climate-change targets into law  because the Republic of Korea is leading the way on nuclear security.But there is much more to do; there are many more areas where we need to take the lead. A global trade deal to cut bureaucracy at borders — the subject of a World Trade Organization meeting that will take place in Bali in early December — would mean a trillion-dollar boost for the global economy.In the next two years  the United Kingdom wants to do as much as it can to drive progress on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals  and we are also working in the United Nations and with civil society to set out a post-2015 agenda that is even more ambitious. There can be no greater goal than to eradicate extreme poverty  leaving no one behind.On these and all other issues facing our nations  we are quite simply stronger together than we are apart. Now more than ever  we must fend off the forces of insularity and isolationism  stand up for our values and look out to the world. That is what the United Kingdom will do. We stand ready to work with all others who will do the same."
"62",2579,"GEO",68,2013,"It is a great honour to once again represent my beloved nation at this rostrum. During the past decade  when I have had the privilege to address the Hall  Georgia has moved from a failed State to a market democracy. We have experienced both advances and setbacks  both breakthroughs and mistakes. But the world has been able to witness my nation’s constant commitment to freedom. I ask members today once again to hear the voice of a nation that transcends political  social and religious differences in a common love for freedom — a voice that  despite all the problems we have encountered and the challenges we still have to overcome  is full of hope. Looking at our world today  I think that this voice of hope is needed.The optimism of the early 1990s  when the spread of liberal and democratic values seemed natural  when the end of history had been proclaimed  and when the United Nations was set to become the heart and the soul of a world finally at peace  the optimism of that era — noticeable when I was a student in New York and visited the United Nations as an intern — was then crushed by a wave of pessimism and cynicism.The world is not at peace. Humankind has not reconciled with itself  and the United Nations did not become the heart and soul of a united globe. Western civilization  once triumphant  is now trying to tackle a deep economic  social  and spiritual crisis. In Eastern Europe the colour revolutions are challenged by the very forces they defeated a few years ago. In the Middle East the glorious images of cheering crowds in Cairo and Tunis have been replaced by the horrendous videos of the gassed children of Damascus.There are many good reasons to be disillusioned. But should the untrammelled optimism of the 1990s be replaced by an equally untrammelled pessimism  by a sense of resignation that stifles hope? Should the fact that the expansion of democracy and freedom turns out to require profound struggle cause us to renounce our beliefs and our principles?I have come here today to share the hopes on behalf of my nation and to speak out on behalf of my Georgian people against such pervasive fatalism. I came here to address those who doubt  those who hesitate and those who are tempted to give in.If the West is an anachronism  why do millions of Poles  Czechs  Estonians  Romanians and others cherish so much the day they entered NATO? Why are millions of Ukrainians  Georgians  Moldovans and others desperately knocking on the doors of the European Union?If freedom is no longer fashionable  how do we explain that the suicide of a previously unknown citizen in a remote Tunisian town has changed the map of the world? No  history did not come to an end in 1989 or 1991  as was proclaimed  and it never will. Freedom is still its driving force and its goal. Everywhere  men and women who want to live in freedom are confronted by the forces of tyranny. The question is: are we going to be actors or spectators in that confrontation?As I speak  the Eastern European countries aspiring to join the European family of free and democratic nations are facing constant pressures and threats. Armenia has been cornered and forced to sign a customs union that is not in that nation’s interest or in those of our region. Moldova is being blockaded. Ukraine is under constant attack. Azerbaijan faces extraordinary pressure. And Georgia is occupied. Why? Because an old empire is trying to reclaim its bygone borders. “Borders” is actually not the right word  since that empire — be it the Russian Empire  the Soviet Union  the Russian Federation  or the Eurasian Union — never had borders. It had only margins.I came today to speak in the name of those margins. Unlike most nations  the Russian Federation has no interest in having stable States around it. Neighbouring countries in constant turmoil is what the Kremlin is seeking. It rejects the very idea of strong Governments in Georgia  Ukraine or Moldova  even ones that try to be friendly to its interests. I was never a great fan of what the French call “la langue de bois”. But  as my second term nears its end  I feel the urge more than heretofore to speak my mind. Let us be very concrete.Do members think that Vladimir Putin wants Armenia to decisively triumph over Azerbaijan  for instance? No. That would make Armenia too strong and potentially too independent. Do members think then that the contrary is true  that Moscow wants Baku to prevail over Yerevan? Obviously not. The current rise of a modernized  dynamic Azerbaijan is a nightmare for Russian leaders. No  they do not want anyone to prevail. The conflict itself is their objective  since it keeps both nations dependent and blocks their integration into the European common space.Do members think that the electoral defeat of the forces that led the Orange Revolution in Ukraine has led the Kremlin to take a softer approach to that country? On the contrary. I spoke yesterday to my colleague Viktor Yanukovych. His Government is under constant attack and pressure from Russia. That is what is happening on a daily basis  again ahead of the European summit in Vilnius. Russian officials now speak openly about dismembering that nation. I just heard the speech two days ago.Do members think that the Kremlin would agree to discuss the de-occupation of our regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia  now that the Government has changed in Tbilisi? Far from it. The annexation of Georgian lands by Russian troops continues. Yesterday  the occupants again expelled Georgian citizens from their houses and are destroying their villages  homes and the houses of their parents and grandparents. In daylight  they are taking over their cemeteries and water systems with total impunity. Despite the friendly statements made by the new Georgian Government in recent weeks and months  the Russian military continues to advance its position  dividing communities with new barbed wire  threatening our economy  moving towards the vital Baku-Supsa pipeline  approaching closer and closer to the main highway of Georgia  and thus putting into question the very sustainability of our country.We are one of very few nations in history — of which I am very proud — that has  unfortunately  sustained a full-blown attack by Russia. We are the only one  in many centuries  whose statehood and independence have survived  despite a full-blown attack by the more than 100 000-strong Russian army  despite being bombed by 200 planes and attacked by the full Russian Black Sea fleet and tens of thousands of mercenaries. Our statehood and independence have survived despite all of those things. But let us not now risk losing any of that in a time of peace. We have survived because were united; we survived because the world was with us. I hope that the world will remain with us when that pressure is on us.I have come here  in the name of the Georgian people  to ask the international community to react strongly to the aggression and to help us to put an end to the Russian annexation of our lands. The hostility of Vladimir Putin and his team towards the Government that I have had the privilege to lead for almost a decade has not been based on personal hatred or cultural misunderstanding. Any such interpretation was just a smokescreen.My predecessor  President Shevardnadze  came from the highest-level Soviet nomenklatura. He was returned to power in Georgia with direct Russian help in the 1990s  through a military coup. He was well known for his Soviet diplomatic skills — unlike me. And yet  Russia constantly undermined his authority and even tried to assassinate him several times.It is not about Gamsakhurdia — the first President of Georgia — Shevardnadze  Saakashvili  or the present Prime Minister Ivanishvili. Those names actually do not matter when the stakes are so high. This is about the possibility — or lack — of true statehood in Georgia and beyond. Why? Because the current Russian authorities know perfectly well that as soon as strong institutions are built in Ukraine  Georgia  Moldova or in any other place — as soon as functioning States emerge — such institutions  such States will reflect and enforce the will of their people  which is to become fully independent and move towards Europe.The Georgian experience of successful reforms and the creation of a functioning State was therefore considered to be a virus — one that could and would contaminate the whole post-Soviet region. We became the least corrupt country in Europe  the world’s number-one reformer — according to the World Bank — one of the top places for business and the least criminal country in Europe  after having been one of the most criminal. That was the virus that should be eliminated by every means possible.That is why the Georgian nation has suffered an embargo  a war  an invasion and an occupation — all since 2006. But it is also why the resistance of the Georgian people and the resilience of the Georgian democracy are of the utmost importance for the whole region.The efforts to roll back the advances of the European Union and of NATO in our region — progress based on the will of our people — are becoming ever more intense. Those efforts have a name: the Eurasian Union. It makes me sick when KGB officer Vladimir Putin lectures the world about freedom  values and democracy. That is the least of the things he can do for the world  as the dictatorial leader of one of the last empires left. But that new project is much more dangerous than his lectures. The Eurasian Union has been shaped as an alternative to the European Union  and unveiled by Vladimir Putin as the main project of his new presidency — a new Russian empire.Because European and Euro-Atlantic integration take a lot of time and require tremendous effort; because there are moments when one might think one is pursuing a mirage; and because the threats are becoming so strong  the pressure so direct  while the promises seem so far away — some people in our region might fall victim to fatigue and ask themselves  “Why not?”. Today  I want precisely to explore that “why not?”.Much more than with a choice of foreign policy or of international alliances  our nations are confronted with a choice of society  a choice of life. Our people have to decide whether they accept to live in a world of fear and crime: a world in which differences are perceived as threats and minorities as punching bags; a world in which opponents are faced with selective justice or beatings; a world that we in our region all know very well  as do those in some other regions of the world  since this is the world from which we originate.The Eurasian Union is both our recent past and the future shaped for us by some ex-KGB officers in Moscow. On the opposite side  our revived traditions and our centuries-old aspirations have led us towards another world called Europe.European societies are far from perfect — we all know that. There too  one can have fears  doubts  angers  hatreds and social inequality. But there  at the same time  meritocracy prevails over nepotism  tolerance is a fundamental of public life and current opponents are the future ministers  and not prisoners to be or enemies to beat.The choice  when it is expressed in that way  is so obvious for the people of our region that some Kremlin strategists — they call themselves “polito-technologists” — have decided to cancel the truth and have shaped lies that they are spreading throughout Ukraine  Georgia  Moldova and many other places. Their mouthpieces in our respective countries — that conscious or unconscious so-called fifth column — identify the European Union with the destruction of family values  the erosion of national traditions and the promotion of gays and lesbians  undermining our traditional religions.Strangely  in recent years  and even more so in recent months  we hear in Tbilisi  Kiev and Chisinau the same ugly music that was first orchestrated in Moscow. We hear that our traditions are collapsing under the influence of the West  that Christian holidays will be replaced by gay pride events and churches by a multicultural Disneyland. We hear that our Orthodox identity is under threat. And after all of that  we hear that we share with our former masters a common respect for decency and traditions.Are we so naive as to believe the lies of Putin and the others  as other generations have done  allowing our sovereignty to be kidnapped? Are we so unfair to our ancestors to think that their memory would be honoured by attacks on mosques or by pogroms? Are we so unaware of our own history that we allow it to repeat itself endlessly?When we hear the fake music of the orthodox brotherhood sung by Russian imperialists  can we not hear the true voice of Patriarch Kirion  who was assassinated  or the eternal voice of the Patriarch Ambrosi Khelaya  who was tortured for days and weeks only because he appealed to the Geneva Conference against the invasion of his country? He told his Russian interrogators  “You can have my body  my flesh  but you will never have my soul.” Are we so deaf as not to hear the voices of the bishops and priests tortured and killed by Russian imperialists and Russian communists? Are we so uneducated that we do not recall who has repainted our churches and erased our sacred frescos? Are we so blind today not to see the destruction of our churches by the same people who erased our churches in the nineteenth century — Russians who are now in the occupied territory?We need to know our history. Our history teaches us that tolerance is the basis for sovereignty in our region. It is not only a moral duty; it is an issue of national security. We need to know our history to understand that the same old imperialistic principle — divide and rule — is being applied today as it was two centuries ago.Looking at our region today  those who have some knowledge of Caucasian history might remember the Armenian-Azerbaijani bloodshed of 1905  directly created by the tsarist Administration; compare it to the beginning of the conflict in Karabakh in the late 1980s. The Russian army was present there  in large numbers. In front of its eyes  the war started and they pretended to help both sides  but in fact stirred up the conflict.They might recall — as I do too well — the beginning of the war in the Georgia region of Abkhazia in the early 1990s  when Georgian paramilitary groups were getting their weapons from the same Russian troops who were actually leading  directing and assisting the Abkhaz militia and bombing Georgian territory and bringing in Chechen mercenaries in order to kill any form of solidarity between nations of the North and the South Caucasus. They did so just as they sent — for the same reason  more than one century before — Georgian officers to the front line of their wars against the Chechens  Ingush and Dagestanis.We could also look at other margins throughout the times. We could look at Poland or Ukraine  and we would see the same pictures. Everywhere it reached  the Empire inflamed the relations between subjugated peoples and separated them by a wall of fanatic antagonism. Unfortunately  it used to work. But what is even more unfortunate is that it is still working today.The European Union  the greatest political success of recent decades  has been built on three pillars  which could be characterized as three rejections — the rejection of the extreme nationalists who had led Europe to the collective suicide of two world wars and the horrors of nazism; the rejection of communism  which was threatening to be spread throughout the continent and the world; and  finally  the rejection of colonialism and imperialism. It took time — and many participants today  as victims of French imperialism or British imperialism  remember it well and painfully — for the French and British Empires to accept that third rejection. But giving up their colonies was the price they had to pay for the modernization of their economies and the development of their democracies. It was also the price to pay for European unification to become fully realized. The Eurasian Union is based on the exact opposite premise. It is fuelled by intolerance  it is lead by old structures of the KGB  and it is designed to revive an old empire. That is what the Eurasian Union is all about. Of course  joining the Eurasian Union is very easy. There are no social  economic or political criteria to be met; becoming a colony  in fact  requires no effort at all. Passivity  mediocrity  the absence of national pride and a willingness to be enslaved are the only requirements.On the other hand  to form a real union there is no alternative but to make a herculean effort and meet exact criteria  because principles are precisely what create a union. To those who doubt  therefore  I say that it is precisely because the European Union demands effort and imposes criteria for joining — because the European Union does not seek to absorb us while the Eurasian Union dreams of absorption — that the choice should be obvious.But there is an even better reason for saying that the choice is obvious. The choice is obvious because the Russian project is doomed to fail. No empire is sustainable today; we are living in the twenty-first century. It is certainly not the Russian century  and the Russian Empire is the last  anachronistic empire in the world. If we look back at history  France and the United Kingdom lost their colonies not only because the colonies fought for their independence  but also because people in Paris and London ultimately did not believe in their empire anymore.Exactly the same thing is happening in Russia nowadays. The imperial dream is being rejected first  as we have seen  at its margins. But  most crucially  perhaps  the idea of the Empire is rejected at its very centre. Such a rejection does not manifest itself in public protests alone or in the rising polls of the opposition in the main cities of Russia. It expresses itself in the universal cynicism of Russian elites towards Putin’s Eurasian vision. The very people who are supposed to serve it do not believe in the viability of the project.Rejected at its margins  rejected at its centre  the imperialistic path will come to a dead end  the Eurasian Union will fail  and Russia will in the end become a nation State with borders  instead of margins — a real country with real borders. Then it will start to seek stable relations with stable neighbours. Then cooperation will replace confrontation.It will happen  and much sooner than people think  to the benefit of the margins  but most of all to the benefit of the Russian people themselves.It will happen because the imperial project has become absurd for a generation of Russian citizens who are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of the Internet.It will happen because ethnic discrimination in Russia is being used in its territories  but it will not make Russia a stronger and more united State. It will happen because the endless resources provided by the revenues of oil and gas are challenged by the perspectives offered by the exploitation of shale gas and shale oil. The shale gas revolution is really undermining the last authoritarian empire in the world.It will happen because gas alone does not replace economic modernization.It will happen because of corruption and the absence of justice.It will happen because entire regions have been alienated by discrimination and violence — because the people of Chechnya  Ingushetia  Dagestan  Tatarstan  Bashkortostan and many other places have been so persecuted that they do not feel part of any common project with the central authorities in Moscow.It will happen because the frustrations  angers and hatreds are too strong to bear and the unifying ideal is too absent.It will happen  not in the coming decades but in the coming years. A few years from now  the Assembly will recall my words. Vladimir Putin will have left the Kremlin and vanished from Russian politics  even if he says that he will be there for another 20 years or more. Russian citizens will remember him as a ghost from the old times — from the times of corruption and oppression. Nobody knows whether the process will be calm or violent  whether his successor will be nationalistic or liberal  or both together  but what matters is something else — Russia will no longer be an empire. It will become  finally  a normal nation State. That is the horizon we should all prepare for together.Meanwhile  as our region remains an area of confrontation  the formerly captive nations should unite their strengths instead of cultivating their divisions. Some leaders and some countries in the past understood that the freedom of one was dependent on the freedom of all the other subjugated nations  like Poland  which for many centuries dreamed of uniting all persecuted people  or like the Poland of Marshal Pilsudski  which invited all the oppressed people or their officers to unite under the flag of Polish independence and Polish military forces. But never did our ancestors benefitefrom a force that was vast and powerful enough  that understood its strategic interest was to preserve the sovereignty of each of our nations. Today that force exists; it is  with all its deficiencies  the European Union.As we come closer to the Vilnius Eastern Partnership Summit  I would like to reiterate a call that I have made several times in the recent years. By launching the Eastern Partnership as a response to the 2008 invasion of Georgia  the European Union has offered to our nations a platform for us to cooperate under its benevolent umbrella. We should invest much more in it. We should develop common projects  first and foremost focusing on the necessary reforms that we should carry out together  because reforms mean for all of us statehood and independence.Russian Empress Catherine II knew it well. When Poland started to successfully implement an ambitious programme of reforms based on precepts from the French and British Enlightenments despite Russian attempts to counter those reforms  she wrote a long and secret letter to the German Emperor  Frederick the Great of Prussia. The letter was and remains one of the most impressive expressions of the nature and strategy of the imperialistic project. It states that the ongoing reforms were dangerous for both Russia and Prussia because they would turn Poland into a true State  that the reforms needed to be stopped and that Poland should be attacked and dismembered before reforms were fully implemented so that it never needed to be occupied again. The letter will not sound unfamiliar to those who know how much Vladimir Putin loathed the Georgian experience during the past decade. Many Russians were asking  if the once-corrupt Georgia  a criminal country  a mafia-ridden country  considered to be a failed country  could succeed  why is it that Russia cannot succeed? It was an ideologically dangerous project. For the first time  an efficient nation State was being built in the Caucasus  and the reforms had to be crushed before they could bear all their fruits. Unity should be our rule in Eastern Europe  including in the divided Caucasus. I have spoken about the beginnings of the war in Abkhazia. I could have recalled an older scene that symbolically characterizes the history of the Caucasus. It was at the end of the rebellion led by Shamil  the great imam of the Northern Caucasus  against the Russian Empire  after Shamil had surrendered and after the last Chechen leader still fighting  Baysongour  had been wounded and captured. As Baysongour was going to be hanged  the Russian officers brought together a crowd of Dagestani men to witness the execution. They ordered one of them to remove the chair on which Baysongour was standing in order to execute him. The Russians knew what they were doing — they hoped to fuel the local vendettas and oppose the people  which is an old tradition in the Caucasus. Seeing that  the valiant commander Baysongour moved the chair himself  committing a suicide forbidden under all religions  including Islam  and preserving the relations between neighbours.Despite that one failure  how many times has the strategy of dividing neighbours encountered success among the nations of the Caucasus? It needs to come to an end. That is why I have launched several projects during my presidency to reinforce the people-to-people contacts between North and South Caucasus  projects focusing mostly on education and on university exchange. That is why the Georgian Parliament has recognized the genocide of the Cherkezian people — one of the least known and tragic pages of the history of the world  when an entire nation was wiped because their land was needed by the Russian Empire. We need to build on those efforts. We need to prepare for the time when the Empire collapses  so that its legacy of hatred is swiftly overcome. And we  as citizens of Georgia  need to prepare for the time when Russian troops will leave our occupied regions  when Moscow will withdraw from Tskhinvali and Sukhumi  Abkhazia. We need to prepare ourselves to welcome back our Ossetian and Abkhaz fellow citizens as brothers and sisters and not as enemies. We need to prepare for the time when hundreds of thousands  in fact  more than half a million  internally displaced Georgians and members of other ethnic groups return to their deserted homes  because that time will come much sooner than we think. As my second term nears its end  I take pride in Georgia’s many accomplishments during my tenure. We ushered Georgia out of a state of darkness  introduced unprecedented transparency into our public service  put our children back in school and got rid of the gangs. We have brought our nation closer than ever before to its European dream and worked tirelessly to renew the spirit of tolerance that guided Georgia in our glorious past.We did many good things  but like any leader — and when I became President  I was then the youngest president in the world — I realize that some things were done at a very high cost because of lack of experience. In our rush to impose a new reality against the background of internal and external threats  we cut corners and certainly made mistakes. At times we went too far and at other times not far enough. I fully acknowledge my responsibility in that regard  and I sincerely feel for all those who believe that they did not benefit enough from our work  or even that they were victims of our radical methods.I want to tell all Georgian citizens — those who supported our project  our policies and our party and those who rejected them — how proud I am of their maturity. We promised them this project  but we did not promise them that it would be smooth going. We were very ambitious  and that was because our people were so mature and so brave. I want to tell them from this rostrum how humble I feel in the light of the sacrifices and the efforts they made.We are and should remain a nation united in a common love for freedom and dignity. We are and should remain a nation united in the deepest respect for the sacrifices made by our soldiers  a nation sharing the same sorrow when they lose their lives - in Afghanistan  for instance - and taking the same pride in their bravery. We are a nation that is proud of our soldiers  who stood up to a force of Russian invaders one hundred times the size of our contingent  and gave us and the world time to mobilize and to protect and save our independence — something that  with all due respect  many much bigger and more powerful nations could not do in the twentieth century. We are and we should remain a nation united in our historical identity and our desire to join the European family of democratic nations  the family we should never have been separated from in the first place  our family. The path of the Georgian people towards freedom  regional unity and European integration is far from over  and I will continue to dedicate every day of my life to its success  as a proud citizen of a proud nation."
"63",2626,"GHA",68,2013,"It is with a heavy heart that I address the Assembly today. Just before I left Ghana to attend this general debate  I learned of the terrorist attack that took place in Nairobi. I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the many lives that were lost to those senseless and cowardly acts of violence. As the death toll increased  so too did my grief  knowing that each additional number symbolized one more human life. Those numbers symbolized individuals who may have been strangers to those of us here but were of prime significance in the lives of the people who loved them — their parents  children  husbands  wives  friends and colleagues.Soon enough  I got word that one of the people massacred was a person of significance in my life and in the lives of so many other Ghanaians. Kofi Awoonor was a 78-year-old gentleman who had served his country loyally as a poet and professor  ambassador to Brazil and Cuba  and Chairman of our Council of State  a presidential advisory body. Professor Awoonor had once even been our country’s envoy to the United Nations. On this fateful day  however  Professor Awoonor was in Nairobi to perform his poetry at a writers’ conference. He had travelled there with his son  and they had decided before the day’s scheduled events to do what should have been one of the most ordinary and uneventful of activities — to make a stop at a shopping mall.Unfortunately  what happened that day at the Westgate Premier Shopping Mall was anything but ordinary. Professor Awoonor’s life was taken from him and those who loved him  just as the lives of dozens of others were taken away from them and their communities. Each of them had a unique story and accomplishments or aspirations for which they will be remembered. Professor Awoonor’s son  though injured  was among the many who were lucky enough to escape the attack. It is a day they will never forget. They will carry the scars  physical and emotional  with them. We who watched from a distance should never allow ourselves to forget  because we have also been irrevocably marked by this tragedy.When independence was upon us and our possibilities felt endless  the world saw how brightly Africa could shine. Then  for decades  that light was dimmed. There was a time when killing seemed almost commonplace in Africa. Indeed  there are plenty of graves that remain unmarked. There was a time when the ruthlessness of dictators seemed to be the order of the day. For decades  the corruption  greed and depravity of a few caused the suffering of an entire continent. We so easily could have succumbed to the wars  the poverty and the diseases  but we did not. We staggered our way through  year after year  and eventually we made it. We have survived. Last year when I addressed the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.9)  I began with the assurance that I had come with good news from Ghana  with stories of success from the African continent. This year  it gives me great pleasure to do the same — even on the heels of the dastardly terrorist attack — because I know that today’s Africa will not be divided or deterred by the heinous crimes of those who wish to disrupt our progress. I know that our borders will no longer be used to undermine the brotherhood and sisterhood of our citizens. The days of massacres must remain in our past. Our rivers will no longer run red. Our children must be students now; we will no longer allow their childhoods to be stolen from them by those who wish to turn them into soldiers. Africa is standing tall  walking confidently towards political stability  walking confidently towards economic prosperity  walking proudly towards ethnic and religious harmony and coexistence. There is no place in today’s Africa for hatred and intolerance and the murder of innocent people — not anymore  not ever again. So we will mourn our dead. We will console ourselves and each other through our grief. We cannot allow terror to defeat us. That must strengthen our resolve. Our stride will not be broken.Last year from this stage  I also declared Ghana’s resolve to be a beacon of peace and democracy in the West African subregion. On behalf of the citizens whom I serve  I promised the world that Ghana would not allow its territory to be used in any manner whatsoever to destabilize other nations. Ghana has been steadfast in its cooperation with its regional neighbours to maintain the security of those nations that are enjoying stability and to restore security to those  such as Côte d’Ivoire and Mali  that have recently emerged from turmoil. Currently  Côte d’Ivoire is in a stage of rebuilding. The recent overtures towards reconciliation made by President Ouattara are a major step towards bridging the country’s political divide. After its own bout with terror  Mali made a solid return to democracy by conducting an election that all observers  even the sceptics and the cynics  hailed as being free  fair and peaceful.West Africa has seen enough war and strife. We want peace and security to persist in our subregion. Ghana will continue to play its role in strengthening the Economic Community of West African States to make sure that it is able to meet that objective.With all that I have said in my statement today  I am sure it will not come as a surprise to anyone that Ghana enthusiastically threw its support behind the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the General Assembly at the sixty-seventh session. International trade in conventional arms and ammunition must be regulated. We like to mention how the world has become a global village  especially when speaking of technology  culture and travel. The ease of communication in that global village also exists for warmongers and terrorist groups  who are using it to recruit new members  expand their cells  create intercontinental networks  obtain weapons and conceal their identities and locations. If we are to fight back  we must also work cooperatively. Nations in the developed world must align themselves with nations in the developing world. We must form partnerships and work together. Ghana is prepared to do that. We have signed the Arms Trade Treaty and we intend to do everything possible to see that it is ratified in a timely manner.Fledgling democracies tend to be fragile. Their limits are still being tested; their characteristics are still being defined. Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all venture  nor is it a one-time event. It is a system that takes decades to build  a process that pushes a country towards a perfection it will never reach  but countries must try nonetheless. This past year  the limits of Ghana’s democracy were tested  and I am proud to report that we passed with flying colours. The results of our recent elections were contested. Since our return to constitutional rule  Ghana has conducted six successful elections. Last year’s elections were the first whose results were formally challenged and heard by the Supreme Court. What made that situation noteworthy was the reliance of all parties involved on the rule of law. The proceedings were televised for the sake of transparency. The verdicts were readily accepted  and there was not a single reported incident of violence.Ghana’s victory is not an aberration. Other countries  like Kenya  have had similar experiences. That indicates that democratic institutions in Africa are growing stronger. It indicates that the balance of power in African countries is shifting from the authority of a sole individual to the more equitable process of properly designed systems. Strong institutions are the hallmark of every nation’s stability. They are crucial tools in the fight for human rights.It is our intention to bring an end to youth unemployment. In Ghana today  we are about to launch the Youth Jobs and Enterprise Development Fund  a programme that will provide young people with entrepreneurial skills and access to the funds needed to establish businesses of their own or expand existing ones  thereby creating new employment opportunities for themselves. Six of the ten fastest growing economies in the world today are on the African continent. However  that growth has not yet been translated into sustainable employment opportunities. Over the course of the past decade  African economies created over 37 million wage-paying jobs  yet 63 per cent of workers remain trapped in low-paying subsistence or self-employment endeavours. With those realities come the very real possibilities of income instability  exclusion from the benefits of economic growth and social security benefits tied to formal sector employment.Africa has a fast-growing population  more than 50 per cent of which is below the age of 35. That means we must create more jobs for our growing numbers of youth. They must have opportunities available to them. We cannot do that unless we transform the economies of Africa. It all comes down to value. We must value our resources  including our human resource — we must value our people. We cannot continue to be exporters of raw materials and primary produce. We need to add value to our exports. We cannot continue to export raw cocoa beans in Ghana; what we need to do instead is process more of those beans into value-added products. We cannot continue to export unrefined gold; we need to add value to our gold exports. We cannot continue to export oil and gas; we need to integrate that industry into our economy; we need to process petroleum products and produce power with the gas. We cannot continue to export bauxite and then in return import alumina to feed our local aluminium smelter; we need to work towards creating an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry in Ghana.In that way  by keeping the concept of value at the forefront of our economy  we can create new jobs for our young people. We can do that with local and foreign investors who share our vision. Often the rest of the world wrongly assumes that we in Africa do not know our worth. But we do. It is not sympathy we want; it is partnership — and the ability to stand on our own feet. It is not handouts we are in search of; it is opportunities. We have already shown that with time and the right opportunity  Africa can make it.Ghana achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for reducing poverty and hunger far ahead of the scheduled date of 2015. We are on track for achieving MDGs 2  3  and 6 as well. School enrolment  gender parity and the reduction of HIV/AIDS have all seen dramatic progress and statistical shifts as a result of the work to reach our targets. While we are lagging behind in MDGs 4  5  and 7 — infant mortality  maternal health and environmental sustainability — the figures show that there has been a vast improvement. Since 2000  the number of maternal deaths for every 100 000 births has decreased by more than half  from 740 to 320. We recognize that when we are talking about human lives  even a 50 per cent decrease is too little; it is not enough. That is why in 2010 we launched the MDG Accelerated Framework and Country Action Plan.Women account for more than 50 per cent of Ghana’s population. We believe that empowering them through education and encouraging them to take full control of their reproductive rights will help us not only to attain the MDGs faster  but also to build a better nation. It is not enough to put girls in school and allow them just enough education to be deemed literate; we must keep them in school. Removing teenaged girls from school for any reason  let alone to marry them off  is an unacceptable practice that must end. African women have always been the backbone of our societies. Let us imagine the change they could effect in our countries if we would only help them to reach their full potential. As a President and a father  I owe it to my children — my sons and my daughter — and all the children of Ghana to create a country where they may walk with their dignity intact and heads held high  standing shoulder to shoulder with the children of Europe  South America  Asia  North America and the rest of the world.Ghana is encouraged by the new initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue. We are still firm in our belief that an independent Palestinian State  existing side by side with a peaceful and secure Israeli State  is a desirable outcome that we must all support and work towards. In working towards that goal  we must realize that the continuous construction of settlements in Palestinian territory increasingly shuts the door on a two-State solution.Ghana calls once again for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted. It is a relic of the Cold War era and has no place in our current global dispensation.We have come a long way since the end of the last global war  yet the makeup of the Security Council does not reflect those developments. Ghana therefore supports the reform of the Security Council.Ghana will continue to pursue the principle of constructive engagement in our relations with the other countries in the world. We are fully committed to promoting honest global partnership that is informed by mutual respect and reciprocity.In closing  I would like once again to pay my respects to those who have lost their lives in Kenya  Syria  Palestine  Egypt  Libya  Pakistan  Iraq  Nigeria  Mali  Somalia  Turkey  India  the United States and all the other places where terrorists have attacked just this year alone. The reason we are all gathered here today is to find the ways and the means to create a better  more peaceful and prosperous world."
"64",2672,"GIN",68,2013,"It is with legitimate pride that I address the General Assembly  a symbol of the resolve of peoples to pool their potential in order to forge a better world where peace  security  prosperity and solidarity will allow humankind to face the many challenges before it.My pride is as great as my country  since we as a nation have just reached an important stage in our history by finalizing the transitional process and holding legislative elections on 28 September. Guinea has thus joined the melting pot of democratic nations that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was able to do so thanks to the assistance of its partners whose action catalysed a fruitful dialogue among the actors of Guinean political life. The elections have certainly opened the path to widespread development blazed by the Government so that the Guinean population can finally take advantage of its rich potential.I could not find a better opportunity than from this rostrum to convey the gratitude of the people and Government of Guinea to the international community and to reiterate my country’s commitment to the principles and purposes of our Organization  . I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whose devotion and  above all  competence have strengthened the central role of the United Nations in managing crises and improving the living conditions of our populations.I am firmly convinced that the new President of the General Assembly  Mr. John William Ashe  a man of the South  will understand better than anyone what is at stake in the theme for this session. I assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in carrying out his noble mission. We also express our great appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his efforts in maintaining the Assembly at its highest level.World peace and security are at the heart of our concerns and should be the subject of our full attention. A number of conflicts have been ended. Countries such as Sierra Leone  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire and Burundi have been able to turn the page of war in order to dedicate themselves to peacebuilding  thereby guaranteeing national reconstruction and sustainable development. The international community has the duty to support and assist them.In this context  I should like to evoke the case of Mali  which is emerging from a period of crisis. Sadly  the recent past of that brotherly country reminds us of the vulnerability of our States to terrorism and extremism  as well as the fragility of our institutions. The international community mobilized unanimously to maintain Mali’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to restore the authority of its State and constitutional legality.The peace that reigned in the presidential election in Mali certainly augurs a new era of prosperity for the country. Mali urgently needs assistance in order to build peace  reconcile the Malians and rebuild their country. It needs assistance to strengthen its security  which is indivisible from the Sahelo-Saharan region. We must always recall that terrorism never sleeps; we must combat and defeat it. International security is at stake.Guinea will never abandon its solidarity with Mali. Its presence within the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali testifies to our commitment to the stabilization of the subregion. The Guinean Government reiterates its determination to work for the re-establishment of constitutional order in Guinea-Bissau on the basis of the recommendations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the African Union  the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  the European Union and the United Nations.The Mano River Union is an essential link for the consolidation of peace in West Africa and deserves our full attention. The international community  and in particular the United Nations and ECOWAS  must work to support that organization in its global approach to meeting the security and socioeconomic challenges.We welcome the determination of the Peacebuilding Commission to assist Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea in their efforts in security and defence sector reform  while promoting youth employment and the empowerment of women on the basis of national reconciliation.With respect to the Great Lakes region  we urge the parties to renounce violence and to firmly commit to bringing peace to the region via adherence to the Framework Agreement of 24 February. We thank the Mediator  President Denis Sassou Nguesso  for his efforts to re-establish sustainable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region.As for the Central African Republic  urgent measures are needed to prevent a collapse of the State and to avert the chronic instability that threatens the country. We urge the Sudan and South Sudan to pursue dialogue in order to solve pending questions  specifically the status of Abyei province  and to relaunch bilateral cooperation.Given the deteriotation of the situation in Syria  the international community must strive further to bring an end to the relentless violence and massive destruction of lives and property. Guinea condemns the use of chemical weapons  which violates international norms and human dignity. Robust action must be undertaken for the destruction of the chemical arsenal in Syria  in accordance with the Russian-American initiative and Security Council resolution 2118 (2013). At the same time  the legal framework prohibiting the manufacture  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons must be strengthened.I cannot fail to raise the issue of Western Sahara  where we call on all stakeholders to spare no effort to arrive at a political solution. Our solidarity with Cuba is as strong as ever as we seek to have the embargo unjustly imposed on its people lifted.I should like to weigh in on a subject of major concern that is the focus of the international community’s attention — the Palestinian question. In spite of the many injunctions of the international community  the Palestinian people continue to suffer. Arbitrary violence  settlements and the seizure of goods continue to be the people’s daily lot. Guinea reiterates its unceasing support for the Palestinian cause  in the belief that peace and stability in the Middle East require the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the road map of the Quartet  which foresees the creation of an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel within safe and internationally recognized borders. We express the hope that the negotiations under way will enable the Palestinian people to finally enjoy their inalienable rights.Ever since its creation  the United Nations has spared no effort to promote peace  security and international cooperation in order to ensure the harmonious development of humankind. In this context  the Millennium Development Goals were a source of real hope for developing countries. The undeniable progress made in many areas — growth  education  gender equality  and maternal and child health — has largely contributed to pushing back the borders of poverty. Nevertheless  many important challenges have still to be met.At a time when the international community is investing in the creation of a post-2015 development agenda  we must recognize that the results achieved by the Millennium Development Goals have not lived up to our hopes. The eradication of extreme poverty depends on the strengthening of the human development base and the promotion of a competitive economy that respects the environment  which is an engine of inclusive growth and decent work. It also depends on governance that is favourable to sustainable development in the context of peace and security.In this quest  the focus must be on the monitoring  transparency and management of our natural resources. We must join in international partnership on the basis of reaffirmed solidarity and shared responsibility. That must be our new vision. In the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda  we must take into account the synergies arising from the complementarity between the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals. We must also particularly stress South-South and triangular cooperation  and promote innovative financing in order to bridge the gap in official development assistance.In the unanimous resolve to fight marginalization  my delegation remains convinced that Africa’s fight to master its own destiny will be understood. The determination of Heads of State on the continent to adopt a common African position and to create a high-level committee charged with forging regional and intercontinental alliances around the post-2015 development agenda are part of the dynamic to build a better world without conflict and poverty and their corollaries.My country has always believed in the value of multilateralism  the only guarantor of peace  international security and shared development. The United Nations is still the irreplaceable framework for cooperation and the management of world affairs. Guinea  as in the past  will continue to contribute to this lofty fight in order to ensure a better future for humankind. That is why it shares the concerns of the international community and invites it to begin setting the post-2015 stage.We leaders must outline how this new world partnership will work. It is time to draw lessons from the past in order to launch a fruitful dialogue in which all development actors will participate with mutual respect and collective responsibility in the emergence of an international society that is more just  equitable and more unified. There is a need for a new international architecture. The world would do better if all nations  large and small  strong and weak  effectively played their part towards achieving the overall well-being of humankind.The Republic of Guinea will not cease its call for the United Nations system to be reformed and adapted to the needs of the moment. It is a question of equity and justice. Our will is unshakeable and the momentum is irreversible because the aspirations of people who are passionate about peace  freedom and progress are profound. It is high time to listen to the voices of those who do not have a voice — the poorest and most vulnerable. No one should suffer from hunger  fear  illness or the spectre of ignorance. Our duty is to leave to future generations an environment conducive to sustainable development. Together we will save humanity."
"65",2711,"GMB",68,2013,"We praise the almighty Allah for making possible yet again this gathering of world leaders. I would like to congratulate President Ashe on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His impeccable credentials and extensive experience in multilateralism will undoubtedly enrich the debates and proceedings of this session. He has the full support of my delegation. In the same vein  I wish also to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his sterling leadership during the sixty-seventh session. Our special thanks go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his stewardship and for the commitment he has manifested to the welfare of humanity  particularly of the third world.I take this opportunity also to convey our heartfelt condolences to the President  the Government and the people of Kenya  who have suffered one of the most heinous crimes against humanity. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims. This is a clear manifestation of the fact that terrorism in all its forms cannot be accepted. This also has nothing to do with our noble religion  Islam.As we gather for the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly  we must pause and take stock of our collective record in responding to the many different global challenges with which mankind has had to grapple. Our global body  the United Nations  has indeed adopted countless resolutions  which  if implemented to the letter  would have made the world a much better place for the whole of mankind and  indeed  for all other creatures on our planet.Unfortunately  some Member States continue to disregard resolutions necessary for the maintenance of world peace and even question or disregard with impunity resolutions adopted by the Assembly. The United Nations continues to be incapacitated as a result. This certainly calls for an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses  with a view to rendering it more effective. Civil strife and terrorism caused by the negative behaviour of some world Powers are undermining human security and even the viability of States. Poverty  hunger and disease still decimate countless communities  while our capacity to respond to these man-made humanitarian crises remains discriminatory and inadequate.This is demonstrated yet again in the case of Syria. We believe that this Organization was established in the first place to find lasting solutions for peace and the protection of human life. Informed and honest decisions should be made instead of those driven by the interests of a few self-appointed gods  thereby causing irreparable damage to the social fabric and economies of countries in conflict. My Government supports the view that the regional organizations in the Middle East should take the lead in the negotiations towards the resolution of the crisis in Syria. The tragedy unfolding in Syria has become a scar on our conscience as civilized people  and that war must be stopped by any means necessary.All that we hear is the talk about chemical weapons and the need to ensure that they are not used by anyone. This does not make any sense as long as this barbaric war lasts. Whether or not chemical weapons are used  thousands of people will continue to die in the most horrific manner. It is the same horrific and senseless death in both cases  and our duty is not to choose which form of death is acceptable and which not. Our duty is to stop the senseless and barbaric killings in Syria. We  the United Nations  must end that war immediately; otherwise the people of Syria will continue to perish at the hands of satanic and sadistic forces. The Security Council and all the Powers behind the war in Syria must not only prevent the use of chemical weapons but must also bring this brutal war to an immediate end without preconditions. The Syrian war must be stopped and stopped now.The 2013 report on Africa’s performance towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reveals mixed results. Africa’s substantial progress towards many goals  targets and indicators is beyond doubt  but serious challenges still remain  especially in translating economic growth into decent job opportunities  improving service delivery and minimizing income  gender and spatial inequalities. Violent conflicts and economic shocks in some countries  as well as unprecedented natural disasters over the decade induced by climate change  have caused setbacks in the achievement of the MDGs in many countries.Despite such challenges  some African countries  and the Gambia in particular  are making impressive gains towards some of the established goals. My Government is on track to achieve the education MDG target for net enrolment in primary education and literacy rate among the population aged between 15 and 24 years. My Government has made serious and informed policy reviews to prioritize basic primary education  while expanding access to secondary  higher and tertiary education  with an emphasis on improving quality in all areas. We are working diligently to ensure that the gender disparity gap in enrolment is closed by 2014 and to provide free education and an equitable chance for all to be literate by 2015 and beyond.We must ensure that the post-2015 development agenda builds on the important progress of the MDGs and is expanded to cover broader sustainable development issues  as agreed in Rio. Therefore  the choice of the theme for this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is indeed apt  timely and thought-provoking. Clear  time-bound  targeted and measurable global benchmarks are crucial if we are to realize our desired objective.Protecting African livelihoods requires international  regional and country approaches that recognize and act on the overlap of conflicts orchestrated by foreign Powers and severe weather hazards. The Gambia firmly believes that mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and putting an immediate end to the massive looting of African natural resources by Western multinational companies call for a timely and decisive global response. It is a challenge that should unite us  not divide us. The Gambia is of the firm opinion that Africa should play an active role in shaping the goals based on its own development priorities and common interests.The greatest threats to human existence are basically three and are a consequence of human behaviours which are ungodly attributes. They are: excessive greed  and therefore addiction to accumulating material wealth by any means  mostly through violent or immoral schemes; an obsession with world domination by any means  including the resolve to use nuclear  biological and chemical weapons to achieve that fanciful dream; and homosexuality in all its forms and manifestations  which  though very evil  anti-human and anti-Allah  is being promoted as a human right by some Powers.None of the three threats  which are more deadly than all natural disasters put together  has anything to do with climate change. The first led not only to colonization and the plundering of African and Asian human and material resources but also to two devastating wars among the Western Powers  which were unfortunately wrongly termed “world” wars. Colonialism was maintained by subjugation and massive looting of resources in the colonies  leading to the impoverishment and destitution of hundreds of millions of colonial subjects.From the thirteenth century until the middle part of the twentieth century  the notions of human rights  good governance and democracy were philosophies forbidden to Africans. Any African under a colonial Government who advocated for them ended up either at the gallows  in a mass grave or rotting in colonialist-built dungeons called prisons. This was during the colonial era  when the African continent was treated like an abandoned game park and Africans were treated worse than animals.Today  after fighting for our freedom and liberating our continent  we are being prescribed a new religion — democracy  human rights and good governance — by descendants of the same colonial Powers. Present-day Africans cannot be hoodwinked by anyone  any more  and we are determined to defend our independence and dignity  and to take control of our own natural resources at any cost and by any means necessary.In regard to the second threat  the obsession with world domination  we are seeing the unprecedented development of deadly nuclear  biological and chemical weapons  as well as other weapons of mass murder  by the same Powers. We all agree that all forms of human tragedy and catastrophe emanate from the West. They have spent more money on killer technologies than on medical and agricultural technology up to today. If they unleash a third world war  God forbid  that would put an end to human existence on planet Earth  including the United Nations itself.As for the third threat  we know for a fact that all living things need to reproduce for posterity. They become extinct when they can no longer reproduce. Therefore  the Assembly will all agree with me that any person promoting the end of human reproduction must be promoting human extinction. Could it be called promoting human rights when one advocates for a definitive end to human reproduction and procreation? Those who promote homosexuality want to put an end to human existence. It is becoming an epidemic  and we Muslims and Africans will fight against such behaviour in our countries. We will never accept it. We want a brighter future for humankind and the continued existence of humankind on the planet; therefore  we will never tolerate any agenda that clearly calls for human extinction.Peace and security are inextricably linked to development. The Gambia continues to abide by and live by that principle  which has warranted my Government’s relentless commitment to peace initiatives under the auspices of the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States  one of which successfully culminated in a democratically elected Government in Mali a few weeks ago. I seize the opportunity  therefore  to congratulate the brotherly people of Mali for giving peace a chance by electing a Government through democratic means.With more concerted efforts through consultations and dialogue  we shall also soon witness a lasting solution to the political impasse in Guinea-Bissau. I am also happy with the work currently being undertaken by the African Union High-Level Panel for Egypt  which seeks to achieve an inclusive and peaceful transition through dialogue  compromise  reconciliation and tolerance. My Government will continue to use its membership in the Peace and Security Council of the African Union to propose peaceful measures that will facilitate enhanced engagements aimed at achieving the desired results in our common quest for lasting stability in the African continent.However  the present trends across the world cast serious doubts about the effectiveness of the conflict -prevention and management mechanisms adopted by regional organizations and  most importantly  the United Nations. Instead of acting as an effective mechanism for conflict prevention and resolution  as well as advancing global security  the Security Council has become a barrier to progress  peace and security in some instances where lopsided decisions can only be classified as racist and misguided and therefore unacceptable.Africa’s legitimate quest for full representation on the Security Council continues to be a strong warning that needs to be urgently heeded. International peace and security are the business of all  and Africa  a continent whose resources  ranging from material to human  have helped to bail the West out of poverty to reach affluence from the thirteenth century up until today  cannot be expected to continue to play second fiddle in the Security Council or in any international organization from now on. The Gambia remains resolute in its stance that the permanent and non-permanent membership categories of the Security Council should be equitably distributed regionally and expanded to conform to current geopolitical realities. The Gambia stands by Africa’s demand for two permanent seats as well as two non-permanent seats  as clearly articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.How long will the international community continue to ignore the legitimate right and aspirations of a continent of 53 States  all members of the General Assembly? The calls have been very loud and very clear  but some Western Powers continue to ignore them. That must end  or the Assembly will see a very dignified  determined and independent Africa assert its legitimate rights worldwide in its own way.My delegation strongly condemns the application of unilateral and degrading coercive measures as a means of settling disputes. Such measures have an adverse impact on the lives of innocent people  who lack any means of defending their legitimate sovereignty in the face of massive military might. We find the continued application of such measures against the peace-loving people of Cuba to be inhumane and unjust and a blatant violation of the basic human rights tenets of the Charter of the United Nations  which  ironically  were promulgated to prevent such behaviour in the first place.It is in that spirit that the Gambia shares the views expressed by the international community in its continued unequivocal opposition to the United States of America’s sanctions against Cuba. The embargo against Cuba contravenes the fundamental principles of international law  international humanitarian law  the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States  violating the sovereign equality of States and the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other Member States. The embargo has no legitimate or moral justification  given the fact that it continues to undermine the fundamental basic rights to economic emancipation and the development aspirations of the Cuban people. As a responsible member of the international community  the Gambia therefore joins other Member States in calling for the immediate repeal of laws  measures or policies that impede the free flow of international trade and navigation against Cuba.We also reiterate our call for a serious and decisive reassessment of our policy towards the Republic of China on Taiwan. The concerns of the 23 million hard-working and peace-loving people of that great country continue to be ignored. The Republic of China on Taiwan has a democratically elected Government  which is the only legitimate Government that defends the interests of the people of Taiwan in the conduct of world affairs and in its many serious interactions with each and every nation of the world. The Taiwanese people have the same concerns as all of us with regard to global problems. Yet they are not a member of the vital organs of the global body to contribute their share in the search for solutions to those problems.The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains pathetic as a result of decades of collective punishment  fraught with the glaringly degrading and inhumane treatment of innocent civilians and the gross denial of access to humanitarian assistance and basic services  and essential medical supplies and construction materials  which has become the daily rule rather than the exception for the Palestinians. The pattern and frequency of those human rights abuses  as well as the disproportionate use of force perpetrated by the occupying Power  continues unabated.The Gambia is of the conviction that the ongoing seizure of Palestinian lands and properties to make way for illegal settlement activity is morally and politically unacceptable. Such uncalled-for behaviour on the part of Israel is in blatant disregard for international law and casts serious doubt on Israel’s intention to seek genuine and lasting peace with its brothers and sisters  the Palestinian people. How can the international community and the United Nations continue to watch such glaring injustice and protracted human rights abuses in silence  without feeling an iota of guilt for not taking bold and appropriate steps to bring them to an end? How long should we allow such blatant disregard for international law to continue unpunished?While we welcome the resumption of peace talks between Israel and Palestine  we hope that this time around the brokers will be decent and honest enough to ensure that both sides are genuinely committed to a two-State solution that would eventually usher in permanent peace and security in the Middle East and beyond.We live in a world of new and evolving threats — threats that could not have been anticipated when the United Nations was founded in 1945. Unilateral bullying and the criminal invasion of resource-endowed sovereign States under the pretext of strengthening democratization  combined with terrorism  organized crime  poverty and disease  will remain a serious threat to global peace and security unless appropriate steps are taken to eradicate them. Meeting such challenges today calls for sincerity and honesty to mount well-coordinated and concerted global efforts.The Gambia firmly believes that socioeconomic development and respect for the sovereign rights of countries to control their own natural resources  especially minerals  should be the collective line of defence for a collective global security system that takes the sovereignty of each nation seriously. Combating poverty will not only save millions of lives but also strengthen States’ capacities to combat terrorism  organized crime and intra-State conflict. We need renewed and genuine global partnerships and commitments that are binding and based on respect for the sovereign right of each individual State to choose a way of life that is based on its religious and cultural values  as no administrative system is better than the way prescribed by the almighty Allah.It is also necessary to increase the credibility and effectiveness of the Security Council by making sure that selective justice is abandoned and rejected by all Members of the United Nations family. From all indications  there is an imperative need to inject new ideas and impetus into the Security Council and to expand its membership to reflect current geopolitical realities. Moreover  respect for the principle of equal sovereign rights of peoples and the need to promote and respect peaceful relations among all States  rich or poor  black or white  should be the overriding considerations for the peaceful coexistence of Member States — that is  if 2015 and beyond is to bequeath a peaceful and prosperous world to future generations of the human race."
"66",2750,"GNB",68,2013,"I would like to begin my statement by congratulating Ambassador John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I would also like to extend our congratulations to his country  Antigua and Barbuda  which is honoured by the selection of one of its sons to preside this year over the most representative world institution. The President carries on his shoulders the responsibility for guiding the work of the current session of the General Assembly at a time that all consider to be politically very critical for the international community. Indeed  the reality that the international community faces today is that of a world troubled by dangerous global geopolitical tensions and an international financial and economic crisis that is deeper and wider than any we have seen since the 1930s. The intensity of the crisis has thrown millions of people onto the unemployment rolls and created millions of new poor throughout the world. There are new fears  new dangers and new threats around the world — from transnational terrorism to arms and drug trafficking as well as frightening interfaith tensions that often result in bloodshed. Other dangers include the return of brutal  old-style piracy to the modern age  not only off the coast of Somalia but also in the Gulf of Guinea  threatening important routes through which oil is transported to fuel the world economy  creating insecurity for the international merchant marine and facilitating illicit fishing and all manner of illegal maritime trafficking in arms  human beings and psychotropic substances; persistent outbreaks of ethnic violence that cause enormous human suffering; and unimaginable humanitarian disasters in various areas.I come from a small country on the westernmost tip of the African coast. We are a poor country  but we have not lost the hope of achieving  in peace  the progress to which we are entitled. Two days ago we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of our national independence  so this is a good time for us to reaffirm the following: during the entire period of armed struggle for national liberation  the people that I represent believed in the United Nations and in international law  and my country today reiterates  maintains and further reinforces that belief.We achieved national independence in 1973. It was not given to us by anybody but became possible only as a result of the international solidarity of some and  ultimately  the recognition of all. To all without exception  I wish  on behalf of Guinea-Bissau  to express our feeling of eternal gratitude  to declare our firm desire to strengthen longstanding ties of friendship and to affirm our willingness  despite all that has transpired  to rebuild the foundations of solidarity that united our peoples in the past.From this rostrum I ask for the Assembly’s patience and understanding and hope for its solidarity. I believe that expressions of generosity are in no way inconsistent with the cold rationality of relations among sovereign States. I am the Interim President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  and that title  as the Assembly is well aware  indicates something particular and exceptional.Indeed  the political and military events of 12 April 2012 created a new political environment in my country. A military coup had ousted the interim President of the Republic and a self-suspended Prime Minister who had launched an inconclusive campaign to run for the presidency. Faced with that situation  we wondered what to do.Fortunately  the best option available at the time  in our opinion  ultimately prevailed. We were able to avoid political problems that  had they taken hold  could have thrown the country into a political and military tailspin with consequences that would have been unpredictable and certainly much graver than those we nonetheless had to face and  in some ways  continue to face.We therefore had to circumscribe the dynamics of the military coup  control its political effects and limit its institutional reach  and  as if that were not enough  we had to deal with two opposing positions that emerged both internally and abroad.One of them was deeply detrimental to the peaceful return to constitutional normality in my country  but the other was much more realistic and thus more promising in terms of the gradual re-establishment of constitutional order. We had to deal with the first so-called position  which was both curious and dramatic. That position was taken by people who would have preferred to see the worst possible situation in Guinea-Bissau. Why? They were betting on the degradation of the political situation in my country in order to justify their views  confirm their predictions and operationalize their political concepts of how to resolve the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Indeed  they made every attempt to apply the formula of “the worse for Guinea-Bissau  the better” — the better to serve their own interests. With such a radical position  they were truly able to touch the deepest sensibilities of a people that is humble but refuses to be humiliated.We are a true democracy  notwithstanding all our flaws  the violations of the democratic purpose of the State and the many detours taken. We are the first to recognize that. But we must not forget that we are  first  a State born out of centuries of pain and hope and of a hard and victorious struggle for national independence  which has had a strong influence on the determination of the political values to be defended.In order to enable the second option on the table to go forward  we were able to rely on the realism and prompt solidarity of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). With the important support of the Security Council  ECOWAS became solely responsible for managing the agreed transition period and created a reduced stabilization military mission that became known as the ECOWAS Mission in Guinea-Bissau.At the political and institutional levels  the parliament elected by the people of Guinea-Bissau — the National People’s Assembly — remained standing and thus was able to provide the political transition with a legitimate and legitimizing institutional basis. In fact  the Constitution of the Republic was never suspended.That is the origin of the office of the Interim President of the Republic. It did not come from a military coup. It came  rather  from an elected Parliament and therefore from a political and institutional process. That makes all the difference.I combined the position of Member of Parliament  elected to the position four times in a row  with that of First Vice-President of that body of sovereignty: in other words  all modesty aside  I am a democrat with a mature conviction and never carried out a coup d’état or ordered any such action.Indeed  with the inauguration of the Interim President of the Republic  the political transition process per se began. After some time  Parliament approved the revised transition pact and the corresponding political agreement. Later on it approved the programme and general budget for the State  submitted by a Government with a broad political base  which I  as Interim President of the Republic  had appointed and installed by presidential decree.With those steps  the political transition truly took off. I have signed a presidential decree setting 24 November as the date for the legislative and presidential elections. What remains  which is no small task  is to ensure the availability of funds to carry out an effective  transparent and unquestionable electoral process. To that end  we must create reliable voter registries  something that can be accomplished only through an accurate census or voter registration process. That is where the political transition in Guinea-Bissau stands.Guinea-Bissau is the victim of two dramatically interlinked evils: poverty and political instability. In a society such as that of my country  poverty creates a propensity for political instability. In turn  political instability has an impact on the economic order  reduces the rate of growth and thus increases the poverty rate. The challenge ahead consists precisely of escaping the two traps of poverty and political instability. Overcoming this challenge obviously goes well beyond the goals for this exceptional period of political transition. Therefore  in that regard  we will not go into further detail. In the light of this enormous economic and political liability  which has yet to be resolved  achieving the Millennium Development Goals within a given time frame is truly beyond our means  for the foreseeable future at least. But this recognition does not mean that the Government  civil society and Guinea-Bissau’s bilateral and multilateral development partners in general  including United Nations specialized agencies  have given up on the effort. On the contrary  in education  health  gender-equality policies  the fight against poverty  environmental policies for sustainable development  and other areas  our country has made progress  though moderate and below satisfactory levels.With respect to the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  Guinea-Bissau will make every effort to carry out the commitments undertaken. We hope that the more developed countries  our partners  will do their part in the fight against poverty  one of the greatest scourges afflicting States such as Guinea-Bissau  which are very fragile and therefore very vulnerable  and still suffering from the grave consequences of armed conflict.Guinea-Bissau supports the establishment on 24 September of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. It replaces the Commission on Sustainable Development and will develop the United Nations post-2015 development agenda. As a country of many islands  Guinea-Bissau welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  in Samoa  in September 2014.We take this opportunity to thank the United Nations  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in particular  for their dedication to our country and for appointing former President of Timor-Leste José Ramos-Horta as United Nations Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau. Mr. Ramos-Horta has made excellent contributions to the political normalization of our country. The State of Guinea-Bissau is not oblivious to the evolution of the international political environment. Guinea-Bissau has never been indifferent to the hopes and suffering of people all over the world. In that regard  we stand firm in solidarity with our brothers in ECOWAS. We wish the people of Mali the best of luck. Mali has just demonstrated its immense maturity by going to the polls during recent general elections with civic pride  marking the end of a period of political transition. That also sent a strong starting signal for national reconciliation and efforts to rebuild the country  which was destroyed by acts of terrorism and unacceptable irredentism. We take this opportunity to congratulate France on its crucial role in safeguarding the integrity of Malian territory  which is the foundation of the country’s sovereignty.We repudiate the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Nigeria and Kenya  spurred by radicalism in the name of religious intolerance. We offer our full support to the sister nations of Nigeria and Kenya  Presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Uhuru Kenyatta  their Governments and the families of all the victims. We hope that neighbouring Guinea undergoes a successful electoral process  paving the path for true national reconciliation in that country. In Egypt and Syria  which has been ravaged by war  we hope that dialogue and diplomacy prevail over force  so that we can avoid sacrificing more human lives. In the Middle East  we continue to defend the Palestinian cause with as much conviction as ever. It is crucial for the Palestinian people in particular  and for political stability and peacebuilding in the Arab world in general  that negotiations between the Palestinian authorities and the State of Israel advance towards the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.As to Europe  we offer a special word of recognition to France  which has never abandoned us and continues very actively to seek better ways of helping Guinea-Bissau overcome a political crisis. We also thank the Kingdom of Spain  whose Ambassador to the United Nations has been instrumental in efforts towards political normalization. Our friend Timor-Leste  a small country within the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP)  has exhibited an admirable spirit of cooperation with Guinea-Bissau  demonstrating that friends do come through in the most difficult of times. The Timorese authorities have understood the very simple fact that supporting an institutional process of political normalization is not the same as supporting a coup d’état. It is  indeed  quite the contrary. We very much thank President Armando Guebuza  current President of the CPLP  for his fair assessment of the political process in Guinea-Bissau  for his encouragement and for appealing to the international community to provide financial support for general elections in Guinea-Bissau. We also take this opportunity to congratulate Murade Murargy  a Mozambican national who currently serves as the Executive Secretary of CPLP  for his dedication to the political normalization process in our country. We hope one day  and perhaps one day soon  to see a full normalization of our relations with the countries of the CPLP  which is in the interests of all our peoples and sovereign States. With respect to Cuba  we call  as we have always done  for an end to the decades-long embargo and for the advancement of the reforms under way in that friendly nation  with which we have so many and such deep ties of friendship and solidarity.With respect to Asia  we wish to express our profound gratitude to the People’s Republic of China for the extent and intensity of its cooperation with our country. The fruits of this cooperation  particularly in the construction of key public buildings  will enter history as indelible symbols of a friendship that dates back to our armed struggle for national liberation. We express the profound gratitude of the people of Guinea-Bissau to Mr. Alassane Ouattara  President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and current President of ECOWAS  and to Mr. Goodluck Jonathan  President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and President of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau  as well as to all the Heads of State and Government of the member countries of ECOWAS."
"67",2790,"GNQ",68,2013,"We bring to this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly the fraternal and friendly greetings of the people of Equatorial Guinea. We also bring our fervent desire for peace and prosperity for all countries in the world at this difficult time  when the international community has to deal with major challenges that are thwarting the aspirations of the peoples for well-being and happiness.May I also extend my congratulations to Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at this session. We wish him all the very best and every success in his difficult task  and we assure him of our support and cooperation. We would also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for the excellent work he carried out and the dynamic style with which he presided over the work of the Assembly at its previous session.This sixty-eighth session is beginning its work on a tragic note  namely  the criminal and barbaric attack against innocent people in Kenya. It was an attack on a supermarket  a mall  which is a peaceful gathering place for people  which reflects the criminality of the perpetrators. Equatorial Guinea strongly condemns the heinous attack against the freedom and dignity of the Kenyan people  which also retards its national development and violates its freedoms. I convey our condolences and a feeling of solidarity to the Government of Kenya and the families of the victims. We also call on the United Nations to take severe measures against crimes of that nature.Although the international community has become increasingly conscious of the importance of peace  we still see  unfortunately  that the United Nations has not yet achieved its main objectives  namely  a peaceful and developed world  one ensuring the dignity and well-being of all peoples in the world. Thus  despite the major efforts that have been made over the past 68 years  peace is still as yet an unrealized dream in many parts of the world. The sovereign equality of all States can be seen only in declarations of principles. Economic and social development has not yet been achieved by most States  and the principles of cooperation for mutual benefit are being undermined in international relations.At the same time  in addition to that disturbing situation  we see an increase in natural disasters  wars  terrorism and acts of violence  which take human lives and force large groups of populations from their homes. Hunger haunts almost three quarters of the world’s population  and there are still major endemic diseases that cause many deaths in less developed countries: they affect in particular the most vulnerable segments of society.Against the backdrop of that difficult political  economic and sociocultural situation around the world  Equatorial Guinea would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary-General to preserve the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to seek to achieve the goals set forth therein. However  the almost incomprehensible ideological tenor of relations among States creates almost a kind of cold war between those that proclaim themselves moral authorities and a majority that want freedom of action to determine the futures of their peoples.As far as the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is concerned  questions of the peace and security of States should be given full priority and consideration by the United Nations  since without peace  there can be no development  and without development it would be difficult to ensure human beings’ dignity  integrity and freedom. For that reason  we firmly support the principle of the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiation  mediation and arbitration. In that connection  we would like to commend and acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Tomislav Nikoli.  President of the Republic of Serbia  for presiding over the special session of the General Assembly held in April of this year on the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.Equatorial Guinea’s political  economic and sociocultural situation is positive and encouraging  because our country enjoys productive peace and stability and harmonious political development and is consolidating a genuine national democracy. All of that has allowed us to carry out significant infrastructure work  enabling the people to participate directly in the country’s overall growth. The Government  together with all the political institutions  is carrying out major political reforms  thanks to the agreements reached in the binding national political pact  which was signed with all the country’s political groups and which establishes standards for the political conduct of all stakeholders and their participation in public affairs administration. Happily  the people of Equatorial Guinea are aware of the changes in the areas benefiting them  and they recognize and support them.At the international level  we are very concerned about the negative effects of the so-called humanitarian interference from the United Nations  which  far from ensuring the human rights and well-being of the peoples affected  is more focused on imposing political systems and democracy based on unacknowledged interests. That interference is being carried out in total disregard of the sacred principles of national sovereignty and the dignity of peoples. Democracy is indeed the ultimate expression of natural law; it is also an act of the people’s sovereign will. We have never seen any country in the world accept democracy when it was imposed on it. And why has it now become the excuse for intervening through force in conflicts within self-governing countries? That represents a provocation against our peoples  who are being deceived in the name of democracy  while the fundamental attributes of independence and national sovereignty are disregarded  provoking civil disorder  which leads to loss of life  social divisiveness and the destruction of basic infrastructure  which is difficult to rebuild. We see  therefore  that everything is easily traced to the neocolonialist activities of certain parties that wish to recover the resources that nature reserved for our countries.Equatorial Guinea understands and agrees that security and development are an essential whole  and we affirm that peace and security  development and human rights are intrinsically bound together  which is why we disagree with the argument that indiscriminate destruction can be planned in order to then introduce reconstruction and reconciliation at somebody else’s expense. In that belief and in the face of such hidden and complex plans  I am pleased to declare before this world forum that Equatorial Guinea and its Government are willing to host the next session of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa  at a suitable date to be agreed on by the parties.Uncoordinated actions such as those I mentioned  which worsen global insecurity  are being carried out today  while the United Nations — whose role as arbiter and conciliator is being openly flouted by special interests — looks on  powerless. Let us be honest with ourselves  because democracy  as a just and equitable system  should prevail in all the organs of the United Nations system  the epicentre of the international community  aspiring to peace  order and development. We therefore have no alternative but to reform those organs  particularly the Security Council  in order to make them more democratic  so that they can protect the interests of every nation impartially.Within the framework of efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals  the level of basic infrastructure that has been created and the policy of promoting social institutions in Equatorial Guinea have resulted in a drop in the number of cases of malaria and in infant and maternal morbidity and mortality; in lower illiteracy rates; better technical and professional training; the increased empowerment of women; the gradual integration of persons with disabilities and a rise in the well-being of the people. Equatorial Guinea is contributing and collaborating actively with its North American partners  Noble Energy  Marathon and Sanaria  with a view to completely eliminating malaria through the development of a vaccine that will be ready for official use in 2017.In order to work towards the main objective of the theme for this session  which is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  Equatorial Guinea has adopted a development programme aimed at reaching the goals of an emerging country by 2020  which is now our priority. We therefore believe that Equatorial Guinea should move up gradually from its status as a least-developed country in order to achieve that new rank in 2020.While that is the central theme of this session  to which we all must give our support  we also note that the attention of the General Assembly should be focused on the normalization of relations among States  not only by adopting appropriate standards  but even more by ensuring that our States apply them.While the African continent and other developing countries strive to move towards sustainable development  they are unfortunately diverted from their efforts and forced to address man-made conflicts that are fuelled by the surreal approaches to freedom  democracy and respect for human rights in Africa that certain Powers are promoting. We are not convinced that the United Nations has adopted a particular model of democracy that is applicable to all States. Africa is more in need of special attention from the international community to ensure its security  since it is now a breeding ground for terrorist operations  mercenaries  pirates and organized crime  due to the fragility of its structures.The United Nations should not cling to methods and practices that do not resolve conflict or meet the desires of the people — or even worse  are a burden for them. We are referring here to the use of force and embargoes  which always inflict great suffering on the affected peoples and deprive them of their most basic rights. That was not the purpose for which the United Nations was established. We therefore call for the lifting of the embargoes imposed on the Republic of Cuba and the Republic of Zimbabwe  as they harm the lives of their peoples.With respect to armed conflict  the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians has demonstrated the inability of the United Nations to impose solutions during armed hostilities. However  we believe that politically influential countries of the Middle East can and should play a prominent role as arbitrators and mediators between the parties to the conflict. The solutions have already been laid out by the United Nations  and all that is needed is to implement them by ensuring respect for the limits set in 1967  because both countries must coexist and need clearly defined borders.Regarding the situation in Syria  we regret and condemn the use of chemical weapons and the escalation of violence fuelled by opaque interests that are decimating a people because of alleged internal problems. Wars have always bequeathed a negative balance  and their victims tend to always be innocent people. That is why we ask for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the countries involved in the conflict  in order to honour and respect the Syrian people and fulfil the United Nations responsibility to maintain peace and security around the world. The only interventions should be pacification and the destruction of chemical weapons  which the United Nations must demand of the Syrian Government.Repetition implies concern  and indeed  in its creation and in the framework of its Charter  the United Nations is seriously committed to maintaining peace and security in the world. It is also committed to promoting economic development  moral  human and material welfare  and relations of friendship  trust and cooperation among nations. But far from achieving these goals  we continue to experience the horrors of war on a daily basis  and to allow people to go hungry and nations to continue to live with the threat of instability and espionage.It is high time for us to stop this global misery in its tracks and look to our past while moving forward in a spirit of solidarity to forge a world that fulfils the hopes of humankind for well-being and happiness."
"68",2836,"GRC",68,2013,"I congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I convey my deep gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his work to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations  fully supporting the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.I take this opportunity to emphasize my country’s alignment with the positions of the European Union  presented by the President of the European Council  Mr. Herman Van Rompuy  in his address (see A/68/PV.8).Greece remains fully committed to the objectives of the United Nations  whose universal ideals have never ceased to inspire us. We are deeply committed to our collective work for sustainable peace  prosperity and safeguarding human dignity. In that spirit  we lend our full support to the efforts to reform and strengthen the Organization in order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.We welcome the special event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the High-Level Political Forum that took place this week and highlighted the broad themes of international development and cooperation. The effective management of migration can have a positive impact on the countries of origin and of destination. The High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development to be held on 3 and 4 October presents an important opportunity to develop a global agenda for the effective and inclusive management of migration and to reaffirm the necessary political will. Greece is committed to participating actively in joint efforts to that end.Greece and the other countries of southern Europe are under great pressure with regard to the issue of illegal immigration  which weighs heavily on our financial and administrative capacities. The effective management of migration represents for our country a key political option in that it relates directly to safeguarding and respecting human rights  social cohesion and public security  and to maintaining the economic stability of our countries. On the basis of our experience of recent years  we have reviewed our national action plan to reform the system of asylum and immigration. Furthermore  migration and mobility issues will be among the priorities of the Greek presidency of the European Council in the first term of 2014.The promotion of human rights is a priority interest. Greece will lend its full support to strengthening the Human Rights Council with a solid mandate. Greece is determined to contribute actively to the mission of the Human Rights Council and is presenting its candidature for the 2017–2019 term. Greece is strongly devoted to the decisive role of the United Nations in peace and security. In spite of financial restraints  we remain firmly committed to peacekeeping operations  to which we contribute personnel and resources  including to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We support efforts to prevent conflicts and promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. Moreover  we attach particular importance to cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations in the field of crisis management  and we welcome the work undertaken to further strengthen that cooperation.(spoke in English) The relaunching of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority  facilitated by the United States  provides an important opportunity to reach a final settlement to this long-standing problem  to the benefit and stability in the wider region  based on a two-State solution with a secure Israel and a sovereign  contiguous and viable Palestine living side by side. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas must be praised for their leadership and courage to engage in the peace talks. Now is the time to take bold and concrete steps towards peace.Greece is very concerned with the ongoing crisis in Syria  which jeopardizes stability in a very fragile region. Greece and the European Union have unequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons  and we strongly support the United States-Russian Federation initiative for the collection and destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal. We welcome the diplomatic breakthrough expected to be achieved by the Security Council on the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. It is our fervent hope that it will be a crucial turning point in the Syrian crisis  providing vital momentum towards a “Geneva II”-type process that can take us to a viable and inclusive political resolution of the Syrian crisis.Greece has always been a firm supporter of a European future for the Balkan region. The process of European integration means leaving behind old  divisive mentalities and moving towards an era of close cooperation  on the basis of shared values and principles. Demonstrating political courage  Belgrade and Pristina concluded an historic agreement in April  which is a major development towards consolidating peace and stability in the Western Balkans and advancing the European integration of both sides.We seek to develop our relations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and within the framework of good neighbourly relations. Greece is committed to the ongoing United Nations-led negotiation process and to finding a solution on the issue of a name. We therefore continue our efforts to reach a mutually acceptable name for all uses  erga omnes  that will leave no grey areas and allow for a clear distinction between our neighbouring country and the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. The solution of the name issue will enable both Greece and its neighbour to develop multidimensional and productive cooperation at the bilateral and regional levels. It will also contribute to the stability and prosperity of South-East Europe and boost the country’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.Thirty-nine years after the Turkish military invasion of the island  the Cyprus problem remains first and foremost an issue of illegal military occupation of well over one third of the territory of a Member State of the United Nations and European Union. A comprehensive agreed settlement of that major international problem is a top priority for the foreign policy of Greece. In that context  Greece greatly values the Secretary-General’s mission of good offices  in particular his ongoing efforts to successfully relaunch the intercommunal negotiating process. We also fully support President Anastasiadis’ renewed constructive package proposal.We hope that Ankara will decide at long last to pursue a new policy of normalization of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. Such a Turkish policy would decisively facilitate the relaunching of intercommunal negotiations on a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue within the framework of the relevant Security Council resolutions  in line with the acquis communautaire and approved by the Cypriot people through a referendum. The new developments in the energy sector regarding the exploitation of hydrocarbons can serve as a factor for development  peace and stability throughout the region.Relations with our neighbour Turkey are set on a positive course. Institutionalized cooperation at the highest governmental level  as well as increasing tourism and economic cooperation  can create further potential for the future. Nevertheless  critical factors needed to promote substantial and promising prospects for our relationship with our eastern neighbour are full respect for international law and international legality and  within this framework  a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue.The Greek people have succeeded in restoring the country’s credibility. Greece has already achieved the highest structural primary surplus in the Eurozone — 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Greece has achieved a peacetime historical first — a fiscal adjustment of 19 per cent of gross domestic product in the four years from 2009 to 2013. We have done so in spite of six years of recession. We have carried out necessary structural reforms in public administration  the investment sector and the labour market  and our privatization programme is already yielding results. But all of that has  of course  come through great sacrifices borne by the Greek people and at a very high social and political cost. Defending democracy and the rule of law against forms of racist  xenophobic conduct and all forms of social violence is a fundamental engagement of the Hellenic Republic.I also wish to say a few words about the priorities of Greece’s upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2014. Coming at a time of unprecedented economic challenges for the Union  our presidency will carry forward the vital debate on the future of Europe — a debate that will intensify as we approach next year’s European elections.All the issues that humankind is facing and that are being dealt with by General Assembly at this session highlight the need to enhance the role of the United Nations and to further consolidate the institutions of global economic and political governance. The hopes of the international community are oriented towards the United Nations. Our Organization has to send a strong and clear message of peace  security and prosperity to the peoples of the world  particularly the younger generation."
"69",2877,"GRD",68,2013,"I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. The fact that you were elected by consensus speaks in unequivocal terms of the high esteem in which you are held by your colleagues and the respect that you command in this forum. I am confident that your vast practical experience at the multilateral level will serve you in good stead as you guide this session to a fruitful outcome. In the same breath  I pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his astute stewardship at the previous session.Allow me to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of Kenya  while condemning in the strongest terms the cowardly acts of terrorism that were seen last week.I thank you  Sir  for selecting as the theme for this session “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  which  in my delegation’s view  embodies the fundamental concerns of all countries  but will find particular resonance with small island developing States (SIDS) like Grenada. This is an area where the multilateral system must demonstrate its effectiveness not only to improve the lives of ordinary citizens but also to maintain confidence in our multilateral institutions. We look forward to key performance indicators linked to tangible outcomes  rather than more analysis and more reports.Grenada endorses the call made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development for the future we want. In that context  we must build on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals and Agenda 21. Indeed  for a post-2015 development agenda we welcome a framework that goes beyond gross domestic product and recognizes the assets of natural capital. Grenada encourages the international financial institutions to go even further by also recognizing the liabilities associated with natural disasters caused by climate change. Those liabilities underscore the need to reassess the basis on which small island developing States are graduated to middle-income status  thereby losing access to concessionary funding that is sorely needed.The unilateral graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status is premature. I therefore reiterate the call made in Agenda 21 for a more holistic and comprehensive set of indicators for classifying States. Grenada endorses support for low-income and fragile economies. Moreover  it is clear that several of the SIDS newly promoted to middle-income status continue to struggle with high debt burdens  which are worsened by climate change and high fossil-fuel import bills. Many SIDS also struggle with low productivity and low levels of competitiveness and with severe financial constraints  and  in some cases  they struggle with limited prospects for immediate growth.The point is that per capita income used as a sole measure without the context of climate vulnerability does more harm than good. To illustrate that point  as damaging as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina were to the United States economy  the costs ran between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the gross domestic product of the United States. That is in sharp contrast to the costs of between 20 per cent and 200 per cent of gross domestic product when hurricanes hit island economies.Therefore  Grenada is joining with other SIDS in urging the shareholders  the donors and the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to translate the recognition of climate vulnerability in small island States into a meaningful package of financial and official development assistance for SIDS.The issue of the graduation of SIDS is an issue that has been raised year after year. Let us return to the General Assembly next year confident that progress on that matter has been made. In that regard  we wish to suggest for consideration during your presidency  Sir  a call for a substantive paper and a debate on the issue. Ideally  the outcomes of that debate should be provided as an input towards the 2014 third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be hosted by Samoa  and as an input to the Secretary-General’s debate on climate change scheduled for September 2014.Also contributing to the indebtedness and fiscal unsustainability of small island States are the volatility and high prices for fossil fuels. On average  small island developing States are paying between 20 cents and 40 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity  some as high as $1. That contrasts with prices of 5 cents to 15 cents in developed countries. We welcome  therefore  the initiative of the Alliance of Small Island States in establishing the SIDS DOCK Support Programme. We also wish to express gratitude to the donors and institutions for helping to facilitate that programme.In addition  the Government of Grenada is taking major steps towards creating a green economy. One of the priorities for Grenada’s Prime Minister  The Right Honourable Keith Mitchell  is the dismantling of a monopoly that is contributing to high energy costs on the island of Grenada. The Government is seeking partners to help create a level playing field  which will allow many more private-sector players to have a role in innovative and substantive power-generation solutions  while positioning Grenada as an exemplar for a sustainable planet.Mr. President  as you have chosen the theme of sustainability for the sixty-eighth session  so too has the Government of Grenada chosen sustainable development as the organizing theme for the development of our island and for our engagement with international partners. Grenada is a party to more than 40 multilateral environmental agreements. The push to harmonize local laws with those international instruments is testament to Grenada’s commitment to that agenda. The reasons are clear  the causes of climate change and the impacts of climate change are negatively affecting Grenada’s ability to fulfil its social contract with its people  including its ability to fully deliver on the Millennium Development Goals.So far I have spoken only about economic sustainability and environmental sustainability. The third pillar of sustainable development relates to social sustainability. Grenada is a society in which social development is given equal weighting with the importance of investment and economic growth driven by the private sector. On 13 May  a mere three months after assuming office  my Government ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We are proceeding apace to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  thus demonstrating that Grenada is committed to the removal of all forms of discrimination.Grenada associates itself with efforts to dedicate the Caribbean region to the development of humanity. We also acknowledge that through the ages the Arab world has contributed enormously to the world of science and mathematics  including the very numerals we use today. We see a modern Arab world taking positive steps to take the lead in developing breakthroughs on the key issues that confront our planet. We very much welcome initiatives such as Masdar City and the hosting of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the United Arab Emirates. The role of Qatar in hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference is also noteworthy. Grenada joins with other countries in seeking to deepen our relationship with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and places a high degree of importance on the peace and security of the region.We are mindful that the region and the entire United Nations system have been seized of the issues of peace and security during United Nations Week. Grenada and many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are home to a vibrant and entrepreneurial diaspora from the Middle East  including people from Syria and Lebanon. As a consequence  Grenadian citizens are very concerned about the prospects for peace in Syria and the wider Middle East.Grenada condemns  in the most vehement terms  atrocities and crimes against humanity. We therefore believe that those responsible for the recent deadly use of chemical weapons in Syria must be held accountable by the international community. Moreover  Grenada welcomes Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  on destroying Syria’s chemical weapons  and is encouraged by the commitment of the Syrian Government to comply with that resolution. More importantly  my delegation hopes that that breakthrough could be a stepping stone to the resolution of the already brutal and bloody civil war in Syria  which has been fuelled by conventional weapons.On 3 June  Grenada joined 83 States in signing the Arms Trade Treaty on the very first morning that the Treaty was opened for signature. Work is already under way at the national level for the ratification of the Treaty  yet another signal of Grenada’s commitment to peace and security. Moreover  being the first country to accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions  Grenada intends to use its experience to raise awareness on that particular matter  especially in the Americas.On the question of Israeli-Palestinian relations  Grenada remains convinced that a two-State solution is essential to ending that conflict and urges both parties to conduct the present round of negotiations in good faith. Grenada has good relations with the Government and people of Israel and is a strong advocate for Israel’s right to coexist in peace with its neighbours. Furthermore  Grenada has long been a supporter of the people of Palestine. Grenada is proud to have joined with neighbouring countries in recognizing the State of Palestine and in signing a memorandum of understanding based upon friendship and upon an understanding of a two-State solution.As with most of the world  Grenada looked at the Arab Spring with great interest. The use of social media underscores the rise of technology as a tool for democracy on a 24/7 basis  and my Prime Minister places great importance on the use of information and communication technologies as a way to engage our youth. As Egypt goes through its transition and its people’s call for freedom  dignity and social justice is heard  we encourage the leaders to learn the lessons of the recent past and respond to the will of the people in moving forward to a system of true democracy and respect for human rights and inclusive processes for nation-building.Finally  my delegation uses this occasion once more to express our solidarity with the Cuban people  who continue to suffer from an unnecessary economic  commercial and financial embargo that is a relic of the Cold War. Grenada once again calls on the United States of America to respect the views of the overwhelming majority of humanity and lift the onerous measures imposed over five decades ago now.We support your theme  Mr. President  for this sixty-eighth session and wish to assure our partners that they can count on Grenada to be an active participant in these deliberations and in the implementation of their outcomes.Grenada is open for business. My Government recognizes that a tried-and-tested route to sustainable development involves a significant component of foreign direct investment. Grenada therefore reaches out and seeks new friendships while maintaining and building upon its existing and long-standing relations with many States members of this body.In 2014 Grenada marks its fortieth anniversary of independence  and we invite each and every Member to celebrate with us on 7 February. We also see our 40 years as a milestone that recognizes 40 years of struggle  40 years of development. But also  more importantly  it marks 40 years of expectations not yet fully delivered upon. As such  my Government  under the leadership of our Prime Minister  sees this year as the year of less talk and more action  the year of tangible deliverables  and the year that great socioeconomic strides are made. We have a young and vibrant population that cannot wait any longer  that should not wait any longer  and with the help and cooperation of our friends  new and old  we will deliver. They will not wait any longer."
"70",2924,"GTM",68,2013,"I would like to begin my remarks by welcoming Mr. John Ashe in his capacity as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased that a representative of our region  Latin America and the Caribbean  is once again presiding over the main organ of the United Nations. At the same time  I wish to express my appreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his outstanding leadership and stewardship of the Assembly at its previous session  during which he honoured us with a visit to Guatemala.The year 2013 has been challenging for Guatemala. Last year we undertook to reduce our levels of child malnutrition  which affects 4 of every 10 children in my country. In addition  we decided that we could not continue to sit on our hands while hundreds of those children died of hunger. I am here to inform the Assembly  with some optimism  that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Since we began the fight against hunger  we have managed to reduce infant mortality from malnutrition by 50 per cent. Similarly  we have created a monitoring system that allows us to measure the nutritional condition of hundreds of thousands of children  both to assess their growth and development and to prevent deaths among children under the age of 5. The challenge is enormous and we know that our goals are very ambitious. That is why we are not yet satisfied with the progress achieved  but we can affirm without hesitation that little by little we are winning the fight against hunger and child malnutrition.The fight against hunger is closely related to education. We want our boys and girls to study as many years as they can and wish  and with no less than nine years of basic education  which is the goal we have set. But for that to happen  we have to ensure that they have the nutrition that will enable their brains and bodies grow healthily. We have to nourish our boys and girls so that they can study. And we must provide them with the opportunity of education so that they can be successful in their adult lives  both in the world of work and in the civic responsibilities that our democracy needs.That is clearly linked to our second goal  that of promoting dignified employment and a competitive economy. I can again report to the Assembly that we have achieved a 27 per cent increase in the number of workers registered with Guatemala’s social security system between the first quarters of 2012 and 2013. That means that our economy is creating more formal employment opportunities at the same time as we are making progress in establishing our country as a leader in improving the business climate in order to stimulate investment. I am delighted to say that we have developed a growing dialogue in various fields with the President of the United Mexican States  Enrique Peña Nieto. We see the future of Guatemala as clearly related to the economy of that fraternal neighbouring State  and that is why we have been seeking to strengthen our relations in areas including energy  transport and logistics  the modernization of customs and the improvement of security at border crossings  as well as our common battle against hunger and in favour of peace in our countries. Shared prosperity is our banner  and justice our emblem.In the same vein  we have expressed to the Government of the United States of America our clear interest in aligning our policies with those that promote progress and security between the peoples of Mexico and the United States. Guatemala aspires to a tripartite alliance of prosperity with Mexico and the United States that would serve as the foundation for solid links with the countries of the Central American Integration System and at the same time become a platform for progress in the entire Caribbean region.Again  we know that these are ambitious goals and that reaching them will require a strong and persistent effort  so as to achieve the common future of prosperity that our peoples demand - a demand that we cannot and should not evade. Today millions of Guatemalans and Central Americans live and work in the United States  and more than 50 per cent of our population depends directly on business transactions with and family remittances from Mexico and the United States. That integration is a fact  and we Governments must strengthening the institutions and policies that make it possible to make best use of the achievements of our children  our citizens and our business community.The quest for prosperity is also related to our goals of promoting peace and combating impunity. Security has been a challenge inherited by my Government  and we have resolved to address it by preventing violence and by enforcing the law in a clear framework of respect for human rights. We are far from having achieved our goals  but the progress made shows that our State has the capacity to dismantle large criminal networks and to make them accountable to justice for their actions. In that regard  I should like to inform the Assembly that in urban areas of Guatemala City  where homicide  extortion and insecurity were prevalent  we have managed gradually to reinstate peace and social coexistence. At the same time  our justice institutions report that overall  impunity has been reduced by almost 25 per cent between 2009 and 2013  with a particular decrease in impunity for crimes against life  both homicide and sexual crimes against women and children.In connection with the strengthening of the rule of law  I would like to thank the General Assembly and the donor community in particular for their support for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. Its mandate has been renewed until September 2015  and we hope that this period will be used well to continue strengthening the capacity to prosecute of the Public Prosecutor  the Ministry of Security  the Ministry of the Interior  the national civil police and the courts.Building a country that is prosperous and free of hunger  a country integrated with its neighbours and where justice and peace prevail – that is the standard that will guide us  and those are the goals that will move us forward. That is why we ask the international community to support us in moving in that direction.Since my Government took office last year  we have clearly affirmed that the war against drugs has not yielded the desired results and that we cannot continue doing the same thing and expecting different results. That is why I associate myself at this time with other countries that have spoken out in the Assembly  including Mexico  Colombia and Costa Rica  in stating that in the face of the global drug problem  we must review internationally agreed policies in the quest for more effective results in a framework of respect for human rights and from the perspective of health and harm reduction. The objective must be the well-being of society in all its aspects.Prevention must be given priority in order to reduce the impact on health and especially to reduce the level of social violence that is associated with the drug problem. In the same vein  international cooperation should be strengthened so as to reduce illegal flows of arms and the funds that finance those criminal networks.The new global strategy must emerge from an open and inclusive debate leading up to the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome the Declaration of Antigua Guatemala of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States as a first step in the right direction towards the 2016 session.I would like to add to this the specific views of my Government. I should first like to say that Guatemala commends the visionary decision of the citizens of the states of Colorado and Washington  which have led the way to an approach that addresses the issue of drugs from the perspective of public health  the prevention of addiction and violence  and full respect for human rights. Likewise  I wish to commend President Obama for his wise decision to respect the voice of the citizens of Colorado and Washington  allowing those innovative undertakings to prove themselves over time.We also respect and support the example set by President José Mujica of Uruguay in proposing legislation that regulates the cannabis market instead of following the failed route of prohibition. I must also acknowledge the valiant and visionary leadership of the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States  José Miguel Insulza  who has firmly promoted a climate of dialogue and reflection on drug policies among the Governments of the western hemisphere.Without digressing from the path of international cooperation against transnational crime  each country must experiment with new models to address the drug problem. My Government has decided to create a national commission that will help us explore more effective means of dealing with the consumption  trafficking and production of drugs. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 2016 will draw on those innovative experiences and take a strong stand in favour of public policy that can be evaluated objectively and is based on a focus on public health  prevention  damage control and  of course  respect for human rights. We also believe it important that the special session be held here in New York City  because of its significance for the future of global policies on the drug problem.We had the privilege of being elected to the Security Council for the period 2012-2013. Now that we are only a few months away from the end of our tenure  I would like to say that we have taken the provisions of Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations very seriously  not only in decisions based on our own values and principles but also taking into account the fact that we are acting on behalf of the General Assembly. We have strived to comply with our mandate with objectivity  a sense of responsibility and professionalism  while emphasizing security and justice and the protection of human rights and humanitarian law.As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  we have taken a position on the recent crisis in Syria. We condemned the massacre  with chemical weapons  of more than 1 000 people and insisted that a crime of such magnitude could not go unpunished. We also called for a firm response on the part of the international community in order to prevent any repetition of such deplorable acts. Consistent with that position  we have supported the leadership of President Obama  who has clearly affirmed that peace in Syria and the Middle East as a whole must be built within the framework of a political and diplomatic dialogue  but without abandoning our international responsibility to protect the citizens of those countries and of the world from the threat of nuclear and chemical weapons.We also believe that the United Nations made a singular contribution to humankind in 2000 when it launched the Millennium Development Goals. That is why we are actively participating in the design of the content and scope of the post-2015 development agenda as a catalyst for development. We particularly hope that the international community will define the reduction of violence against women and children and universal access to justice as global priorities. Only in a world that is free of violence against women and provides justice for all can a path be cleared towards development based on full respect for human rights.I would like to conclude my statement by congratulating the United Nations system once again on its ongoing efforts to seek peace and justice worldwide. Guatemala endorses the same goals  and it is with pride that I can affirm that we are and always will be a country guided by the principles of the Charter of the Organization."
"71",2967,"GUY",68,2013,"My delegation and I warmly congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I salute you as a distinguished son of our Caribbean community and I pledge Guyana’s unwavering support towards the successful execution of your important duties. I would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his valuable service to the Organization. And I take this occasion to reiterate our thanks to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership and dedication to the United Nations.I would also like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with and deepest condolences to the Government and people of Kenya in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks there  which resulted in the loss of life and great pain to the people of that nation.Barely 800 days remain until the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is reached and a post-2015 development agenda launched. It is appropriate  therefore  that the Assembly has been invited to focus its attention on the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. A review of our experience to date will reveal that the world as a whole has witnessed substantial progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However  prospects vary significantly within and across countries and regions  and a large number of countries are likely to come short in achieving the Goals.Health and education challenges threaten the sustainability of hard-earned socioeconomic gains. Today  still more than 1 billion people live in extreme poverty and one in eight persons on the planet — among them 200 million children — suffer from chronic undernourishment. In addition  we still have 57 million children who are out of school. This needs to be urgently corrected. We must also pay special attention to the quality of education in order to develop a generation of global citizens who are capable of rising to the challenges of the future. To this end  Guyana supports the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative as an instrument for the development of meaningful solutions to the challenges regarding access to and quality of education.If we are to make this world a better place for everyone  we must also address the issue of inequality. Income distribution continues to be skewed in favour of the rich nations and rich persons within nations. This gap has grown dangerously wide. Needless to say  inequality leads to great discontent and social unrest. At the heart of many of the conflicts we see today is the widening gap between the haves and have-nots. Sometimes this is not readily visible  as the fight for social and economic justice is often clouded by inter-ethnic  interreligious and other types of conflicts.To defend the gains that we have made and to expand further  it is necessary for the United Nations to focus on narrowing the gaps in income  access to social services  infrastructure  land distribution and other critical areas. If there is one lesson to be drawn from efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  it is that addressing inequality is crucial to the achievement of sustainable development objectives. The approach adumbrated in the resolution on a new global human order (resolution 65/120) remains relevant in the struggle to eradicate poverty and inequality and indeed the post-2015 development agenda.In setting the stage for a post-2015 agenda  we must build on and expand the gains made. To this end  we must create an international environment that will facilitate the achievement of the goals that we will set for the future. Central to our efforts must be the focus on world peace. Peace and development are inseparable. Peace will be realized only if international law and the rights of nations and their sovereignty are always respected and upheld.It is in this regard that I wish to view the situation in the Middle East. At the moment  Syria is at the centre of our collective concern. The war in that sister nation has taken thousands of innocent lives. It is an illusion to believe that military intervention will bring peace to that country. What is badly needed is political dialogue among the Syrian parties. The international community also has an important role to play. We welcome the agreement between Russia and the United States that will facilitate the destruction of chemical weapons held in Syria. We call on all countries that possess such weapons to do the same. We hope too  that terrorist forces operating in Syria will withdraw. After all  they cannot be terrorists when they were fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq  but freedom fighters when fighting the Syrian Government. A terrorist is simply a terrorist.In the same way  let me say that a blow was struck against democracy when the coup took place in Egypt. However  the major world Powers  instead of condemning the use of such means to change Governments  chose to remain silent. This gave tacit support to the coup  which has led to violations of human rights and loss of innocent lives  and may lead to more protests and possibly violence and death. Nevertheless  it is our fervent hope that the people of that great brotherly country and their leaders  regardless of their political persuasion  will find a peaceful way out of the present difficulties.Moreover  peace in the Middle East will not be realized until we have a just solution to the Palestinian tragedy. The Palestinian people have the right to their own country. We support them in their quest for the right to live in peace and in an independent  viable Palestinian State.Turning to our own region  allow me to underscore that the blockade against our sister Caribbean country Cuba has caused serious damage to that country’s economy and continues to be a major obstacle to development. We join the call for a lifting of the blockade and the removal of the burden that it places on the Cuban people.The adoption in April of the landmark Arms Trade Treaty opens the door to effective regulation of the international trade in conventional arms. For us in the Caribbean  the Treaty bears relevance not only to the safety and security of our citizens and to the fight against transnational crime  but also  in an important way  to our overall pursuit of sustainable development. The funnelling of guns into our societies is a menace that must be curbed in order to preserve our young people and our future. As one of the first countries to ratify the Treaty  Guyana urges all States to work to assure its early entry into force.While peace is vital to development  let me hasten to add that socioeconomic progress coupled with democracy is crucial to the preservation of peace. Central to these principles are our people. They remain the most important factor for development. That is why my country has been increasingly investing in the development of our people. An examination of our national budget will reveal that some 30 per cent of our expenditure goes to the social sector. As a result  we have managed to achieve several of the Millennium Development Goals well before the time envisaged. We have achieved universal primary education and are close to achieving universal secondary education. We have also slashed poverty by more than half. Moreover  according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  we are one of the few countries in the world that have not only reduced poverty but also improved nutrition. The eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development must become a key principle and objective of global economic governance and a guidepost for the action of international financial and trade institutions.While I speak of these achievements  I would be remiss if I did not point out the grave challenges confronting us even as we seek to build on the foundations that have already been laid. We in the Caribbean have experienced major setbacks due to the international economic and financial crises that started in North America and Europe. While it appears that those two regions are emerging from the crises  the effects continue to be devastating in the Caribbean. Even as we continue to grapple with the effects of the financial crisis  we are now faced with the graduation and differentiation imposed by some of our international partners. We are told that as middle-income countries  measured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP)  we are no longer entitled to concessionary financing. This is a recipe for reversing the gains made over the years of hard work and sacrifice. We call for a rethink of that position and urge that greater consideration be given to the special vulnerabilities of our region  where a country can see its entire GDP wiped out by a single hurricane or  as in our country in 2005  when 60 per cent of its GDP was wiped out because of floods. Clearly what we need is increased cooperation with the international community and our development partners  and not less.Another serious challenge to sustainable development is the impact of climate change. This is even more the case for small island developing States  which are represented in the Assembly. Some of them face an imminent passage to oblivion. Climate change is not of our making but  sadly  as small island developing States and low-lying coastal States  we remain the victims of its most adverse impacts. Unfortunately  instead of a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases  there has been a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This marked failure to take decisive action poses a threat to all humankind. It is tragic that while we all know that dangers that lurk due to global warming and climate change  we seem incapable of stopping ourselves. We therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to convene a summit on climate change  and hope that it will result in a strong political consensus for addressing this paramount challenge of our time.We welcome the observance of 2014 as the International Year of Small Island Developing States  and call on the international community to seize the chance to take a serious approach to meaningfully assist such States  in particular in relation to building resilience and disaster risk management. To that end  a special fund must be established and made easily accessible.In setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  we believe that we should intensify efforts to eradicate poverty. The United Nations must not allow that objective to be lost among the many other demands that exist. The United Nations also has a role to play in ensuring that the poorer  smaller developing countries are not always put at a disadvantage at the level of international economic discourse and action. It is critical that this body pursue and encourage multilateral approaches to international and global problems. Experience has shown that even though the multilateral approach is often slow  it is the only approach that can lead to lasting peace  democracy and justice in our world."
"72",3012,"HND",68,2013,"The Government of Honduras extends its warmest congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his election to preside over the proceedings of the General Assembly  and we wish him every success.I am grateful for the honour that the President of Honduras conferred upon me by asking me to represent him in this world forum. As we come to the close of our term in office  we in the Administration of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa note with satisfaction that we have laid the foundation for national unity and reconciliation. We have successfully overcome the severe political crisis that affected Honduras during the previous Government  and Honduras now looks forward to new general elections in November.The Government of President Lobo Sosa has normalized relations with the international community. We have secured ties of close cooperation with more than a hundred friendly countries  restored foreign credit and shown the world that we are a country that lives up to its democratic and peaceful calling. Today  Honduras is a member of the principal international and regional organizations. Our membership in major forums has given us access to new markets  opportunities for investment and employment and helped to strengthen our energy sector.As part of the process of unity and reconciliation  the President of the Republic created a Government of National Integration  with the participation of all the political parties that took part in the last electoral process. Fortunately  that participation continues today and will continue through the end of the present constitutional term. Accordingly  I wish to mention that  as part of the process of healing the wounds of the 2009 political crisis and building the future together  we have successfully adopted by consensus a long-term country vision and a national plan from which our Government programme is derived. That shared vision is being implemented through a major national agreement for economic growth with social equity between the Government of President Lobo Sosa  trade unions  business owners  workers  farmers and civil society. I believe that Honduras and the world should welcome those efforts  together with the spirit of dialogue and commitment of all sectors of Honduran society  which have shown that collective interests come well before individual interests.Today  we are reaping the benefits of that major national agreement. We have had successes in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector  social protection programmes  the establishment of a transparent budget and foreign trade. Democratic participation has also been strengthened because of the interaction of all sectors in our economic and social council  which is a forum that has made it possible for mechanisms for dialogue and conflict prevention to work.We are pleased to state that our Government will be handing over to the incoming Administration a series of principles that should serve as a basis for consolidating social policies. Those principles were discussed and agreed upon between the Government and civil society in order to ensure a solid foundation and the sustainability of social institutions in the country.Our country and our democratic institutions have suffered the onslaught of external aggression  which has led to violence and insecurity. I am referring to drug trafficking and various forms of transnational organized crime. With all the measures adopted to combat crime  last year the Government of President Lobo Sosa was able to halt the rise of the homicide rate  and this year we have seen a reduction in that rate. That has been achieved through the adoption by the National Congress of an entirely new legal and institutional framework  which was lacking before. We have undertaken a reform of the security and justice system. For the first time  we have adopted procedures to certify judicial officials  using confidence-testing measures. We have also adopted a tax to strengthen citizen safety. To the extent possible  we are providing training for the security and defence institutions. We have implemented a national policy to prevent violence against children and youth  and we have promoted and protected human rights.And yet  while halting the spiral of violence is a positive sign  it is insufficient  given the high level of criminal activity that had been reached. Our commitment to combat crime will be upheld until the very last day of our mandate. However  it is very important to sustain those efforts. The new Government will have to do so with a firm hand. It will have to continue to strengthen security and justice institutions  which is a medium- to long-term task. Combating global crime requires a more decisive and more effective international and regional effort  in which drug-producing and drug-consuming countries assume the shared and differentiated responsibility that they bear in this wave of violence.Today  I reaffirm Honduras’s commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the right to life and the respect for human dignity. We recognize that the protection of human rights is the very essence of democracy. During our administration  we created a Secretary of State for Justice and Human Rights and strengthened the role of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights. We established institutions for combating torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment  and we enacted a law combating human trafficking and introducing a public human rights policy and a national plan of action for human rights. We now require presidential candidates to sign the human rights pact.It is fundamentally important to Honduras that we continue working towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals  with which we have made significant progress. Food and nutrition security is a national priority for President Porfirio Lobo Sosa’s Government  and we have focused efforts to eradicate hunger through various food and nutrition security programmes targeting the most vulnerable people and the neediest areas of the country.Through its recognition of the multidimensional and multisectoral nature of the food and nutrition security issue  the Government of our Republic reduced the population suffering from malnutrition by 21 per cent between 2010 and 2012  meeting and exceeding its target for the Millennium Development Goals. As an example of our multisectoral approach and to ensure the sustainability of our programmes  I am pleased to announce the launch of a Government initiative  the Partnership for the Dry Corridor. The Partnership  which has the support of the international community  targets those suffering from poverty and hunger in our country’s most vulnerable area.Concerning education  I should emphasize that Honduras has seen a significant increase in the number of 5-year-olds entering the pre-school system. It is roughly triple what we expected. Our Government has been deeply committed to reforming the national education system. The new legal framework requires a broad participatory process involving parents  communities and teachers. The proposal that President Lobo made here in the General Assembly last year  when he said that classrooms must never be closed (see A/67/PV.6  p. 49)  has led to a considerable increase in the number of school days for children in Honduras. That has resulted in an improvement in the quality of education  and as a nation we are very optimistic about it.As to gender equality and the empowerment of women  we have made progress in implementing a gender equality system  created with a view to promoting  encouraging and institutionalizing gender-equity policies and improving equality of opportunity between men and women. With regard to the reduction of under-five mortality and improving maternal health  our Government approved a public policy for the holistic development of infants and a comprehensive care strategy for children in the community. The strategy has been internationally recognized  because it has improved maternal health conditions before  during and after delivery and has thus lowered the mortality risk and increased the number of births in medical centres.Similarly  it is important to emphasize the efforts we have made to reduce infant morbidity and mortality associated with diseases that are preventable through vaccination; our broad immunization programme has achieved more than 90 per cent coverage for vaccines required for children under the age of 2. With regard respect to HIV/AIDS  our Government has increased the national budget for prevention and care and has financed almost 100 per cent of the antiretroviral treatment.Concerning the delimitation of maritime space in the Pacific Ocean  and specifically the situation in the Gulf of Fonseca  a historic bay that Honduras shares in a co-sovereignty regime with El Salvador and Nicaragua  my Government wishes to reiterate its respect for the decision that the International Court of Justice handed down on 11 September 1992. We also affirm our commitment to including a comprehensive cooperation agreement under the auspices of a tri-national commission of coastal States  which develops conservation and protection programmes for the environment in the Gulf and the improvement of living conditions for neighbouring communities. It is an opportune moment to recall that it was in October 2012 that Honduras first asked the Security Council to authorize the Secretary-General to provide all necessary support for constituting that authority  and I take this opportunity to repeat our request. I thank the European Union for its cooperation in developing this zone  which has great economic potential.I would like to emphasize the importance that all coastal States attach to the decisions of the International Court of Justice. We wish to avoid making any territorial or maritime claims that would distance us further from the big picture  which is to make the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Fonseca a zone of cooperation and peace. But given the understanding and neighbourliness we possess  we have concluded  based on equitable principles  the necessary agreements regarding the maritime impact on the Pacific Ocean. Honduras has already made proposals that we are prepared to discuss with our fraternal neighbours.I wish to underscore the fact that our Government has defined a strategy for a governmental transition for 2013-2014  whose primary objective is to ensure an orderly and structured handover  so as to avoid the vacuums and delays in planning that have traditionally accompanied a change of Government. It is essential to ensure the sustainability of public policies beyond the life of our Administration  so that we can achieve long-term planning that benefits the Honduran people. In November we will hold general elections with the participation of nine political parties  including a strong female presence in the election process. Honduras’s electoral authorities  which function independently  are making every possible effort to ensure that the general elections are free and transparent. On behalf of the people of Honduras  I would like to ask all friendly nations to support our electoral process. All States are welcome to witness it.I hope sincerely that  during its sixty-eighth session  the General Assembly will meet the expectations of Member States  and I take this opportunity to express my thanks  on behalf of the people and Government of Honduras  for the solidarity that the international community has shown to the Administration of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa."
"73",3037,"HRV",68,2013,"I would like first to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to that important position and express my confidence in his leadership. It is also my great pleasure to address the Assembly for the first time as the President of the newest European Union member State.Our debate this year is focused on an issue of paramount importance for our planet’s future — the post-2015 development agenda. However  before sharing my views on that central issue  I would like to share my thoughts on a broader understanding of sustainability. It is difficult  if not impossible  to outline sustainable development without touching upon one of its essential prerequisites: peace and security. As a global community  we continue to witness  year after year  a plethora of deadly and prolonged international crises and new and emerging threats and conflicts. The ongoing security and humanitarian catastrophe in Syria  with all its terrible effects and potential to destabilize the region  is naturally foremost on our minds. We are saddened by the tremendous loss of life as a result of that ongoing conflict. We are particularly appalled and concerned by the findings and conclusions of the report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic on the alleged use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013 (A/67/997). Croatia condemns in the strongest terms the use of chemical weapons. The international community must ensure that there is no impunity for such crimes and that the perpetrators of those and other crimes are held to account. In that connection  we welcome the United States-Russia Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons of 14 September. The priority must now be to provide for its prompt and full implementation  starting with a process in the Security Council and the soonest possible adoption of a relevant Council resolution.The United Nations was established at a time when the world was emerging from a period that had witnessed the worst atrocities of the twentieth century. In fact  it was established for the very purpose of ensuring that such atrocities would not happen again. While we can and often do debate the overall effectiveness of the United Nations in ensuring international peace  it is important that we build on the lessons learned from both past successes and past mistakes.In that connection  allow me to highlight one such past success. January this year marked the fifteenth anniversary of the end of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and Western Sirmium in Croatia. It is considered to be one of the most successful peacekeeping operations in United Nations history. The mission was able to peacefully reaffirm the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia  and paved the way for normalizing relations and cooperation in the region.Over the past 20 years Croatia has undertaken a long and demanding journey from being a host nation for a number of United Nations peacekeeping missions on its territory to a peacekeeping contributor. Today  we are determined to continue our participation in many current peacekeeping and peace-support operations and missions around the world. This year also marks the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It is a well-known fact that Croatia advocated the establishment of the ICTY from the very beginning.We wholeheartedly supported the strong determination of the international community to finally  once and for all  put an end to the culture of impunity that had for so long accompanied wars and armed conflicts. The establishment of the ad hoc criminal tribunals changed the landscape of international criminal justice and paved the way for a whole new system  with the International Criminal Court at its head. The establishment of the International Criminal Court in 1998 can be regarded as one of the most important civilization achievements in the last century and the beginning of a new era of accountability. That is why we are calling on those countries that have not yet decided to adopt the Rome Statute to do so as soon as possible.Our own experience teaches us that peace often comes at a high price. Maintaining peace often entails a long-term and comprehensive commitment on the part of the international community. The United Nations recognized that fact in establishing the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) in 2005. Its aim is to direct and sustain the attention and efforts of the international community in post-conflict countries. Croatia’s interest and engagement in peacebuilding started some time ago and was further strengthened by our bitter experience in recent history. From the very beginning  Croatia actively participated in and contributed to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission.In the PBC we have focused on three different  yet mutually reinforcing areas – strengthening security  stimulating socioeconomic prosperity and promoting human rights and gender equality. For example  as the current PBC Chair and in line with the Peacebuilding Commission’s action plan for 2013  Croatia helped organize a joint meeting of the PBC and the Global Compact on the important topic of business for peacebuilding  which was held in June. Earlier today  Croatia  as PBC Chair and in cooperation with UN-Women  organized a high-level ministerial meeting on women’s economic empowerment in peacebuilding. The meeting emphasized the critical role of women in peacebuilding processes and the fact that empowering women in the economy is essential for realizing women’s rights and achieving broader development goals.In our view  progress in the areas of security  development  the rule of law and human rights must go hand in hand. We would especially like to stress the critical importance that the rule of law plays in post-conflict peacebuilding and  therefore  in achieving lasting peace and sustainable development.For its part  Croatia continues to follow the path of promoting an open and pluralistic democracy as the best guarantee for safeguarding the human rights of its citizens. We believe that democracy needs to be approached in a holistic manner. Human and minority rights  the rule of law  good governance and the fight against corruption are intrinsic to democratic values. Democracy is not only about civil and political rights; its focus is not only on free and fair elections  but also on economic  social and cultural rights.Croatia will continue to seek the upholding of human rights standards across the globe. We particularly support the abolition of the death penalty  the implementation of anti-discrimination policies  the effective and full protection of the rights of the child and the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities. We will also spare no effort in raising awareness about the importance of upholding and improving women’s and minority rights. Croatia fully supports the pivotal role of the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms  in particular the Human Rights Council. For that reason  Croatia has presented its bid for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period of 2017-2019  remaining committed to making an active and substantial contribution to the activities and efforts of that very important United Nations body.In the area of security  we consider the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  especially proliferation to non-State actors  to be a global security priority. Croatia believes that successful non-proliferation is possible only through a combination of diligent work at the national level and the widest possible international cooperation. We firmly believe that adherence to multilateral non-proliferation treaties  as well as participation in informal non-proliferation initiatives  are an indispensable part of non-proliferation efforts. The most recent events in Syria are a horrible reminder and warning of how important it is that all international agreements on non-proliferation be universally complied with.Croatia is also very concerned about the issue of the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation. We believe that those weapons present a great risk for the stability and security of many weak and fragile areas around the world. A milestone in that area is the successful completion and opening for signature of the international Arms Trade Treaty  a uniquely drafted document establishing rules and criteria for trade in conventional arms. Croatia  as an original signatory State  would like to add its voice to those requesting urgent and universal adherence to the treaty and its expedited entry into force.Nowadays we are witnessing all around the world the heavy toll of armed conflicts and wars. In any humanitarian crisis  those paying the highest price for the conflict are civilians  especially women and children. We commend the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and other international donors to help civilians  and we are contributing to them as much as we can. Having been an aid recipient  we have learned that the donor-recipient relationship can be effective and efficient only if based on an equal partnership  mutual respect and understanding. Development cooperation is a multilevel process through which all sides can learn and grow. Croatia will continue focusing its donor activities on gender and child-sensitive issues  on maternal health and the prevention of mortality in children under 5  as well as on enhancing girls’ education.In setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  we  as a global community  will continue to be confronted with many challenges  some of which I have just mentioned. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) has provided us with important guidance with regard to establishing the goals and multilateral architecture necessary for its implementation. In that sense  we would like to express our satisfaction with the creation of the High-Level Political Forum  which we hope will be a stepping stone in the establishment of a strengthened institutional architecture for sustainable development.Scientists warn us that soon we will need two planets to keep pace with the consumption-driven growth necessary to sustain our ever-increasing population. While we agree that a transformative shift towards more sustainable development is needed  the question remains how to achieve that shift. Knowledge is the key. The science-policy interface  so often highlighted in the run-up to the Rio+20 Conference and integrated into the vision of “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  stands as a crucial link to those innovative solutions.To achieve a sustainable future  we need a concurrent base of strong institutions  solidarity  justice and social development  with an approach that is more targeted towards marginalized groups  including women’s empowerment  as well as a strong respect for the environment and innovative growth. Croatia welcomes the already widely accepted view that education represents one of the main building blocks in every society and is a crucial driver for development. I am proud to represent a country among the States championing the Global Education First Initiative. Croatia is fully committed to supporting the Initiative  and I would like to take this opportunity to call upon others to join our efforts to give life to the Initiative’s goals.On 1 July  just over two and a half months ago  Croatia became the twenty-eighth member of the European Union (EU). One of the primary reasons that my country strove to become a full member of the European Union was to secure a safe  democratic and stable future for ourselves and for forthcoming generations. Croatia firmly believes that EU enlargement has been one of that organization’s most successful and productive policies. Because of that  we believe that the European project should not and cannot stop at our borders. We firmly believe in the strategic importance of the EU’s enlargement policy. It must be continued with respect to all countries of the Western Balkans — based on their individual merits — as it is the best option for long-term stability in the region. We strongly support all of the countries in our neighbourhood in their endeavours and believe that their efforts towards future membership of the European Union will be successful.It is important to understand that reconciliation and cooperation have become a new standard for regional policies  and in that regard  we welcome closer collaboration among all countries of South-Eastern Europe  both bilaterally and in the framework of regional organizations and initiatives.Before concluding  I would like to address the issue of United Nations reform. We believe that there is a need for true reform of the current United Nations structures and mechanisms if the United Nations is to achieve its ambitious goals and strengthen its capacity to meet new challenges.The first area is Security Council reform. Croatia commends the persevering commitment of Member States to the ongoing negotiating process and believes that broader understanding of sustainability should find its place in that context as well. However  any reform of the Council must not have a negative impact on its ability to perform its main duties and meet its primary responsibilities. Enlargement of the Council is closely connected with the reform of its working methods  while the continuing veto powers of the permanent five continues to raise numerous questions. That is why such reform must be comprehensive. That having been said  it is Croatia’s position that any enlargement should take place in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories of membership  with one additional non-permanent seat reserved for the group of Eastern European States. That would more properly reflect the reality of international relations in the twenty-first century.As a member of the Economic and Social Council  we intend to continue advocating a stronger and more efficient role for that main body in its efforts to seek solutions to the most significant social and economic challenges of our time. The General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should also find ways of working together to support deliberations on the complex matter of sustainable development. Within its broad  overarching mandate  the General Assembly remains the central point for all of our discussions. Croatia welcomes the focus at this year’s debate on the post-2015 development agenda.Finally  I would like to stress that we are all aware of the global challenges we face today. As a global community  in looking for sustainable solutions  we made strong commitments at last year’s Rio+20 Conference  and we will need to make new ones as we proceed with the post-2015 development agenda. To achieve all of that  we will need to strengthen old partnerships and create new ones  both between Governments and among Governments and civil society and other key stakeholders. In that respect  it is our belief that the United Nations and its institutions offer the best chance to help meet those expectations. Let us  as its Member States  make the best use of all that it has to offer."
"74",3082,"HTI",68,2013,"I would first like to express my warm and fraternal gratitude to the President of the Republic of Haiti  His Excellency Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly  for the trust he has placed in me and  above all  for his courage and unwavering determination to build a new Haiti. I would also like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe  Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda  for his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  as well as to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.I am proud to speak in this forum of modern global history  one that has witnessed so many great leaders discussing their vision for a world that is more just and a humankind that is more enlightened and balanced.It has been 13 years since the States Members of the Organization  buoyed by the basic values of freedom and equality  met to launch a new world order for development when they adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). It has been a strong period for the United Nations  which continues to stand out through its efforts to call on the peoples of the world to unite to overcome the challenges linked to poverty and social exclusion.I speak on behalf of Haiti when I voice our pleasure at the increasing vitality of the Organization  which over the years has succeeded in preserving the ideals of peace and solidarity. My country has always sought  with the United Nations  to provide a better future to generations to come. We have done so enthusiastically  because over the past two centuries  Haiti — the land of Toussaint Louverture  Alexandre Pétion  Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe — has never missed the great historic events. It is up to all of us to preserve this vital tool for the future of humankind.The theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. This is the ideal opportunity for Haiti to present to the entire world an initial assessment of the work carried out by the Government  work which largely meets the aims of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and which allows us to see a burgeoning new Haiti.Before presenting those achievements to the Assembly  it is important to recall the situation that Haiti found itself in when President Michel Martelly was sworn in. In January 2010  Haiti was in a particularly critical situation  especially because of the devastating  large-scale earthquake. The natural disasters following the earthquake exacerbated the already very difficult problems. Despite daily difficulties  Haiti is now resolutely and definitively on the path of progress. Our country is gradually recovering from the natural disasters it experienced and today is facing the future with confidence. We have adopted effective measures and policies that are focused on a strategic long-term development plan.The aims underlying our Government’s action go hand in hand with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However  the development under way cannot take place without a deep-seated reform of the public administration and good political governance. That is why the rule of law is one of our priorities. In that regard  we have made great strides in 28 months. A Supreme Council of the Judiciary has been put in place to ensure the independence of judges and of all the justices appointed to the Court of Cassation. The professionalism of the Haitian National Police enables us today to provide and guarantee security and to create a climate conducive to investment  which is necessary to combat extreme poverty. The performance of our police force has meant that Haiti is now ranked as one of the safest countries in the Caribbean. Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the military and police presence of the United Nations in Haiti. The Haitian Government welcomes the implementation of the plan for the gradual withdrawal of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  which is now possible thanks to the considerable progress achieved in the area of security.The implementation of the constitutional mechanisms envisaged in the context of the rule of law is an ongoing priority for the Government. We have managed to create a climate conducive to political stability and to the expression of ideas and democratic values. The Haitian press enjoys full freedom  and members of the political opposition exercise their rights without restrictions. I would also like to mention the commitment and work of the Government in consolidating the rule of law and ensuring the sustainability of democratic institutions. To that end  the Government continues to give its full support to the transitional college of the Permanent Electoral Council to ensure that legislative and local elections take place as soon as possible. Despite its lack of resources  the Haitian Government has already allocated significant funds to the electoral body. The President of the Republic of Haiti is personally involved in initiating a dialogue with stakeholders and political parties and is encouraging them to participate in the upcoming elections in order to respect the process of democratic change  as it is essential to the rule of law.With regard to education  more than 1.2 million Haitian children have benefited from the free education programme put in place by the Government. We have achieved that in particular by establishing a universal  free and compulsory education programme. That is a major achievement for Haiti  and one that is in keeping with one of the most important Millennium Development Goals: the achievement of universal primary education by 2015. The Government is aware that this achievement does not resolve the challenge of providing access to quality schooling for everyone. That is a new objective that we are determined to achieve. Moreover  an ambitious programme to combat illiteracy is under way. It will impact more than 250 000 people in 2014.With regard to combating hunger and extreme poverty — another Millennium Development Goal — despite the serious social inequality in Haiti  the Government has made considerable efforts to avoid a humanitarian crisis. To achieve its goals in the fight against extreme poverty  the Government has invested more than $150 million in social assistance and protection programmes  which is a first for our country. The programmes are aimed at helping the most vulnerable. Since 2012  three ministries have been established to strengthen public policies for the elimination of extreme poverty. The Government is pursuing a national food-security policy that includes a series of 15 measures that are expected to yield results in the short  medium and long terms. In the short term  the objective is  first  to stabilize the price of basic consumer goods and  secondly  to provide assistance to those living in extreme poverty. In the medium and long terms  the objective is to increase national production and to reduce our food dependence. We have also introduced a social innovation that is unprecedented in the history of our country by initiating a series of social programmes for the most vulnerable groups under the theme “Help the poor”. After one year of operation  those programmes are now reaching more than 1 million Haitian people living in extreme poverty: thousands of mothers  students  older persons  disabled people and victims of natural disasters. Finally  along the same lines  I would like it to be noted that of the 1.5 million earthquake refugees who were living in tents in subhuman conditions  more than 1.25 million have now been rehoused.In the twenty-first century  people are still starving in Haiti. That is unacceptable and intolerable. As Nelson Mandela said  “overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity  it is an act of justice.” For President Martelly and myself  combatting extreme poverty is a commitment that we make to history.In terms of health care  there are considerable challenges to be met in Haiti. The prevalence of certain diseases  the high rates of infant mortality and the shortcomings in health-care infrastructure have deprived millions of Haitians of good-quality health services. That situation was exacerbated by the earthquake in 2010. Furthermore  in October 2010  there was a very serious outbreak of cholera in Haiti  for which the Haitian people continue to pay a heavy price in human lives. Given the catastrophic consequences of that scourge — more than 8 000 dead and 650 000 people infected — the Haitian Government is proposing that a significant amount of the new global fund to combat cholera be earmarked exclusively for the eradication of the disease in Haiti. While we continue to believe that the United Nations has some moral responsibility with regard to the outbreak of the epidemic  it is nonetheless true that the Organization has already supported some of the Government’s efforts to combat the disease. However  those efforts are far from enough. We would therefore like to propose the establishment of a joint commission  including members of the Haitian Government and representatives of the United Nations  to consider ways and means to definitively eradicate the disease in Haiti.In the face of those major public health challenges  the Haitian Government has not stood idly by. Working with our national and international partners and public health experts  we have managed to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS. In terms of treating AIDS today  Haiti has moved from a prevalence rate of 5.5 in 2000 to 2.2 today  with a projected 1.5 for 2015. Such results are a just reward for the years of effort that have made Haiti a model universally recognized in international scientific and academic circles. But we will not stop there. Much remains to be done in terms of prevention and treatment. We very much hope that we can definitively halt the spread of AIDS and make treatment more affordable. In Haiti  the public health network and the provision of health care are largely insufficient. New efforts in terms of prevention must be made.The question of the environment is of major concern to the Haitian Government  because the vegetation cover over a very large area has disappeared. In order to raise awareness among people about the need to replant that vegetation  large-scale programmes have been set up  and others are being drawn up  with the aim of meeting the challenges of replanting  reforestation  providing drinking water and sanitation and protecting ecosystems — all of which have been neglected for far too long. Without appropriate protection of the environment  there will be no sustainable development; no food security is possible for a growing population  nor can there be a decline in poverty and misery.As set forth in the noble Millennium Development Goal on the topic  the Haitian Government  aware of the need for gender equality  has made significant efforts to ensure equality between Haitian men and women. While Haitian society has always accorded an important role to women  the Government has undertaken significant initiatives to enable women to have access to highly responsible positions in public administration. Thirty-five per cent of the Cabinet is made up of women  and they have important portfolios. Much remains to be done to ensure the full emancipation of Haitian women  particularly among the most vulnerable populations. In our country  women deserve better access to education and health-care services.I conclude by asking the Assembly to observe more closely the new Haiti that has been emerging over the past two years despite its day-to-day problems and the extremely difficult legacy  of which we are all aware. That Haiti is one where more girls and boys go to school  where new international-class hotels are opening up their doors every day  breathing new life into our tourism  where the economy is growing at the rate of 4.6 per cent  where inflation has been stabilized at 6.7 per cent  where for the first time foreign direct investment has increased by more than 19 per cent annually  where a fierce fight against smuggling and corruption is being carried out and where today the lowest rate of homicide in the Caribbean is seen. The new Haiti is modernizing the old Haiti little by little and is adopting courageous reforms. The new Haiti is increasingly focusing on constructive dialogue with the country’s social partners — the press  political parties and the private sector. That Haiti has the courage to invest in the worst-off and the poorest  despite a degree of misunderstanding and some criticism.A new Haiti is emerging. More than ever before  Haiti feels that it is taking its place in the great family of the United Nations and in the international community  without which many of the achievements of the past three years would not have been possible.We are doing a great deal with very little. If the international community had fully met its commitments — amounting to $10 billion — made at the 31 March 2010 meeting  the results would be even better  and the suffering of the Haitian people would be less harsh. Today  we are still far from our goal  because only a part of those commitments have been honoured.Based on its desire for transparency and efficiency and to avoid duplication of effort on the part of non-governmental organizations  the Government has stepped up its leadership role and set up a mechanism — the National Coordination Framework for External Development Aid in Haiti — to take over the management of international assistance.Haiti is once again present on the regional scene. This year alone our country has hosted three major regional summits  including those of CARICOM  the Ministers of the Association of Caribbean States  and Petrocaribe. During those meetings  there were also discussions on the best regional strategies to combat hunger  abject poverty and exclusion  topics that are in line with the Millennium Development Goals. Finally  the Haiti of which I speak is the one that Haitian men and women are working tirelessly to forge each and every day. The results are coming; progress is already palpable. Our country is no longer on the front pages of the international press owing to repeated coups d’état  social turmoil  insecurity and instability. Our country is henceforth stable and secure  thanks in particular to the tremendous efforts of the Haitian National Police  with the support of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. Work on infrastructure and on the reconstruction of public buildings destroyed by the earthquake has begun. The country offers excellent investment opportunities in all sectors. Haiti today is on the right track  moving towards a new era of social and economic progress and respect for human rights. We are acting specifically to achieve progress towards a Haiti that is more solidarity-based and more prosperous — a Haiti that the entire world will want to visit to see its extraordinary sights. Long live Haiti!"
"75",3128,"HUN",68,2013,"Defining the post-2015 strategy for development is among the most important long-term multilateral agendas existing today. The task is complex  but the mission — to make our common development sustainable — should be clear. It is not just a synonym for the protection of the environment. The mission is to make sure that our societies  economies  environment and partnerships will serve us all and serve the generations to come.By 2030  our population will be 9 billion people  65 per cent of whom will live in cities  forming consumer societies with ever-growing demands but using the same or a declining pool of natural resources. Civil societies and other non-governmental players have more influence than ever on our values and decisions. We are racing against climate change. Our perceptions of progress  equity  inequality  affluence and resource management are changing as we speak. The post-2015 development agenda has to reflect these changes.As we face a turning point in our history and the state of the Earth  it is only with a fundamental shift in mindset that humanity will succeed in a transition to global sustainable development. We have to accelerate progress towards the goals set out in the Millennium Development Goals. However  we know that by 2015 we may not be able to meet all the targets we set in 2000. Therefore  the next important step is to create a single agenda through which we will complete the unfinished business and make sure that the results will last even in the light of the tremendous challenges facing humankind.We should aim at eradicating extreme poverty in a single generation. The transformation to sustainable development is costly; however  it would be incomparably more costly to miss the chance. We should learn from past mistakes and find better alternatives. We all need economic growth. We all need justice  respect for human rights  gender equality  dignity  good governance and successfully implemented national development plans. We all deserve to live free of want and from fear of devastating conflicts. Our objective should be not a zero-sum game but a win-win outcome. We all share the consequences; therefore we should be aware of our common responsibility as well.The decisions we make today will also need to be relevant in 15 years. When our successors look back in 2030 on the agenda we are about to decide on  they should acknowledge the purpose  priorities and targets jointly set. They should be convinced that our action had the right impact and made this world a better place. I thank the Member States for the confidence they have shown in Hungary by entrusting us to co-chair the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. We will do our best to achieve a consensual  forward-looking  win-win formula as the outcome of the negotiating process.Hungary attaches the utmost importance to the issue of water and sanitation. We believe that it needs to be addressed in an integrated way to achieve a human rights-based social development prosperity and ecological balance. Water is a source of life  health  prosperity and a shared future  but it can also be a source of risk.In order to take stock of the various international developments in the field of water  Hungary has decided to organize the Budapest Water Summit  to be held in our capital from 8 to 11 October. Hungary is a downstream country with about 95 per cent of all fluvial waters originating beyond our State borders. We have accumulated precious know-how in flood control  drinking water  wastewater treatment and irrigation  just to list a few. The Summit will be accompanied by a science forum  a youth forum  a civil society forum  a business leaders’ forum and Expo  and a philanthropy round table. We look forward to welcoming Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations agencies active in the field of water  as well as other international and national leaders to the conference. More than 100 countries and international institutions have confirmed they will be represented in Budapest. The Summit will adopt the Budapest Statement  and we hope that it will  as a synthesis document  greatly contribute to and facilitate the discussions and negotiations on the sustainable development goals.The appalling situations in various parts of the world leave no doubt as to the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy  peace and security  development and human rights. A cross-policy approach that takes account of those interrelationships should be integrated into the work of the various bodies and forums of the United Nations.Hungary welcomes the measures that the United Nations system is introducing to mainstream human rights. Likewise  it encourages national initiatives and contributions to the protection of human rights. Hungary remains dedicated to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was in this spirit that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary established the annual Budapest Human Rights Forum  intended to apply an interrelated philosophy to address current human rights challenges. The next Forum is due to take place in November and will be dedicated  among other things  to the relationship between human rights and sustainable development.Hungary is committed to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts  which are fundamental for maintaining global peace and security. We urge all countries to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. We also support the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  as foreseen by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.My country was greatly honoured to chair the International Atomic Energy Agency’s International Conference on Nuclear Security in July and sincerely hopes that the results of that Conference will contribute to a safer world.On the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  I am confident that its entry into force will greatly strengthen global peace and security. Only a treaty in force will confine the chapter on nuclear testing to the history books. We therefore need to further intensify our respective efforts. I and my fellow article XIV Coordinator Mr. Marty Natalegawa  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  will make an attempt to bring us closer to that goal. I look forward to our co-coordinatorship of the CTBT for the period 2013-2015 with a view to accelerating the ratification process.The use of chemical weapons in Syria was a crime against humanity. The international community has finally embarked on action to ensure that similar attacks will never be repeated. We urge that the perpetrators of all war crimes be brought to justice. Without justice there is no reconciliation. Without a chance for reconciliation  there is no lasting settlement. We welcome the United States-Russia agreement on the framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons as well as the consequent resolutions adopted by the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  and the Security Council. We look forward to a timely  transparent and full-scale implementation under the watchful eyes of the international community.Hungary is ready to provide chemical and biological experts on the ground to facilitate those international efforts. We urge the Syrian authorities to take full responsibility to ensure that their chemical weapons are stored securely until inspection and destruction  and do not fall into the hands of any other State or non-State actor. Syria should live up to its commitments  including by providing full access to the international inspectors.We hope that these developments will bring us closer to a lasting and sustainable political solution  which should remain the backbone of our efforts in the Syrian crisis. Well over 100 000 lives have already been lost and 5 million people displaced in this conflict. Most regrettably  it was only after a terrible chemical attack last August that the Security Council became ready to fulfil its duties and embarked on action. I urge all partners in the international community to seize this momentum and reinvigorate the process leading to the long-overdue “Geneva II” international peace conference on Syria.Last  but not least  my country is shocked by and strongly condemns the surging terrorist attacks against civilians at the Westgate Mall in Kenya  students in Nigeria  and Christian  Muslim and other communities in Pakistan  Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere. Our solidarity and sympathy go to the innocent victims."
"76",3175,"IDN",68,2013,"Let me begin by congratulating His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. May I also take this opportunity to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his skilful stewardship of the sixty-seventh session. Our profound appreciation of course also goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspirational leadership of the Organization.The theme of this session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is timely and well-chosen  for we are now making the final push towards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline. Simultaneously  work has begun on framing the post-2015 global development agenda to end extreme poverty and ensure sustainable growth with equity. That agenda must be anchored by a new global partnership — a vision reflected in President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s role as one of the three co-Chairs of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda and recognition of the fact that the success of the forthcoming intergovernmental process requires the capacity to forge a global consensus to identify and build upon common interests. Indonesia has an enduring belief in the efficacy and effectiveness of diplomacy  maintaining peace and security  advancing social progress and economic prosperity and promoting democracy  human rights and tolerance.The conflict in Syria has long demanded such a political and diplomatic solution  for amid the undoubted complexity of the situation three key points are compelling  namely  halting the violence  facilitating humanitarian relief and beginning an inclusive political process that reflects the wishes of the Syrian people. The recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical weapons in Syria is clear evidence that diplomacy works. Further diplomatic momentum must be generated. The Security Council must be one to forcefully make the case for a peaceful settlement. To get the parties to the negotiating table  the “Geneva II” conference must be convened at the earliest opportunity.On the issue of Palestine  the full weight of diplomatic pressure must similarly be brought to bear and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council implemented. The historic injustice that the Palestinian people have suffered for so long must be ended. We are encouraged by and welcome  therefore  the resumption of direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel  the result  no less  of painstaking and relentless diplomatic efforts. The revival of the long-stalled nuclear disarmament agenda is also key. In particular  as co-President of the Article XIV Conference on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  Indonesia calls for the early entry into force of the Treaty.The same relentless diplomatic pursuit must be applied to what is manifestly in the common interests of all  that is  the eradication of poverty  the promotion of sustainable development and inclusive financing and overcoming the challenges of climate change. We have in ourselves the wherewithal to address the development challenges of our time — for example  to work for an early conclusion of the Doha development agenda and a new climate-change regime by 2015.Key to that  however  must be a strong commitment to the spirit of partnership and an unshakeable belief in the power of multilateralism: cooperation and collaboration rather than discord and division. The development agenda must work for all countries  large or small  developed and developing. Each of us must share responsibility. Developed countries must take the lead  while developing countries must do more.The pursuit of a diplomatic path becomes fraught with challenges in a complex and fast-changing world where the issues of governance  human rights violations  extremism and intolerance within countries can quickly gain inter-State dimensions. We must ensure that the institutions of the United Nations are ready to address such contemporary challenges. Therefore  as countries embark upon a process of democratization and the promotion and protection of human rights  as they draw a line against intolerance and extremism  the international community  the United Nations  must contribute towards ensuring an atmosphere that is conducive to their peaceful transformation  one that reflects the wishes of the peoples concerned.Together with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Indonesia is steadily developing a regional architecture conducive to the peaceful promotion of human rights and democracy. It is called the ASEAN Political-Security Community. Together with the economic community and sociocultural community pillars  it makes up the ASEAN Community that we are to achieve by 2015. Through a process of sharing lessons learned derived from our respective successes and setbacks  we provide mutual encouragement and support in our promotion of the principles of democracy  the rule of law and good governance  and respect for and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms as inscribed in the ASEAN Charter.Beyond South-East Asia  Indonesia is pursuing the same positive and constructive approach through what is called the Bali Democracy Forum  a platform for countries in the wider region to shareone anothers’ experiences. At all levels — national  regional and global — we remain steadfast in promoting tolerance and religious freedom  pushing back against prejudice and intolerance and building partnerships  harmony and mutual respect. Indonesia recognizes  therefore  the special responsibility incumbent upon it as host of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum in 2014  one that aims to promote unity in diversity.The primacy of diplomacy and of the peaceful settlement of disputes over war and conflict is not more evident than in the quiet and yet fundamental transformations that have been taking place in our region  South-East Asia. Notwithstanding the continuing challenges  Indonesia believes that the dividends of peace and stability are self-evident: economic and social progress.The continued stability and security of the region is therefore the key to securing our prosperity. Peace and development are indivisible. With other ASEAN nations  Indonesia has worked constantly to develop the region’s capacity to manage and overcome any potential for conflict and to ensure that it remains a net contributor to international peace and security; to extend the arc of stability beyond South-East Asia to the Asia-Pacific region at large while promoting common security  common prosperity and common stability for all in the region; and  through commitments to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the renunciation of the use or threat of force  to ensure that the region places diplomacy at the forefront.Indonesia will be tireless in promoting the primacy of diplomacy  and unwavering in its belief in the noble goals of the United Nations."
"77",3222,"IND",68,2013,"Let me first of all congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We wish you every success and assure you of our fullest cooperation.At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges  there is renewed attention to the role of the United Nations in advancing international peace  security and prosperity. However  never has scepticism about the capacity of the United Nations to do so been higher  or the external environment less propitious for multilateralism.The nearly seven decades of work of the United Nations hold one simple lesson: that we are most successful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter  basing our decisions on the widest possible consensus and balancing equitably the needs and responsibilities of nations at different stages and levels of development.In those seven decades  the world has changed in fundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent and resurgent. Countries are now not only more interdependent  but also face new  increasingly complex challenges. For multilateralism to remain relevant and effective in the future  multilateral institutions need to be reformed urgently. The place to begin is right here.The Security Council must be reformed and restructured to reflect current political realities. More developing countries should be included as both permanent and non-permanent members.The multilateral financial institutions should also enable an enhanced voice for developing countries in their decision-making structures. Multilateral efforts must guide our quest for peace and security  wherever they are threatened  and the centrality and contribution of the United Nations system to development must be restored.Those objectives require the building of a new international consensus suited to our time and rooted in today’s realities. It is only such a plan of action that will enable the United Nations to meet the twin tests of legitimacy  and effectiveness and efficiency.We commend your choice of the theme of this session. Setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda is especially important as we deal with a lingering global economic slowdown and continuing volatility in financial markets. These have imposed disproportionately heavy costs on developing countries and the vulnerable groups within them.Growth and inclusive development are naturally important for all our countries. They require a supportive international economic environment  enhanced investment flows  including from multilateral development banks  the transfer of technology  and an open multilateral trading regime.But the problems of the more than 1 billion people living in abject poverty around the world need to be attacked more directly. Poverty remains a major political and economic challenge  and its eradication requires special attention and a new collective thrust. That priority should anchor the post-2015 development agenda  which should be shaped by the Member States so that it enjoys the broadest possible support and acceptance.Issues of peace  security  human rights and governance are important and need to be addressed. But we will fall short of realizing an ambitious post-2015 development agenda if we focus merely on governance issues at the cost of robust economic growth. This agenda should not be merely about reprioritizing domestic spending  but also about fostering genuine international partnerships between developing and developed countries to bring about change. All of us need the policy space necessary to set our own domestic priorities. No one knows the condition of developing countries better than the developing countries themselves. It is therefore important that the United Nations set clear and concise goals and provide practical and well-defined means of implementation  including an adequate flow of resources and the transfer of technology  taking the views of developing countries fully into account.A meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally high priority on food and nutrition  health  education  infrastructure  water  sanitation  energy and combating discrimination against women. Especially critical is women’s equal access to economic opportunities and ensuring that they do not become victims of violence or the targets of prejudice.In India  we have sought to promote inclusive development in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened access to education and secured rural livelihoods. We are now building the world’s largest programme for food security. Digital technology is being harnessed to improve the delivery of public services and benefits to the people.India is proud of its partnerships with developing countries. Using modest resources  we have built strong ties with Africa and the least developed countries. We are committed to building 100 institutions in Africa and have offered capacity-building support  including thousands of scholarships  and made available over $9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa are engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit process. We also look forward to participating actively in the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in Samoa in 2014  and to contributing to its outcome.Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times. We must summon the political will necessary to craft a robust global response to climate change on the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.We are deeply concerned about the future of West Asia  a region with which India shares deep bonds of history and one that is critical for our energy security as well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million Indians who work and live in the region. Not only is the increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for the people of Syria  but it also threatens stability and security in the region and beyond. It has been made worse by the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons  whosoever may have deployed them  must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. India strongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons material and equipment in Syria.There is no military solution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to end the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is essential that the “Geneva II” conference be convened at the earliest opportunity.We are encouraged that direct talks have resumed between Israel and Palestine. India supports the early realization of a sovereign  independent  viable and united State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  living within secure and recognized borders  side by side and at peace with Israel. We also remain committed to the Palestinian quest for full membership in the United Nations.In our own region  Afghanistan prepares for a historic political  security and economic transition. The international community must support the people of Afghanistan through this transition and beyond in combating terrorism  preserving the progress of the past decade and creating a stable  united and prosperous Afghanistan.Terrorism remains a grave threat to security and stability everywhere and exacts a heavy toll of innocent lives around the world. From Africa to Asia  we have seen several manifestations of this menace in the last few days alone. State-sponsored  cross-border terrorism is of particular concern to India  also on account of the fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is located in our neighbourhood  in Pakistan.From this rostrum yesterday  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning (see A/68/PV.15). I reciprocate his sentiments and am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India is sincerely committed to resolving all issues with Pakistan  including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir  through bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla Agreement. However  for progress to be made  it is imperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas under its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting terrorism directed against India. It is equally important that the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance from Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear understanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and that there can never  ever  be a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity of India.We need to renew our commitment  especially here at the United Nations  to concerted  cohesive and continuing global action against terrorism. There can be no tolerance for States sheltering  arming  training or financing terrorists. Nor can States absolve themselves of the responsibility to prevent their territories from being used to launch acts of terrorism.The increasingly complex challenges to international peace and security require a new international consensus to be built  whether it is in the field of cybersecurity  non-proliferation or terrorism. This year  25 years after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi put forward a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world order  we must strengthen efforts against nuclear proliferation and pursue time-bound  universal  non-discriminatory  phased and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We must also guard against terrorists and non-State actors gaining access to sensitive materials and technologies.Two years from now  the United Nations will be 70 years old. Every new State born during that period of 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just with pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be a time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the United Nations is ready for this century  by completing much-needed reforms of the Organization and its Security Council  developing an ambitious and balanced post-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our capacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and security in the world we live in."
"78",3268,"IRL",68,2013,"Every day  the peoples of the world whom we are privileged to represent in the General Assembly look on in helpless horror at the slaughter in Syria. They can see gassed children lined out  dead  on their television screens. They can access online the facts about the 100 000 Syrians who have been killed; the 4 million who have been displaced; and the 2 million or more who have been driven into refugee camps in Turkey  Lebanon and Jordan.The peoples who have sent us  Government leaders and diplomats  to speak for them in this Hall are asking  “Why can we not stop this slaughter and this suffering?” They see the conflict in real time. It is not taking place in a remote part of the planet. Its brutality is made more visible by modern technology. The utterly callous attack in Ghouta on 21 August marked a new low in the endless litany of horrors.From the very outset  Ireland has consistently argued that the United Nations and the Security Council must be central to any efforts to resolve the crisis and ensure that international law and basic human rights are upheld. And while it has taken much longer than we would all have wished  I welcome the decisive action the Security Council has now taken on Syria.Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) marks a watershed in the international community’s engagement on the crisis. It offers renewed hope and confidence that the United Nations is capable of discharging its responsibilities and meeting the aspirations and expectations of the peoples of the world. The resolution builds on the vital breakthrough achieved by the United States and Russia in agreeing to a framework for the complete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons. Full compliance by the Syrian regime with its obligations is imperative. Ireland has already pledged €200 000 in funding to support the vital role of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  assisted by the United Nations  in implementing those arrangements.Crucially  the Security Council has called for the early convening of an international conference to address all aspects of the conflict. The inescapable reality is that the crisis can be resolved only politically  not militarily. I am greatly encouraged by the indications that the “Geneva II” conference could be held within a matter of weeks. Peace can come only through all Syrians engaging in a genuinely inclusive process aimed at agreeing a new political dispensation in their country.The Security Council has expressed its conviction that there must also be accountability for what has occurred in Syria. The International Criminal Court exists precisely for that purpose. We owe it to the Syrian people to ensure that those responsible for the war crimes committed against them are brought to justice. There is also an urgent need to remove impediments to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Violence against civilians must cease. All parties must facilitate unimpeded access to people in need throughout Syria and guarantee the safety and security of humanitarian personnel who perform their duties at enormous personal risk.The humanitarian efforts being made by Syria’s neighbours  including Turkey  Jordan and Lebanon  are remarkable and deserve far more support from the international community. We should not underestimate the strain being imposed on those countries and the threats being posed to refugee populations. Ireland has contributed $15 million to the humanitarian operation  and we stand ready to do more within our means.Elsewhere in the Middle East  we also see the prospect of progress. In Ireland  we know what it takes to make peace after a protracted conflict. I want to acknowledge the work being done in the current direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators  which all who wish for peace must welcome. I want to commend in particular the determination and engagement of United States Secretary of State John Kerry  who has done so much to bring that about  and the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu  who have had to accept difficult choices to begin the process of negotiation. We all know  and they know  that many more difficult choices lie before them if they are to succeed and to secure a comprehensive peace settlement. They deserve all our support.We are also encouraged by the stated determination of the new Iranian Government to address the concerns of the international community and build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. We look forward to Iran’s serious engagement in meaningful negotiations  leading to full compliance with all of its international obligations  and hope that that will also contribute to the creation of a positive dynamic in the Middle East region.Ireland currently participates in seven United Nations peacekeeping missions  including each of the three missions in the Middle East. In response to a request of the Secretary-General  we are deploying Irish personnel to reinforce the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights. We are doing so to help ensure that UNDOF can continue to implement its mandate at a difficult time. Ireland’s deployment to that challenging mission is a signal of our deep commitment to the peacekeeping role of the United Nations. The Irish people are rightly proud of these soldiers and of the record of our Defence Forces  members of our police service and Irish civilians deployed in the cause of peace.I join other speakers at this rostrum in condemning the recent attack in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi  which left dozens of innocent people dead and almost 200 injured. It was a chilling reminder that well-organized and ruthless international terrorist groups and networks are constantly searching for new locations and targets for atrocities. My profound sympathy and that of the people of Ireland go out to the victims of the attack and their families. We must be vigilant against terror and resolute in refusing to compromise our values in the face of such threats.Many factors contribute to human suffering. Violent conflict  such as that in Syria  is one — and the toll of casualties there is escalating daily. But there are many parts of the world where underdevelopment  malnutrition and disease exact an even greater toll. Around the globe  870 million people — almost 200 times the entire population of Ireland — are living in extreme poverty and hunger. Every single day  18 000 children die needlessly from preventable causes in the poorest and least developed regions of the world; 7 000 of them are children under the age of 5  who die because they are undernourished. One in every four children is stunted  most of them in the poorest countries. And every day  800 women die because of complications during pregnancy and childbirth  for basic reasons that could have been prevented. Reversing those trends and creating a better future for the countless millions of impoverished people on our planet is  perhaps  the greatest moral and practical challenge we face today. We can  of course  draw inspiration and hope from our successes. And there have been successes. Thirteen years ago  at the United Nations  world leaders committed to taking tangible  measurable action to tackle global poverty. Huge progress has been made since then under the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Significant numbers of people have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of children are receiving primary education. Two billion people have access to improved water supplies  and HIV/AIDS and other diseases and pandemics are being tackled.Nevertheless  fresh global challenges  such as climate change  are beginning to undermine the progress made. Communities in developing countries that have contributed least to the causes of climate change are suffering most from its effects. That is an injustice — clear and simple. It is a matter of fundamental human rights and equity. And it is critical for the future of all of our children  in a world which is reaching the limits of environmental sustainability  that this injustice be reversed.I had the privilege of taking part in this week’s special event on the Millennium Development Goals and co-chairing one of the round-table sessions. Ireland is proud to have co-facilitated the special event with South Africa and to have achieved an outcome document that will guide negotiations over the next two years on completing the MDGs and crafting the post-2015 development agenda.I believe that when world leaders gather at the United Nations in 2015  we can and should be ready to adopt a new set of global goals aimed at achieving a sustainable  just and secure world for the future. I want to see a clear commitment to ending extreme poverty and hunger in a generation. I want to see specific commitments in relation to the empowerment of women and girls. And I want to see an integrated approach on climate change and a strong focus on climate-sensitive agriculture.In our own aid programme  my Government has prioritized hunger and malnutrition  a theme that resonates with Ireland’s own history. We have a very simple message about the vital importance of investment in nutrition for mothers and babies. We are leading supporters of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement  and we are committed to doubling our aid spending on nutrition by 2016.Ireland is today emerging from several years of an economic crisis that will soon be behind us. After many tough decisions and a lot of hard work  we are about to safely exit an international bailout and our economy is back on track. I am proud to say that despite the extremely difficult circumstances many Irish people find themselves in  we have sustained our commitment to the provision of development aid. I know that we are ready to play our part in a new global partnership  and that it is only through this body  the United Nations  that it can be achieved.It is a matter of great pride to my country that Ireland was last year elected for the first time to the Human Rights Council. I warmly thank the Member States for their support in the election and the confidence they have placed in us. Ireland played a lead role in the adoption of two important resolutions by the Human Rights Council this week — one on preventable mortality of children under five; the other recognizing the important role played by civil society at the local  national  regional and international levels.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the Assembly states that recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world. It also states that those human rights should be protected in law. Today  instead of offering protection  we increasingly see legal measures being adopted to discriminate against people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. I welcome the courageous leadership shown by the Secretary-General when he promised in April to lead a global campaign for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender rights. Ireland pledges its full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General  both here in the General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council.Ireland is a small State that is deeply committed to the United Nations and to the principles enshrined in its Charter. We are proud to contribute to the important efforts of the United Nations in peacekeeping  in conflict resolution  in development aid and in humanitarian action. There can be no doubt that the United Nations is the unique and indispensable forum where the peoples of the world share their collective concerns and determine to take action to make the world a better and a safer place.The membership of this Organization has conferred primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security on the Security Council. Accordingly  we look to the Council to show leadership in response to international crises. Membership of the Council is a privilege for any State  and Ireland has been honoured to serve on it on a number of occasions. But the permanent members of the Security Council have a special responsibility to work together in a way that enables the United Nations to live up to the commitments made in its Charter. When the United Nations fails  or delays action  we are all the poorer for such setbacks. But when the United Nations works  we can achieve great things together. And those successes  such as the definition of a post-2015 development agenda  should serve as an inspiration and a springboard for the international community’s responses to the other great challenges of our time."
"79",3315,"IRN",68,2013,"Mr. President  at the outset  I would like to offer my most sincere felicitations on your deserved election as President of the General Assembly and to seize the moment to express appreciation for the valuable efforts of the Secretary-General.Our world today is replete with fear and hope — fear of war and hostile regional and global relations; fear of deadly confrontation between religious  ethnic and national identities; fear of the institutionalization of violence and extremism; fear of poverty and destructive discrimination; fear of decay and the destruction of life-sustaining resources; fear of the disregard for human dignity and rights; and fear of the neglect of morality. Alongside those fears  however  there are new hopes — the hope of the universal acceptance of “yes to peace and no to war” by the people and the elite all across the globe; and the hope that dialogue will be preferred over conflict and moderation over extremism.The recent election in Iran represents a clear  living example of the wise choice for hope  rationality and moderation by the great people of Iran. The realization of democracy consistent with religion and the peaceful transfer of executive power showed that Iran is an anchor of stability in an ocean of regional instabilities. The firm belief of our people and Government in enduring peace  stability  tranquillity  the peaceful resolution of disputes and the reliance on the ballot box as the basis of power  public acceptance and legitimacy has indeed played a key role in creating such a safe environment.The current critical period of transition in international relations is replete with dangers  albeit also with unique opportunities. Any miscalculation of one’s own position  and of course those of others  will cause damage on a historic scale; a mistake by one actor will have a negative impact on all others. Vulnerability is now a global and indivisible phenomenon.At this sensitive juncture in the history of global relations  the age of zero-sum games is over  even though a few actors still tend to rely on archaic and deeply ineffective ways and means of preserving their old superiority and domination. Militarism and the recourse to violent and military means for the purposes of subjugating others have shown themselves to be failed examples of the perpetuation of old ways in new circumstances.Coercive economic and military policies and practices geared to the maintenance and preservation of old superiorities and domination have been pursued in a conceptual mindset that negates peace  security  human dignity and exalted human ideals. Ignoring differences between societies and globally imposing Western values as universal values represent further manifestations of that conceptual mindset. Yet another reflection of the same cognitive model is the persistence of the Cold War mentality and the bipolar division of the world into the “superior us” and the “inferior other”. Fanning fear and phobia around the emergence of new actors on the world scene is still another.In such an environment  governmental and non-governmental  religious  ethnic and even racial violence has increased  and there is no guarantee that the era of quiet among major Powers will remain inviolate under the pressure of such violent discourse  practices and actions. The catastrophic impact of violent and extremist narratives should not — in fact  must not — be underestimated.In that context  the strategic violence that is manifested in efforts to deprive regional players of their natural domain of action  containment policies  regime change from the outside and efforts to redraw political borders and frontiers  is extremely dangerous and provocative. The prevalent international political discourse depicts a civilized centre surrounded by uncivilized peripheries. In that scenario  the relation between the centre of world power and the peripheries is hegemonic. The discourse that assigns centre stage to the North while relegating the South to the periphery has led to the establishment of a monologue in international relations. The creation of illusory identity distinctions and the current prevalent violent forms of xenophobia are the inevitable outcome of such discourse. Propagandistic and unfounded faith-phobic  Islamophobic  Shiaphobic and Iranophobic discourse indeed represents a serious threat to world peace and human security. That propagandistic discourse has assumed dangerous proportions through the portrayal and inculcation of presumed imaginary threats. One such imaginary threat is the so-called Iranian threat  which has been employed as an excuse to justify a long catalogue of crimes and catastrophic practices over the past three decades. The arming of the Saddam Hussein regime with chemical weapons and support for the Taliban and Al-Qaida are just two examples of such catastrophes. Let me say in all sincerity before this world Assembly that  based on irrefutable evidence  those who harp on the so-called threat of Iran are either a threat against international peace and security themselves or promote such a threat. Iran poses absolutely no threat to the world or to the region. In fact  in its ideals as well as in actual practice  my country has been a harbinger of just peace and comprehensive security.Nowhere in the world has violence been so deadly and destructive as in North Africa and West Asia. Military intervention in Afghanistan  Saddam Hussein’s imposed war against Iran  the occupation of Kuwait  military interventions against Iraq  the brutal repression of the Palestinian people  the assassination of ordinary people and political figures in Iran and terrorist bombings in countries such as Iraq  Afghanistan and Lebanon are examples of the acts of violence committed in that region in the past three decades.What has been and continues to be practiced against the innocent people of Palestine is nothing less than structural violence. Palestine is under occupation; the basic rights of the Palestinians are being tragically violated  and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes  birthplace and homeland. Apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression committed against the innocent Palestinian people.The human tragedy in Syria represents a painful example of the catastrophic spread of violence and extremism in our region. From the very outset of the crisis  when certain regional and international actors helped to militarize the situation through the infusion of arms and intelligence into the country and active support for extremist groups  we emphasized that there was no military solution to the Syrian crisis. The pursuit of expansionist strategies and objectives and attempts to change the regional balance through proxies cannot be camouflaged behind humanitarian rhetoric. The common objective of the international community should be a quick end to the killing of the innocent. While condemning any use of chemical weapons  we welcome Syria’s acceptance of the Chemical Weapons Convention and believe that access by extremist terrorist groups to such weapons poses the greatest possible danger to the region and must be considered in any disarmament plan. Simultaneously  I would underline that any illegitimate and ineffective threat of use  or the actual use of  force will only lead to the further exacerbation of violence and crisis in the region.Terrorism and the killing of innocent persons represent the ultimate inhumanity of extremism and violence. Terrorism is a violent scourge and knows no national borders. But violence and extreme actions  such as the use of drones  against innocent people in the name of combating terrorism should also be condemned. Here I should also like to say a word about the criminal assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. For what crimes were they assassinated? The United Nations and its Security Council should answer this question — have the perpetrators been condemned?Unjust sanctions  as a manifestation of structural violence  are intrinsically inhumane and against peace. Contrary to the claims of those who pursue and impose them  it is not the States and the political elite that are targeted; rather  it is the common people who are victimized by such sanctions. Let us not forget the millions of Iraqis who  as a result of sanctions cloaked in international legal jargon  suffered and lost their lives  and the many more who continue to suffer throughout their lives. Those sanctions are violent  pure and simple  whether called smart or otherwise  unilateral or multilateral. They violate inalienable human rights  inter alia  the right to peace  the right to development  the right to access to health and education  and  above all  the right to life. Sanctions  beyond any and all rhetoric  cause belligerence  warmongering and human suffering. It should be borne in mind  however  that their negative impact is not limited merely to their intended victims; it also affects the economy and livelihood of other countries and societies  including the countries imposing sanctions.Today violence and extremism have gone beyond the physical realm and  unfortunately  have afflicted and tarnished the mental and spiritual dimensions of life in human societies. Violence and extremism leave no space for understanding and moderation as the necessary foundations of the collective life of human beings and modern society. Intolerance is the predicament of our time. We need to promote and reinforce tolerance in the light of the religious teachings and appropriate cultural and political approaches. Human society should be elevated from a state of mere tolerance to one of collective collaboration. We should not just tolerate others. We should rise above mere tolerance and dare to work together.People the world over are tired of war  violence and extremism. They are hoping for a change in the status quo. This is a unique opportunity for us all. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that all challenges can be managed successfully through a smart  judicious blend of hope and moderation. Warmongers are bent on extinguishing all hope. But hope for change for the better is an innate  religious  widespread and universal concept.Hope is founded on the belief in the universal will of the people across the globe to combat violence and extremism  to cherish change  to oppose imposed structures  to value choice and to act in accordance with human responsibility. Hope is without a doubt one of the greatest gifts bestowed upon human beings by their all-loving Creator. And moderation means to think and move in a wise  judicious manner  conscious of time and space  and to align exalted ideals with a choice of effective strategies and policies  while remaining cognizant of objective realities.The Iranian people  in a judiciously sober choice in the recent elections  voted for the discourse of hope  foresight and prudent moderation  both at home and abroad. In foreign policy  the combination of those elements means that the Islamic Republic of Iran  as a regional power  will act responsibly with regard to regional and international security and is willing and prepared to cooperate in these fields  bilaterally as well as multilaterally  with other responsible actors. We defend peace based on democracy and the ballot box everywhere  including in Syria  Bahrain and other countries of the region  and believe that there are no violent solutions to world crises. The bitter and ugly realities of human society can be overcome only through recourse to and reliance on human wisdom  interaction and moderation. Peace  democracy and the legitimate rights of all countries in the world  including in the Middle East  cannot and will not be secured through militarism.Iran seeks to resolve problems  not to create them. There is no issue or dossier that cannot be resolved through reliance on hope  prudent moderation  mutual respect and the rejection of violence and extremism. Iran’s nuclear dossier is a case in point. As clearly stated by the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran  acceptance of Iran’s inalienable rights constitutes the best and easiest way of resolving this issue. This is not political rhetoric. Rather  it is based on a profound recognition of the state of technology in Iran  the global political environment  the end of the era of zero-sum games and the imperative of seeking common objectives and interests in order to reach common understanding and shared security. Put otherwise  Iran and other actors should pursue two common objectives as two mutually inseparable parts of a political solution for Iran’s nuclear dossier.First  Iran’s nuclear programme — and for that matter  that of all other countries — must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes. I declare here  openly and unambiguously  that  notwithstanding others’ positions  this has been and always will be the objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran’s security and defence doctrine  and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions. Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme.The second objective — acceptance of and respect for the implementation of the right to enrichment inside Iran and the enjoyment of other related nuclear rights — provides the only path towards achieving the first objective. Nuclear knowledge in Iran has now been domesticated and nuclear technology  including enrichment  has already reached an industrial scale. It is therefore an illusion and extremely unrealistic to presume that the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme could be ensured by impeding the programme via illegitimate pressures.In this context  the Islamic Republic of Iran  insisting on enjoying its rights and the imperative of international respect and cooperation in this exercise  is prepared to engage immediately in time-bound and results-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and ensure the removal of mutual uncertainties with full transparency.Iran seeks constructive engagement with other countries based on mutual respect and common interests and  within the same framework  does not seek to increase tensions with the United States. I listened carefully to the statement made by President Obama today in the General Assembly. With efforts commensurate with the political will of the leadership in the United States  and hoping that they will refrain from following the short-sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups  we can arrive at a framework to manage our differences. To this end  equal footing  mutual respect and the recognized principles of international law should govern our interactions. Of course  we expect to hear a consistent message from Washington  D. C.In recent years  a dominant message has been heard reiterating again and again that the military option is on the table. Against the backdrop of this illegal and ineffective assertion  let me say loud and clear that peace is within reach. So  on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran  I propose  as a first step  the consideration by the United Nations of a project to be known as “A World Against Violence and Extremism”. Let us all ride this wave. I invite all States  international organizations and civil institutions to undertake a new effort to guide the world in this direction. We should start thinking about a coalition for enduring peace across the entire globe instead of ineffective coalitions for war in various parts of the world.Today  the Islamic Republic of Iran urges the Assembly and the entire world community to take a step forward by accepting our invitation to join A World Against Violence and Extremism. We should accept and be able to open up new horizons in which peace will prevail over war  tolerance over violence  progress over bloodshed  justice over discrimination  prosperity over poverty and freedom over despotism. As beautifully stated by Ferdowsi  the renowned Iranian epic poet:“Be relentless in striving for the cause of good;Bring the spring  you must; Banish the winter  you should.”Notwithstanding all the difficulties and challenges before us  I am deeply optimistic about the future. I have no doubt that the future will be bright  with the entire world solidly rejecting violence and extremism. Prudent moderation will ensure a bright future for the world. My hope  aside from personal and national experience  emanates from the belief shared by all divine religions that a good and bright future awaits the world. As stated in the Holy Koran:“And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land  My righteous servants shall inherit it.” (The Holy Koran  XXI:105)"
"80",3362,"IRQ",68,2013,"I have great pleasure in participating in the current session of the General Assembly to discuss the vital issue of post-2015 sustainable development and the achievement of its goals  which we all hope to be able to accomplish.Having overcome the serious consequences of the economic  political and social policies pursued by the former regime  which were not based on scientific grounds but on the regime’s personal reckless whims  Iraq has sought to translate what was agreed upon by world leaders in 2000  notably the development goals  into practical and concrete steps. By adopting plans  strategies and enacting laws that provide for the necessary mechanisms  Iraq has endeavoured to achieve the essence of sustainable development  namely  the integration of its three dimensions: economic  environmental and social.Iraq has been working on financial and monetary policies to increase the financial flows to its public budget  which is expected to reach approximately $150 billion in 2015  40 per cent of which is envisioned to be allocated to the requisite investment expenditure in order to provide basic services  improve infrastructure and strengthen the Iraqi economy.Iraq is expected to achieve steady growth in the economic sectors through its 2013-2017 development plan. However  oil is still the main engine driving the other sectors  thanks to Iraq’s abundant oil and gas reserves  which surpass confirmed reserve estimates by a very large margin. Estimates put the potential of extractable oil reserves at 250 billion barrels and that of gas at more than 250 trillion cubic feet.We expect to double oil production by the end of the 2013-2017 development plan  with a steady increase in oil exports  which are expected to reach approximately 3 750 000 barrels per day in 2015. Therefore  the 2010-2014 development plan focuses on environmental sustainability and the green economy in Iraq. Strategic goals have been identified for the aforementioned plan and for the 2013-2017 National Development Plan  which was recently approved by the Council of Ministers  as follows:First  a poverty alleviation strategy will be adopted as one of the components for the attainment of sustainable development. The poverty rate fell from 23 per cent in 2007 to 19 per cent in 2012  and it is hoped that it will fall further  to 16 per cent  in 2017.Second  the unemployment rate was reduced from 15 per cent in 2007 to 11 per cent in 2012  with an expected decline to 6 per cent in 2017.Third  the average per capita income increased from $3 000 in 2009 to nearly $6 000 in 2012  with an annual growth rate of 15.9 per cent  clearly indicating noticeable economic progress.Fourth  infant mortality must be reduced to 18 deaths per 1 000 births in 2017. It is noteworthy that those figures fell from 32 deaths per 1 000 births in 2011 to 22 deaths per 1 000 births in 2013. The plan also aims at reducing the mortality rate for children under five years of age to 24 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2017  following the decline from 37 in 2011 to 28 deaths in 2013.Fifth  primary school enrolment must increase to 95 per cent in 2017 from its 2012 figure of 92 per cent.Sixth  the plan focuses on increasing secondary school enrolment to 40 per cent and that of universities to 20 per cent by 2017.Seventh  the plan works to curb desertification through the expansion of land reclamation  where approximately 4 million dunums have been reclaimed. We hope to reclaim 2.5 million additional dunums by the end of the plan.Eighth  it also advocates utilizing modern techniques in irrigation and increasing the latent energy of water resources by focusing on the economic exploitation thereof.Ninth  it plans to minimize the quantities of burned gases associated with oil production by devising plans for full investment therein in 2015.Tenth  it is hoped that  by beginning the implementation of a housing programme for the poor and limited-income people  1 million housing units will be available by the end of the plan.Eleventh  the plan also includes achieving self-sufficiency in terms of electricity production  which is envisioned to reach 22 000 megawatts in 2015. That means a 15 per cent surplus over peak consumption  while the production of electricity in 2003 was around 2 500 megawatts.In that connection  we deem it necessary to emphasize the following significant points during the sixty-eighth session.First  Iraq calls for strengthened international cooperation  particularly South-South cooperation  and we call upon the international community to fulfil its financial obligations in relation to achieving sustainable development.Second  we favour facilitating the transfer of technology to developing countries  so as to reduce the gap between them and the developed world and contribute to solving the problems caused by global warming and climate change.Third  we aim to address the problems caused by water scarcity  which has destabilized certain regions of the world  and we stress the need to determine fair water quotas among riparian States on international rivers.Fourth  we want to extend special support for people suffering from the effects of international conflict and international economic sanctions  which constitute significant obstacles to the attainment of sustainable development.Fifth  we intend to appropriately address pressures caused by unsustainable production and consumption patterns  particularly in the areas of deforestation  water scarcity  food waste and elevated carbon emissions.Sixth  we will focus on building effective and accountable institutions; promoting the rule of law  property rights  the freedom of expression and information  in addition to the administration of justice and the fight against corruption.Seventh  we want to ensure that the post-2015 plan is underpinned by a new spirit of solidarity  responsibility  cooperation and integration built on a common understanding of our humanity and on mutual respect through the involvement of more participants from among women  the poor  civil society and local governments  academia and philanthropic institutions and charities.Eighth  we will advocate for the need for Governments to play a leading role in the field of education and the need to recognize that education is a shared responsibility between families  local communities and civil society organizations  which all must contribute to the improvement and development of education and its ways and means.Ninth  in addition to securing international cooperation and integration to help address the issues of sustainable development and the fight against extreme poverty  we hope to include  as one of the priorities  the achievement of the objectives of sustainable development beyond 2015 and the elimination of violence against women  and to achieve gender equality with appropriate work and decision-making positions  as well as comprehensive economic and social security..Tenth  we stress the importance of existing standards in the field of human rights  the right to compensation for victims and equity in cases of human rights violations.Eleventh  we look forward to the completion of tasks by the Working Group that came out of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  on financing for development  as well as to the creation of sound foundations in the field of financing the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda in a sustainable and predictable fashion.I must stress  however  that no pre-2015 or post-2015 development is attainable with the existence of organized terrorism  which thrives on the blood of innocents and claims their lives. That scourge has adopted extremism as its approach  death as its craft  violence as its means  hatred as its culture and senseless and indiscriminate murder as its hobby and pastime. Such a phenomenon calls for a strict and pragmatic stance by the entire world  so as to face up to terrorism’s brutal  ferocious  crazed and destructive attacks. International cooperation must seek to dry up the financial  intellectual and armament resources of terrorism  so as to save humanity from that scourge and the universe from its effects and dangers and the harm it inflicts.We also wish to reiterate that no sustainable development can be achieved while the drums of war are beating in more than one place in the world  because the concepts of peace  development and life cannot be upheld in conjunction with the will to bring about death  war and genocide. Nor can development be achieved in the absence of peace and security. There will therefore be no political stability or social development without peaceful coexistence  security and stability  where human beings can rest and have shelter.Against that backdrop  Iraq reiterates its calls and initiatives for a peaceful solution for each and every land where gunfire  bloodshed and the smell of death prevail  and where people witness scenes of destruction. That is because the logic of force cannot produce peace  nor can instruments of death or war mills bring about security or create development or growth.Hence  we in Iraq  whose people have suffered tremendously from the horrors of war caused by the recklessness and folly of the defunct Saddam regime  are deeply concerned by the worsening events and tense situation on our borders with Syria  a country with which we have borders over 600 kilometres long. That is why we consider the Syrian armed conflict a serious threat to our security and stability and to the integrity of our land and people.For that reason  we insist on putting forward our initiative to resolve the Syrian crisis politically in order to avoid a devastating humanitarian disaster unfolding in our neighbouring country and on our borders  which could undermine all aspects of the development  stability and prosperity that we and other States aspire to achieve in our vitally important region. Therefore  I invite the Assembly to support the Iraqi initiative in its effort to ensure peace  security and stability. Otherwise  developments in the region could take an unpredictable turn.Our region is beleaguered by concerns that regional and large-scale wars may erupt or be triggered by a small spark. No one can guess the scale  trends  trajectory or duration of such conflicts. There can be no hope for sustainable development  stability or prosperity in a region that is already fragile  volatile  explosive and complex. That is the message of the Government and the people of Iraq to the Assembly.In the aftermath of the fall of the dictatorial regime  Iraq has opted for democratic mechanisms as the sole means of ensuring the peaceful rotation of power  for we believe in the freedom  dignity and rights of human beings. We have adopted an open-door foreign policy in our relations with the international community  and are always looking for common denominators to overcome disagreement through positive dialogue based on justice and responsible involvement with neighbouring countries  our region and the world.We are firmly convinced that peaceful solutions are the most effective means to settle all problems between peoples  nations and Governments. We reject violence  terrorism and aggression  irrespective of their sources. Internally  we have called for tolerance  national reconciliation and cooperation  with a view to attaining communal coexistence  social peace  stability and prosperity. These principles were formally adopted by the National Conference for Social Peace that was held recently in Baghdad and signed with the code of national honour by most of Iraq’s leaders and national representatives.Iraq suffered more than two decades under international sanctions because of the invasion of brotherly Kuwait under the previous regime. However  today the new Iraq has managed  through its cooperation with the international community and the development of good-neighbourly relations with Kuwait  to overcome the effects of the sanctions. Furthermore  Iraq worked with the Security Council towards the adoption of its resolution 2107 (2013)  of 27 June 2013  which put an end to Iraq’s obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus  the crises and problems suffered by the two brotherly countries of Iraq and Kuwait are now part of the past. Today  we look forward together to developing our new relations as a springboard and a solid foundation for a prosperous future for generations to come that will have positive effects on the entire region.Our faith in humankind does not preclude us from taking up the just cause of the oppressed  the disadvantaged and the vulnerable  or from showing solidarity with the just causes of our Arab and Islamic nation  raising our voices in defence of their rights  their humanity and their causes. Foremost among those is the cause of the Palestinian people  who are still suffering from systematic oppression and ongoing settlement activities that violate their rights and threaten their identity and existence. The situation requires the world and its international institutions to assume their due roles and responsibilities and stand by a people who seek only the realization of their rights  freedom  justice and independence and the establishment of a viable Palestinian State  without which the Middle East region will remain prone to tension and instability.For the sake of a Middle East living in peace and security  we reiterate the call for the establishment of a Middle East free of nuclear weapons  with an emphasis on the need to hold the Helsinki conference on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone as soon as possible. The failure of international efforts in that area would adversely affect the credibility of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which in turn could lead to an arms race  raising the levels of violence  tension and instability.While the United Nations is our agreed forum for international cooperation to address the problems and challenges that we face through multilateral negotiations  we believe that the time has come to reform its bodies  in particular the Security Council  as the primary body responsible for international peace and security  in order to make them consistent with the aspirations of the peoples of the world in the twenty-first century and more representative  transparent and able to meet the challenges they face.In conclusion  I take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Iraqi people  our sincere thanks and profound appreciation to all those who have contributed to helping Iraq lift the burden of Chapter VII from its shoulders. We wish each and every nation all over the world a free  safe and secure life with dignity and a promising prosperous future. Peace be upon the Assembly."
"81",3409,"ISL",68,2013,"Once again  we have witnessed outrageous acts of terrorism against innocent people  most recently in Kenya  Iraq and Pakistan. Our thoughts go out to the victims and their families. It is the primary responsibility of all Governments to protect their citizens. A few weeks ago  the world witnessed the use of chemical weapons in Syria. It is hard to find words strong enough to express our condemnation. International law has been violated  war crimes committed and globally shared values have been shattered. Those responsible must be held accountable and should answer to the International Criminal Court.The devastation inflicted on the Syrian people must end. A country is in ruins. Innocent lives are lost every day  more than 6 million people are displaced and stability in the region is threatened. The Syrian Government has not lived up to its responsibility towards its own citizens. It has retaliated with unabated violence instead of choosing a path of reform  reconciliation and improved rights for its people. The crisis calls for firm action to be taken by the international community. Syria must comply with its international obligations  and all parties to the conflict must respect humanitarian and human rights law. We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) and call on the Council to ensure that Syria fully meets its commitments. The Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522  annex) must also be honoured and a “Geneva II” conference convened urgently. The tragedy in Syria has once again underscored the fundamental importance of international law and order.Some of the greatest achievements of the United Nations are in the field of international law. Within these walls  the history of international relations continues to be written and brave new steps to be taken. The latest accomplishment is the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. Iceland is proud to have been the first State to ratify this landmark treaty. We call on all States — in particular arms exporters — to do so as well  so that it enters into force without delay.In the year 2000  world leaders gathered in this city and made a historic decision by adopting the Millennium Declaration. Since then  the Millennium Development Goals have served us well. For almost 15 years  they have influenced and guided the development priorities of nations and organizations. They have increased awareness of heartbreaking poverty and inspired new policymaking. The Millennium Development Goals are indeed central to Iceland’s development policy  and my Government is firmly committed to shouldering our responsibility in a globalized world. As new goals are defined  the focus should remain on eliminating poverty  achieving gender equality  improving health and providing education for girls and boys.The pressure on our ecosystem calls for urgent action to combat pollution and land degradation  as well as a balanced consideration of conservation and the utilization of natural resources. It is a challenge to ensure food security when land and water resources are threatened. Our duty is to share experiences and know-how to restore land and improve land management — to change deserts into blooming fields.Furthermore  climate change and disasters such as the one in Fukushima have taught us that a real energy transformation is needed. Safe  clean and renewable energy is the way of the future. Iceland has undergone a true energy revolution. Today  almost all of our electricity and heating needs are met with renewable energy. That success story is a source of a productive partnership between Iceland and the United Nations  and now also the World Bank.Our world is wealthy. That wealth is not only preserved in the minerals of the Earth  the power of the rivers and the rich living marine resources. Our greatest wealth is people — the knowledge  the experiences  the constant journey of the human mind to explore and invent new solutions.Iceland makes use of those assets in its development cooperation. We are proud to offer the world our expertise where it can make a real difference — for the development of geothermal energy  sustainable fisheries management  the restoration of fertile land and the promotion of gender equality. More than 2 500 experts from all parts of the world have benefited from the activities of the four United Nations university training programmes in Iceland since the first one was established 35 years ago. Iceland will focus on those same four topics in the post-2015 process. Let me emphasize that the process must be conducted in a true democratic spirit. It must be inclusive and allow for all Member States to participate.As I glance around the Assembly Hall  I am inspired by the history and success of the Organization  which represents the immense diversity and talent of humankind  and inspired by the potential for future positive action that the rich fabric of representatives from all Member States represents. But success should not blind our vision or cloud our judgement. The flaws of the Security Council have been sadly exposed in the case of Syria. Furthermore  the lack of organizational reform undermines the credibility of the United Nations.Much work remains undone in many areas. As long as people are mistreated for their views  race or religion  or even cast as outlaws for their sexual orientation or gender identity  human rights obligations are not honoured. We are alarmed that recent legislation in some countries is violating the fundamental principles of equality and the freedom of expression. The responsibility to change that and to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights rests with us politicians. By speaking from this rostrum  each and every one of us pledges to uphold those common values of the United Nations.The promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women is another urgent task. In 2015  we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women  held in Beijing. We call on all Member States to renew efforts to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Iceland has been advocating for celebrating the anniversary through a 12-month campaign  focusing on each of the 12 themes of Beijing. We note that UN Women is planning its strategy along those lines.A prominent element in the Beijing Declaration is the importance of the active engagement of women for democratic development. The women of the Arab world have given that objective a powerful new meaning in the past three years. Women assumed their rightful place and have called on their leaders to show real leadership. They call for respect for human rights and the equal treatment of women and men. They call for the freedom to express their views and to determine their own future through democratic processes.It is regrettable that developments in the region have been overshadowed by political discord and continued violence. We deplore the loss of lives and condemn all violence. We also call on the Governments in the region to demonstrate their commitment to democracy with concrete actions.The developments in the Middle East cannot be separated from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As United States President Obama said  the Palestinian people have a right to live with security and dignity in their own sovereign State. Israel’s security depends upon the realization of a Palestinian State  and stability will be served only through a two-State solution and a secure Israel. We welcome the renewed peace talks between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine and applaud United States Secretary Kerry for his commitment in that regard. We must respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination as well as Israel’s right to exist in peace with its neighbours. But time is running out.The continuing settlement activities  in violation of international law  threaten to make the two-State solution impossible. Therefore  the Government of Israel must end all settlements in the West Bank  including East Jerusalem. We denounce the oppressive policies of Hamas and condemn the indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza. We also call upon Israel to end the blockade of the territory.Respect for international law is fundamental for relations between States. If differences arise  we should always seek agreements through consultations  negotiations or other means for peaceful resolution. The principle of the rule of law  which is among the founding principles of the United Nations  is vital to us all — big nations and small.One international agreement that Iceland holds in high regard is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It was a great achievement when that important Convention was adopted 30 years ago  and it has proved its relevance by the test of time. The Law of the Sea Convention demonstrates how the international order can best work and prescribes how differences should be settled through peaceful means. The Convention provides a basis for sound resource management. However  meeting that objective is difficult for many States. The international community should do much more to support developing countries to better conserve and utilize their resources and reform their management policies. As a steadfast advocate of the Convention  Iceland is firmly committed to its provisions. We protest in the strongest terms when stakeholders resort to threats of coercive measures when differences arise.Icelanders know better than anyone that the health of the ocean and its resources must be preserved. It is fundamental for our existence and livelihood. The conservation  sound management and sustainable use of natural resources are principles that we follow strictly in our policies. We are sincere and serious in living up to the responsibility that comes with safeguarding the riches of the Earth. For the same reason  the eight Arctic States have developed productive regional cooperation. As the world witnesses the rapid changes in the Arctic  we who live in that corner of the world know how urgent it is to act and plan for the future. The delicate environment must be protected  economic opportunities developed and the needs of the people who live in the Arctic respected.As caretakers of the Arctic  we take our global duty very seriously. It was therefore a great pleasure and an honour for me to host the Secretary-General in Iceland last summer. During his visit  I demonstrated to him how the global impact of climate change melts the glaciers in the north. Following our trip to the central highlands  the Secretary-General observed that we had not only seen the ice disappear  we had also heard the most powerful sound of ice melting away.During his stay  the Secretary-General gave us Icelanders an insight into the work of the United Nations — how  every single day  the United Nations is making a difference in the lives of countless people around the world  helping refugees  providing humanitarian assistance and saving the lives of children. The United Nations is a force for good in the world. Together we can make a real difference; united we protect the environment  preserve peace and save lives. The more united we are  the better the world will become."
"82",3456,"ISR",68,2013,"I feel deeply honoured and privileged to stand here before the General Assembly today representing the citizens of the State of Israel. We are an ancient people. We date back nearly 4 000 years to Abraham  Isaac and Jacob. We have journeyed through time. We have overcome the greatest of adversities. And we re-established our sovereign State in our ancestral homeland  the land of Israel. The Jewish people’s odyssey through time has taught us two things: never give up hope and always remain vigilant. Hope charts the future  vigilance protects it.Today our hope for the future is challenged by a nuclear-armed Iran that seeks our destruction. But I want members to know that that was not always the case. Some 2 500 years ago  the great Persian King Cyrus ended the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people. He issued a famous edict in which he proclaimed the right of the Jews to return to the land of Israel and rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. That is a Persian decree  and thus began a historic friendship between the Jews and the Persians that lasted until modern times.But  in 1979  a radical regime in Tehran tried to stamp out that friendship. As it was busy crushing the Iranian people’s hopes for democracy  it also led wild chants of “Death to the Jews!” Since that time  presidents of Iran have come and gone. Some presidents were considered moderates  others hard-liners. But they have all served that same unforgiving creed  that same unforgiving regime — that creed that is espoused and enforced by the real power in Iran  the dictator known in Iran as the Supreme Leader  first Ayatollah Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei.President Rouhani  like the presidents who came before him  is a loyal servant of the regime. He was one of only six candidates the regime permitted to run for office. Nearly 700 other candidates were rejected. What made him acceptable? Rouhani headed Iran’s Supreme National Security Council from 1989 through 2003. During that time  Iran’s henchmen gunned down opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant. They murdered 85 people at the Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. They killed 19 American soldiers by blowing up the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Are we to believe that Rouhani  the national security adviser of Iran at the time  knew nothing about those attacks? Of course he did — just as 30 years ago Iran’s security chiefs knew about the bombings in Beirut that killed 241 American marines and 58 French paratroopers.Rouhani was also Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator between 2003 and 2005. He masterminded the strategy that enabled Iran to advance its nuclear-weapons programme behind a smokescreen of diplomatic engagement and very soothing rhetoric. I know that Rouhani does not sound like Ahmadinejad. But when it comes to Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme  the only difference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf’s clothing  Rouhani is a wolf in sheep’s clothing — a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community.Like everyone else  I wish we could believe Rouhani’s words  but we must focus on Iran’s actions. And it is the brazen contrast — that extraordinary contradiction between Rouhani’s words and Iran’s actions — that is so startling. Rouhani stood at this very rostrum last week and praised Iranian democracy (see A/68/PV.6). Iranian democracy  he said. But the regime that he represents executes political dissidents by the hundreds and jails them by the thousands. Rouhani spoke of “the human tragedy in Syria”. Yet Iran directly participates in Al-Assad’s murder and massacre of tens of thousands of innocent men  women and children in Syria  and that regime is propping up a Syrian regime that just used chemical weapons against its own people. Rouhani condemned the “violent scourge” of terrorism. Yet in the past three years alone Iran has ordered  planned or perpetrated terrorist attacks in 25 cities on five continents. Rouhani denounced “attempts to change the regional balance through proxies”. Yet Iran is actively destabilizing Lebanon  Yemen  Bahrain and many other Middle Eastern countries. Rouhani promises “constructive engagement with other countries”. Yet two years ago  Iranian agents tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador in Washington  D.C. Just three weeks ago  an Iranian agent was arrested while trying to collect information for possible attacks against the American Embassy in Tel Aviv. Some constructive engagement!I wish I could be moved by Rouhani’s invitation to join his “WAVE” — a world against violence and extremism. Yet the only waves Iran has generated in the past 30 years are waves of violence and terrorism that it has unleashed on the region and across the world. I wish I could believe Rouhani  but I do not because facts are stubborn things. The facts are that Iran’s savage record flatly contradicts Rouhani’s soothing rhetoric. Last Friday  Rouhani assured us that in pursuit of its nuclear programme  Iran had “never chosen deceit and secrecy.” Never chosen deceit and secrecy?In 2002  Iran was caught red-handed secretly building an underground centrifuge facility at Natanz. In 2009  Iran was again caught red-handed secretly building a huge underground nuclear facility for uranium enrichment in a mountain near Qom. Rouhani tells us not to worry. He assures us that all that is not intended for nuclear weapons. Does any here believe that? If so  here are a few questions to ask.Why would a country that claims to only want peaceful nuclear energy build hidden underground enrichment facilities? Why would a country with vast natural energy reserves invest billions in developing nuclear energy? Why would a country intent on merely having civilian nuclear programmes continue to defy multiple Security Council resolutions and incur the costs of crippling sanctions on its economy? And why would a country with a peaceful nuclear programme develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) whose sole purpose is to deliver nuclear warheads? You do not build ICBMs to carry TNT thousands of miles away. You build them for one purpose: to carry nuclear warheads. Iran is now building ICBMs that the United States says could reach this city in three or four years.Why would they do all that? The answer is simple. Iran is not building a peaceful nuclear programme. Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Last year alone  Iran enriched three tons of uranium to 3.5 per cent  doubled its stockpile of 20 per cent-enriched uranium and added thousands of new centrifuges  including advanced centrifuges. It also continued work on the heavy-water reactor in Arak in order to have another route to the bomb — a plutonium path. Since Rouhani’s election — and I stress this — that vast and feverish effort has continued unabated.Underground nuclear facilities? Heavy water reactors? Advanced centrifuges? ICBMs? It is not that it is hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear-weapons programme; it is hard to find evidence that Iran does not have a nuclear-weapons programme. Last year  when I spoke here at the United Nations (see A/67/PV.12)  I drew a red line. Iran has been very careful not to cross that line. But Iran is positioning itself to race across that line in future  at a time of its choosing. Iran wants to be in a position to rush forward to build nuclear bombs before the international community can detect it  much less prevent it. Yet Iran faces one big problem  and that problem is summed up in one word: sanctions.I have argued for many years  including from this rostrum  that the only way to peacefully prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is to combine tough sanctions with a credible military threat. That policy is today bearing fruit. Thanks to the efforts of many countries  many represented here  and under the leadership of the United States  tough sanctions have taken a big bite out of Iran’s economy. Oil revenues have fallen. The currency has plummeted. Banks are hard pressed to transfer money. As a result  the regime is under intense pressure from the Iranian people to get the sanctions removed. That is why Rouhani got elected in the first place. That is why he launched his charm offensive. He definitely wants to get the sanctions lifted — I guarantee the Assembly that — but he does not want to give up Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme in return.Here is the strategy to achieve that: first  smile a lot. Smiling never hurts. Secondly  pay lip service to peace  democracy and tolerance. Thirdly  offer meaningless concessions in exchange for lifting sanctions. Fourthly  and most important  ensure that Iran retains sufficient nuclear material and sufficient nuclear infrastructure to race to the bomb at a time that it chooses to do so. Why does Rouhani think he can get away with that? This is a ruse  a ploy. Why does Rouhani think he can get away with that? Because he has gotten away with it before. Because his strategy of talking a lot and doing little has worked for him in the past. He even brags about it. Here is what he said in his 2011 book about his time as Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator: “While we were talking to the Europeans in Tehran  we were installing equipment in Isfahan”. For those here who do not know  the Isfahan facility is an indispensable part of Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme. That is where uranium ore called yellowcake is converted into an enrichable form. Rouhani boasted: “By creating a calm environment  we were able to complete the work in Isfahan”. He fooled the world once; now he thinks he can fool it again. Rouhani thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it too.He has another reason to believe that he can get away with that  and that reason is called North Korea. Like Iran  North Korea also said its nuclear programme was for peaceful purposes. Like Iran  North Korea also offered meaningless concessions and empty promises in return for sanctions relief. In 2005  North Korea agreed to a deal that was celebrated the world over by many well-meaning people. Here is what a New York Times editorial had to say about it:“For years now  foreign policy insiders have pointed to North Korea as the ultimate nightmare ... a closed  hostile and paranoid dictatorship with an aggressive nuclear-weapons programme. Very few could envision a successful outcome. And yet North Korea agreed in principle this week to dismantle its nuclear-weapons programme  return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  abide by the Treaty’s safeguards and admit international inspectors.“Diplomacy  it seems  does work after all.” (New York Times  20 September 2005)A year later  North Korea exploded its first nuclear-weapon device.Yet as dangerous as a nuclear-armed North Korea is  it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran. A nuclear-armed Iran would have a chokehold on the world’s main energy supplies. It would trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East  turning the most unstable part of the planet into a nuclear tinderbox. And for the first time in history  it would make the spectre of nuclear terrorism a clear and present danger.A nuclear-armed Iran in the Middle East would not be another North Korea. It would be another 50 North Koreas. I know that some in the international community think that I am exaggerating that threat. Sure  they know that Iran’s regime leads these chants: “Death to America!”  “Death to Israel!”. Then it pledges to wipe Israel off the map. But they think that wild rhetoric is just bluster for domestic consumption. Have those people learned nothing from history? The last century has taught us that  when a radical regime with global ambitions gets awesome power  sooner or later its appetite for aggression knows no bounds. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century. And we cannot forget it.The world may have forgotten that lesson; the Jewish people have not. Iran’s fanaticism is not bluster. It is real. That fanatic regime must never be allowed to arm itself with nuclear weapons. I know that the world is weary of war. We in Israel know all too well the cost of war. But history has taught us that to prevent war tomorrow  we must be firm today.That raises the question: Can diplomacy stop that threat? The only diplomatic solution that would work is one that fully dismantles Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme and prevents it from having one in the future. President Obama rightly said that Iran’s conciliatory words must be matched by transparent  verifiable and meaningful action; and to be meaningful  a diplomatic solution would require Iran to do four things; first  cease all uranium enrichment  as called for by several Security Council resolutions; secondly  remove from Iran’s territory the stockpiles of enriched uranium; thirdly  dismantle the infrastructure for a nuclear-breakout capability  including the underground facility near Qom and the advanced centrifuges in Natanz; and  fourthly  stop all work at the heavy water-reactor in Arak aimed at the production of plutonium. Those steps would put an end to Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme and eliminate its breakout capability.There are those who would readily agree to leave Iran with a residual capability to enrich uranium. I advise them to pay close attention to what Rouhani said in a speech to Iran’s Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council published in 2005. This is what he said:“A country that can enrich uranium to about 3.5 per cent will also have the capability to enrich it to about 90 per cent. Having fuel-cycle capability virtually means that a country that possesses this capability is able to produce nuclear weapons.”Precisely: that is why Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme must be fully and verifiably dismantled. That is why the pressure on Iran must continue. Here is what the international community must do. First  keep up the sanctions. If Iran advances its nuclear-weapons programme during negotiations  strengthen the sanctions. Secondly  do not agree to a partial deal. A partial deal would lift the international sanctions that have taken years to put in place  in exchange for cosmetic concessions that will take only weeks for Iran to reverse. Thirdly  lift the sanctions only when Iran fully dismantles its nuclear-weapons programme.The international community has Iran on the ropes. If it wants to knock out Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme peacefully  do not let up on the pressure. Keep it up. We all want to give diplomacy with Iran a chance to succeed. But when it comes to Iran  the greater the pressure  the greater the chance. Three decades ago  President Ronald Reagan famously advised “trust but verify”. When it comes to Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme  here is my advice: distrust  dismantle and verify.Israel will never acquiesce to nuclear arms in the hands of a rogue regime that repeatedly promises to wipe us off the map. Against such a threat  Israel will have no choice but to defend itself. I want there to be no confusion on this point: Israel will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. If Israel is forced to stand alone  Israel will stand alone. Yet in standing alone  Israel will know that we will be defending many others.The dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and the emergence of other threats in our region have led many of our Arab neighbours to finally recognize that Israel is not their enemy. That affords us the opportunity to overcome historic animosities and build new relationships  new friendships and new hopes. Israel welcomes engagement with the wider Arab world. We hope that our common interests and common challenges will help us forge a more peaceful future.And Israel continues to seek a historic compromise with our Palestinian neighbours  one that ends our conflict once and for all. We want peace based on security and mutual recognition in which a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State of Israel.I remain committed to achieving a historic reconciliation and building a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. I have no illusions about how difficult it will be to achieve. Twenty years ago  the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians began. Six Israeli Prime Ministers — myself included — have not succeeded in achieving peace with the Palestinians. My predecessors were prepared to make painful concessions. So am I.But so far  Palestinian leaders have not been prepared to offer the painful concessions they must make in order to end the conflict. For peace to be achieved  the Palestinians must finally recognize the Jewish State and Israel’s security needs must be met. I am prepared to make a historic compromise for a genuine and enduring peace. But I will never compromise on the security of my people and of my country — the one and only Jewish State.One cold day in the late nineteenth century  my grandfather  Nathan  and his younger brother  Judah  were standing in a railway station in the heart of Europe. They were seen by a group of anti-Semitic hoodlums  who ran towards them waving clubs  screaming  “Death to the Jews!” My grandfather shouted to his younger brother to flee and save himself. And he then stood alone against the raging mob to slow it down. They beat him senseless. They left him for dead. Before he passed out  covered in his own blood  he said to himself: “What a disgrace! What a disgrace! The descendants of the Maccabees lie in the mud  powerless to defend themselves.” He promised himself then that if he lived  he would take his family to the Jewish homeland and help to build a future for the Jewish people.I stand here today as Israel’s Prime Minister because my grandfather kept that promise. So many other Israelis have a similar story: a parent or a grandparent who fled every conceivable oppression and went to Israel to start a new life in our ancient homeland. Together we have transformed a bludgeoned Jewish people  left for dead  into a vibrant  thriving nation  defending itself with the courage of modern Maccabees  developing limitless possibilities for the future.In our time  the Biblical prophecies are being realized. As the prophet Amos said “They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them. They shall plant vineyards and drink their wine. They shall till gardens and eat their fruit. And I will plant them upon their soil never to be uprooted again.”The people of Israel have come home  never to be uprooted again."
"83",3503,"ITA",68,2013,"With an end to the global crisis finally within reach  it is imperative to make growth and development our first priority today. In the past 10 years  remarkable progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been made. But we have to work harder. We need to empower individuals and communities and increase the capacity of economic and social systems to adapt to the rapid changes of our complex world. With regard to the post-2015 development agenda  we should address the root causes of the ills afflicting our world rather than limit ourselves to the side effects. Sustainable development  in line with the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  is the best possible antidote. In that conviction  Italy co-facilitated the establishment of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  with universal membership. We are also in favour of reinforcing the Economic and Social Council and of a partial reform of the United Nations Environment Programme.The promotion of sustainable development goes hand in hand with the spread of democratic principles. We are in favour of the convergence of the sustainable development goals and the MDGs after 2015. But development cannot be simply reduced to economic growth and statistics. We must go beyond gross domestic product and pay adequate attention to the more comprehensive notion of “quality of life”. Special attention should be paid to the role of women’s rights and gender equality. Although women cultivate more than half the food grown in the world  they represent two thirds of the people who live in poverty and suffer from hunger. More female participation in the global economy means more equality and growth.As the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the Organization (A/68/1) notes  in the past 13 years gains have been made in the fight against poverty  but despite these tangible improvements one in eight persons worldwide still suffers from malnutrition. Food security should be a priority area of action. It combines the need to act locally and globally. It incorporates some of today’s most crucial issues: a sustainable relationship between consumption and production  energy efficiency  and more.Italy is making a specific contribution to the issue of food security through Expo 2015 in Milan. The theme is “Feeding the planet: energy for life”. More than 130 countries have so far agreed to participate. Italy will use Expo Milan as an opportunity to exchange best practices on global sustainability in the area of food security and nutrition. We intend to promote new partnerships between the private and public sectors. As I underlined to the heads of the United Nations agencies based in Rome at a recent meeting  Italy feels that the time has come to launch a new global initiative on food. The United Nations participation in Expo 2015 is consequently of great importance. An integrated approach to development also involves a focus on its social dimensions.The projected rise of the world population highlights one of the most serious problems today. I am referring to global unemployment  particularly among young people. This phenomenon affects every part of the world  including Europe and my country. We want to combine the measures taken at the national and European levels to launch our war against unemployment.Italy deems it important to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  a true driver for employment. Such enterprises are well placed to create jobs for young people and contribute to social stability. In Europe  85 per cent of new jobs in the private sector are created by SMEs. In the employment sector  great attention must also be given to people with disabilities.Hundreds of millions of people around the world become immigrants in a phenomenon that affects both developed nations and countries of origin. Italy’s geographic location makes it a port of entry for thousands of immigrants. At the national level  we respect the fundamental human rights of immigrants and prosecute criminals who engage in human trafficking. At the same time  we have fostered international cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit.On this crucial subject  I wish to quote Pope Francis  who decided to visit the small island of Lampedusa this summer. He brought a message of support for the thousands of immigrants who arrive there from Africa every year. We should all fight what he called the “globalization of indifference” and feel the suffering of migrants as our own.Recognizing that more needs to be done at the national and international levels  we look forward to the second summit of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  to be held in New York this October.Achieving sustainable development requires stability  security and peace. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria  the Italian Government has underlined the importance of preserving the role of the United Nations as the ultimate guardian of peace. At the same time  we strongly condemn what has taken place in Syria with regard to chemical weapons. We cannot be indifferent to blatant violations of fundamental international rights.Italy invites all members of the Security Council and other relevant international stakeholders to spare no effort in the search for political solutions. That is why the Italian Government welcomed the Geneva framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons. We strongly support the work undertaken in the Security Council aimed at inducing Syria to participate in the Chemical Weapons Convention.We cannot accept the continuous deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Syria and in neighbouring countries. Once again  we invite all the parties involved in the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law. There must be effective protection for humanitarian assistance.Italy has intensified humanitarian assistance  particularly for refugees. Italy confirms its pledge of $30 million for 2013 and intends to provide even more support to expand the reach of humanitarian assistance. At the Group of 20 Summit held in Saint Petersburg  we announced our intention to implement new humanitarian and emergency initiatives  for an additional $50 million. On Friday  upon my return to Rome  I will enact that measure.We will continue to keep Somalia high on our agenda. As I confirmed to President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud a few days ago in Rome  Italy is willing to help the Somali authorities in their efforts to lay the foundations of an effective and united federal State.Together with Ethiopia  Italy has convened a ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Partners Forum tomorrow  26 September  here in New York  to discuss Somalia.As the top contributor to Libya  Italy is supporting the country in its stabilization and democratic transition  and we remain fully committed to cooperation with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). Before the end of the year  Italy will host the second international conference on Libya in Rome  which we are preparing together with the Libyan authorities  UNSMIL and other partners.Italy reiterates its strong commitment to the stabilization of Mali and the Sahel region. At the national level  we are currently funding training for border police in Mali and the Niger. We welcome the holding of the next high-level meeting on the Sahel. The strategy presented by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  Romano Prodi  is a good example of increasing efforts and resources.Italy is the seventh-largest contributor to the general budget of the United Nations. Since 2006  despite financial constraints  we have been the top contributor of United Nations peacekeepers among Western countries. We are demonstrating our commitment to peace and stability through our participation in 10 different United Nations peacekeeping missions worldwide  from the Mediterranean and the Middle East to Africa and Afghanistan.Italy is engaged in international initiatives related to peace and security  such as the Arms Trade Treaty  which we have already ratified. Other relevant initiatives include the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.Italy believes that respect for human rights is fundamental to peaceful coexistence among nations. Our foreign policy will continue to focus on social and humanitarian affairs and the protection of human rights. Wherever human rights are at risk  global peace and security are also at risk.Italy will continue its efforts to better defend those most vulnerable to violence and discrimination. Our actions and our thoughts must focus on the categories most at risk: women  children  religious and ethnic minorities  lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender persons  human rights defenders and humanitarian workers.The recent atrocities in Pakistan once again illustrate the importance of the issue of religious tolerance. The General Assembly should never stop acting to counter religious hatred and fundamentalism.At the same time  Italy will continue to support the campaign for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.In the second half of 2014  Italy will assume the presidency of the European Union (EU). We want the EU to be more open to the world. That means more European foreign  or rather global  policy. It also means more trade exchanges with the rest of the world. In that connection  we will host the next summit of the Asia-Europe Meeting  in Milan in October 2014.I am convinced that a well-governed Europe can act as a global player. A good example is the EU enlargement policy  which succeeded in bringing stability to the Balkans in a very short time. It is high time for the EU to rise again to assume a leading role on the world stage. We in Europe must act now for more unity and for more effective governance.On the theme of adapting to a changing world  allow me to conclude by referring to reform of the Security Council. As a leading member of the Uniting for Consensus group  Italy strongly believes that Security Council reform is absolutely necessary. The adoption of any such reform  however  will require the consensus of a large majority of the membership. We need to update the Security Council to today’s world  increasing its accountability  transparency and effectiveness. To bridge the gap between the different models of reform  all Member States should be ready to engage in the next round of negotiations with a higher degree of flexibility and openness to compromise.We have many challenges ahead. Italy will contribute to addressing those challenges as an active member of the international community within a framework of reinforced global governance. We make that commitment before the General Assembly  and we make that commitment before the international community."
"84",3549,"JAM",68,2013,"I am extremely pleased that a son of the Caribbean — and one with such a wealth of experience and tested diplomatic skills — is presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I commend the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his untiring efforts to promote international peace and development  and I thank him for his exemplary leadership.The theme for our debate  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  catapults development to the centre of the United Nations agenda  impelling us to elaborate a meaningful and far-reaching development framework for the benefit of all. Our deliberations and actions during this session must therefore send a clear message of hope to the many millions who  sadly  are still living in poverty and inequity. Let us redouble our efforts to fight against the scourge of poverty. It was the late Jamaican national hero  Marcus Mosiah Garvey  who aptly said:“Poverty is a hellish state to be in. It is no virtue. It is a crime. To be poor is to be hungry without possible hope of food; to be sick without hope of medicine; to be tired and sleepy without a place to lay one’s head; to be naked without the hope of clothing; to be despised and comfortless. To be poor is to be a fit subject for crime and hell.”Too many of the world’s citizens are facing that reality. We need to fulfil the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which entrusted to us the responsibility to chart a path towards development underpinned by a commitment to eradicate poverty on the basis of a global partnership.As the deadline for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals draws near  with under 1 000 days remaining  we face many challenges  including the global economic and financial crisis  climate change  natural disasters  high levels of debt and conflict. With the limited time remaining  it is imperative for us to accelerate our efforts. Anything less would be a disservice to our people.While we contemplate a post-2015 development framework  we must also complete unfinished business in the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger  combating HIV/AIDS  halting and reversing the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis and increasing access to reproductive health care. In our deliberations on a post-2015 development agenda  we must determine how best to shape a global compact that is universal and people-centred and that strikes the balance between the need for robust economic growth  job creation and poverty eradication and the equally important need to preserve and protect the environment. Our deliberations have to take into account the special needs of disadvantaged groups of countries  in particular the vulnerable group of small island developing States (SIDS)  which are grappling with climate change  sea-level rise and the need to deal with new and emerging economic and social situations.We are pleased that international attention will be focused on small island developing States in 2014  when the international community will observe the International Year of Small Island Developing States. The success of the Samoa Conference in 2014 will depend on strong international support for and the mainstreaming of SIDS issues in all activities across the United Nations system.A sustainable approach to development should include people with disabilities in the post-2015 development agenda. It should also provide for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and additional financial resources to sustain the global fight against HIV/AIDS.Another major threat to development is the high incidence of road crashes. I call on all countries to take the challenge of reducing injuries and fatalities resulting from road crashes and traffic accidents more seriously as a crucial policy issue.There is an urgent need for innovative and sustainable financing to underpin our development efforts. Reforms should be undertaken in a manner that will assist middle-income developing countries to deal with the challenges they face. Those reforms must address public debt sustainability and review the classification system of middle-income developing countries with a view to coming up with more relevant and appropriate measures of development.There is an urgent need for greater focus on job creation  including for unemployed youth. I note that the International Labour Organization has estimated that global unemployment will rise to 202 million this year. That alarming statistic is overshadowed by estimate of the global working poor  which is in the order of 869 million  almost 400 million of whom live in extreme poverty. Growth in joblessness is reflected in rural and urban pockets of poverty and social deprivation. Increased investment in developing countries with a focus on job creation is an avenue that must be actively pursued.We need to provide more assistance for people to cope with daily life  as growth and prosperity are unevenly distributed and the most vulnerable are at risk of falling through the cracks  being overlooked and failing to achieve a decent quality of life. Social protection schemes should work effectively to provide for basic needs and encourage target groups to pursue self-advancement while facilitating empowerment and fostering greater inclusiveness. As countries like Jamaica implement strategies to deal with indebtedness and also encourage growth and investment  it is critical that international financial institutions and multilateral and other development partners recognize the importance of social protection mechanisms.As we forge the agenda for development for the next decade and beyond  we do so in part on behalf of a group that is very close to my heart — our children. The future we want  the future we craft  the future we achieve will be our legacy to our children. We must redouble our efforts to safeguard their rights and enhance their development. Despite limited resources  Jamaica continues to make every effort to meet its obligations to its children. We condemn violence and abuse against our children and reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding and promoting the rights of children everywhere. We must leave no child behind.The issue of human trafficking is of paramount concern. I am always mindful of the horrors and evils of slavery  both in history and in its modern-day form. I am particularly moved by the knowledge that young girls and boys are torn daily from the bosom of their families  taken to strange lands  placed in subhuman conditions and forced to perform unspeakable acts. We must unite in our efforts to eliminate that transnational scourge and bring an end to human trafficking among our women  men and children. We must ensure that in these modern times we do not have a re-enactment of slavery.We must stamp it out wherever it exists and bring the perpetrators to justice. We must protect our future generations. Never again should anything resembling slavery be tolerated anywhere.Jamaica is proud to lead the efforts  in collaboration with the countries of the Caribbean Community and members of the African Union  to have the permanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade erected here at the United Nations. The unveiling of the winning design of the permanent memorial earlier this week signals an important chapter in our journey to honour the memory of the millions of men and women who were subject to untold atrocities. When I attended the unveiling I was reminded of the words of our reggae icon  Bob Marley:“Old pirates  yes  they rob I;Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took IFrom the bottomless pit.But my hand was made strongBy the hand of the Almighty.We forward in this generationTriumphantly.”We are grateful for the generous contributions towards the erection of the memorial  and we encourage the international community to continue to show financial support for that important initiative.Jamaica supports the call for an international discussion in a non-confrontational manner on the question of reparations. We fully support the initiative to proclaim a decade for people of African descent.The quest for development will not be complete without requisite attention being paid to peace and security. My heart goes out to the families of the victims of the horrific attack in Kenya. Transnational organized criminal enterprises wreak havoc on economies and challenge the capacity of States to deal with those threats. No country is immune to the direct or indirect effects of the scourge of transnational crime. Increased collaboration is necessary in confronting such threats to human development. To that end  we welcome the recent opening for signature of the landmark Arms Trade Treaty in June of this year  which represents one of many steps that the international community must take towards defeating terrorism  crime and violence. Jamaica is currently embarking on the process leading to ratification of the Treaty.Bilateral and regional cooperation through information-sharing  capacity-building and assistance are integral to dealing with crime  violence and security issues. We remain deeply concerned about the suffering of the people in Syria and join the international community in condemning the use of chemical weapons. We welcome the recent positive steps taken by the Security Council. Jamaica remains firmly committed to a just  lasting and peaceful solution to the situation in the Middle East.Turning closer to home  the trade and economic embargo against our neighbour Cuba has caused its people untold hardship. It has no place in the twenty-first century. We reiterate our call for an end to the embargo against Cuba and to extraterritorial measures that target third-party countries.Jamaica has never lost faith in the influence for good that exists here at the United Nations. We are fully aware that the expectations and aspirations of peoples rest in our hands. At this pivotal moment in history  let us revitalize the partnership on which this great institution is built. I draw on the words of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King  Jr.  when he said “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”The challenges and expectations of our time are indeed great. It falls to our generation to take a stand. Now is the time to act."
"85",3595,"JOR",68,2013,"It is an honour to join the Assembly today. I congratulate President Ashe on his election and sincerely thank the Secretary-General for his always invaluable work.Global security will long be shaped by what is happening right now in the Middle East. Our region can be and must be a house of peace and prosperity  with strong pillars of good governance and wide-open doors to opportunity  especially for our young people. That is Jordan’s blueprint  and we are not alone.But no house can be built when its city is burning. And today  the region’s fires cannot be ignored. All the world is in their path. To protect the future  our world must respond. The Syrian crisis is a global humanitarian and security disaster. Escalating violence threatens to hollow out the rest of that country’s economic and political future. Extremists have rushed to promote and exploit ethnic and religious divisions. Such a dynamic could crush regional renaissance and put global security at risk. We have a duty to reject those destructive forces.Last month  Jordan hosted more than 100 eminent Muslim scholars from around the world. Their work affirms the true teachings of Islam and builds on Jordan’s long-standing interfaith and intra-religious initiatives: the Amman Message  A Common Word  and World Interfaith Harmony Week. The scholars said that there was no single prescribed model for an Islamic State  but they affirmed that the modern Islamic State should be a civic State  founded on institutions and with an inclusive constitution based on the rule of law  justice and freedom of opinion and faith. The modern Islamic State should uphold equality across the ethnic and religious spectrum. The scholars decisively condemned the incitement of ethnic and sectarian conflict  known in Arabic as fitna. They recognized that evil for what it is — a threat to the Muslim world  the Ummah  and indeed to all humankind. Jordan has called upon the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to adopt those recommendations  which are critical guiding principles amid the turbulence and transformations across our region.This month  we in Jordan also convened an international meeting to address challenges to Arab Christian communities. They are an essential part of our region’s past  present and future. Jordan has been a historic model of coexistence and fraternity between Muslims and Christians. We will continue to do our utmost to protect our Arab Christian communities and minorities  and we call on all countries to join us in our stand for diversity  tolerance and mutual respect.The truth is that respect for each other is the way forward for all of us. The historic transformation going on in my region today will not be achieved by formulas; it will come when all of our citizens feel truly represented. Jordan seeks a house of the future that includes all. We are building our future on the solid foundation of majority consensus  minority rights  a democratic culture of active citizenship and peaceful  evolutionary change.The Syrian people must also have a future. And for that  the international community must act. It is time to fast-track a political transition in Syria  end the violence and bloodshed  neutralize the threat of chemical weapons  restore security and stability  preserve the unity of Syria and its territorial integrity  and engage all — all — of its people in building their country’s future.Syria’s future will depend on the Syrian people  but the world has the duty  the interest and the power to help. And help must come soon. The damage and dangers are mounting. The flow of Syrian refugees into Jordan already equals one-tenth of our own population. It could reach 1 million  some 20 per cent of our population  by next year. These are not just numbers; they are people who need food  water  shelter  sanitation  electricity  health care and more. Not even the strongest global economies could absorb such demand on infrastructure and resources  let alone a small economy and the fourth water-poorest country in the world. Jordanians have opened their arms to those in need  as we have always done  but I say here and now that my people cannot be asked to shoulder the burden of what is a regional and global challenge.Let me acknowledge  with gratitude  the generous response to date by the United Nations and regional and international donors. But we can all see the reality on the ground; the need is outracing the response. More support is urgently needed to send a strong signal that the world community stands shoulder to shoulder with those who have borne so much. Those who are suffering in Syria also need the world to be resolute: the Syrian parties must abide by international humanitarian law and principles  and allow humanitarian access  into and within Syria  to reach those in need.Our international community must also work together for a speedy resolution of the region’s core crisis. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict consumes resources that are needed to build a better future and feeds the flames of extremism around the world. It is time to put this fire out.The talks that began in July show that progress can be made  with willing parties  determined United States leadership and strong regional and international backing. We commend the President of Palestine and the Prime Minister of Israel for the bold decision to resume final status negotiations. We urge them to stay committed to reaching an agreement within the established time frame. Let there be no actions that can derail what is still a fragile process. This means no continued settlement construction and no unilateral actions that threaten the status quo in East Jerusalem and its Muslim and Christian holy sites. Such threats would be a flashpoint for global concern.We know the right way forward. And the goal can be reached. It includes a just and final two-State settlement  based on international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative; for Israel  real security and normal relations with 57 Arab and Muslim countries; for the Palestinian people  at long last  the rights they deserve in a viable and independent Palestinian State on Palestinian national soil  based on the 1967 lines and with East Jerusalem as its capital.Let us keep the focus on what we are building — communities safe for families to lead normal lives; a Middle East of many houses  working together in region-wide cooperation; the ultimate security for our future.The future is ours to build  not in the Middle East alone  but in global partnership. Those who are working to do the right thing need the whole world’s support. With every country that is more prosperous and free  with every neighbourhood that is safer  with every person who has more reason to hope  the entire house of humankind grows more secure. Let this be our promise  not only for future generations  but for those we serve today."
"86",3642,"JPN",68,2013,"First  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.I would now like to make a new pledge about the situation in Syria. The use of chemical weapons has caused profound shock and anger on the part of the people of Japan  including myself. Chemical weapons must never be used again. I hereby declare that Japan will provide thorough support to  and the greatest possible cooperation with  the international community’s efforts to dispose of Syria’s chemical weapons. We feel righteous indignation about innocent civilians continuing to be victims. Japan regards the cessation of violence  the initiation of political dialogue and the improvement of the appalling humanitarian conditions as issues of the utmost urgency. At this very moment  the number of refugees is soaring. To them  Japan will provide still greater assistance. We will act in cooperation with the international community to extend a helping hand to internally displaced persons and refugees fleeing across national borders. I take pride in the fact that Japan’s non-governmental organizations and volunteer organizations are working around the clock to help them.Japan will also continue to provide assistance to areas under the control of the opposition groups  where it is difficult for assistance from the international community to reach. We are working to undertake the training of staff working at medical centres. We will also deliver portable X-ray devices and other medical equipment to those areas.With the escalating despair of refugees now as they head for a harsh winter  I would like to announce that the Government of Japan will provide and make immediately available approximately $60 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Syria and its surrounding countries. We are determined to conduct such assistance in parallel with the process of political dialogue  notably the “Geneva II” conference  and to move forward in cooperation with the international community.Our nation  Japan  and its capital  Tokyo  have been granted the honour of hosting the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games  seven years from now. To reciprocate that good fortune we have come to enjoy  my obligation first of all is to rebuild the Japanese economy to be vibrant  and then to make Japan a dependable force that works for good in the world. I pledge here that I will make Japan a force for peace and stability in the world  just as it has been until now — or  rather  make it an even greater such force than it has been thus far  given the increasingly tragic state of the globe.Japan will newly bear the flag of proactive contributor to peace  anchored in the undeniable record of and the solid appreciation for our country  which has endeavoured to bring peace and prosperity to the world while emphasizing cooperation with the international community.The balance of power in the world has been changing rapidly  and technological innovations are now removing all borders from both new opportunities and new types of threats. It is now impossible for any one country  no matter which one it may be  to safeguard its own peace and security acting entirely by itself. That is why Japan is working to garner trust from the world as a creator of added value and a net contributor to regional and global peace and stability. Under those circumstances  the role of the United Nations will become even more important than it is today. Japan has continually promoted the concept of human security  and the implications of the concept will surely expand. Through the accumulated discussions over the nine years since the submission of a report by the Commission on Human Security  the resolution on a common understanding on the notion of human security was adopted  here at the General Assembly  in September 2012 (resolution 66/290). Guided by the wisdom of its forerunners  Japan is determined to further spread the concept and build actual practices.I will enable Japan  as a proactive contributor to peace  to be even more actively engaged in United Nations collective security measures  including peacekeeping operations. I believe that Japan must continually cultivate our human resources so that they are appropriate for use in United Nations activities.For Japan  whose national interests are firmly connected to the stability of open seas  changes to the maritime order through the use of force or coercion cannot be condoned under any circumstances. Japan has great expectations that public spaces  ranging from outer space and cyberspace to the skies and the seas  will be rigorously preserved as global commons governed by rules and laws.Japan  as a country that understands the horror and devastation wrought by atomic bombs  will utterly devote itself to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the total elimination of nuclear weapons. North Korea’s nuclear and missile development cannot be condoned. Japan also maintains serious concerns with respect to other weapons of mass destruction that North Korea is likely to possess. Pyongyang should listen to the unified voice of the international community and rectify its own actions by taking a tangible step. We demand that North Korea return every Japanese national whom it has abducted  without exception. While in office  I am determined to resolve that issue completely. The normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea remains unthinkable without the resolution of that issue.As for the nuclear issue of Iran  Japan hopes that the country’s new Administration will move forward with concrete actions. We are ready to continue to play a role in resolving the issue.In the Middle East region  a cornerstone for world peace and prosperity  Japan will continue its unique contributions towards the Middle East peace process.Japan will also continue to extend cooperation to the countries of Africa  which are certain to become a growth engine in the twenty-first century. Firmly rooted in our own experiences  that cooperation takes the fostering of human resources as its main emphasis and seeks to achieve sustainable growth while cultivating ownership by Africa itself. In June  my Government invited African Heads of State and Government and representatives of international organizations to Japan  where it convened the fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD V). On that occasion  I was deeply struck by the eagerness expressed by representatives of African nations for private sector investment. Investment flow to Africa now exceeds the flow of assistance. I also heard from the African leaders time and again that assistance should be utilized strategically as a catalyst for attracting investment. That is the evolution that discussions in the 20-year-long TICAD process have witnessed and given rise to. TICAD V became a forum where we celebrated the path that Africa has walked down  and together we reconfirmed that Japan has been an enduring partner weaving dreams side by side with Africa.I hold the firm conviction that the future course of Japan’s diplomacy will begin here  by sparing no pains — and with our regained strength and capacity — to become actively engaged in meeting the historic challenges that today’s world faces. I consider “sparing no pains” to be nothing less than the basso continuo notes that set the basic tone for Japan’s actions  be they in diplomacy or any other field.As a country with such intentions  strengths and achievements  Japan considers it extremely regrettable that the structure of the Security Council is still frozen in a state that reflects the realities of some 70 years ago. Security Council reform must proceed without delay. Japan’s aspirations to becoming a permanent member of the Council have not changed in the slightest.Everything begins with Japan refortifying its true abilities and its economy. The growth of Japan will benefit the world. Japan’s decline would be a loss for people everywhere. How  then  does Japan aim to realize its growth? Mobilizing the power of women will serve as both a source and outcome of growth  a point almost self-evident at this gathering.There is a theory called “womenomics”  which asserts that the more the advancement of women in society is promoted  the more growth increases. Creating an environment in which women find it comfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for women to work and to be active in society is no longer a matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the greatest urgency.Having declared my intention to create a society in which women shine  I have been working to change Japan’s domestic structures. However  that is not confined merely to domestic matters. I would now like to discuss how it is also an issue guiding Japan’s diplomacy. To begin with  I would like to state four contributions through which Japan aspires to remain a leading member within the international community. First  Japan respects the activities of UN-Women and intends to become one of its leading contributors  and therefore an exemplary country in that area. Japan will also work closely with the relevant international organizations.Secondly  as other like-minded countries have already done  Japan also intends to develop a national action plan with regard to women  peace and security  in cooperation with people working at the grass-roots level. Thirdly  Japan will cooperate closely with not only UN-Women  but also the International Criminal Court and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict  Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura. It is an outrage that there continues to be sexual violence against women during times of armed conflict even now  in the twenty-first century. Japan will do everything possible to prevent such crimes against women and to support — both materially and psychologically — those people who unfortunately become victims of such acts.Fourthly  Japan will submit once more at the next session of the Commission on the Status of Women a draft resolution that gives careful consideration to women in natural disasters  as they are likely to be vulnerable. Japan  which experienced a major natural disaster two years ago  wishes to garner support for the draft resolution  which embodies our outpouring of support for the matter.I would now like to make use of the examples of three individuals to clarify Japan’s development concept aimed at bringing about a society in which women shine  and also to shed light on some issues that must be tackled. I will first introduce the examples of a Japanese woman and a Bangladeshi woman  and then that of an Afghan woman  as the third example.Ms. Tokiko Sato was an expert at the Japan International Cooperation Agency  responsible for improving maternal  newborn and child health for over 15 years in a remote village in Jordan. Undaunted by the suspicious looks she initially received from the villagers  Ms. Sato would speak with anyone  anywhere. Devoted to her ideas  including making use of public entertainment to persuade the villagers  Ms. Sato finally found herself accepted by the village community. Ms. Sato’s tenacity gradually transformed the traditional idea that the one who decides the number of children is the husband  not the wife  into a mindset that values the health of women.As the Assembly is aware  my country played a leading role in the establishment of the the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan intends to continue to make an appropriate contribution at the upcoming Fourth Replenishment  which seeks to secure additional financing for the Fund. However  as for the post-2015 development agenda  it would be most appropriate to broaden the focus to encompass those diseases individually. Japan regards approaches that address individuals holistically as better able to meet their broader health needs. That is why Japan decided to promote universal health coverage — “UHC — on the occasion of TICAD V. To address health issues in the African region  we have readied $500 million and are at present concentrating on setting up training for 120 000 health and medical services providers. With regard to medical care for all  there can be no doubt that the people who give the human touch to the three letters in “UHC” are  in concrete terms  people like Ms. Sato  who without hesitation go into local communities. The second person I would like to introduce is Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin  a young Bangladeshi woman and the mother of two. Her professional title is “Poly-Glu Lady”. Poly-Glu is a made-in-Japan water purifier derived from a food that can be found in Japan in great abundance. One simply adds it to turbid water. Poly-Glu acts as an adsorbent  adhering to excess substances in the water  and then falls to the bottom as a precipitate  leaving the water clear. It is necessary to teach people how to use it correctly at the outset  and Ms. Yeasmin and other Poly-Glu ladies serve as both salespersons and instructors.As members can see  as with what is called a “base of the pyramid” business  that endeavour is characterized by the expectations placed on the power of women. By combining her income with her husband’s  Ms. Yeasmin has been able to send her children to an institution of higher education. Poverty caused her to give up on the dream she had cherished as a little girl of becoming a doctor someday. But I understand that now she proudly states she has become a doctor of clean water. Can we not say that Ms. Yeasmin has acquired self-esteem  the most precious asset of all? My Government wishes to create as many Ms. Nilufa Yeasmins as possible. By the way  the company that makes Poly-Glu is a very small Japanese company. We will work to enhance the assistance to such companies and organizations to allow their ideas to bear fruit.Finally  there is one more woman I would like to introduce to everyone in the Hall today  but this Afghan lady is no longer with us. Her name is Ms. Islam Bibi  and on 4 July she was gunned down and assassinated. She was 37 years old and is survived by three children. Ms. Islam Bibi was a proud female police officer with the Afghan police. She came to shoulder heavy responsibilities through her nine years of service. She guarded polling stations to monitor elections and was a trainer to young female officers coming after her. We have much work to be done. However  we must proceed undaunted.Under the auspices of the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan  Japan has been one of the countries that have always taken great pains to improve the capacity of the Afghan police force and cultivate female police officers  whose number will finally reach 1 800 — still far from enough. I have renewed my determination to continue to provide support in order to prevent another case like that of Islam Bibi.I wanted to emphasize — through the real-life example of Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin in Bangladesh — the necessity of promoting women’s participation in society and their empowerment. My Government has prioritized that as its foremost policy and will continue to undertake highly inventive efforts  including launching start-up businesses in Africa.Through her actions  Ms. Tokiko Sato  the Japanese aid specialist  has highlighted the importance of maternal  newborn and child health  an MDG whose attainment has been conspicuously slow. My Administration will  as its second priority policy area  engage greater efforts towards women’s health and medical care.Finally  what I hoped to convey through the tragic example of Islam Bibi is the importance of women’s participation and their protection in the context of peace and security. Japan intends to promote measures to ensure women’s participation at all stages — including in conflict prevention and resolution and in peacebuilding — and to safeguard their rights and the physical well-being of women who are exposed to danger in times of conflict.I would like to state here that in establishing those three pillars  the Government of Japan will direct official development assistance in excess of $3 billion over the next three years  to target the pillars.In conclusion  if we were to follow the wisdom of the so-called “womenomics” theory  as mentioned earlier  the development concept aimed at cultivating the power of women would generate greater peace and well-being in the world. I wish to bring about a society where women shine  within Japan and in conflict regions and countries suffering from poverty. In that context  I do not consider the outlook to be optimistic. However  I know one thing: in Japan a considerable number of people are working unsparingly towards that end. They are the people who are making every effort to ready themselves to be able to work together  in unity."
"87",3667,"KAZ",68,2013,"On behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan  I should like first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to wish him every success in his important functions. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  for his able stewardship  energy and dedication in finding solutions to critical international challenges.Since we met here at the United Nations a year ago the world situation has not improved but  on the contrary  has deteriorated  becoming more fragile and vulnerable to new risks and threats. A growing number of States in the Middle East and Africa  which were making steady progress  both economically and socially  are now witnessing regression. Some Asian States are facing similar risks of destabilization. The number of post-conflict countries is also on the rise  inevitably affecting global development in an interconnected world. Never before has the need been more compelling for equal partnership and the participation of all Member States  based on mutual respect and norms as embodied in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The United Nations  by the power invested in it by its Member States  stands out as our unquestioned leading entity on the world stage.Kazakhstan strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria  as confirmed by the findings of an independent investigation by the United Nations mission  and regards it as a crime against humanity. We support the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Syria that would stipulate strict compliance with a concerted decision on the elimination of chemical weapons in that country and the conduct of regular inspections of that process.We express our hope that the accession of Syria to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction  as well as the placement of such weapons under international control  will preclude the possibility of their repeated use and will contribute towards the end of the long-standing and bloody conflict in Syria. We call for the earliest possible convening of an international conference on the settlement of that conflict  with the aim of ending the violence and determining Syria’s political future through dialogue and reconciliation.The current situation in the nuclear disarmament process also does not encourage confidence in a more peaceful future. While we participated actively in yesterday’s High-level Meeting  we stress once again now from the rostrum of the General Assembly that our country has a special moral authority to champion the cause of nuclear abolition. By closing the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site soon after our independence in 1991 and renouncing the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal  Kazakhstan made a unique contribution in the multilateral effort to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.We believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  which remains the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime  must reach full universalization  with the strict implementation of national obligations in accordance with the three fundamental pillars of the Treaty — non-proliferation  the peaceful use of nuclear energy and disarmament — in a balanced way. We call on all non-NPT countries possessing nuclear weapons to sign the Treaty and on all States parties not to withdraw. The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) should become an important catalyst in the non-proliferation process  promoting the effective implementation of the NPT. We urge those countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that important document. The General Assembly resolution initiated by Kazakhstan establishing 29 August as the International Day against Nuclear Tests (resolution 64/35) matches the goals and objectives for the entry into force of the CTBT.The Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia  which came into force in March 2009  represents an important contribution by the Central Asian countries to international and regional security. It is the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in the northern hemisphere and shares common borders with two major nuclear Powers. It is also the first such zone where previously nuclear weapons had existed. Kazakhstan welcomes the willingness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to hold a dialogue on the Additional Protocol with the five countries in the zone and to provide negative assurances as soon as possible.Kazakhstan supports the early convening of the conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction under the auspices of the United Nations and calls upon all States in the region actively to cooperate to make that important undertaking possible.In order to take further decisive actions to eliminate the nuclear threat  President Nursultan Nazarbaev of the Republic of Kazakhstan has proposed the adoption of a universal declaration for a nuclear-weapon-free world  which would be an important step towards a nuclear-weapons prohibition convention  and thereby achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. We count on Member States to finalize and submit a draft resolution on the universal declaration of the General Assembly at this session.We support an immediate political and diplomatic settlement of the situation concerning the Iranian nuclear programme on the basis of strict compliance with the provisions of the NPT and the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations. In order to ensure progress in the dialogue between the group of international mediators and Iran  Kazakhstan hosted two rounds of negotiations in Almaty this year. Specific agreements have yet to be reached  but we are confident that a mutually acceptable outcome is possible. We believe that concrete actions by Iran to ensure the transparency and peaceful nature of its nuclear programme  along with reciprocal constructive steps on the part of the group of six  will advance the settlement of the problem  rather than relying on sanctions alone. We all witnessed the latest positive signs of understanding on that issue during the current session and wholeheartedly welcomed them  remaining fully available to contribute to a productive negotiation process.We express our grave concern about North Korea’s nuclear programme. Attempts to engage in the secret development of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations cannot be justified under any circumstances. At the same time  Kazakhstan is against a military solution to the problem  since we are convinced that only the peaceful settlement of that crisis  within the framework of the Six-Party Talks  can ensure peace and stability in North-East Asia. Kazakhstan is genuinely interested in the sustainable and stable development of Afghanistan through its transformation into a politically stable and economically viable State in keeping with the decisions of the ministerial conference of the Istanbul Process held in Almaty last April. We support the rapid integration of Afghanistan into the regional framework so as to promote its speedy social and economic recovery.The Asian continent is transforming itself into a global powerhouse for the twenty-first century  with its production of more than 57 per cent of global gross domestic product — a trend that is expected to increase. However  that growth could be jeopardized by an aggravation of existing conflicts  illegal migration  drug trafficking  territorial claims  separatism  religious extremism and terrorism. To cope with those challenges  Asia needs a regional security architecture. Kazakhstan  as the host of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia  is striving to maximize opportunities for joint decision-making on security and cooperation in Asia.Kazakhstan is committed to the fundamental principles of international law  among which respect for human rights and freedom  based on impartiality and non-politicization  is deemed pivotal for a sustainable  universal and effective global architecture for protecting human rights. That  among other things  requires appropriate budgeting and the strengthening of the Human Rights Council and its special procedures  in particular the universal periodic review and the institution of special rapporteurs  as well as supporting the capacity and authority of United Nations human rights mechanisms.We need to implement civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights at the national  regional and global levels while paying particular attention to vulnerable groups. Kazakhstan  as a multiethnic and multi-confessional country  can facilitate a comprehensive dialogue among civilizations within the United Nations and various international and regional organizations. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  which Kazakhstan convenes every three years  contributes to global and regional security by mobilizing the spiritual and moral potential of world religions to mitigate international conflicts so as to prevent confrontations between faiths and cultures.Additionally  at the initiative of Kazakhstan  the General Assembly proclaimed the period between 2013 and 2022 as the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures. Its official inauguration was held in Astana last month  thereby paving the way for cultural diversity and tolerance. Kazakhstan calls on Member States actively to participate in the events of the Decade and to support synergy between the Alliance of Civilizations and the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.The consequences of the global financial and economic crisis have led to the conclusion that the world needs a common policy of global governance. Kazakhstan therefore welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the United Nations in global economic governance (resolution 67/289)  which recognizes the value of cooperation and interaction between the United Nations and various regional and subregional groups.Over the years  Kazakhstan has hosted the Astana Economic Forum  which is now a reputed international platform that covers the most pressing and ever-expanding issues of the world economy. The first World Anti-Crisis Conference was held as part of the Forum last May in Astana. The Astana Declaration  the recommendations of the Astana Economic Forum to the Group of 20 leaders and the road map of the World Anti-Crisis Plan were adopted as outcome documents. The second World Anti-Crisis Conference  which is to be held next May in Kazakhstan  will draft the world anti-crisis plan to combat the financial and economic crisis so as to ensure long-term sustainable economic growth.We are pleased to note the commendable work of the United Nations in implementing the agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20)  and Kazakhstan is actively contributing to that work. A national plan for transitioning to a green economy has been developed  with programmes in key sectors of the economy — energy  water  utilities  agriculture  industry and biodiversity. Kazakhstan has also initiated the transition to a green economy in Central Asia within the framework of the regional Intergovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development. The Rio+20 Conference supported the Kazakhstan-sponsored Green Bridge Partnership Programme as a voluntary framework for mutually beneficial cooperation between the developed and developing world in the interests of sustainable development. Next Monday  30 September  Kazakhstan will host the International Conference on the Green Bridge Partnership Programme in Astana with the participation of regional countries  the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  the Economic Commission for Europe and other stakeholders. At that Conference the programme will be institutionalized and its secretariat established.Kazakhstan has made voluntary commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and investing in low-carbon development  all of which constitute Kazakhstan’s contribution to the Secretary-General’s global Sustainable Energy for All initiative and other initiatives aimed at sustainable development.I am pleased to inform members that Kazakhstan’s capital  Astana  will host the international exhibition EXPO 2017  entitled “Energy for the Future”  which is designed to disseminate best practices in the field of sustainable energy. On the basis of national consultations  we have developed a number of recommendations on development goals for the post-2015 agenda and submitted them to the United Nations. We believe that those Millennium Development Goals that were not reached must be included in the post-2015 agenda  in conjunction with the objectives of sustainable development. International partnerships must be strengthened for South-South and triangular cooperation so as to complement official development assistance activities. Strengthening resilience in order to withstand external factors such as climate change and the financial and food crises will have to gain priority under the new agenda.In that regard  Kazakhstan’s chairmanship of the last and symbolic twentieth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development effected its official transition and handover to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The establishment of the High-Level Political Forum is historic as a universal platform to meet current realities  closely linked with global security  which justifies the rationale for a direct nexus between the High-Level Political Forum and the Security Council over the issues of food  the environment  energy and water security.For the first time since its independence  Kazakhstan has announced its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018  based on the principles of fair and equitable geographical rotation and the adequate representation of all States members of the Asia-Pacific regional group. The experience we have gained from recently chairing a number of regional and international organizations and forums  such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia  the Commonwealth of Independent States  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  the Collective Security Treaty Organization and others  gives us unique access to a wide and diverse range of experiences and approaches to solving international security problems addressed by the Security Council.If elected  Kazakhstan will unfailingly be united with others to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and will support efforts to reform the Council  transforming it into a more representative and transparent body that can effectively address the full range of challenges and threats facing the world today. We therefore count on the broad support of Member States for our candidacy to the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018.Last year  Kazakhstan celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its accession to the United Nations  and this year the twentieth anniversary of a United Nations presence in our country. Our Government and people strongly support the United Nations in all its programmes. Kazakhstan acts as a geographical and political bridge between North and South  Europe and Asia. For that reason  it is ideally suited to foster cooperative initiatives in that vast regional landscape. Promoting Kazakhstan to the status of a middle-income country represents both challenges and opportunities for the development agenda  shifting the focus from being a recipient country to that of a regional development partner.Regional cooperation is critical to ensuring national and regional security. Persistent conflict and instability in Afghanistan also have an effect on Central Asia. Poverty  unemployment and growing disparities in economic and social development in the countries of Central Asia are strong factors indicating the potential for new mass population movements  instability  environmental degradation  drug trafficking  religious extremism and terrorism  all of which must be addressed through regional cooperation. Such collaboration can be facilitated through the establishment of a United Nations multi-country centre in Kazakhstan in the city of Almaty as a hub for promoting regional development  security and stability. Kazakhstan is ready to bear all the costs for the construction  equipping and maintenance of such a United Nations office bridging the gap between Vienna and Bangkok.The 20 years of Kazakhstan’s membership and cooperation with the United Nations have been characterized by the highest dedication to the ideals and principles of the world Organization. We will continue to play the role of an engaged and responsible Member State  ready to take on increased responsibilities and consistently implement them in full."
"88",3738,"KGZ",68,2013,"Thirteen years have passed since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  and the established deadline to achieve the Millennium Development Goals is rapidly approaching. The world has changed since then  and we anticipate that  in the next 15 years  it will change a great deal more. In that context  the main theme of the general debate  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is obviously very appropriate and relevant. We are convinced that the new development agenda will provide a clear vision for our post-2015 development. It should be formulated in the best spirit of the Millennium Development Goals  with special attention to the issues of poverty eradication  education and health care  the economy and employment  governance  agriculture and food availability  energy  peace and security.The need for a common agenda is unquestionable. All countries must enthusiastically embark on the path of sustainable development. The global challenges can be effectively met if they are included as core priorities in each country’s development strategy. Kyrgyzstan has done its part. That is reflected in the national sustainable development strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2013-2017  which identifies five-year targets and plans for a transition to sustainable development  culminating in 2017. Our vision is to form a stable country where human rights  freedom and security are guaranteed  where a multi-ethnic society is governed with equal adherence to the rule of law  and where all prerequisites for sustainable economic growth and a decent standard of life are the norm. The tasks ahead are complex  and we believe they should be addressed in partnership with the United Nations and the international community.The main strategic resource for the green economic growth of Kyrgyzstan is water. The role of water has increased significantly due to the major challenge of sustainable development posed by global climate change  which is already affecting our region negatively. Most importantly with regard to the state of water resources  Kyrgyzstan’s glaciers have shrunk by 30 per cent as a result of global warming. According to preliminary expert forecasts  unless urgent measures are taken there will be practically no glaciers or snowfields on the country’s territory by the year 2100. Those melting waters are the primary source of the rivers of Central Asia.This ongoing negative trend may well lead to a substantial reduction of river flow in Kyrgyzstan  and consequently to social and economic tensions in the region as a whole. We must pursue our work in the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The relevant international financial and ecological organizations must continue to assist the countries of Central Asia in addressing the problem. That is particularly important in the transition to a sustainable use of both water and natural ecosystems resources.The development of hydro-energy is strategically important to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region. We are convinced that it would contribute to an integrated solution of many current and future challenges. We believe that the construction of large hydroelectric power facilities should be considered one path to clean development. Harnessing the hydropower potential of the upstream countries should be considered part of low-carbon development  and developing water resources should be considered the core model for green development in the economic progress of the region. We are ready to participate in an exchange of best practices in water management  water use and the construction of irrigation systems.More than 90 per cent of Kyrgyzstan is located in mountainous areas  which play an important role in the accumulation of water. In that regard  we support the further promotion of the developmental goals of the mountain regions  in accordance with the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. I am confident that a draft resolution on the issue  to be submitted to the General Assembly at this session with the co-sponsorship of Kyrgyzstan  will enjoy the support of all United Nations Members.Some mountainous landlocked countries have special needs for development. High levels of poverty  isolation  the burden of transportation costs and a heavy debt are among the basic range of problems that many mountainous countries face. In such conditions  it is difficult to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to meet the commitments set out in United Nations documents on sustainable development. We hope that the special needs  problems and challenges of mountain countries and communities will be properly reflected in the post-2015 development programme.It is well known that mountain ranges provide valuable ecosystem services and serve as important indicator of environmental health and a support system for the snow leopard  a rare and endangered highland animal. In that regard  Kyrgyzstan is developing a 10-year national protection strategy. We invite everyone to the world forum on the snow leopard to be held on 22 and 23 October in Bishkek  Kyrgyzstan. The rehabilitation and security of uranium tailings  which today total more than 8 million cubic metres on our territory  is very important in Kyrgyzstan. The situation is aggravated by the fact that most are located in seismically active mudflow and flood-prone areas with high groundwater levels  as well near the banks of rivers that form the basis of the Central Asian water supply. The potential consequences of ineffective solutions would have a very negative impact on millions of people in Central Asia.In order to raise the international community’s awareness of the problem and to attract additional assistance towards its solution  at this session the Kyrgyz delegation will introduce a draft resolution under agenda item 19 (j)  “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia”. We call on members to support the draft resolution.It is well known that development and security are closely interrelated. Unfortunately  the maintenance of security and stability and the fight against international terrorism  religious extremism  and illicit drug and arms trafficking and trade remain on the development agenda of Kyrgyzstan and our region. Those issues are most acute in our region because of the current situation in Afghanistan. Despite some progress in the political process in Afghanistan  the stability and security of the country remain at risk. Furthermore  the Afghan drug-production trade  being the largest in the world  is generating a whole range of threats and destabilizing both the political and military situation in Eurasia. Those problems are more critical and significant in our region than ever before  especially in view of the upcoming withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 2014.Kyrgyzstan  in accordance with its commitments  has fully complied with its mission in counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan. Over the past 12 years  Kyrgyzstan has provided an important channel for the supply of military and humanitarian goods to Afghanistan through the transit centre at Manas International Airport. We believe that the international community’s efforts have contributed to the relative stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan and helped the Afghan authorities to assume their leadership role and responsibility in the fields of public administration and development. We are determined to continue our strategic dialogue with partners on all issues of mutual interest. We believe that in the fight against terrorism  drug trafficking and other security challenges stemming from Afghanistan  regional organizations have proved their effectiveness and should be even more involved. I am talking here in particular of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Kyrgyzstan’s chairmanship of those international and regional organizations this year has once again confirmed the need to have comprehensive measures in place to stabilize the situation as soon as possible  both in Afghanistan and in the region as a whole. Along with other measures to combat security challenges and threats  it is necessary to pursue a policy of industrialization aimed at building a sustainable Afghan economy in order to achieve socioeconomic growth in the country. It is also important to involve Afghanistan in the development of regional cooperation and the implementation of major joint socioeconomic and infrastructural projects such as the export of electricity and the building of roads and railroad networks.In that respect  Kyrgyzstan stands ready to expand its trade and economic relations and to implement various infrastructural projects  including the export of electricity to Afghanistan as part of the CASA-1000 project and the establishment of a tripartite — Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan — agro-industrial consortium  with the assistance of the United Nations.Today we must take a fundamentally new approach to solving Afghanistan’s problems  based on a new philosophy and paradigm of social development: the right to development.I should like to take this opportunity to invite representatives of Government and academia to take part in the international research conference on “Afghanistan — 2014”  to be held on 10 October 2013 in the capital of Kyrgyzstan  Bishkek.We are following developments in the Arab world with special attention. The continuing two-year armed conflict in Syria is of great concern. Kyrgyzstan expresses its serious concern about the numerous victims of the armed conflict  the humanitarian disaster it represents and the further escalation of the crisis. We call upon both sides to immediately call a ceasefire and resolve the crisis peacefully through a dialogue between all political forces of the country under the mediation of the United Nations. We support the initiative of the transfer of Syrian chemical weapons and their subsequent destruction  under international supervision  and Syria’s accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. We wish to see the restoration of stability in the country and the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria  without external military interference.The changes occurring in the modern world and its increasing diversity require the strengthening of the United Nations so as to ensure that it continues to play its central role of ensuring global security and the effective implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. That can be achieved through reforming the United Nations  which should be done in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of a broad consensus on the part of States Members of the United Nations.We believe that all States Members of the United Nations should strictly comply with the decisions of the Security Council; we are in favour of expanding its membership in order to make it more representative  transparent and democratic.We attach particular importance to the work of the Economic and Social Council. Kyrgyzstan therefore welcomed the adoption last week of resolution 68/1  on strengthening the role and enhancing the effectiveness of the work of the Council. We hope that a strengthened Council will become an effective mechanism for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda and continue to serve as an important platform for multilateral political dialogue on global social and economic issues.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize the need to move forward firmly and resolutely by means of joint efforts and a common resolve on the part of all countries in order to overcome threats and challenges  maintain peace and well-being and promote development for future generations. Kyrgyzstan is fully prepared to engage in such constructive and effective international cooperation."
"89",3781,"KHM",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. My delegation has full confidence that under his able leadership the new session will draw to a successful conclusion. The President can rest assured of Cambodia’s full support and cooperation throughout his presidency.This year session’s theme  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage ” is very timely as we have less than 1 000 days to reach the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. That development agenda will be one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the United Nations  in which all nations will be called upon to galvanize efforts to help the world live up to its commitments to end poverty  educate children  empower women and provide health services for all.While the overall picture is encouraging  we must also recognize that the progress made towards attaining the MDGs has been insufficient and uneven. Poverty is still widespread  with more than one billion people living in extreme poverty. High maternal and child mortality rates are still seen in too many places throughout the developing world. Most developing countries still face many obstacles to the achievement of all the MDGs within the allocated time frame of 2015  owing to their vulnerability to the global financial crisis  their debt burdens and the failure of some developed countries to meet official development assistance (ODA) commitments.It is high time for donor countries to fulfil their ODA pledges. In addition  debt relief is one of several financial-assistance instruments which can enhance the developing countries’ ability to eradicate poverty. Furthermore  facilitating the transfer of technology from the developed to the developing world plays a critical role in helping countries to further their development efforts and accelerate their economic growth.In the case of Cambodia  the MDGs are firmly embedded as the cornerstone of the country’s development policies and strategies. In a country whose entire population once faced abject poverty and hunger after emerging from war and genocide in 1979  the number of people living below the national poverty line dropped steadily  reaching 19.8 per cent in 2011. The country is well on track — if not ahead of schedule — in terms of attaining its poverty-reduction goal of 19.5 per cent. In fact  Cambodia received a United Nations award for reducing hunger by half well ahead of the MDG target. In general  my country is well positioned to meet most of the Goals on schedule by the end of 2015  thanks not only to the Government’s sound approach and firm commitment but also to sustained peace and political stability.In adopting the MDGs  we acknowledged that sustained and inclusive economic growth in developing countries was a key requirement for eradicating poverty and meeting the targets. In that context  my delegation highly appreciates the far-sighted report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  which is entitled A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  and which sets forth a universal agenda to eradicate extreme poverty from our world by 2030 and to deliver on the promise of sustainable development.Cambodia believes that the post-2015 development agenda should carry forward the spirit of the Millennium Declaration in various ways: first  by setting out a balanced integration of the economic  social and environmental dimensions for sustainable development; secondly  by aiming at the completion of the work started under the MDGs  particularly the goal of eradicating extreme poverty; thirdly  by emphasizing inclusive  equitable and sustainable development and economic growth aimed at effectively addressing inequality and any associated factors; and  fourthly  by focusing not only on the global dimension of development  but also on its regional dimension  while taking into account the particular challenges of the least developed countries.With regard to the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Warsaw in November  my country has high hopes that the Conference will ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol by 2015. Cambodia greatly appreciates the developed countries’ continued commitment to providing funds and technology to help developing nations tackle climate change  in accordance with the United Nations principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.Global and regional peace and security are currently threatened by conflicts  armed confrontation and transnational organized crime  which take a heavy toll on many development efforts. Against that backdrop  Cambodia welcomes the signing of the Arms Trade Treaty  the first ever international treaty to regulate the trade of conventional weapons.Another security issue is the presence of landmines and other explosive remnants of war  which continue to pose constant threats to human security and safety and hinder national development. To counter those threats  last year in Phnom Penh the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) decided to establish the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center and to base it in Cambodia.For its part  Cambodia has spared no effort to address the issue of landmines. To that end  it has established demining and clearance of other unexploded ordnance as an additional MDG of its own. Substantial progress has been made in realizing that goal  as is demonstrated by the sharp decline in the number of mine explosion accidents in Cambodia  from over 300 cases in 2008 to 186 in 2012. As Chair of the Eleventh Meeting of the States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty  or Ottawa Treaty  Cambodia made a strong commitment to work towards a world free of landmines and unexploded ordnance. Since 2006  Cambodia has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations by sending mine-clearance experts to a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East  including the Sudan  South Sudan  the Central African Republic  Chad and Lebanon  and very soon to Mali.On the situation in the Korean peninsula  we welcome the positive developments between North Korea and South Korea  which  I hope  will lead to a significant improvement in inter-Korean relations and the resumption of the Six-Party Talks. We encourage the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply fully with its obligations to cease its nuclear programme  as spelled out by the relevant Security Council resolutions.My country reaffirms its support for the Palestinian people’s just demand for a sovereign and independent State of Palestine and for the two-State solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict. We urge all parties to play a constructive role in the efforts aimed at resuming peace talks and to remove any obstacles standing in the way of such resumption.With regard to the Syrian situation  Cambodia strongly condemns human rights violations and the use of chemical weapons. My delegation fully supports Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  adopted on Friday with the aim of destroying Syria’s chemical weapons.My delegation also calls for an end to the unilateral embargo on Cuba  which has caused the Cuban people decades of untold suffering.We are seriously concerned about the extensive levels of sexual violence inflicted on innocent women and children in armed conflicts around the world. My country endorses the declaration of commitment on ending sexual violence in conflict  issued on 24 September at a side event during the general debate.Since the establishment of the United Nations  in 1945  the world situation has changed so dramatically that there is an urgent need to strengthen global diplomacy. In that context  the reform of the United Nations should be comprehensive and include not only the Security Council but also other organs  so as to maintain the Organization’s relevance as a global governance institution that can cope effectively with world reality. The General Assembly should be empowered to play a greater leading role in strengthening the wider United Nations system  improving international governance and enhancing multilateralism. At the same time  the Economic and Social Council should also be strengthened  so that it can effectively coordinate international cooperation and efforts to tackle social and economic challenges. Both the permanent and non-permanent membership categories of the Security Council should be expanded in an equitable manner  so that the Council represents both developed and developing countries. A comprehensive reform of the Council to make it a body where real negotiations and compromises can take place is acutely needed."
"90",3795,"KIR",68,2013,"I bring warm greetings from the people of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am privileged to once again address this Assembly.I would like to take the opportunity to echo the sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador John W. Ashe on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are indeed very proud to have a brother from the small island developing States presiding over this session. I am confident that under his able stewardship of the Assembly will continue its work towards improving security and quality of life for all members of our global community  in particular the most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the leadership of his predecessor  Mr Vuk Jeremi..I also commend the untiring commitment and work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has been an able navigator on this journey  steering the United Nations through the diverse and complex realities and the myriad challenges facing our peoples and nations. On behalf of the people of my country and our region  I wish to reiterate our deep gratitude for his personal commitment to the issue of climate change and the plight of the most vulnerable. Our people still remember with fondness the Secretary-General’s visit to Kiribati in 2011  which was particularly significant in that it was the first visit to our country and region by the head of the United Nations. I am also heartened and humbled to hear that his visit brought home to him the stark realities of the challenges facing our people  living as we are on the front line of climate change.As we gather again in New York for this session  the problems are perhaps greater today than they were a year ago. Security challenges posed by climate change  conflicts  terrorism  transnational organized crime and other threats continue to undermine our efforts to achieve sustainable development  peace and security for our global community. In the past few weeks  we have seen heartbreaking events unfold here in the United States  in Syria  in Pakistan  in Kenya and in other parts of the world  giving ample evidence of the growing security threats to our peoples from within our own societies. We commiserate and join in prayer with the families of all those affected by those barbaric and terrorist acts.The ongoing work of the United Nations  and the work awaiting us at this session  reflect these challenges  and the President has appropriately selected the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” for our discussions this week. Kiribati welcomes the theme. We believe that it provides an opportunity for us to reflect on what we have done and achieved as individuals  as leaders of our countries  and together as a global body entrusted with making the world a more peaceful  secure and better place for everyone. We must continue to ask ourselves if what we are doing is in the best interests of all our people  or of just a select few. We must examine our efforts as leaders of this global family and ask ourselves if we are doing the right thing for our children and their children  whose future rests in our hands and depends on our decisions.This is the eighth time I have had the honour to address this Assembly in my ten years as President  and on each occasion I have sought to convey the same message. On each occasion  I have spoken of the real and existential threat to my nation posed by climate change and sea-level rise  and I have called for urgent action to ensure the long-term survival of countries like mine. Last year (see A/67/PV.11)  I said that I would continue to speak of the peril confronting my country for as long as I have breath in my body. Well  I am still breathing and the peril remains. It is a critical issue for the survival of our people and indeed for all of humankind. Many of us here today are parents  and even grandparents. I myself have 10 grandchildren. Surely the world that we want to leave to our grandchildren should be better than the one we inherited. But we are not on course to achieve that. In fact  we are disastrously off course. The scientists tell us — as I am sure they will again reaffirm in their next assessment report — that calamity awaits  and not just for those of us on low-lying islands. What we are experiencing now on these low-lying atoll islands is an early warning of what will happen further down the line. No one will be spared. We cannot continue to abuse our planet in the same old way. To shape the future we want for our children and grandchildren  we need leadership  we need commitment  we need action — now. When we all return home to our children and grandchildren  we must be able to look them in the eye and tell them with confidence that we have done all that is humanly possible to combat the devastating consequences of climate change.We are grateful to the General Assembly for acknowledging that climate change is a matter that warrants the attention of the Security Council. I applaud the commitment of our Secretary-General to that specific security threat and particularly welcome his recent announcement to convene a high-level climate summit at approximately this time next year. It will be the most significant such event since the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009.But the Secretary-General cannot mobilize the remedy needed on his own. He will need the support of all nations to ensure that the action necessary to address climate change is taken. We must step up our national and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. We must urge major greenhouse gas emitters to do their part. We must also call with urgency on our development partners to assist in our efforts to deal with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise now being experienced in our countries  and in our efforts to prepare our people for an uncertain future.The delivery of international adaptation finance and resources is taking much too long. We cannot continue to stand on the sidelines and wait for others to deliver. In Kiribati  we are taking charge of our situation and moving forward with our mitigation and adaptation strategies. We have finalized a national adaptation framework and are now working directly with our partners on it. Australia  New Zealand  Taiwan and the World Bank are working with us to implement our national adaptation priorities.While we are taking adaptation measures to ensure that Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible  prudence demands that we prepare for the future of our people. We are looking to improve the skills of our people to a level where they are able to exercise the option of migrating  to be able to migrate with dignity.When it comes to the Millennium Development Goals  our situation has not changed much since I last spoke before this body. We are on track on some of the Goals  but we continue to be off track on most. This  I believe  should not come as a surprise  as most of the limited resources we have continue to be diverted from equally pressing priorities to fighting the onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges and their impact on our water supplies  homes  livelihoods and public infrastructure. This is a costly exercise  one we cannot afford but that is necessary. We will continue to rely on the support and goodwill of our partners and members of our global family in that regard.As we prepare for the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in Samoa in 2014  the special needs of the most vulnerable low-lying small States  like Kiribati  the Marshall Islands  Maldives and Tuvalu  must be highlighted  for how can we meaningfully discuss sustainable development goals when a disproportionate amount of our time and scarce resources are focused on ensuring the survival of our people?For us  the ocean is a double-edged sword. Sea-level rise threatens the very survival of our people. But the ocean is also an integral part of our lives and provides daily subsistence for our people. It can and should be a ticket to freedom from dependency on others. We are a nation of water. We own substantial fishery resources. The annual total catch in our waters is valued at some $400 million. Yet as owners  we receive only 8 per cent of that sum. Where is the equity  where is the justice in this? We believe that this must change. Our objective must be to maximize the returns from those resources  and we have started in that direction with the establishment of our first fish-processing plant through a public-private partnership. We invite our partners to join us in that endeavour. I am convinced that  given the right support  we can achieve sustainable development by utilizing the available resources of our vast exclusive economic zone. Through this approach  we can reduce our reliance on external assistance. I believe that if we are provided with the support we now need to develop our capacity to harvest and process our own resources  we will also be better able to build our climate-change resilience.The ocean is the next frontier in the pursuit of sustainable development. While we have failed to protect our land and atmosphere from our human demands  we must make sure that the ocean does not meet with the same fate.In June last year  we met in Rio de Janeiro to review our progress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth Summit. Unfortunately  our track record in delivering on our undertakings has not been good. In fact  in many respects  our environment is worse off today than it was 21 years ago.We renewed our commitment in Rio to achieving the future we want  but we need to move beyond commitments and to act. The future we want will require this Organization to restructure and realign itself to reflect the realities of our time: a time in which new and emerging security threats  such as climate change  climate variability  sea-level rise and ocean acidification  are challenging the international system of governance; a time in which the future survival of some nations is seriously in question; a time when all those countries with the ability to do so must contribute to the prevention of this calamity or be forever judged by history.Business as usual can no longer be considered an option. Let us not limit ourselves to working within the boundaries of our comfort zones. Let us be inclusive rather than exclusive. We must listen to civil society  our youth and women’s groups and allow those with the ability to make a contribution to join in the global dialogue and action to address these major challenges.In that regard  we welcome the continued resolve of the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly to accelerate action on the reform of our Organization  to ensure the highest level of global collaboration  accountability and decisive action  and to inspire a greater sense of urgency on issues of critical concern to our global community.We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the international processes of the World Health Assembly. We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in respect of other international institutions and processes  so that Taiwan  and others currently excluded  can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind.Resolution 66/288 calls for a frank assessment of our global decision-making structure. It requires bold but rational political commitment on a global scale. As leaders of our global family  we must be brutally honest in accepting the fact that unless we act now to shape the future we want for our children and their children’s children  the prospects for success will be bleak. As we chart the path towards the future we want  we must address the fundamental threats to the security and very existence of the members of this family of nations. Once again I call on all of us to ask ourselves the question  “Whose interests are we pursuing? Are we here to secure the future of each other’s children or just our own?” This is the greatest moral challenge facing us today."
"91",3826,"KNA",68,2013,"I am particularly pleased to extend congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am indeed proud  given your stellar service to the General Assembly and of the service you have rendered to your native land  Antigua and Barbuda  and to the Latin America and Caribbean region in general. As a member of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean regional group and the wider Caribbean region  Saint Kitts and Nevis pledges its full support to you throughout your tenure at the helm of the General Assembly. I am confident that your expertise and skills will position you favourably to guide the general debate and the extensive work programme of the various committees and agencies of this body.Sir  Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record its appreciation to your predecessor  the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for the important contributions that he made to advance the work of the institution during his own tenure.We begin the sixty-eighth session fully cognizant of the diverse challenges with which we must contend  and equally seized of our obligation as a Government and people to contribute to the global priorities that inform the work of the Assembly. We see the relevance of maintaining sharp focus on those areas that are quite integral to the national and international development agendas. I refer to matters such as sustainable development  the maintenance of international peace and security  the promotion of human rights  disarmament  the promotion of justice and international law  and the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts. Those  we believe  are the core principles for informing any plan of action to advance towards the post-2015 era with the confidence that our shared vision for meeting the goals we set  will be realized.Just a few days ago  Saint Kitts and Nevis attained another milestone  celebrating three decades of nationhood with a very strong commitment to maintaining the stability and prosperity of our nation  drawing on our own creativity as a Government and a people. Therefore  this year’s statement is very significant for our proud nation. As one of the smallest States Members of the Organization in the western hemisphere  we are pleased with the significant strides that we have made as my Government pursues a process of transformation for sustainability in a nation that is not immune to global developments that continue to have a negative impact on its national agenda.However  my Government is working assiduously to transform our former sugar-based economy into one that is service-oriented  driven mainly by tourism and hospitality and supported by international financial and offshore education services and by manufacturing and agriculture. In all of this  we are aware of the momentum and impact of information and communication technology as a tool that will assist us in developing our national economy.As far as the manufacturing sector is concerned  we have developed a cluster of light manufacturing enterprises that service the North and South American and European markets with quality electronic and electrical components for construction  cable television  and the aerospace and aircraft industries. Indeed  our present economic trajectory will ensure that we meet both the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and our own sustainable development goals in the post-2015 development agenda. That is why the theme for this session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is perceived to be quite relevant.My delegation is pleased that at this session we will be reviewing the progress made towards achieving the MDGs as the target date of 2015 fast approaches. In that regard  the Secretary-General must be commended for his initiative. I am pleased to indicate that Saint Kitts and Nevis has taken tremendous strides in achieving the MDG 1  concerning the eradication of extreme poverty. Our Government has invested heavily in creating a very solid and expansive social safety infrastructure that has helped the less fortunate to lead dignified lives. We provide subsidized health care for children and the elderly. We assist vulnerable families with the resources to pursue education and provide them with hot  nourishing meals each day. We also provide living facilities for the aged and the indigent.My delegation hopes that every effort will be made globally to ensure that all targets are met by the indicative 2015 deadline. The Millennium Development Goals Report 2013 provides a clear indication of exactly where the international community should be directing its focus. The world as a whole has to pay a great deal of attention to the MDGs that are most off track  and those where progress has stalled  including those relating to hunger  universal access to primary education  child mortality  maternal health and access to sanitation. All nations must therefore redouble their efforts to exercise the requisite political will to implement programmes designed especially to meet the established targets and to improve the lives of millions of people in a meaningful way.We must never lose sight of the intrinsic linkages that exist between the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals  particularly in the post-2015 development agenda. Both processes  though running in parallel  are mutually reinforcing in the sense that the latter will accelerate programmes to meet target indicators in the former  while the former will provide valuable lessons for achieving a higher degree of overall success.Cognizant of the fact that poverty eradication is intrinsically linked to attaining sustainable development  we must strive to ensure that a balanced approach is taken to blending economic growth  equity  social inclusion and environmental sustainability as we craft and implement policies to achieve development that is both meaningful and truly sustainable. The post-2015 development agenda must be arrived at through transparent and inclusive intergovernmental negotiations under the United Nations. In that regard  my delegation appreciates the decision taken at the special event on the follow-up to achieving the MDGs that was convened earlier this week.The post-2015 development agenda should also address other challenges faced by developing countries  such as universal access to modern energy services  ensuring food security and nutrition  providing full and productive employment and decent work for all  job skills and training  agricultural development  building productive capacity  and infrastructure development. My Government has seen the positive impact of its own national initiative  which is geared towards providing young people in particular with the skills they need to integrate themselves into the world of work through the People Empowerment Programme. To date  over 2 000 young men and women have reaped the benefits of this particular initiative.It is very important for all States Members of this great Organization to play an active role in ensuring that the targets identified in the post-2015 era adequately address the remaining gaps by the indicative deadline for achieving the MDGs. My delegation would therefore wish to reaffirm its commitment to ensuring that small island developing States remain a special case for ensuring sustainable development  recognizing our unique characteristics  our challenges and vulnerabilities  and their ongoing impact on our ability to achieve and build resilience. Small island developing States remain constrained in meeting the economic  environmental and social challenges they face. While we recognize our own responsibility for overcoming some of these setbacks  we wish to stress that in the absence of cooperation and assistance from the international community  success will definitely remain difficult.At this juncture  allow me to place on record our appreciation to some of our development partners that have offered us tangible assistance in stabilizing our national economy and in generally diversifying the national economy  in particular in the field of agricultural diversification  information and communications technologies  development and energy diversification in an economy that relies on fossil-fuel consumption. This phenomenon will have a positive impact on our energy cost-reduction efforts as we advance towards realizing our goal of a fully green economy as we endeavour to bring much-needed relief to our people by 2015.The contributions of the Governments of the Republic of China  Japan  the United States of America  Venezuela  the United Kingdom  Canada and Cuba  and of the Organization of American States  the European Union  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in particular  have assisted greatly in that regard.The Assembly will agree that no discussion of the issue of development can progress without reference to the area of health  and in particular the chronic illnesses that continue to plague our societies resulting in the loss of lives  thus retarding our developmental thrust. It was just a few days ago  in the margins of the sixty-eighth session  that I had the privilege of addressing a forum on non-communicable diseases and disability  held in collaboration with several permanent missions  the Caribbean Community secretariat  the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)  the World Health Organization and the Non-Communicable Disease Alliance. The forum was designed to bring focused attention to creating synergies between non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and disabilities and to examine how health systems can be reoriented and reinforced to ensure equitable access to high-quality care and thereby advance development.In that forum  we were able to confirm that NCDs are driven not only by ageing but increasingly and alarmingly by the growing number of cases of juvenile diabetes and the growing number of youth incapacitated by accident injury. The high incidence of NCDs within the Caribbean also places an increased burden on our open economies  which are highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters  diverting resources that could be allocated to building quality infrastructure and our precious human capital. Indeed  we accept the recommendation of the report of the Caribbean Commission on Health and Development that urgent steps must be taken to reverse those particular trends.Therefore  as we focus strategically on the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda  we cannot lose sight of non-communicable diseases and the real threat that they pose to societies across the globe. We are therefore grateful for the attention that was given at the United Nations High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases two years ago to the need for a global response to that problem. We recognize that much work has been undertaken by the World Health Organization  the Pan American Health Organization and other regional bodies to reverse the high incidence of NCDs in our region. There is now a strong emphasis on testing  since the collection of empirical data is key for proper tracking and analysis. The preparation of strategic plans and budgets and the incorporation of families and communities into education  prevention and detection programmes are all pivotal in this regard.My delegation is convinced that the combat against the high incidence of non-communicable diseases must receive greater prominence in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. It is evident that there is a strong nexus between a nation’s health status and its levels of productivity. My delegation therefore subscribes to the notion that a nation’s wealth lies in the health of its people. Our High-level Meeting of two years ago was an important first step in that regard  and it is one on which we must continue to build on an ongoing basis. It is clear that we need to adopt a strategy similar to the global response to HIV/AIDS in order to achieve the levels of success in fighting the incidence of NCDs.Today  I respectfully submit that there are practical lessons to be learned from the experience developed by agencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and PAHO that have touched the lives of millions in a positive way. It is therefore important for the Assembly to keep on the front burner a practical strategy to address the high incidence of NCDs within our region and the nations of the world.As we usher in a dispensation of sustainment  we remain cognizant of the inextricable link between development and an environment of peace and security. Crime in any society is an unwelcome and destabilizing threat that must be dealt with promptly. Indeed  the ways in which societies are affected at both the micro and the macro levels are known to us all. Entire societies are forced to bear the myriad costs associated with personal injury  psychological insecurity and the related health-care repercussions.That is why we in Saint Kitts and Nevis have placed great emphasis on effective leadership  clear lines of authority and responsibility  targeted equipment upgrades  expanded and ongoing training  community policing  strengthened relations between the police and the public  and full cooperation at all levels between our national police force and our national defence force. As a result  Saint Kitts and Nevis has made tremendous strides in confronting the challenge of crime. Indeed  in the space of just over one year  we were able to see crime plummet by some 53 per cent  convincing us of the importance of the United Nations providing a forum via which Member States might share best practices in this era of globalized criminality. If the challenge is becoming international in scope  so too must our response.In that regard  we are equally aware that the socioeconomic and political gains that we are trying to achieve in the global community will be elusive if the environment of peace is interrupted by warfare and threats to the peaceful coexistence of the world’s peoples. Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore joins in condemning the atrocities that have recently been perpetrated in Syria and Kenya  which have resulted in wanton loss of human lives. Such use of chemical and conventional weapons  resort to acts of violence and terrorism  and their spiralling inhumane effects will ultimately have a far-reaching deleterious impact on global safety and security  which must continue to be a concern for all of the world’s leaders and their peoples.More than any other time in its history  the United Nations must be more assertive in executing its mandate as a leading actor in securing world peace. Saint Kitts and Nevis appreciates the strides that we have made with the Arms Trade Treaty  and would urge that we move with alacrity to ensure its entry into force. However  as a small island State with open borders  we see the relevance of establishing international standards and controls that will govern the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons through our Caribbean ports.We commend the United States of America for the partnership that has been forged with Saint Kitts and Nevis and the other States Members of the Caribbean that form part of the United States Caribbean Basin Security Initiative  which  among other things  will be pivotal to our efforts to stop the illicit flow of foreign-made small arms into our peaceful Caribbean region. This initiative has provided avenues of collaboration in crime prevention and detection as we work together in building the capacity of our security forces. This  we are convinced  will contribute significantly to creating an enabling environment for sustainable development through the prevalence of peace and security in our communities.Our focus is not only on the international dimensions of crime. Indeed  we are mindful of the fact that all over the world  women and children are among the most vulnerable in our societies  and so we have instituted a clear and assertive zero-tolerance policy in this regard. Violence against women and children must be seen not as a personal or family matter  but instead as a socially destructive behaviour demanding judicial intervention. If and where this zero-tolerance policy does not yet exist  we strongly urge its embrace today and its immediate implementation.Thirty years ago  Saint Kitts and Nevis established diplomatic relations with several countries  including the Republic of China on Taiwan. In the intervening years  this relationship has been mutually beneficial. As the debate on sustainable development unfolds  Saint Kitts and Nevis is eminently qualified to speak on the myriad contributions that the Republic of China is capable of making to the international community. While the international community is preoccupied with ensuring peace and security globally  we can applaud the Government of the Republic of China for promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait and proposing the East China Sea Peace Initiative  thereby demonstrating a commitment to peace and stability.Taiwan is one of the top 18 economies globally. In addition  Taiwan has worked assiduously to advance the economic interests of countries such as ours. In this regard  we have collaborated on a large number of key projects  such as the multisectoral agritourism demonstration farm  our high-priority solar energy farm and an information and communications technology centre  which are all designed to advance the social and economic interests of my small nation.I wish to place on record my delegation’s appreciation to the World Health Organization for having invited Taiwan  for five consecutive years  to attend the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer. We are of the view that Taiwan has adopted a very pragmatic approach to its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and functional organizations that are critical to the current global efforts to address many issues of mutual concern. My delegation is convinced that the arrangements made for Taiwan’s presence in the World Health Assembly  which have been referred to as the WHA model  serve as a useful point of reference for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in other international agencies  such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While on that note  permit me to commend Mr. Roberto Kobeh González  President of the ICAO Council  on the decision to invite Taiwan to attend this month’s thirty-eighth ICAO Assembly as a special guest.Germane to the concept of exclusion from the international trading arrangement is the trade embargo imposed on Cuba at the height of the Cold War  which today remains a matter of concern for Saint Kitts and Nevis  as it does to the vast majority of nations represented in this important institution. Our own position is based on our commitment to international law  the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and our obligations under the same. We therefore  like so many in this Hall  are concerned about the extraterritorial application and effects of national legislation on the sovereignty of States. Therefore  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis reiterates its support for resolution 67/4 on the necessity of ending the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba  and once again calls for an immediate end to that unilateral action.As we move to open a chapter that will usher in a more enlightened era of human existence  Saint Kitts and Nevis joins with the States members of the Caribbean Community in supporting the very important case for reparations associated with the atrocities of slavery. Although the repercussions of slavery on the lives of our ancestors cannot be quantified  we are convinced that the deleterious effects  which even now are translated into much hardship and poverty for the descendants of our ancestors  must be resolved. Therefore  the time has come.The world has seen more than its share of conflicts in recent years. In addition  natural disasters  sometimes caused by climate change  continue to wreak havoc in many corners of the globe. All of this speaks to the importance of us marshalling and managing very carefully those resources that have been placed under our respective control for the benefit of the people we represent. It speaks to the importance of us being far more responsible stewards of this planet than we have been in the past. It speaks to our working assiduously  whenever we can  to abate tensions and promote peace.There can be change in 2015 only as long as we do not fail to take a bold and definitive stance in addressing the ills that stymie our efforts to move forward in achieving our goals. There will be change in 2015 if we do not fail to pursue the priorities that will eradicate poverty  enhance global peace and security  find alternative means of reducing the impact of climate change and saving our planet from destruction  and reduce elevated incidences of HIV/AIDS and NCDs. There must be change in 2015 if the agencies of the Organization adopt a policy of equity and the strong determination to execute their mandate to enable the institutionalization of a culture of peace and security  respect for human lives and justice for all.Let us therefore  today and forever  commit to rising to the challenge and moving forward  imbued with a renewed sense of focus  determination and urgency to fulfil our goals. May all that we say here bring us closer to that most vital and crucial of ends."
"92",3852,"KOR",68,2013,"May I first congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am confident that the current session will be a fruitful one under your able leadership.The Republic of Korea is pleased that the United Nations  in partnership with its Member States and under the stewardship of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  is strengthening multilateralism by successfully responding to the diverse challenges that the international community faces. We are confident that the Secretary-General’s Five-Year Action Plan will help the United Nations to keep making important contributions in this period of transformation.Twenty-two years ago I was present in the Assembly to watch with great emotion the historic moment when the Republic of Korea was admitted as a State Member of the United Nations. The moment came at the end of a long wait during the Cold War. At that time the Republic of Korea solemnly pledged to actively take part in the shaping of a new global order that is free  fair and prosperous and where justice and the rule of law prevail. To live up to this pledge  the Republic of Korea  though a latecomer  has fully embraced the callings of the United Nations with passion and devotion. In many corners of the world  Korea has actively taken part in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. Currently  Korea is serving as a member of the Security Council and the Human Rights Council  among others.Since its inception  the United Nations has taken on the noble endeavour of helping the peoples of the United Nations to live in larger freedom. However  insecurity and inequality  injustice and intolerance still prevail in many parts of the world  where our common efforts are desperately needed. Furthermore  the rise of new global challenges  such as climate change  terrorism and cybercrime  calls for global cooperation that transcends the existing inter-State system. In other words  the importance and the relevance of the United Nations is ever increasing  as it is a key vehicle for global cooperation.The new Administration of the Republic of Korea has put forward its foreign-policy vision  which is built on two fundamental objectives: “happiness of the people” and “happiness of the global community”. Such a vision resonates with the core values of the United Nations — peace  human rights and development.Korea seeks to make meaningful contributions to maintain global peace beyond the Korean peninsula. We want to share the fruits of our economic success  which was achieved with the help of the international community  and strive to enhance the dignity and happiness of all global citizens. I believe that that is in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations as well.The first pillar in attaining global happiness is security. In particular  the Republic of Korea is of the view that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.In that connection  the use of chemical weapons in Syria  as confirmed by the report of the United Nations investigators (A/67/997)  has caused the worst humanitarian disaster in the twenty-first century. The Government of the Republic of Korea condemns the use of chemical weapons in the strongest possible terms  as it constitutes a crime against humanity that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.In that regard  we welcome the recent agreement between the United States and Russia on the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons  and expect a decision by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. and a reinforcing resolution by the Security Council  sometime today. We urge the Syrian Government to faithfully implement its commitments to the international community. We also strongly call upon all countries that have not acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention  including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  to do so as soon as possible.In that context  I must draw attention to the seriousness of the Democratic People’s Republic’s ongoing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. Despite a series of Security Council resolutions  the Democratic People’s Republic launched long-range missiles and conducted nuclear tests as recently as in early 2013  in blatant violation of its international obligations. It should strictly implement its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions  including resolution 2094 (2013). As is the case with Syria  the international community should make united efforts to roll back the Democratic People’s Republic’s nuclear-weapons programmes to prevent the advent of another nuclear-armed State. However  if it decides to give up its so-called parallel pursuit of economic development and nuclear armament and in turn embarks on a path of genuine change through concrete actions  the Republic of Korea stands ready to help the Democratic People’s Republic.Alongside the proliferation of WMD  terrorism presents a grave threat to international peace and security in the twenty-first century. The Republic of Korea strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place last weekend in Nairobi  Kenya. Our sincere condolences go out to the victims and their families of the tragedy. The Government of the Republic of Korea denounces all forms of terrorism and will continue to take part in the global efforts to combat terrorism.Together with its efforts to respond to the imminent security threats  including the proliferation of WMD  the new Administration of the Republic of Korea is pursuing a policy that it calls “trustpolitik”  to establish a regional order of reconciliation and cooperation in the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. Our trustpolitik  in turn  is implemented through the Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process and the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative.The Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process aspires to safeguard peace based on strong deterrence  while simultaneously building peace through dialogue and cooperation. Through that process  the new Administration of the Republic of Korea was able to ensure the resumption of operations in the Kaesong industrial park  the only remaining inter-Korean economic cooperation project.Furthermore  the Republic of Korea proposes to create a world peace park in the world’s most heavily armed demilitarized zone  in order to transform a lasting legacy of the Cold War and a divided Korea into a new space of peace and harmony. It is my hope that the United Nations and the two Koreas will work together to bring this proposal to fruition  thereby contributing greatly to the building of trust in the Korean peninsula.Turning to the broader region of North-East Asia  Korea is expecting further political and security cooperation that corresponds to the level of economic interdependence in the region. To that end  the Republic of Korea proposed the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative  which will open dialogue on soft issues of common interests to the players in the region. The Republic of Korea is also interested in learning from the valuable experiences in successful regional institutions  such as the European Union  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.The second pillar of an era of global happiness is the promotion of human rights and human dignity as universal values. In the past century  the Republic of Korea went through a colonial occupation and a tragic internecine war. From that experience  Koreans became more appreciative than others of the paramount importance of human rights and humanitarianism.Worldwide  there is an alarming increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced persons owing to wars and intra-State conflicts. Concerning the massive refugee problem caused by the Syrian civil war  my Government is actively involved in international efforts to assist the refugees. Korea is also planning to co-host a working group meeting on Syrian reconstruction in Seoul next month. The Republic of Korea also wishes to emphasize the need to uphold the internationally established legal principle of non-refoulement.Today  there are over 10 million people in Korea suffering from the agony of not being able to see their loved ones across the inter-Korean border  even 60 years after the end of the Korean War. Based on the recent agreement between the two Koreas  a reunion for those separated families was to be held this week. However  to our utmost regret  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea unilaterally cancelled that reunion  which would have been a humanitarian event  citing political reasons. Such an inhumane decision cannot be justified for any sound reason. Thus far  the new Administration of the Republic of Korea has maintained the insulation of humanitarian issues from political considerations. I therefore urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to convene the family reunion as soon as possible so as to ease the pain and suffering of the Korean people as a whole.The Republic of Korea wishes to draw the attention of the Assembly to the increasing need to protect civilians  including women and children  from armed conflicts around the globe. With that in mind  during its presidency of the Security Council in February  the Republic of Korea chaired an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict (see S/PV.6917). We are also one of the champions of the newly launched protection from sexual violence initiative. In fact  sexual violence during conflicts is one of the most serious types of human rights violation. It is a war crime that not only destroys the life of the victim  but also that of the victim’s family and the community.In particular  for the victims of sexual violence during conflicts of the past century  the pain and the agony continue to this day. What matters most is genuine remorse and concrete actions. As repeatedly emphasized in reports of United Nations special rapporteurs on sexual violence  responsible measures are called for that can restore the honour of the victims and soothe their pain  as such crimes involve a universal human rights issue.Underdevelopment and extreme poverty are the core challenges facing the United Nations today. Since the Millennium Summit was held in 2000  the collective efforts by the international community to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have yielded some very tangible results. However  progress has not been equally enjoyed across all regions  countries and groups of people. It is against that backdrop that we attach great importance to discussions on the future direction of and road map for development cooperation  under the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  at the present session of the General Assembly.The next set of common global development goals should be genuinely people-centred and take into account a standard of well-being that goes beyond the traditional income levels. The new goals should place the greatest priority on guaranteeing the dignity of all. Furthermore  they should seek to build partnerships with the newly emerging development actors  so as to effectively utilize available capacities and resources. The Republic of Korea hopes that the Busan Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation  launched in 2012  will also play a significant role in setting up a new cooperative mechanism to lead the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.Such development goals also coincide with Korea’s foreign policy objective of building an era of global happiness. The Republic of Korea hopes to work together to complete the unfinished business of the MDGs by pursuing a recipient-oriented development cooperation policy. More specifically  we will continue to increase our official development assistance and share our successful development experiences  such as the Saemaul Undong  or New Community Movement  with developing countries.In addition  a united response to climate change is critical to achieving global happiness. Korea will actively support the Green Climate Fund  headquartered in Korea  so that it develops into a significant organization that supports developing countries in responding to climate change and the threats it brings.Deepening global interdependence has led to the rise of challenges requiring a common response. Expectations of the role to be played by the United Nations are now higher than ever before. Indeed  the United Nations has made great contributions as the centre of global cooperation and is expected to continue in those noble endeavours. As former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld once said  we should“recognize the United Nations for what it is — an admittedly imperfect but indispensable instrument of nations working for a peaceful evolution towards a more just and secure world order”.I am reminded of the solemn pledge that my Government made 22 years ago — that the Republic of Korea will actively contribute to the resolution of global challenges through the United Nations. Today  I stand before the Assembly to reaffirm the commitment of the new Government of the Republic of Korea — that Korea will contribute to realizing the era of global happiness by achieving the goals set out by the United Nations. It is only when we make common and collective efforts toward advancing the universal values of peace  development and human rights that the United Nations will truly become the parliament of humankind."
"93",3898,"KWT",68,2013,"At the outset  it is with pleasure that I extend  on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait  our sincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe and to his country  Antigua and Barbuda  upon his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are certain that his vast experience in international affairs will enable him to conduct the deliberations of this session wisely and ably  and we wish him success in that endeavour. We extend our thanks to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his great efforts as President at the previous session. I should also like to pay tribute to the tremendous and tireless efforts by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in leading the Organization and disseminating its lofty message and in seeking to maintain international peace and security  in fulfilment of the aspirations of the States and peoples of the world for a better world that guarantees a life of dignity for all human beings.The State of Kuwait condemns the acts of terrorism committed in a shopping centre in Nairobi on Saturday  21 September. We extend our sincerest condolences to the people and Government of Kenya and to the families of the victims. We also underscore again our support for Bahrain and all of the measures being undertaken there to strengthen security.The maintenance of regional and international peace and security occupies a position of great importance among the priorities of the foreign policy of the State of Kuwait  based on its principles and objectives  the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law  which call for the building of bridges of confidence  good-neighbourly relations  mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  as well as for the promotion of the concepts of peaceful coexistence and the pursuit of peaceful settlements to conflicts and disputes.In November 2012  the State of Kuwait celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of its Constitution  which was the result of a distinctive experience reflecting relations between ruler and subject. It evolved in a historically seamless manner into a democratic mechanism involving popular participation. That process has embodied the essence and values of political growth based on a commitment to working for peace  as well as developing and strengthening relations with neighbouring countries in accordance with the principles of mutual respect  common interests and rising above the wounds of the past in order to chart a better future for the region and the world.In that context  I would highlight our bilateral relations with the Republic of Iraq and to commend the efforts of the Iraqi Government to fulfil its international commitments to the State of Kuwait  in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Our bilateral relations have developed in positive and tangible ways through communications at the highest level between the leadership of both countries. We have overcome our past differences and are looking to the future to strengthen and develop future bilateral relations for the welfare and interests of the peoples of both countries.We also look forward to genuine cooperation with the Republic of Iraq in order to find the remains of missing Kuwaitis and third-country nationals and undertake a serious search for the national archives of the State of Kuwait  in implementation of Security Council resolution 2107 (2013). That resolution was adopted following the understanding reached to transfer follow-up responsibility for these matters from the High-level Coordinator on the issue of the repatriation or return of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals or their remains to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. In this regard  we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General and his concern to accelerate the closure of these two issues  discover the fate of the remaining missing persons and put an end to their families’ suffering.More than two and a half years have passed since the eruption of the crisis in Syria. This crisis is more than a humanitarian disaster; it is fast approaching the definition of a catastrophe  with the increasing numbers of victims and missing persons  both internally and externally  and the recurring scenes of bloodshed  violence  destruction  oppression and violation of the most basic principles and values of humankind. The scale of the crisis has become an obstacle to any possible solution that could contain it  despite the great and continued efforts at the regional and international levels. The Security Council has been faced with a historic and decisive responsibility: to start taking serious and tangible steps to ensure solutions that can guarantee an end to the bloodshed of the brotherly Syrian people  achieve their demands and restore security and stability in their country.In January 2013  in response to the suffering of the Syrian people owing to the exacerbation of the crisis and its destructive consequences  the State of Kuwait hosted an international donors conference to support the humanitarian situation in Syria. This conference achieved the desired results  and pledges surpassed the targeted amount of $1.5 billion  of which the State of Kuwait contributed $300 million. This amount has been disbursed in full to a number of United Nations bodies and agencies  which converted it into emergency relief assistance to the Syrian people  inside and outside Syria. The State of Kuwait would like to thank all countries that participated in the donors conference. Their participation reflected their care and concern regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria.We all recognize that the maintenance of peace and security is the key that opens the doors to a dignified life  prosperity and human creativity. This is because factors such as development  in all its economic  social  environmental  political and cultural aspects  cannot take place when peace and security are lacking or ebbing.Turning to the Middle East region  Palestine is still facing chronic challenges that have disrupted the vision of a future based on development and regional and international cooperation. The political and security conditions in the region have also been disrupted by the lack of confidence created by Israel’s continued policy of building illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian lands  its continued siege of the Gaza Strip and the detention of thousands of Palestinians and their imprisonment in subhuman conditions  in contravention of the most basic rules of international humanitarian law. Such practices reached their peak after Palestine received Observer State status in the Organization.In this regard  we reiterate that only the international community will be able to find the difficult formula for peace. We value in this respect the ongoing efforts of the United States of America to achieve a breakthrough in the peace process and hope that persistent efforts and pressure on Israel will make it accept the resolutions of international legitimacy.At the regional level  concerning Iran’s nuclear programme  the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing efforts to peacefully resolve this issue in a manner a that will preserve the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran and all countries in the region to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the supervision and monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate fully with international efforts and work on implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions. We also call on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and implement its resolutions to find a definitive solution to this crisis  which had cast it shadow on this region for many years  given rise to doubts and created an atmosphere of instability and tension.This year  the State of Kuwait celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its membership in this enduring Organization. Ever since then  and driven by its belief in the importance of common international action  it has sought to provide highly effective support to many of the agencies  bodies and entities of the United Nations system. This is particularly true in view of the growth and increase in challenges facing the Organization at all levels and putting the international community  represented by the United Nations  to the test  a test of international will and global partnership in facing these challenges.The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) represented a major shift in the ability of the United Nations to mobilize the global will to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development  thus clearly expressing how ambitious the will of the international community really is and the feasibility of this global partnership.However  major new challenges have emerged that are related either to security disruptions resulting from instability and the violations of human rights that accompany them  or to the steady environmental deterioration that threatens our world  together with other serious and urgent challenges. This requires the international community to take up the inevitable task of rethinking our preparations for a comprehensive and ambitious development plan. We must complement the efforts aimed at achieving the MDGs by formulating new goals and incorporating them in the post-2015 development plan. This will enable us to take a quantum leap towards a renewed global partnership that will complete the process under way on the scientific bases of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the principles and outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex) held in Brazil. It should help our peoples  to whom those goals represent the hope of creating an ideal world and a better life  particularly in the least developed countries or those still recovering from wars and conflicts. In this respect  we refer to the importance of the international community paying careful attention to supporting the foundations of development in order to achieve security and stability in Somalia and Afghanistan.While the State of Kuwait is considered a developing country  it has been independent since 1961 and given a great deal of attention to providing financial and material assistance to the developing and least developed countries  through many different mechanisms and initiatives. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development is a central Kuwaiti institution firmly committed to implementing its promises and policies on international cooperation and assistance to needy people by on the ground. Since its establishment  and having outgrown its regional Arab scope  the Fund has expanded its activities and development assistance to Asian  African and Central and Latin American countries.In that regard  the State of Kuwait has provided provisional funding of $500 million to the Republic of Yemen for development projects in the 2012-2014 provisional programme. The contribution seeks to support a peaceful transition of power pursuant to the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its Implementation Mechanism  which are aimed at ending the crisis in Yemen  re-establishing security and stability there  and rehabilitating the development sectors in order to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni people to live in peace and security through the consolidation of democracy and good governance.The State of Kuwait  through its great interest in promoting and intensifying regional and international multilateral activities by reviewing cooperation and coordination measures in many important and political fields  has hosted many regional and international summits  meetings and conferences. All haved focused on a multiplicity of issues  challenges  hopes and aspirations and supported initiatives aimed at creating better conditions for the peoples of the region and the world.In order to expand that approach  built on coordination and a spirit of entrepreneurship  in November the State of Kuwait will host the third Arab-African Summit under the theme “Partners in Development and Investment”. We hope that this initiative will achieve results that deepen the foundations of Arab-African cooperation and open new horizons in the name of stability  development and cooperation between the people and countries of these two regions. The State of Kuwait will also host the thirty-fourth session of the Supreme Council of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf in December  as well as the twenty-fifth Summit of League of Arab States in March 2014.In conclusion  I reiterate the commitment of the State of Kuwait to the international multilateral system and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  as well as its belief in the importance that all States fulfil the obligations to which they have committed in international agreements and conferences. That will help in the search for just and equitable solutions to the global threats and challenges confronting us in order to achieve the lofty objective of maintaining international peace and security."
"94",3944,"LAO",68,2013,"On behalf of the Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  I sincerely congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I would like to assure you of our full support and cooperation in discharging your noble duty. I would also like to commend Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his successful completion of his mandate as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic offers its condolences to the Government and people of Kenya on the loss of life as a result of the terrorist attacks last week in Nairobi  and I join the international community in condemning that inhumane act.The year 2013 marks a new turning point in promoting international cooperation for development and in addressing global poverty. At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Brazil in 2012  world leaders initiated an international consultative process to chart a vision and concrete action for enhancing sustainable development in the post-2015 era. This clearly demonstrates that poverty eradication and sustainable development remain our overriding priorities. In recent decades  despite the tremendous efforts of the international community to achieve poverty eradication and development targets  1.2 billion poor people — 22 per cent of the world population — still live in poverty. In addition  the environment continues to be threatened and damaged  which has led to climate imbalance and the frequent recurrence of natural disasters that were rarely seen in the past. Moreover  political and social unrest and armed conflicts continue to rage in different parts of the world with no sign of imminent resolution. Likewise  the global and regional economic and financial crisis has intensified  with long-term effects on developing countries  especially least developed countries.These situations in the development  political  socioeconomic and environmental spheres continue to obstruct and impede all nations from attaining the sustainable development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Against that backdrop  it is more crucial now than ever before for the international community to redouble its efforts to strengthen development cooperation based on sincere and mutual assistance for the benefit of all and for a secure world. As the world today becomes increasingly interdependent  no single country can thrive and survive without the engagement and cooperation of the international community. In that context  global institutions such as the United Nations have an important duty to advocate on behalf of international development cooperation. I commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in promoting international cooperation  including between the United Nations and regional organizations throughout the world  in a complex and challenging global environment.A nation’s political stability and security are vital factors for enabling an environment and conditions conducive to advancing sustainable development. However  many regions of the world are experiencing social unrest  political strife and military confrontation  which pose a major threat to global and regional peace and security. In that regard  we share the common concern over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East  which has lasted for years now. We call on all parties concerned to work together and to find a peaceful solution in order to save the lives of innocent people. In that spirit  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes the agreement reached by Russia and the United States on Syria’s chemical weapons. The international community must devote urgent attention to the issue of Palestine on the basis of the principle of creating the two independent States of Palestine and Israel living side by side in peace. In that regard  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic commends the efforts of Israel and Palestine to resume peace negotiations  which mark an important milestone for the promotion of peace in that region. The unilateral embargo on the Republic of Cuba  an independent State  is unjust and contrary to international law  and has a severe negative impact on the lives of the peace-loving Cuban people. Therefore  it is now time to put an end to the embargo.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic has always attached great importance to creating a peaceful environment and to safeguarding political stability in the interest of national development  with a view to graduating from least-developed-country status. To that end  the Lao Government has made the utmost effort to pursue a consistent foreign policy and to promote international cooperation at all levels. We continue to fulfil our international obligations to maintain peace and to promote the rule of law attentively. In this regard  the Lao Government has mapped out a policy for governing the State by the rule of law and the promotion and protection of the fundamental rights of people of all backgrounds. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is party to many international human rights instruments. We have enacted and amended a national law on human rights  including the rights of women and children.To continue fulfilling its international obligations  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has presented its candidatures for membership of the Human Rights Council  for the term of 2016-2018  and of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/United Nations Office for Project Services for 2016-2018. We hope that the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will be given an opportunity to work with the international community within the aforementioned frameworks.At the regional level  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has played an active part in the process of community-building of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which consists of three pillars: the political-security community  the economic community and the sociocultural community. We believe that the political and economic strength of the ASEAN community will form a solid ground for regional cooperation  thereby contributing to the maintenance and promotion of peace  security and development in the region and the world at large.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic played an important role as Chair of the framework of cooperation between the continents of Asia and Europe — the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) — from 2010 to 2012  and was greatly honoured to host the ninth ASEM Summit on 5 and 6 November in Vientiane  under the theme “Friends for peace  partners for prosperity”  which was successfully concluded. At the Summit  leaders from the two continents had a constructive exchange of views on the ways and means to promote peace and enhance development cooperation in their respective regions for the benefits of the peoples of Asia and Europe  as well as to ensure their legitimate rights to live in peace and to improve their well-being. The Lao Government was proud to have been given the opportunity to fulfil that important obligation  and I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all friendly countries and the international community for their support and assistance to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  which led to the successful outcome of the Summit.Despite various achievements in its socioeconomic development  as both a least developed and a landlocked country the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains vulnerable and continues to face numerous challenges in its development and poverty-reduction efforts  as clearly reflected in the recent third national MDG progress report  issued early this month. If it is to achieve all the MDGs  the country must continue to overcome daunting challenges  such as child malnutrition  gender inequality in education and the impact of unexploded ordnance contamination. Nevertheless  the Lao Government will continue to lead its people in moving ahead together with the international community in tackling numerous challenges in order to achieve the MDGs.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is among those countries most affected by cluster munitions and unexploded ordnance  which continue to pose major constraints to national socioeconomic development and poverty reduction. In that regard  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic calls on all countries to consider acceding to the Convention on Cluster Munitions with a view to ensuring a total ban on those weapons and to helping to address the impact of cluster munitions.In 2014  the group of landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) will hold a 10-year Review Conference on the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action to address the particular problems and special needs of the LLDCs. Adressing the specific problems of LLDCs has become a regional and international obligation. Regardless of their development level  these countries will not be able to address the impacts of their landlocked condition without international cooperation  especially from transit countries and development partners.In that context  the 2014 Review Conference will be of great importance not only for the LLDCs  but also for all development partners. The Conference will provide an excellent opportunity for the international community to identify the emerging challenges and engage in new cooperation aimed at addressing the impact of the landlocked status faced by the LLDCs. We have high hopes and expectations for the outcome of the Conference  which could adopt a new policy direction and more concrete measures reflecting the current development environment. This could form the basis for addressing the specific problems faced by the LLDCs in the next decade. The success of the Conference would certainly demonstrate the spirit of genuine partnership and mutual assistance among members of the international community. Therefore  in my capacity as chair of the group of LLDCs  I call on all parties  international organizations — including the United Nations system — international financial institutions  the private sector and non-governmental organizations to participate actively in the preparation and organization of the Conference in view of ensuring its successful outcome."
"95",3987,"LBN",68,2013," I would first like to warmly congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session  and to express my full appreciation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has closely followed developments in the situation in Lebanon. I particularly wish to point out the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 10 July (S/PRST/2013/9)  which provides an effective road map for what the international community can do to help Lebanon in order to preserve its stability  promote its institutions  support its economy and army and to help it face the growing burden created by the refugees entering from Syria. That is definitely the core objective of the meeting of the International Support Group for Lebanon  which will be launched tomorrow afternoon  25 September.Many countries represented here have witnessed uprisings  civil wars or foreign aggression. Lebanon  too  has experienced many wars  which have led to influxes of numerous refugees in our territory. Against all odds  the Lebanese have sought to assume the responsibility for restoring the glory of our country as a space for freedom and coexistence and to hallow their presence in the East within the confines of a State that embraced democracy from its very inception while ensuring respect for diversity within unity as well as personal and public freedoms. Through dialogue  the Lebanese will continue to develop their political system and improve their democratic practices. They will have to remain committed to the Baabda Declaration  which advocates Lebanon distancing itself from regional crises and axis politics. It is equally essential to reach an agreement on a national strategy to ensure the exclusive defence of Lebanon in the face of Israel’s hostility and ongoing threats. Nevertheless  however strong the Lebanese commitment may be  we still require the care and support of brotherly and friendly countries in order to address the repercussions of external conflicts and crises that threaten our security and stability and have negative impacts on our socioeconomic situation. The Lebanese look to assistance not only in the name of brotherly solidarity and the shared responsibility of the international community as a whole  but also in the face of events that pose a threat to regional and international security. The first challenge is rooted in the repercussions of the Syrian crisis on Lebanon’s security and economy. An existential challenge has arisen  related to the growing number of Syrian refugees on Lebanese territory  which is far beyond Lebanon’s capacity to assimilate them. The number of refugees has already exceeded one quarter of the Lebanese population. As the Assembly knows  Lebanon is a country of limited geographical area and resources  as well as sensitive balances. Therefore  while we understand that it is not possible to impose the impossible on nations  it is important for me to reiterate my call on the States Members of the United Nations to provide sufficient human and financial resources to manage the presence of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and meet their humanitarian and essential needs  bearing in mind that the pledges undertaken at the meeting of donor States hosted by the State of Kuwait on 30 January have only been partially fulfilled; to expand infrastructure and reception areas for Syrian refugees within Syrian territories themselves and organize an international conference on the issue of Syrian refugees  with the aim of sharing the burden among different countries in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility while also assisting the International Support Group for Lebanon; and to garner support from all concerned States for the work of the International Support Group. Of course  all of that must take place while we work towards finding a political solution for the Syrian crisis that will preserve the unity of Syria. Lebanon has called attention to the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of the crimes that have been committed. Solutions must be found to ensure that the conflict does not spread to neighbouring countries. Today  we have an opportunity to condemn all terrorist attacks perpetrated anywhere in the world  particularly in the Middle East. I would like to comment on the attack that took place upon the historic town of Maaloula. That attack represents an assault on civilization and the tolerant spirit of religions. That is why the international community must adopt a firm stance in order to protect such sites  in particular through the adoption of an investigative mechanism that will assess the reality of the situation on the ground. We must work to encourage the countries of the region currently engaged in conflict to ensure that the logic of dialogue and negotiation prevails and to keep Lebanon from getting involved in the Syrian conflict  while encouraging those countries to contribute the necessary assistance and support for the Baabda Declaration  just as the Security Council has pledged its support. However  the main challenge that we face remains the Arab-Israeli conflict and Israeli settlement policy practices  not to overlook the difficulties created by it in terms of refugee flows. The settlement policy has fostered a sense of frustration and a tendency towards extremism. Lebanon has been affected by the daily Israeli attacks against Lebanon and its infrastructure through the use of all sorts of prohibited weapons. Lebanon has paid a high price for those acts of aggression  with all that implies in terms of the burden on human lives and destruction. It therefore falls upon the international community to work to find a fair and comprehensive solution to the conflict in the Middle East  particularly with respect to the Palestinian cause  pursuant to the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference and the Arab Peace Initiative. Stability  democracy and moderation will not prevail in the Middle East unless justice is done in Palestine  based on the belief that the security of the Arab region and the preservation of its cultural diversity are of strategic importance. Lebanon calls for the adoption of an integrated comprehensive approach that includes the participation of all States concerned and addresses all aspects of the Israeli-Arab conflict. At the same time  no solution should be taken at the expense of its superior interests. As a result  Lebanon will reject any compromise attempting to force an influx of Palestinian refugees on its territory.In this transitional period where the Arab world is undergoing major historic upheaval and deep-wrought changes  the world as a whole is witnessing an fundamentl structural transformation due to the amazing scientific progress that has been achieved  in particular in the fields of communication and information. That progress will contribute to globalization in all aspects of life. We must therefore convey a spirit of pluralism and diversity within all societies as a necessary condition in order to match the accelerating pace of change. However  the regimes that run the affairs of peoples and societies have unfortunately not undergone a corresponding evolution at the intellectual level. On the contrary  we have witnessed conflicts exacerbated by extremist terrorism continue to spring forth fuelled by isolationism that rejects dialogue  mutual recognition and coexistence. That has even led some to call for the return to religious emirates and racial segregation. In order to do so  those groups have applied violent methods that flout peace and public freedoms. Amid those unilateral fundamentalist tendencies  Lebanon remains a laboratory and a model of necessary coexistence for the future. That model must be allowed to benefit from support and stability because  as it has for decades  it has led to the education of students in our schools and universities and caused the security forces to fulfil their national missions in military camps in a spirit of unity. It is a model that is also experienced by the citizens on a daily basis on the streets of our cities  towns and in our capital  in the theatres  clubs  at the movies  in public and private institutions and in civil society organizations. The model  which has become a lifestyle  is lived with the sound of the church bells and the voices of the mosques’ muezzins ringing in our ears  in particular at joint celebrations  the most significant of which is the Common Religious National Day  celebrated on the day of the Annunciation on 25 March of every year  when everyone is urged to seek the common good. The management of diversity and the building of a culture of justice  peace and coexistence between cultures  civilizations and religions requires that we all make efforts at the following three levels.First  we must work to improve the political  financial and social systems that govern the affairs of peoples worldwide  in particular the democratic system  to make them more humane and better suited to diversity. This must be done in such a way so as to guarantee the involvement of all components of society  in particular minorities  in political life and in the management of public affairs in all States  regardless of what ratio of the population such minorities may represent  but  rather  on the basis of their capacity and heritage.Secondly  we must consider the preservation of an active presence on the part of minorities worldwide  with all the civilizations and specific characteristics that they represent  to be an international responsibility  especially in the Middle East. The Middle East is the cradle of the monotheistic religions  whose peoples have coexisted for centuries  forged civilizations and enriched the history of humankind through their culture and the values of tolerance  goodwill and friendship. That shared responsibility cannot be based on international interests in that part of the world while ignoring the communities living there. Rather  it should take into account the interests of all of those minorities and their right to participate in all aspects of the life of their nation  as they are an integral part of its fabric.Thirdly  there is a need to intensify ongoing efforts aimed at reforming and developing the United Nations and its specialized agencies  so as to bring them into line with current realities and restore confidence in their capacity to resolve international issues  counter crime and adopt the appropriate resolutions and implement them without obstruction  free from selectivity and the policy of double standards. That would be an alternative to the logic of legitimate force that may be used by peoples whose countries have fallen victim to aggression and occupation  in the absence of a capable  guaranteed international mechanism.For its part  Lebanon will remain faithful to the message of freedom and coexistence that are its hallmark  reiterating its commitment to implementing all decisions of international legitimacy and to upholding the spirit of moderation and agreement upon which Lebanon was founded. It will also remain an active partner in the context of the promotion of a culture of justice  peace and sustainable human development."
"96",4033,"LBR",68,2013,"I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on behalf of the Government and people of Liberia and to extend my warmest congratulations to the President and to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda on the occasion of his election as President of the Assembly at this session. I trust that he will bring his wealth of experience to bear on the work of the current session. In a similar vein  I congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of the Republic of Serbia  for his leadership of the Assembly at the sixty-seventh session and for the initiatives he undertook during his tenure.Let me also extend my special appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiring leadership and his visionary initiatives that have mobilized the international community around many noble objectives. Those initiatives have engendered hope among the people around the world  especially the poor and marginalized.We are deeply concerned about the growing number of acts of senseless violence around the world  as exemplified by the ghastly and cowardly murder of innocent persons in a terrorist attack on a shopping mall in Kenya. We commiserate with the families of all victims and with the Government and sisterly people of Kenya on such a terrible loss.Because we know first-hand the profound destruction and long-lasting hurt inherent in civil conflict  we also agonize with the people of Syria  particularly those innocent women and children who suffer most from such tragedy. We unequivocally condemn the use of chemical weapons in Syria and anywhere else in the world  and we call for concerted and renewed international effort to stem the rising scourge of terrorism and other transnational crimes through action to control and eliminate weapons of mass destruction.We welcome the communications revolution that has provided a broad cyber platform for the exchange of information. However  that should not provide a vehicle for the promotion of terrorism and the spread of unfounded and irresponsible information through unregulated cyber weaponry that threatens the security of nations  particularly fragile States  and open societies of freedom and democracy.Colleague after colleague who will address the Assembly will no doubt express pride at the tremendous progress in Africa. Our continental growth has averaged over 5 percent annually  surpassing that of other regions. Moreover  our economies are diversifying  our trade infrastructure is expanding  our democracies are strong and maturing  and our regional institutions strengthening and leading the processes of cooperation and integration. But the new Africa story is not just about growth. We see improvement in school enrolment  health indicators  in trade and investment. The share of people living in poverty is declining. Democracy  while still needing room for improvement  has become the norm rather than the exception  and governance has improved significantly over the past decade.We are equally pleased with the progress made in resolving conflicts in several of our countries  as we welcome the international support that has set Somalia on a trajectory of peace and development.We appreciate the strong collaboration among regional economic communities  the African Union and the United Nations  joined by the international community  that responded robustly in the Malian crisis  thereby averting the threat posed to the peace and security of the entire region. The recent inauguration of a new  democratically elected President in Mali is a clear indication that such cooperation is the surest path to world peace. We congratulate the newly elected President of Mali  Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita  for receiving the overwhelming endorsement of the Malian people  and we commend all stakeholders for respecting the outcome of the democratic process. We also salute the former interim President  Mr. Dioncounda Traoré  and all partners for working to restore constitutional order within the stipulated time period.Although Liberia still faces the residual challenges of its own conflict  and despite our size and limited military strength  I am pleased to report that a small contingent of Liberian troops is currently participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. We view our role in that peacekeeping effort as a way of reciprocating  albeit in a small way  the countless demonstrations of friendship and goodwill that were accorded to us by Mali and other members of the international community during our dark days of war.Once the epicentre of a regional war  I am pleased to note that the neighboring countries of the Mano River Union — Côte D’Ivoire  Guinea  Sierra Leone and Liberia — are at peace and engaged in consolidating the gains of stability to accelerate national transformation through regional integration. A new Mano River Union initiative will facilitate connectivity in our power and transport systems  thereby enhancing cross-border trade  in which our market women are actively engaged.I bring greetings from the Government and people of Liberia  who are this year celebrating 10 consecutive years of peace and progress. In those 10 years  our nation’s pride has been restored and we have returned to the community of nations as a respectable and responsible partner. With the support of the international community  especially the United Nations through its peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts  we have rebuilt a new ethnically balanced professional army and increased the size and enhanced the professionalism of our police  immigration and intelligence forces  in line with our commitment to bear full responsibility for security with in our borders as United Nations peacekeepers execute a phased drawdown.In that regard  we commend the Security Council for its recent adoption of resolution 2116 (2013)  which extends the mandate of the United Nations peacekeeping Mission in Liberia to 30 September 2014. We fully commit to meeting all the expectations of the resolution  including continuing to take concrete steps aimed at developing and sustaining a self-sufficient and competent security sector able to tackle violent crimes  sexual and gender-based violence and the infringement of the rights of the ordinary person. Thanks to our commitment and the resilience of the Liberian people  we have instituted a host of reforms intended to improve governance  enhance accountability and create an enabling environment for the exercise of basic freedoms  including freedom of speech and the press. That has put the country on a path of irreversible progress  which has enabled us to conduct two democratic presidential and general elections and adjust our Vision 2030  while laying a firm foundation for the transformation of our economy towards moving our country to middle-income status by the year 2030.Liberia has come a long way  but we know that we have an even longer way to go. We have done much in restoring basic services and infrastructure  but still have much to do  especially in reducing our huge infrastructure deficits in power and in transport. We have done much in improving governance and strengthening our institutions of integrity  but still have much more to do in consolidating the culture of integrity and accountability in a society that is still beset by values occasioned by years of conflict. We have adopted laws and policies that eschew discrimination of any kind  to ensure social equity and equal opportunity  but still must do more in promoting natural reconciliation and healing. We have done much in achieving an average annual growth of over 7 per cent and attracted huge multi-million-dollar direct foreign investments  especially in our natural resource sector  but still have much more to do in expanding growth and diversifying our economy  making it more resilient to internal and external shocks and more responsive to the ever-increasing demand of our people for jobs and improved livelihoods. We still have much to do in continuing the reforms that will ensure equitable benefits from natural resource capital to current and future generations.All the policies and actions that we have pursued in the past several years have enabled us to stabilize our overall national condition. We must now  over the next few years  take the hard decisions in addressing long-standing structural systems. We know that the transition from stabilization to transformation can be a long and hard road subject to brickbats from vested interests. We are bound to face criticism as we attempt to apply and respect the rule of law and as we challenge entrenched social habits  but we must change old mindsets and attitudes. We remain strong in that resolve  for it is the right thing to do.I was honoured to have been selected by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as one of three co-Chairs of a 27-member High-level Panel of Eminent Persons tasked with making recommendations for a new global development agenda post-2015. The mandate of the Panel was to advise the Secretary-General on a bold and practical development agenda beyond 2015 that builds upon  as well as goes beyond  the Millennium Development Goals in establishing new goals that are ambitious and yet achievable. Last May  the Panel submitted its report to the Secretary-General for his consideration. We are pleased that many of the principles we identified are emphasized in the Secretary General’s report (A/68/202)  rightly titled “A life of dignity for a11”. Today more than at any other time  we have an opportunity to transform our world; to pursue an agenda that will eradicate poverty while at the same time sustaining nature to secure natural resources for future generations. The solutions of yesterday may not apply today’s challenges  so we must muster the courage to take bold steps. I therefore call upon the Assembly to reflect on the emerging challenges we face  to boldly seize new opportunities and to commit ourselves to a new global partnership that promotes economic and social transformations for inclusive and shared prosperity for all.In Africa we are working towards a continental consensus that will convey an African position on the post-2015 development agenda. I am pleased to have been asked by the African Union Summit to chair a high-level committee of 10 Heads of State that will oversee and guide the process. We held our first meeting yesterday here in New York  and agreed upon a road map that will ensure a global development framework that is not only brave and ambitious  but one that reflects African priorities  a global agenda that creates an enabling environment for Africa’s transformation that includes infrastructure development  increased productive capacities  resilience to external shocks and enhanced statistical capacities that will result will accelerate the reation of employment that is directed particularly to our youthful populations.I am pleased to report that on 2 September  I chaired and launched the High-level Panel on Fragile States  under the aegis of the African Development Bank. Of the estimated 7 billion people in the world  1.5 billion live in situations of conflict and fragility. That data puts fragile States at the centre of the new post-2015 agenda. We hold the view that international partners should accommodate the peculiarities and special circumstances of post-conflict nations. The achievement of sustained economic growth and development in those countries is critical to reducing their vulnerability to new political and economic shocks  fuelled in many cases by high expectation gaps that need to be mitigated. We therefore call on all our partners to renew their support to the New Deal for Engagement on Fragile States  which calls for stronger ownership  harmonization  results and mutual accountability.I would like to conclude by expressing our gratitude to the United Nations family for sustaining our agenda of peacebuilding and sustainable development. Since its founding  the United Nations has had its share of challenges  but it remains the beacon of hope for the peoples of the world who thirst for peace; a world that is fair  a world that is prosperous  a world in which the uncommon dreams of all will have a fair chance of realization; a world where the weak can become strong; a world where no nation feels developed and powerful until all nations have their share of global wealth. The leaders of today must rise to those challenges. The future begins today. We must commit to a new global development trajectory that gives all of humankind a world of peace  dignity and prosperity."
"97",4078,"LBY",68,2013,"At the outset  I warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in his endeavours. I also wish to convey my greetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to commend him and his team for the remarkable efforts they continue to exert in the realization of the lofty purposes and principles that have been at the heart of the United Nations since its inception.I have the honour to speak before the Assembly today on behalf of my country  the new Libya  which is forging ahead towards democracy  establishing State institutions  the rule of law  development and prosperity  despite the range of political  economic  social and cultural difficulties and obstacles we face as a result of the burdensome legacy left behind by the dictatorial regime. I wish to assure the international community  and the United Nations in particular  that Libya is working tirelessly  with confidence and determination  to establish State laws and institutions  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the peaceful transfer of power  as well as to forge positive partnerships with development partners that are fully respectful of the interests of all countries  including non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  and to promote peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international laws and norms.The people of Libya will always highly appreciate the important role played by the United Nations in the establishment of Libya  beginning with resolution 289 (IV)  of 21 November 1949  on the independence of Libya  through to the Security Council’s adoption of resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011)  to protect Libyan civilians and support the revolution of 17 February 2011. That positive role continues through the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)  which is making commendable and praiseworthy efforts to provide technical advice and training  raise awareness and build capacity in various sectors in order to advance the democratization process  achieve justice and national reconciliation and rebuild modern State institutions. UNSMIL has been crucial in launching and supporting a national dialogue  which will start in a few days. The Council of Ministers is now considering a draft law on victims of rape and violence during the dictatorial era and the liberation war. In response to the relevant Security Council resolutions  we are cooperating with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in order to expand the scope of investigations into those who committed crimes against the Libyan people  through the implementation of the mechanisms and rulings of the ICC and in line with national legislation. We are looking forward to the cooperation of the countries concerned  in particular neighbouring countries  in surrendering and extraditing the wanted individuals of the former regime.We trust that an understanding will be reached with the United Nations  and the Security Council in particular  with regard to security and the need to impose control over our vast land and sea borders and to lift the ban on arms completely. Libya faces a broad range of problems caused by illegal migration. This requires efforts to be coordinated at the international and regional levels in order to find an urgent solution and curb the phenomenon of illegal migration  ensure respect for the sovereignty of States  promote and ensure the rights and dignity of the illegal migrants themselves and enhance cooperation with international organizations.I would be remiss if I failed to express my sincere gratitude to the International Organization for Migration for its cooperation with the relevant international institutions. I also wish to thank the European Union for its assistance to Libya in curbing the problem of illegal migration through its assistance to Libyan institutions in securing the vast borders.Libya faces a number of security threats  including the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  illegal migration and arms smuggling. That is why we hosted a regional ministerial conference on border security in March 2012  which included the adoption of the Tripoli action plan for border cooperation and the establishment of mechanisms and structures for cooperation and the sharing of information and experience in the field of border protection and control.In addition  last spring  the Libyan city of Ghadames hosted a meeting of the Heads of Government of Libya  Algeria and Tunisia to strengthen joint security operations in addressing the challenges posed by developments in the Sahel and Sahara regions.We also contributed to the ministerial conference on support to Libya in the areas of security  justice and the rule of law  which was held in Paris in February at the initiative of the Libyan interim Government and with the support of the French and British Governments. Two action plans were adopted at that meeting on the development of the Libyan security and justice sectors.The interim Government is sparing no efforts in reactivating the role of the Arab Maghreb group to promote political  development and security cooperation and to promote the interests of all countries in North Africa and the Arab Maghreb. Libya is taking all the necessary steps to get back on the path to development and to complete national projects in all sectors  which requires substantial funds. It is crucial that we recover the looted funds that were smuggled out of Libya. From this rostrum  I reiterate the call that we made to all States to cooperate with and help us locate and recover those funds.We also emphasize our request to the countries in which there are Libyan investments to ensure the right of the Libyan State to those investments and to prevent any compromise thereof  especially in some countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America  where coercive measures have caused significant damage to those investments.My country attaches great importance to human rights issues and to the process of safeguarding and promoting those rights. Preventing any violations in this area is therefore a priority for Libya’s interim Government. That is why our Government  in coordination with the General National Congress  has taken a number of steps to that end. They include amending or repealing legislation that is inconsistent with the international obligations of the Libyan State in the field of human rights  as well as setting in motion a process of constitutional review of legislation that runs counter to the provisions of the Constitutional Declaration. We are also taking steps to ratify or accede to certain international human rights conventions  including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Preparations are under way to accede to other international agreements  such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. A further step includes developing a practical mechanism for the implementation Human Rights Council decision 19/39  in order to provide technical assistance and capacity-building to Libya through direct cooperation between the Libyan Government and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  with the assistance of UNSMIL. We are also establishing a ministerial committee to follow up on the situation of human rights in Libya  headed by the Minister of Justice and including the deputy ministers of the interior  defence and culture  as well as representatives of civil society. We are making every effort to prepare for the visit to Libya by High Commissioner Navi Pillay before the end of this year. We hope that the visit will reinforce the relationship between Libya and the Office of the High Commissioner  in the mutual interests of both.Libya contributes very seriously to the international efforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and safeguard international peace and security  and we cooperate fully with international institutions and organizations in this field. We reiterate the call to conclude an unconditional and legally binding instrument to protect non-nuclear States from the threat or use of nuclear weapons  pursuant to the relevant General Assembly resolutions and in line with the 1996 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons (A/51/218  annex).I also reaffirm Libya’s full support for international efforts aimed at establishing additional zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in various regions of the world. To contribute to the achievement of that goal  Libya is working  in coordination with its brothers in the League of Arab States  to convene a successful conference on making the Middle East such a zone — a conference that  unfortunately  has been postponed. We call upon the Secretary-General and other organizing parties to make every effort  as stipulated in the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and the outcome document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to convene the conference before the end of 2013. We call upon all States concerned to participate in in the conference in order to ensure its success.Libya shares the concerns of the international community concerning the scourge of terrorism  which is not exclusive to any particular religion  nationality or culture. We have acceded to most international instruments on combating terrorism and are cooperating with other countries in order to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism  in accordance with resolution 66/105.The Palestinian people have now been living in truly tragic humanitarian conditions for more than six decades  starting with their expulsion from their homes and continuing with the annexation of most of their territory  the confiscation and levelling of their land and the demolition of their homes — all in flagrant violation of international humanitarian laws and norms. The time has now come for the international community to assume its responsibilities to put an end to this tragedy as soon as possible by taking urgent and decisive action to ensure the full protection of the Palestinian people and to put an end to their daily suffering and the injustice done to them. That should be done through a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue that ends the occupation and enables the Palestinian people to regain their territory and establish their own independent Palestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  and makes it possible for all Palestinian refugees to return to their homes  in accordance with the relevant international resolutions.The tragic developments taking place in Syria make it incumbent upon the international community to put an end to that human tragedy and stop the bloodshed and destruction. We therefore call upon the Security Council to act in accordance with the concept of the responsibility to protect in order to find a solution to the problem  through consensus among its members  so as to save the Syrian people from the daily massacres and help them to achieve their legitimate demands.Libya once again calls upon the international community and human rights institutions to put an end to the human tragedy being experienced by the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar and to accelerate the setting up of an international investigation committee to bring those responsible for the tragedy before international justice  ensure the return of the displaced to their homes and provide compensation to the victims.A revolution took place in Libya to put an end to despotism and dictatorship  a revolution that was the result of deep and long suffering. I assure the Assembly that  with the will of the people who brought about that revolution  our Government will build State institutions  uphold the rule of law  protect its borders  fulfil its promises  honour its obligations towards neighbouring countries and work for the promotion of peace and security. The revolution will achieve peace and security. I wish the Assembly every success at this session."
"98",4111,"LCA",68,2013,"I address the General Assembly today with a sense of deep humility — humility in the wake of the great architects of world peace who have stood here before me — and pride. In that regard  I will utilize my maiden address to this body to pay homage to those who fostered the birth and initial dynamics of the United Nations. I therefore find it more than appropriate to utilize the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations as a ready compass with which to set my course as I navigate the issues that occupy the forefront of our attention.Before indicating my own country’s perspectives on present trends  let me take the opportunity to congratulate you  Sir  a representative of a Member State from my own Caribbean region  on your election to serve as President of the General Assembly. It is a clear acknowledgement by members of the General Assembly that all States  large or small  have a deep and broad interest in how international relations are evolving and a legitimate contribution to make towards resolving the problems that are having a negative impact on us.At this juncture  permit me to commence my navigation. The first principle of the Charter reads as follows:“To maintain international peace and security  and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace  and to bring about by peaceful means  and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace”.Our world vibrates with dynamic political changes  some welcome  and some threatening to the interests of small States and therefore unwelcome. Like other Member States  we prefer the peaceful resolution of disputes  and therefore welcome the developments in the Middle East  specifically in relation to Syria  where the option of a peaceful and negotiated resolution has taken precedence over the option of war. It is important that in such matters we not get caught up in the emotions of the moment. We must be cerebral in our approach  because emotion is no substitute for intelligence  nor rigidity for prudence. We do not underestimate the difficulties inherent in the resolution of issues and disputes between nations in the Middle East. But we stand for the right to self-determination as a basic principle of any people’s existence  and hope that in other parts of the region the long-standing claims to entitlement on the part of the people of Palestine will continue to be pursued  primarily through persistent negotiation as against any inclination to the threat of violence and war. We are fortunate to have the United Nations as a framework within which we can always proceed to negotiate with patience and persistence until agreement and/or compromise is reached.The second principle of the Charter of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples  and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace. Saint Lucia  as a small State in a hemisphere of both small and large States  emphasizes the use of diplomacy as a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized relations. We note the increasing mutual involvement of the peoples on both sides of the China Strait and express the hope that that will lead to normal relations beneficial to all the peoples of the world. In that regard  we welcome the response of the membership of the International Civil Aviation Organization to embrace the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in aspects of its proceedings. That can be an appropriate model for the further engagement of Taiwan in the activities of international organizations  thus permitting that country to play its role more effectively in global development.In the same context  the Government of Saint Lucia reiterates its support for the inclusion of Cuba in all regional and hemispheric organizations that it wishes to join. We support the removal of what can clearly be seen as forced exclusions  which are surely no longer permissible under the new rules and regimes of balanced diplomacy. As is evident  the exclusion of Cuba from normal and complete intercourse remains an open wound in the heart of our hemisphere. It is unnecessary and needs to be ended. Saint Lucia therefore emphasizes its support for persistent international efforts towards the removal of the unconscionable embargo that inhibits Cuba’s legitimate efforts at economic growth and full hemispheric cooperation.The third principle of the Charter is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character  and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for everyone without distinction to race  sex  language or religion. That is in consonance with the theme chosen for this year’s general debate  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. Over a decade ago  when the world was entering the twenty-first century  the United Nations took the lead in setting the international development agenda. At that time  we made a loud and clear declaration of war against extreme poverty and hunger  illiteracy  gender inequality  child mortality  poor maternal health care  HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  environmental degradation  as well as against the forces that seek to fragment our global partnership for development.Our declaration was appropriately entitled the Millennium Declaration  and the goals contained therein were time-bound and target-driven. Today  less than two years before the 2015 deadline arrives  we find ourselves facing new  and increasingly critical  development challenges. Youth unemployment has reached crisis proportions globally  and high debt levels have threatened the solvency and stability of small States. Climate change and the increasing ferocity of natural and man-made disasters are threatening the environmental sustainability  and even the very existence  of small island developing States (SIDS).Global interdependence demands that the strong help the weak  so that everyone can get strong. Therefore  the setting of the post-2015 development agenda is a watershed moment in global history  and all countries must participate meaningfully in the process. The rich must resist the temptation to retreat inward  as that can idle the global economic engine. The post-2015 development agenda must be driven by common aspirations  shared goals and a unified vision of a secure and stable world that we can proudly bequeath to our children.Saint Lucia and several other States have already embarked upon and completed post-2015 consultations  with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). At least 20 such national consultations have been conducted across the world  and they have provided invaluable inputs for the post-2015 agenda. They emphasize that Saint Lucia and other SIDS have serious vulnerabilities that seem to have escaped the gross domestic product-focused eyes of some of our development partners. The post-2015 agenda must therefore address  in a very real sense  the issues of concern to SIDS  such as the rise in sea level  non-communicable diseases  and the assessment of loss and damage caused by natural and man-made disasters and the funding needed for recovery. We are also concerned about the causes of climate change  particularly our over-dependence on fossil fuels  and its destructive impact on the debt profiles of our small and vulnerable economies.In that regard  we want to arrest the adverse consequences of climate change before they cripple us  and we want to accelerate the transition to renewable energy using clean  green technology. In May 2012  our region hosted the Conference on Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in Small Island Developing States in Barbados and  together with UNDP and other international partners  we resolved to set targets for increasing the renewable component of our energy mix. Moreover  a month ago in Barbados  at the third interregional preparatory meeting for the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in Apia  Samoa  in 2014  SIDS reaffirmed their commitment and renewed calls for the world to pay attention to their special vulnerabilities.That is in keeping with the fourth principle of the Charter of the United Nations  which asserts that the Organization is to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the common ends mentioned earlier. In that regard  we recognize a number of United Nations initiatives.First  we note that the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals requested the Secretary-General to initiate thinking on a post-2015 development agenda and to include recommendations in his annual report on efforts to accelerate progress on achieving the MDGs.Secondly  we recognize that the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development has initiated an inclusive intergovernmental process for preparing a set of sustainable development goals.Thirdly  we note that the work of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  on which Saint Lucia is represented  has proceeded in a positive fashion. That work includes initiatives of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region aimed at applying policies to address the effects of the global recession and of new trends and rules that negate our effective participation in international trade. Such initiatives are promoted by our regional institutions  such as the Caribbean Development Bank  whose President recently highlighted the need for new urgency in implementing policies to help the Bank’s member States to emerge from the effects of the global recession.Fourthly  we take special cognizance of the special event just held and convened by you  Mr. President  to follow up on efforts to achieve the MDGs. We concur with the recommendations that propose a framework for countries like mine to come up with an evolving response to the new international environment that recognizes how urgent it is that developed countries fulfil their official development aid commitments  and how critical the MDGs are for meeting the basic needs of people in developing countries.It is vital that all such initiatives on the part of the global community include arrangements such as an adaptation fund that can enhance the ability of small island developing States to begin constructing facilities that can protect our countries from sea-level rise and natural disasters. Do we lie supine on our backs and hug the elusive phantom of hope? No. Given the turbulent and unpredictable world situation that we small States face  we have been compelled to reassess  restructure and reformulate domestic and foreign policy postures to enable us to realistically readjust our economic and political strategies and reshape our external relations along more contemporary and multidimensional lines. In that regard  Saint Lucia has been making a special effort in the area of regional and international outreach. Within our hemisphere  we have witnessed the establishment and active engagement of both the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and Saint Lucia  like other Caribbean Community States  has actively engaged with them where eligible.It is in that spirit that we have also joined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  so as to broaden our activities in the hemisphere and ensure that we take full advantage of efforts to advance our country’s economic growth  reduce the economic inequalities that result from our small size and ensure our full participation in the regional and global decision-making that inevitably affects us.As I speak of a better balance of global relations and the evolution of emergent political principles and practices  Saint Lucia joins with other CARICOM colleagues in drawing attention to a decision of the CARICOM Heads of State  taken at their thirty-fourth regular meeting  in Port of Spain  Trinidad and Tobago  in July. That decision mandates our Governments to collectively seek reparations  on behalf of our citizens and countries  for the period of exploitation experienced during the transatlantic slave trade. Our Governments have therefore initially agreed to the establishment of a Caribbean reparations commission that will prepare the relevant documentation and strategies for pursuing the practical achievement of that goal  with a central focus of righting the wrongs of the past and elevating the status of our people. In that regard  we will continue to conduct a process of diplomatic outreach  not only within our own hemisphere and the States of the African continent  the geographic location of our ancestors  but also within the wider United Nations family.I would like to reiterate the importance for small States like Saint Lucia of deliberate and sustained efforts to resolve disputes peacefully. We support strengthening the institutional arrangements of the United Nations in order to help it better fulfil its mandate. As the Assembly is aware  CARICOM has been actively engaged in developments relating to reform of the Security Council. It is an issue that Saint Lucia’s Permanent Representative has been directly involved in  particularly the question of expanding both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council and thereby giving that body’s decision-making greater legitimacy. We look forward to further progress on the matter.For my part  I can only echo the words of the great Russian writer Nikolai Ostrovsky  who said “Man’s dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once  and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years  never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; so live that  dying  he might say: all my life and all my strength were given to the finest cause in all the world — the fight for the liberation of mankind”.It is to that aim that my country and I devote every moment of our time.As I conclude  Mr. President  I thank you and extend to you Saint Lucia’s best wishes and support for your successful tenure of office as you pursue the tasks of the coming year  some visible and some undoubtedly not yet foreseen. Saint Lucia’s hope is that as we navigate uncharted waters  we continually refer to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  to which I have referred  in order to ensure that our great Organization remains on course  as together  with mutual purpose and mutual aid  we make a new period in history."
"99",4138,"LIE",68,2013,"At the outset  let me convey the sincere condolences of the people and the Government of Liechtenstein to all those affected by the abhorrent terrorist attack in Kenya. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.For the second year in a row  the Assembly is meeting under the shadow of the crisis in Syria. It is the challenge of our time. No other situation in the recent past has so dramatically tested the United Nations ability to respond. And none has so starkly illustrated the limitations and the weaknesses of our multilateral system. Thousands of people have been killed in a brutal war  many of them women and children  and many of them victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Regional stability has been eroded. Millions of people are depending on humanitarian assistance  which is often impossible to deliver. Humanitarian access to those most in need  including the sick and the wounded  is being systematically denied owing to cynical political calculations. The humanitarian agencies have become a pawn in that perverted game.Sadly  it took a particularly outrageous act to generate action in the Security Council: the use of chemical weapons  with hundreds of victims  including countless children. We are encouraged to see that the Council has decided to ensure the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria. That should also provide new momentum to ensure that all remaining States join the Chemical Weapons Convention. Indeed  it should be a step towards the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction worldwide.The use of chemical weapons in Syria has marked a watershed in the conflict. Nevertheless  that issue must not divert our attention away from the core problem: the fighting in Syria continues unabated  with blatant disregard for the civilian population and international humanitarian law. Weapons and ammunition cross the borders more easily than humanitarian assistance.The recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical weapons shows that political progress is possible. Hopefully  that will create the momentum for the Council to finally live up to its responsibility: to end the supply of weapons  pressure the parties to the conflict to accept a ceasefire  work towards a political solution and prepare the ground for accountability for past crimes. There may be different views on who used chemical weapons in Syria  but everyone agrees that that use constitutes a crime against humanity and a war crime that must not go unpunished. It must therefore be put before a court of law  together with the countless other crimes committed  for an independent and impartial investigation.Syria is our biggest collective failure with regard to accountability in recent history. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been operational for more than a decade now. During that time  we have not witnessed any other situation in which crimes have been committed so systematically  on such a scale and for such a long time without any adequate response from the international community.It is well documented that crimes have been and continue to be committed by all sides. That is precisely the type of crisis for which we established the ICC  and it is precisely the type of situation that led us to give the Security Council the competence to refer situations to the Court. In its recent resolution 2118 (2013)  the Council made a limited statement on accountability. More determined and more concrete action must follow. A referral to the ICC will ultimately also contribute to a viable political future for the country  create accountability for those crimes  provide redress for the victims and establish the truth.The establishment of the International Criminal Court has been the most significant development in international law for decades. Only the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year has come even close in terms of significance. With 122 States parties  the Court has attracted a strong following. But the emergence of an effective international judicial mechanism also poses challenges. We have mandated the Court to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes under international law. And we have asked it to focus on those perpetrators who bear the greatest responsibility. Therefore  it cannot be surprising to anyone that the Court is dealing with individuals in leadership positions. We are satisfied that the Court follows the evidence  and that it does not shy away from investigating and prosecuting those in powerful positions. It is therefore implementing its mandate and not politicizing the work it does.Recent events in Syria have reminded us of the importance of the amendments to the Rome Statute adopted in Kampala in 2010. We added provisions that criminalize the use of poisonous and other gases  whether they are used in international or in internal armed conflict. It is troubling that those provisions have become relevant so quickly. But the biggest steps forward are amendments to crimes of aggression. They complement the prohibition of the illegal use of force enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The most serious forms of the illegal use of force by one State against another will become a punishable offence before the ICC. The Court will thereby help enforce the core principle of the rule of law at the international level. With ratifications by Andorra  Cyprus  Slovenia and Uruguay earlier this week  we have come a significant step closer to our common goal  namely  the activation of the Court’s policy over crimes of aggression in 2017. Liechtenstein was the first country to ratify the amendments  and we will continue to assist in the ratification process.Liechtenstein firmly believes in the responsibility to protect populations from crimes of atrocity. Clearly  we have much work left to do in order to put that norm into practice. Our inability to respond to the crisis in Syria demonstrates a crucial weakness in the system: the use of the veto  or its threat  in a manner incompatible with the purposes of the United Nations. That can make the Security Council irrelevant when it is most urgently needed. During this general debate  the President of France suggested a common code of conduct for Permanent Members of the Security Council (see A/68/PV.5). We strongly agree with that proposal. All five permanent members should be able to give the world one public commitment  that is  that they will not use their veto to block action aimed at ending or preventing crimes of atrocity. That would be crucial to enhancing the Council’s effectiveness and credibility. Unfortunately  we have not yet reached the point where we are able to bring the composition of the Security Council in line with the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. But the Council is also struggling to adjust its working methods to new challenges in order to better include the perspective of non-members in its decisions  which is a crucial ingredient for effective leadership. We will therefore continue our efforts to promote accountability and transparency in the work of the Council.The rule of law and accountability have made steady progress in the work of the United Nations. Nevertheless  that progress remains abstract for countless individuals who are vulnerable to atrocities. Sexual violence in conflict has become a rampant phenomenon  with women and girls at particular risk of becoming victims. The ICC has made the fight against that scourge a priority. Most important  though  we must do our part as States. Liechtenstein fully supports the United Kingdom’s initiative to take greater action to end sexual violence during conflict. The fight against sexual violence must also play a central role in the larger context of the women  peace and security agenda. All of that requires stronger emphasis on the need to empower women. Many of our stated goals  from sustainable development to lasting peace  require the full participation of women. Otherwise  they are simply not attainable. In that regard  I am grateful for the leadership of the Secretary-General. We should all rally behind his call to make the twenty-first century the century for women.The upcoming negotiations on the post-2015 agenda will be a crucial test of our ability to tackle challenges that will define the lives of future generations. We look forward to the leadership of the President of the General Assembly in that process. It is of course too early to offer a final assessment of the Millennium Development Goals. But we know that important unfinished business will be carried over into the sustainable development goals. Those new goals must be much more than just an extension of past efforts. They must aim at eradicating poverty and hunger once and for all  and finally ensure full equality between men and women. They must therefore be firmly rooted in human rights  respect for the rule of law and principles of good governance. The sustainable development goals will ensure sustainability only if they approach development in a holistic way. Most important  once we have agreed on our new goals  we need to become more serious in our commitment to achieving them. Let us therefore develop and apply an effective monitoring mechanism to show the world that we are indeed serious.The post-2015 process will also be decisive in moving the General Assembly back to the centre of multilateral policy-making. Only the “G-193” provides the legitimacy and universality required for decisions of global impact and for setting standards that apply to all. This is our General Assembly. Let us use it."
"100",4185,"LKA",68,2013,"At the outset  I offer my condolences to the families whose loved ones died as a result of the terrorist attack on a shopping mall in Kenya. Having suffered many terrorist attacks over nearly three decades  we Sri Lankans condemn this cowardly act.The United Nations has consistently ensured cooperation among States and provided a universal platform for discussions on a range of issues  contentious or otherwise. It is imperative that we jealously protect and abide by the principle of equal treatment of countries that has been the very basis of this global Organization. Be it on economic or political issues  equality must form the bedrock of all international interactions.Reflecting on the work of the United Nations  we note that matters of a political nature have overridden the most basic issues that affect the underprivileged and marginalized who make up the majority of world society. The commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) brought about a real sense of optimism. The theme for this session is timely  as progress in the MDGs should be evaluated  with their deadline fast approaching.Appreciable progress has been made in the MDGs  although the results are uneven among and within countries. According to World Bank projections  by 2015 sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will be home to approximately 40 per cent of the developing world’s population living in extreme poverty. This diminishes our sense of optimism. It is fitting for the United Nations system to examine the causes of the failure in improving the lot of the deprived.In the context of Sri Lanka  my vision has been to distribute the benefits of growth across all segments of the population and to prevent inequalities  social exclusion and adverse environmental effects. The socioeconomic achievements in my country are the result of people-centric Government policies.Despite the fact that my country has had to contend with one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the world  the 2004 tsunami and the global food  energy and financial crises  Sri Lanka’s attainment of the MDGs is exemplary. The statistics speak for themselves. Sri Lanka was ranked ninety-second out of 187 countries in the 2012 Human Development Index. Absolute poverty in Sri Lanka declined to 6.5 per cent in 2012 from 15.2 per cent over a period of five years  surpassing the MDG mid-term target.The goal of universal primary education will be easily achieved by 2015. The key dividend from this strong educational infrastructure has been a drastic reduction in the unemployment level. Sri Lanka’s accomplishments in health care include an infant mortality rate of 9.4 per 1 000 live births  highlighted by UNICEF as a success story.Sri Lanka’s sense of pride in our early recognition of the crucial role women play in political and socioeconomic development is amply warranted  as we elected the world’s first female Prime Minister  the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Sri Lanka was ranked sixteenth in the Global Gender Gap Report 2010.Sri Lanka has mainstreamed the issue of youth in its post-2015 development agenda and is at the forefront of international efforts advocating the interests of youth. Sri Lanka will be hosting the Commonwealth Youth Forum 2013 in November and the United Nations World Conference on Youth in May 2014. I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to all Member States to join in celebrating youth at the World Conference. I also call upon the United Nations to declare an international skills day as recognition of the way in which skills development for youth paves the way for reduced poverty. An innovative development has been the establishment of a Youth Parliament to sharpen the awareness of democracy and skills among the new generation and prepare them to assume leadership.It is of the utmost importance that Member States individually decide on their own means to achieve the MDGs. The unique sociocultural practices and traditions of countries should be taken into account when designing these processes.The post-2015 development agenda needs to be an intergovernmental process  in line with the outcomes and agreed principles of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Centuries of growth in advanced economies have left little carbon space for the developing world  thus challenging their growth. The thin line on which economic development and protection of the environment must be balanced will remain a great challenge in future development policy-setting. It is therefore critical that developed countries honour their commitments and compensate for their damage to the environment on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities.The eradication of poverty must be the primary goal of the post-2015 development agenda and must promote accelerated economic growth in developing countries. Ensuring sustainable growth with social equity demands a balanced approach to development. High rates of investment  efforts to strengthen the quality of human capital and technology transfers are crucial for sustainable growth.The mechanisms on financing and technology mandated by Rio+20 need to be urgently implemented. The sustainable development financing strategy  in its formulation  must seek to provide for enhanced and predictable financial support to developing countries. Sri Lanka supports the establishment of a technology facilitation mechanism under the United Nations  recommended in the Secretary-General’s report (A/67/348). The mighty advocates of rights-based approaches should also honour their international commitments relating to development financing.Calls for reforms in the current international financial institutions continue to be relevant. Their ad hoc policies have proven to be untenable in the long run. It is imperative for the international monetary and financial institutions to give expression to the solid voice of the developing world. Also  those countries that are economically blessed must shed their practice of leveraging through those institutions. A comprehensive structural reform of the existing imperfect global economic order needs to be fully addressed to reflect current realities.The world is in need of a fair international economic system to revitalize partnerships for development. That includes State and non-State actors and blue chip companies emerging as new partners. Moreover  South-South cooperation is crucial due to the shift in economic power and should be actively promoted to complement North-South cooperation.It is disturbing to observe the growing trend in the international arena of interference by some in the internal matters of developing countries in the guise of ensuring security and guarding human rights. Therefore  we continue to witness agitation the world over  leading to violence and forcing political change accompanied by turmoil. It is time to contemplate whether such movements have led to better stability in those countries or produced different results due to inappropriate external factors. In fact  the positive outcomes envisaged by those responsible have not come to pass  but indeed contributed to making those countries unstable. Do unilateral or group actions not erode the authority of the Security Council?That trend needs to be arrested  as it has now extended into areas where it is detrimental to the well-being of populations. The turmoil results from attempts to impose a type of democracy upon countries with significantly different cultures  values and history. The world needs no policing by a few States  particularly when the United Nations is mandated to ensure international security through multilateral engagement. That engagement  to be complete in our time  must ensure the protection of the human race against the flagrant abuse of modern science in such forms as nuclear and chemical weapons.Deepening uncertainties in the Middle East are disturbing. We await the coexistence of Palestine and Israel on the basis of pre-1967 borders. Sri Lanka looks forward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations.We salute the people of Africa in their efforts to achieve better living conditions and economic prosperity. Sri Lanka continues to demonstrate solidarity with the African people in their pursuit of further socioeconomic growth.Unilateral measures  such as embargoes and economic sanctions imposed on countries  are disturbing. Such initiatives bring suffering not only to those specifically targeted  but to a wide range of humankind without any justification. Yet again  I stand in support of the people of Cuba in overcoming economic hardships and in gaining full access to economic opportunity.Permit me to address briefly the post-conflict developments in my own country. I am proud that Sri Lanka has eradicated separatist terrorism spanning three decades and is in the process of addressing the issues of development and reconciliation. Sri Lanka’s Government  at all times responsive to the priorities reflected in public opinion  is engaged in all measures required for meaningful progress in those fields.A significant event in that regard was the opportunity that the people of Northern province enjoyed at the elections  held three days ago  to elect their representatives in the provincial council. It is a matter of legitimate satisfaction to me that this was made possible after the lapse of almost a quarter of a century. There can be no doubt regarding the crucial importance of that measure in the context of political empowerment and reconciliation. It is clearly the responsibility of the international community to assist with those efforts and to ensure their success for the benefit of all the people of Sri Lanka.In spite of the visible progress made and consistent engagement with United Nations mechanisms  many countries are surprised at the disproportionate emphasis on Sri Lanka and its unequal treatment in the multilateral framework. The basis for that relentless pursuit is also questioned. It is my conviction that the United Nations system should be astute in ensuring the consistency of standards applied so that there is no room for suspicion of manipulation of the United Nations system by interested parties to fulfil their agendas.By nature  human beings have the capacity to achieve the most challenging and noble goals in life through strong commitment and dedication. I am confident that  by our own collective efforts  those results will prove to be beneficial to all humankind. As Buddha  the Enlightened One  said  “Atta hi attano natho” — “You are your own master.” Let those timeless words of wisdom guide the destiny of the world. May the Noble Triple Gem bless us all. "
"101",4227,"LSO",68,2013,"At the very outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Ashe on his well-deserved election to the office of the President of the General Assembly. I assure him of my delegation’s full support and cooperation during his tenure of office. I also wish to commend his predecessor for the exemplary leadership he demonstrated during the previous session. From the humble beginnings of a fledging organization more than six decades ago to a massive expansion in membership today  the United Nations has undoubtedly stood the test of time. Its worth as an indispensable entity in shaping the world of our time is a matter of common cause. Some of the great strides the United Nations has made span the peaceful settlement of disputes  restoring calm in many countries through peacekeeping  raising awareness of human rights and eradicating diseases. Nevertheless  much still needs to be done.Much of the world remains mired in poverty and disease  while peace  security and stability continue to be fragile. Economic development continues to be the greatest challenge in our history. As we ushered in a new millennium 13 years ago  we adopted the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to focus the world’s attention on ending extreme poverty in all its forms. The 2015 deadline for the achievement of the MDGs is fast approaching  yet it is clear that not much progress has been made in many countries in achieving the Goals. Alive to that fact  the United Nations is engaged in various processes in preparation for the post-2015 development era. It is in this context that we welcome the theme for this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. One of the key outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was that we launched a process to develop a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs)  which would build upon the MDGs and converge with the post-2015 development agenda. We note the progress that has been made in that regard and hope that the letter and spirit of the Rio+20 outcome document  “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  will be upheld. It is our hope that we will develop SDGs that are simple to implement  while also paying attention to the reality that no one size fits all.The post-2015 development agenda must be an integral framework that will build upon the successes and failures of the MDGs. We need to reflect on the experiences and lessons learned in implementing the MDGs  the results achieved and opportunities missed. It is time for this body to come together and exercise its collective responsibility to finalize this one shared goal of articulating and shaping a development agenda that is inclusive and people-centred. A new development agenda  premised upon the sovereign equality of all States while recognizing their interdependence and mutually reinforcing roles  should be our goal. To achieve that  a renewed spirit of solidarity  cooperation and mutual accountability must underpin our efforts.It is equally important  in our view  to pay special attention to the perils of climate change for our physical world  as well as its destruction of ecosystems  all of which result in land degradation and contribute to the decline of agricultural productivity. Agriculture is the mainstay of our small economies. In order to address that challenge  agriculture and food security have to be given the necessary prominence in the envisaged development agenda.Similarly  sustainable mountain development should be our ideal. To a country such as Lesotho  with over 60 per cent of its land area covered by mountains  sustainable mountain development is imperative for the people to survive. Mountains are valuable water sources with rich biodiversity. As such  international support for conservation programmes and the protection of mountain ecosystems should be at the forefront of our plans.The state of peace and security in the world is gradually getting worse. The possession of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction remains the principal threat to the survival of humankind. The widespread sectarian strife in the Middle East and elsewhere and xenophobia are some of the great challenges to global peace. Sadly  discord remains among Member States on how to overcome those problems.Of particular concern to my delegation is the situation in Syria  which poses a serious and growing threat to international peace and security. Scores of civilians continue to be the principal victims. Women  children and the elderly are bearing the brunt of the conflict. The use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only abhorrent  but also a crime against humanity. We condemn it in the strongest terms  as it threatens to undermine the norm against the use of chemical weapons universally embraced by the international community. We welcome the partial report of the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors investigating the use of those weapons in Syria  and hope that the culprits will face the might of international law and justice.The crisis in Syria has the potential to engulf the whole Middle East region  with global ramifications. We call on the international community to find a quick and lasting solution to the conflict. Whether in Syria or anywhere else  perpetrators of crimes against humanity must be held legally accountable for their actions.History has revealed that human societies can enjoy peaceful  orderly progress only if the rule of law obtains. The conviction that peace and justice are inextricably intertwined has always underpinned the efforts of the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed  the International Criminal Court (ICC)  created in 1998  is a beacon that speaks to that truism. We must use institutions  such as the ICC and other international legal tribunals  as a reflection of the international community’s increasing rejection of impunity and evidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the rule of law. At the same time  we need to ensure that institutions  such as the ICC  are adequately insulated against politicization. Selective prosecutions must be avoided.A decade has passed since the initiation of the notion of the responsibility to protect. Yet  the operationalization of that concept has not become a reality. The fact that crimes of mass atrocity continue to be committed around the world is a stark reminder that the time for a collective approach to protecting populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity is now. Most mass atrocities often do not occur spontaneously  but rather as part of a planned process. Over the years  we have learned the important lesson that the Organization cannot stand on the sidelines when challenged to take preventive action. In so doing  we should guard against the misuse and abuse of the norm of the responsibility to protect by infringing on the national sovereignty or altering the legal obligation of Member States to refrain from the use of force except in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.From the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel region to the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the African continent is facing a rise in lawlessness and conflicts. As we celebrate the jubilee of the formation of our continental organization  the Organization of African Unity  we are resolved  as leaders of Africa  that Africa must open a new chapter going forward and extricate itself from the conflicts that have so soiled its reputation and compromised its development. We are determined to build a safe  secure and peaceful Africa from here forward.With the presence of extremist groups and terrorist entities in the Middle East and elsewhere  terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to world peace  security and development. The ugly face of that scourge has once again resurfaced in Kenya. We condemn the barbaric killings of innocent people in the Westgate mall in Nairobi  committed by Al-Shabaab. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families that have lost their loved ones. We all know that solutions to these problems cannot be through military means alone. We have to invest more in creating a holistic and integrated approach that targets  among other things  the improvement of economic development  the promotion of the rule of law  the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  and good governance.In the face of the numerous global challenges existing in the world today  promoting more effective global governance should be at the forefront of the international agenda. We  the membership of the United Nations  should strive for an international Organization with improved efficiency and effectiveness. In our efforts to reform the United Nations  emphasis needs to be placed on enhancing  inter alia  its accountability and that of all its organs and bodies and the programmes of Member States  irrespective of their size and influence.It would be remiss of me not to express solidarity with the people of Cuba for having endured sanctions for so many years. We also want to express our unwavering solidarity with the people of Western Sahara  who have languished under the yoke of colonialism for far too long. In the same vein  we express our unwavering support for the people of Palestine. As a small country that was surrounded by apartheid South Africa for almost a century  we understand the pain that others who still languish under that kind of situation feel. Those situations are a challenge that this body can easily remove from our agenda simply by doing what is right. In true brotherly solidarity  we appeal to this body to remove those final vestiges of colonial oppression.In conclusion  I need not emphasize that our peoples do not necessarily look at this Organization as a mirror reflecting a divided and troubled world. Rather  they yearn for progress and solutions to the problems besieging their world. They want ideas  leadership and concrete hope for the future. Our actions and decisions should embody themes of peace and development that look far beyond the immediacy of the moment. The challenges that confront us today must be  more than ever before  addressed with the candour and decision that the present global economic and political situation dictates to us all."
"102",4253,"LTU",68,2013,"There are two years left until the deadline for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is therefore time to review what we have succeeded in achieving and set the guidelines for the work that remains.Development is a global challenge. Every contribution that is made  every experience that we share and every lesson that we have learned is very important for all of us. By sharing we set the stage for learning from each other — and not only from our own mistakes. In today’s world  every country has the right to choose a path that best suits its experience  culture and needs  as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others and guarantees human rights and freedoms. The international community has an obligation to offer support based on the principles of ownership and empowerment so that those choices may be realized.Development cannot be imposed; it must be promoted. But it is not only about development. It is about free choice  democracy and fundamental rights  each of which is key to the success of the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Today we live in the twenty-first century  but there are still those who want to enforce a specific course of development on others  using economic pressure  energy levers or cybertools  by distorted information or threats. It is true that internationally approved sanctions send a message to those who are producing weapons and not jobs  who violate human rights and use national resources to satisfy individual interests and not those of their society as a whole. But the use of economic  energy or information tools to show power or set up zones of influence is unjustifiable  especially for the future.The twenty-first century should be the age of solidarity  equality and sustainable development. It cannot be an age of the flaunting of power  zero-sum games or buffer zones. Those times are over. Any attempt to return to those times impedes the development of the modern world. But  regrettably  power games still exist.I would like to share my country’s and region’s experience with the Assembly. In the past two decades  the Baltic States have been rapidly transformed. Complex and painful economic  political and social reforms have boosted economic growth  social well-being and political stability. After rebuilding our statehood two decades ago and with the help  advice and experience of the international community  our nations have today become donors and have a lot of experience to share with those who are going through transformations similar to the ones we have experienced. Inner resolve and consensus are very important. However  a favourable external climate and international support are also needed  especially for small countries that depend on larger players for their trade  transportation or energy links.In two months’ time  in Vilnius  several Eastern European countries intend to confirm their commitment to completing the painful but much-needed reforms for economic growth  political stability and social harmony. For many years  those countries worked hard to reach national agreement on reforms  their scope and direction. They learned from their mistakes and mobilized resources to build their own futures. They chose to build modern States of the twenty-first century — open  transparent and collaborative  not dominating.It was not easy for those countries to decide which course to take. Their choice would have been made easier if their free will had been respected and their decision supported in good faith  and with encouragement by those who could provide such support. Instead  they are now facing trade restrictions  bans on goods  the manipulation of energy prices  the use of pressure and open disrespect displayed in information forums.The countries of the European Union Eastern Partnership are not the only ones experiencing such problems. Even Lithuania  which holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union and has successfully consolidated its course of development  is under similar pressure. Barriers to travel  unreasonable delays in cargo transportation  the milk wars — those are just a few very recent controversial examples. For nations  the decision is really difficult to make when free choice means being threatened with gas-price increases and blocked trade  instead of receiving support and advice. Under such pressure  it is hard to implement reforms that empower members of society and open up opportunities to engage in the state-building process.The post-2015 development agenda must provide instruments that empower States to seek development  based on free will and their individual needs. There is no place for forced choices  open threats or demonstrations of power. The international community  especially the United Nations  should empower States to realize such self-determination. I urge us all to give the matter our very careful attention."
"103",4297,"LUX",68,2013,"The President of the General Assembly has chosen for this session and this general debate the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He has thus called on the Assembly to be bold and ambitious  to work together towards the same objective  to prove to the world that we will not accept defeat  and to exert our collective responsibility in order to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development.Luxembourg stands ready to do so. We are ready to work towards a renewed global partnership based on a common understanding of our shared humanity  on a new spirit of solidarity  cooperation and mutual accountability  and on coordinated action that embraces security  development  governance  human rights and the rule of law.To live free from fear  conflict and violence is the most fundamental human right  and yet we witness unspeakable violations of human rights and international humanitarian law every single day. The use of missiles  bombs  cluster munitions and chemical weapons  the systematic imposition of sieges  forced displacements  torture  sexual violence  violations and abuses committed against children  more than 2 million refugees  more than 100 000 dead — these are the chilling results of two and a half years of brutal repression and conflict in Syria. The list of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on a daily basis continues to grow. Against such horror  I repeat once again that the situation in Syria must be referred to the International Criminal Court. Allow me to quote High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres: “Syria has become the great tragedy of this century — a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history”. The Syrian people need assistance now  and they have the right to such assistance under the most basic criteria codified in international humanitarian law. The Syrian authorities must urgently meet the demands of humanitarian actors by immediately facilitating their free and unimpeded access to the affected populations. It is urgent to remove bureaucratic obstacles  to ensure the delivery of medical supplies  to institute humanitarian pauses  to open up humanitarian routes and to allow access to populations in need across borders and across conflict lines.As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  Luxembourg is working with Australia to amplify the demands of humanitarian actors to the parties to the conflict in Syria and to secure them in a unified message from the Security Council. I hope that those efforts will come to fruition very soon.While we have been able to make progress in past few days on the issue of chemical weapons  and I hope we will adopt  a few hours from now a Security Council resolution establishing a strong and binding mechanism to ensure the control and destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons as soon as possible. Yet we cannot and must not forget the humanitarian crisis that continues to unfold in Syria and its neighbouring countries  particularly Lebanon and Jordan but also in Iraq and Turkey. For its part  Luxembourg has fulfiled the pledges it made in Kuwait City on 30 January last  and we have just decided to increase our humanitarian aid to the populations affected by the Syrian crisis to €7.6 million.The vigorous appeal made on Tuesday by the Secretary-General should resonate with all of us. Let us break our deafening silence and live up to our collective and individual responsibilities. We all agree that a lasting solution to the conflict in Syria can only be political. Here too  let us live up to our responsibilities; let us seize the momentum created by the agreement on chemical weapons  set a date for the “Geneva II” conference  and encourage the parties to participate therein in order to start down a road  on the basis of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523  annex)  leading to a cessation of hostilities and to a necessary political transition in Syria that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.Tragic as it may be  the situation in Syria must not lead us to forget the plight of the Palestinian people. We must not forget the urgent need to see the creation of a contiguous and viable Palestinian State  living in peace and security  side by side with the State of Israel. I welcome the commitment and resolve of the Secretary of State of the United States  John Kerry  to restart direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. I also praise the political courage and the sense of responsibility shown by the Israeli and Palestinian authorities in accepting to return to the negotiating table. Eight rounds have been held since 14 August. We hope that the negotiations will intensify in October and lead to a result within the agreed time frame of nine months.We all know that this initiative is probably our last opportunity to act. We must not let it slip away. If we do  it could lead to dramatic consequences. The time has come to make difficult decisions  to take the necessary historic measures in line with the long-term interests of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The time has come to implement the two-State solution. This is no time for unilateral acts that fuel the dynamic of mistrust. Building illegal settlements and destroying Palestinian homes and infrastructure in the West Bank  including in East Jerusalem  must stop immediately. The attacks on Gaza must stop. All violence must stop.With its partners in the European Union  Luxembourg stands ready to pursue its active contribution to the ongoing efforts  in close cooperation with key stakeholders  the Quartet and countries in the region. There can be no security in Israel without a viable Palestinian State. There can be no security in the region without peace in all countries of the Middle East.We must shake up the status quo. We must break the cycle of violence. This imperative also applies to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region. We dearly hope that the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region  signed on 24 February in Addis Ababa  represents a turning point for consolidating peace and regional stability. The second meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism  held at the level of the Heads of State and Government on Monday in New York City  led to the adoption of regional benchmarks and indicators on progress  which will facilitate the implementation of the Framework. This is an important first step. It must be followed by concrete action at the political  security and economic levels. The parties must fulfil all their commitments diligently and in good faith  including a commitment neither to tolerate nor to provide assistance or support of any kind to armed groups  in particular the Mouvement du 23 mars  which continues to operate in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. We must tackle the root causes of recurring violence and lay the foundation for reviving the regional economy in order to initiate a virtuous circle that will allow the people of the region to start down the the path towards sustainable development.The commitment of the international community is all the more necessary in a situation that  regrettably  has received far less attention. I am referring to the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the Central African Republic  affecting the entire population of 4.6 million people. Law and order and the rule of law have collapsed. Human rights violations have become commonplace  as have arbitrary arrests and detention  torture  sexual violence against women and children  rape and extrajudicial executions. According to our sources  Séléka militias have also recruited and used at least 3 500 child soldiers. No one can be indifferent to those figures. The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The prevailing insecurity has further reduced access to the affected populations. We must act immediately.Restoring security and law and order must be our first priority. We strongly welcome the decision of the African Union Peace and Security Council to authorize the deployment of an international support mission to the Central African Republic. The United Nations should give its full logistical and financial support to this African-led mission. Our credibility is at stake.We all know the disastrous effects of the unregulated trade in conventional arms — violent repression  armed conflict  crime and widespread violence. That is why the Arms Trade Treaty is so important. The General Assembly adopted the Treaty by a very large margin five months ago. Luxembourg is proud to have been among the first sponsors of that important initiative. We are proud to have signed the Treaty as soon as it was ready for signature on 3 June. The national ratification procedure has started  and members can count on our support to ensure that the Treaty comes rapidly into full force. In that regard  allow me to congratulate the homeland of the President of the General Assembly  Antigua and Barbuda  on having ratified the Treaty. I also welcome the fact that more than 110 States Members of the United Nations  including the United States of America  have already signed this new legal instrument. The Arms Trade Treaty is a significant step forward for international law  international humanitarian law and human rights. In that context  I welcome yesterday’s important Security Council debate on the impact of the illicit transfer  destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on international peace and security (see S/PV.7036)  as well as its adoption of resolution 2117 (2013). The Council has thereby rightly underscored the need for an integrated response from the international community that takes into account the negative effects of those illicit activities on security  governance  the rule of law and development  as well as the links between such activities and other threats to international peace and security such as terrorism  piracy and transnational organized crime.The recent callous attack on a shopping centre in Nairobi has again demonstrated the importance of our ongoing vigilance in the fight against terrorism. This unacceptable act must encourage us to further support African efforts aimed at freeing Somalia from the threat of Al-Shabaab. During the New Deal for Somalia conference held on 16 September in Brussels  I had the opportunity to reaffirm that Luxembourg remained committed to working alongside Somalia. We are convinced that with the determined support of the international community — the African Union and the United Nations in particular  the Government and people of Somalia will be able to continue their journey towards peace  security and prosperity.The risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains just as real a threat as the threat of terrorism. Yesterday  negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the E3+3 Governments  led by the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  Ms. Ashton  resumed here in New York. We support those efforts. We seek solid negotiations quickly leading to concrete outcomes and a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. Sanctions are not in and of themselves an end. They are a global response to Iran’s refusal to meet its international obligations and to cooperate fully with the International Atomatic Energy Agency. We encourage the new Iranian leadership to engage in constructive dialogue  to take the measures necessary to prove to the international community that its nuclear programme is intended for exclusively peaceful purposes  and to turn a new leaf in its relations with the global community. I hope that the recent phone call between President Obama and President Rouhani will help move the situation in that direction. When we talk about sustainable development and the creation of the post-2015 development agenda  we cannot ignore the devastating effects of conflicts and violence on development. The crisis situations and threats that I have just mentioned illustrate this clearly. We must also speak firmly about governance that is conducive to development  institutions that guarantee the rule of law  freedom of expression  and transparent and accountable Governments. We must talk about justice  the fight against impunity and respect for international law.Luxembourg fully subscribes to the Secretary-General’s call for the post-2015 objectives to be based on the international norms and principles of human rights. Those objectives must apply to everybody and help address the global challenges of the twenty-first century  building on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They must contribute to eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development  and be integrated into one coherent framework. The special event held the day before yesterday by the General Assembly allowed us to take stock of ongoing work towards achieving the MDGs and to welcome significant progress made  but also to identify the sectors where it will be important to redouble our efforts. As the Secretary-General has reminded us  the picture before us is only half finished. We must therefore speed up the march towards attaining the MDGs. We must renew our commitment. We must keep our promises.My country will continue to do its part. Since 2009  our official development assistance has amounted to 1 per cent of our gross national income. We are determined to maintain this effort despite the crisis. At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012  we reaffirmed our commitment to sustainable development in its three interdependent dimensions: economic development  social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We reiterated our determination to address the threats that climate change and environmental degradation pose to humankind. With its European partners  Luxembourg has made binding commitments to reduce its carbon emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. We are resolved to do our all to achieve a universal climate agreement in 2015.Last year in the Hall of the General Assembly  our Head of State  the Grand Duke  underscored Luxembourg’s willingness to serve the United Nations (see A/67/PV.9). Today  I take this opportunity to thank the Assembly for having elected my country to a two-year term on the Security Council. That tenure  the first in our history  is not only an honour but a responsibility that we do not take lightly. Each day since 1 January  Luxembourg has worked in concert with its partners to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and to assume our common responsibility to prevent  to preserve and to protect. No task is more noble. No task is more urgent in the current context."
"104",4323,"LVA",68,2013,"The three pillars of the United Nations — peace and security  sustainable development  and human rights — are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. Respect for universal human rights  fundamental freedoms and the rule of law is a cornerstone of international peace and stability.Fragile  conflict-affected and least developed countries face the biggest difficulties in ensuring sustainable development. Growing evidence shows that progress on the Millenium Development Goals in those States is impossible without first achieving peace and security. That leads us to one of the cornerstones of the new post-2015 vision: peace and security are basic conditions for a decent life and for the enjoyment of human rights.The priorities of the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session are topical and very pertinent. The new development framework for post-2015 will remain high on the United Nations agenda for the next two years and beyond. It should set out a comprehensive and coherent framework around a single set of global goals  driving action in all countries. A set of peacebuilding goals should be high on the post-2015 agenda  in which the United Nations should continue to play the leading role in promoting the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.The Middle East stands at a crossroads. Events there have global impact  and the international community must take decisive actions.We deplore the continuing humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. The easing of human suffering is the immediate goal  and we commend international efforts to that end. I would especially like to thank the neighbouring countries for hosting Syrian refugees. The detailed report by the United Nations inspectors confirms the use of chemical weapons against civilians on 21 August. Those who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria must face the International Criminal Court. The agreement reached by the United States and Russia on the framework to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons should be reflected in a Security Council resolution with the clear indication that Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations would be invoked in case of non-compliance.We encourage the new Iranian leadership to address the concerns of the international community. We welcome the stated determination of the new Iranian Government to resolve the nuclear issue  thus building confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.Latvia welcomes the reopening of direct Middle East peace negotiations. Latvia praises the role of the United States as the mediator. Negotiations should demonstrate the commitment of both parties to a peaceful settlement. We anticipate a two-State solution — Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.Latvia is convinced that the resolution of protracted conflicts in Moldova  Georgia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain high on the international agenda. Efforts to resolve the conflicts should be increased.Latvia accumulated extensive experience during its transition to a free  just and democratic society. As a European Union member State with that extensive experience  we share it with countries in the European Union’s Eastern Partnership and Central Asia. Latvia will continue to offer its expertise in such areas as the rule of law and fundamental freedoms  thereby contributing to good governance and further economic development in those countries. However  it is essential to keep in mind that national ownership is fundamental in any reform process  .Latvia is stepping up development assistance for Afghanistan and the Central Asian States  particularly in the areas of transportation and customs. We see potential for the further integration of those countries into the global economy by developing international trade routes. The Northern Distribution Network already connects the region with Europe through Latvia. We are confident that it can also become a commercially viable long-term transit corridor after 2014.We are approaching an important turning point in Afghanistan. In order to secure the progress achieved  the international community must remain committed to the country’s long-term development. Latvia will continue to support civilian policing and to train military personnel. We will also provide financial aid to the Afghan National Security Forces as of 2015.Sustainable development and prosperity go hand in hand. During times of recession  structural reforms and budgetary discipline  accompanied by economic stimulus  bring results. While we can observe signs of global economic recovery  there is no room for complacency. To ensure robust economic growth  we need to ensure that the young generation contributes to it. Quality education is the key to empowering people; it should reach all. Everybody should have lifelong learning opportunities. Quality education is the foundation on which peaceful  prosperous and dignified societies are built.Following the economic downturn in 2008  Latvia has been the fastest growing European Union economy for the past two years. We expect to maintain that strong growth trend at the level of at least 4 per cent annually for the coming years. Latvia is now ready for further integration into the global economy by introducing the euro in 2014 and by joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.An empowered civil society is a key engine of sustainable development. We are proud that the people of Latvia are actively engaged in the decision-making process at all stages. In the twenty-first century the public involvement’s must be ensured both directly and on line. Latvia has been working actively to protect and promote Internet freedom as an important element of freedom of expression for an open and democratic society.Latvia stands ready to contribute to the most fundamental goals that should figure on the post-2015 agenda  namely  promoting peace  human rights and fundamental freedoms. Therefore  we have put forward our candidacy for the elections to the Human Rights Council in 2014 and the Security Council in 2025. Latvia counts on the support of Member States and gives its assurance that it will contribute to the work of those bodies in a responsible manner."
"105",4370,"MAR",68,2013,"I would first like to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  and to renew our support for and highlight the efforts that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made at every level to enable our Organization to fulfil its role and responsibilities in dealing with the challenges of today’s world.We commend your choice of theme for our debate  Sir  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  which is very relevant and enables us to exchange views. From this rostrum  we pay tribute to the Secretary-General’s tireless efforts to integrate the Millennium Development Goals into the Organization’s strategic objectives. We hope that are our deliberations will help to strengthen international consensus on pursuing the complete and integrated fulfilment of our commitments and on formulating a road map with clear directions and specific goals for the post-2015 period.Morocco  while itself a stable country  is part of the Sahel-Sahara region  which is highly unstable — hence the importance for the Kingdom of Morocco of the situation in the brotherly country of Mali and the dangerous challenges it has been dealing with recently. We congratulate our Malian and African brothers and the international community on the success of the recent elections there and the progress Mali has made in achieving stability. The international community should continue to support it at every level. The visit of His Majesty King Mohammed VI to Mali to participate in the investiture ceremony for the new President of Mali afforded an excellent opportunity for Morocco to renew its wholehearted commitment to supporting Mali’s security  unity  stability and development. In his speech  King Mohammed said that the solutions to other security crises demonstrated that the crisis in Mali required an approach that went beyond mere security. That is why we support a three-pronged approach. The first dimension would be educational and ideological and would aim at spreading a culture of moderation and centrism and instituting a dialogue between the two peoples and their States  leading to the launching of cooperation in Islamic affairs and the training of 500 mosque imams to be sent to Mali.The second dimension would consist of development  with emphasis on bringing developing countries together  particularly countries stricken by drought and poverty  among other problems and crises  and empowering their people  as well as strengthening their capacity to achieve progress and development. That is why we have launched development programmes in coordination with Mali and other countries in the region.The third key thrust would be the humanitarian dimension. Security crises provoke unspeakable suffering for individuals and countries. Mali has seen tens of thousands of refugees leave the country and go to neighbouring countries  which is why it is important that there be a coordinated regional approach. In Bamako  the capital of Mali  we established a country hospital to relieve the suffering of the people in that area.With respect to the Great Lakes region  the Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the signing of the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement  which will greatly facilitate the real settlement of the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which has gone on for too long. We hope that all parties will respect the Framework Agreement and that they will honour their commitments and pledges and support the international community’s efforts to establish a peace process  while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Those challenges are part of various crises that we see occurring in the Sahel and Saharan regions. The Secretary-General has deployed many efforts along those lines. We are pleased with the high-level dialogue on the Sahel that he organized on the margins of the General Assembly for the second consecutive year  as well as the visit he hopes to make to the region  accompanied by a representative of the World Bank. We hope that the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel will be finalized. Once again  Morocco reiterates that it will participate in all efforts to protect the countries of the Sahel and the Sahara in order to strengthen stability  security and development in the region.Morocco reaffirms once more the need to set up initiatives for the Atlantic coast States  given their security  political  economic and social interrelationship and the challenges that obtain. We believe that stability and security in the region go beyond regional frameworks. We are therefore talking about a Sahel-Moroccan space for the purpose of maintaining stability in the region.We condemn the recent terrorist attacks in Kenya. We would ask the international community for greater efforts to bolster security and stability in that region.The second issue that concerns us and the rest of the international community is Syria. In that respect  we commend the international community and the Security Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013)  on the Syrian chemical weapons programme  and the announcement of the date of 15 November for the holding of the “Geneva II” Middle East peace conference in order to stop the violence in Syria and reach a political solution through dialogue that would maintain the territorial integrity of Syria and the stability of its neighbours. In that regard  I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States  the League itself  its member States and Joint Special Envoy Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi for the joint efforts they have made during this period with regard to the shedding of Syrian blood  the agreeing on a resolution and the reaching of a solution prior to Geneva II  with a view to putting an end to the crisis in Syria.We would like to reaffirm once again the importance of the humanitarian aspect of the crisis. There are 2 million refugees and tens of thousands of displaced persons  and thousands have been killed or wounded. This is the degree of suffering that the international community is called upon to reduce. The Kingdom of Morocco and its King have paid particular attention to the humanitarian dimension  which is why we established a rural hospital in Jordan a year and a half ago to provide health services to our Syrian brothers.It is well known that Morocco has been involved in the establishment of a Maghreb Union. Now is the time for coming together regionally  not for isolation. It is the time for cooperation and openness  not for unilateralism. Therefore  we are reactivating the Maghreb Union project in order to fulfil the hopes of the peoples of the five Maghreb countries and to help them to achieve stability  prosperity and sustainable development. His Majesty the King has called for a promising and ambitious Maghreb Union  and the Secretary-General has made a similar appeal. The Maghreb Union would implement peace and stability by taking a number of initiatives  including a joint mediation initiative undertaken with neighbourly Spain  pursuant to the appeal by the General Assembly in favour of mediation. The Kingdom of Morocco answered the call by launching the initiative and establishing partnership agreements between Moroccan and Spanish mediation centres to provide training and invite the participation of other countries in the region. The initiative was launched in a spirit of rapprochement  dialogue and cooperation and to promote mediation  which is important not only to stop conflicts when they have broken out but also to prevent them from occurring in the first place.The Kingdom of Morocco’s decision to protect human rights is irreversible. It is part of a comprehensive strategy and relies on an approach that favours the participation and advancement of people and the protection of their dignity within the framework of a development-focused democratic model. Morocco has therefore launched a number of projects and workshops  as well as major reforms  and made tremendous progress in broadening the sphere of individual and collective rights and freedoms  of preserving human dignity and of strengthening the protection of the rights of its citizens  especially the rights of women  children and persons with special needs.In its amended 2011 Constitution  the Kingdom of Morocco dedicated a chapter to respect for human rights as they are recognized internationally. Morocco has always desired to preserve a balance between its international and national commitments and priorities. As a founding member of the Human Rights Council  Morocco has participated effectively and constructively in the formulation and implementation of the institutional texts of the Council  in particular the universal periodic review. When it was decided to take another look at the rules and mechanisms in 2011  Morocco was given the task of conducting the negotiations on them. At the same time  the Kingdom of Morocco enjoyed positive cooperation with the various institutions and mechanisms and interacted with their recommendations  in particular the universal period review  treaties and special measures  whose assessments Morocco continues to welcome  facilitate and answer with its observations. Morocco hopes to gain the Assembly’s support for its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period 2014-2016  in order to further contribute to strengthening the role of the Council and to ensure the effectiveness necessary for its operation.In that connection  we have recently launched an initiative relating to immigration  especially illegal migration. Morocco wished to establish other mechanisms for refugees in connection with how we address the issue and rights of immigration  especially illegal migration  and asylum. A few days ago  a new statute on immigration was enacted and the right to asylum  so as to give new rights and documents to political refugees. All of this is a very important development for our country.I would like also to touch on the key issue of the territorial integrity of Morocco and the issue of the Moroccan Sahara. For several years now our authorities have followed the diligent efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council to resolve the Sahara issue. Morocco complies with all Security Council resolutions and has acted in good faith with respect to those resolutions and to the efforts of the Secretary-General. The most recent resolutions called for a new round of negotiations among the parties so as to achieve a sustainable political solution accepted by all. Morocco therefore launched an initiative on autonomy  a practical and moderate solution that enjoyed the support of many countries friends of Morocco as well as of several regional organizations. Unfortunately  however  the other parties involved  committed to their 30-year stance and proposals  did not allow progress to be made in the political process. I reiterate that Morocco is committed to working effectively and in good faith with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy in all their efforts and with the Security Council in order to implement the successive resolutions adopted by the Security Council.Finally  on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco  I wish to say that with the approach of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization  we reaffirm our sincere commitment to its principles and to the active mobilization of our efforts so as to update  empower and strengthen it  given that it is the unique and optimal framework for meeting current and future challenges."
"106",4394,"MCO",68,2013,"Twenty years ago I took the floor for the first time before the General Assembly. A few months before that  on 28 May 1993  Monaco had become the one hundred and eighty-third State Member of the United Nations  the smallest Member State of the only universal Organization. The decision of Prince Rainier III  my father  reflected the will to fully assume our role as a responsible and committed State within a changing world  where new opportunities and new challenges were becoming interdependent and transcending borders. That vision remains unchanged over the passage of time. My country continues to shoulder all its responsibilities on the major issues that bring us together here today. Faithful to its principles and to its past  the Principality of Monaco wishes to make its contribution in the most effective way possible to the task of building peace  to which we have been so attached over the centuries. Therefore  inspired by a conviction that our shared humanity requires that each of us treat our fellow human beings with respect and dignity  tolerance and comprehension  we have endorsed the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which we aspire together to defend and to promote. That important decision to fulfil the responsibility that each Member State has is strengthened by the conviction  originating from the holding of the first Earth Summit  in 1992  that sustainable development  without which we cannot aspire to our ideal of peace  must be planned with respect for the environment of our planet. It is in a sombre international context that we are going to define the post-2015 development agenda  an agenda that will be the cornerstone of the work of the Organization and will be crucial to establishing its political legitimacy for decades to come. The growing insecurity in the world  characterized by the fragmentation of societies  threatens the progress made in many fields and causes multidimensional regional instability that is likely to further deepen existing differences. The recent attacks perpetrated in Kenya  Pakistan and Iraq are another shocking illustration of that problem. They remind us that many parts of the world are still subject to deadly terrorist attacks. Allow me to extend to the families of the victims and to their Government my deepest condolences. I must also speak out against persisting conflicts  which hamper development and cause an unacceptable humanitarian situation. With regard to Syria in particular  the number of displaced civilians and refugees in bordering countries is of great concern. A new threshold was crossed with the use of chemical weapons  an extremely serious violation of international law that cannot be tolerated. Monaco associates itself with those who continue to advocate for a political settlement of the conflict  especially in the light of the recent agreement on the control and destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria. Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons cannot go unpunished. The International Committee of the Red Cross  which I wish to pay tribute to for its determination to fulfil its mandate in spite of difficult circumstances  must be given access to populations in need and must be assured that it is able to conduct its activities in full security.The tenth anniversary of the attack on United Nations staff in Baghdad is a sad reminder that we need to relentlessly continue with our efforts on behalf of United Nations staff  who too often have become deliberate targets. That deplorable situation will be given attention in the coming world summit on humanitarian aid to be held on the initiative of the Secretary-General  which we fully support.The evolution of factors that lead to humanitarian emergencies forces us to examine the ways in which the Organization can act in such circumstances  which include conflicts  natural disasters  climate change and environmental degradation. We must recognize that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  to which I express my deepest gratitude  needs to be given the means and the resources required for it to carry out the mandate we have given it.To those who criticize or threaten the progress of the United Nations  the results accomplished show that our courageous political decisions  in the fields of both security and development  are timely and positive. Together  in the year 2000  we defined the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which today have made it possible for billions of people to live better. Those successes are all the more remarkable given that progress has been achieved in spite of the effects of many crises of a financial  economic  food and energy nature  some of whose consequences linger and are even worsening. Tomorrow  the special event devoted to the MDGs will be an opportunity to reiterate our priority commitment to eliminating poverty and an opportunity for us to redouble efforts to hasten the achievement of the Goals. The Millennium Development Goals Report 2013 indicates the areas that require urgent action and the significant gaps that exist  not only among countries but within their borders. We cannot tolerate the fact that there are still people who have been rejected by society  people for whom the hope born of a new millennium remains a broken promise. It is not acceptable that in today’s world human beings still live close to complete destitution  where even their basic needs go unmet. That is why we applaud the Secretary-General’s efforts on behalf of his mobilization campaigns — Education First  “Every woman  every child” and Scaling Up Nutrition — which push us to shoulder our responsibilities towards the world’s most vulnerable.Education  the promotion of women  the protection of children  public health and the conservation of natural resources are priority elements in the international cooperation policies that I have outlined. They are structured around the eight MDGs  especially maternal and child health  the fight against pandemics and neglected diseases and the promotion of food security  and in particular they are geared towards the least developed countries. It seems to me that a policy of international cooperation should respond as much as possible to their interests  so that a virtuous circle of development can be launched and help build a more just  stable and less unequal world.Important advances have often been accompanied or completed by the adoption of measures emerging from the Organization’s major conferences and summits. By strengthening the treaty regime on human rights  disarmament and the fight against terrorism  and through the regimes established by the Security Council  Member States have endowed themselves with the means to reaffirm their faith in multilateralism  which is the reason for the Organization’s existence  and in the rule of law  which is the foundation of our collective action. It is vital that we speed up the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted in Istanbul in 2011 at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.The work that lies ahead for the President of the General Assembly comes at a turning point in our history. Under his leadership  the General Assembly must not only speed up the implementation of the MDGs but also prepare the post-2015 development agenda and define the sustainable development goals in accordance with this session’s theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”.His valuable experience and unreserved dedication to the Organization  and to sustainable development in particular  will guide our deliberations. We are grateful to have him  a son of Antigua and Barbuda  a small island developing State  presiding over the upcoming discussions  since we are confident that he is all too familiar with the issues at stake.He should also rest assured that Monaco’s representative  in its capacity as Vice-President  is ready to support him in his noble task.Based on lessons learned from the MDGs  together we will build an ambitious new development programme capable of responding effectively to the demands of our new reality. I have climate change in mind in particular. Greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the global level  despite the fact that we have identified climate change as one of the greatest dangers of our era. The Secretary-General can count on my country’s contribution to the upcoming summit on climate change  which he intends to hold next September. His willingness to bring together leaders from every sector of society — civil society  the private sector  the world of business and finance and  above all  young people  all of them agents of change — is the only path of hope for the radical transformation that is needed. There is no alternative to defining a new programme and a new paradigm.At the current rate  if we do not change our behaviour  we will need the equivalent of two planet Earths to meet the needs of the world’s population  which  as we know  will reach 9 billion in 2050 and has always been concentrated in urban and coastal zones  whose natural resources are particularly vulnerable. That simple fact should prompt us to adopt sustainable modes of production and consumption  in accordance with the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. That essential change of mindset presupposes that we place human beings at the heart of the development issue. It is no longer a question of agreeing on development plans for agricultural  artisanal and industrial capacities. We must consider that it is human societies and individuals who deserve all of our attention. We must study economic and environmental issues in the light of their impact on the lives of people and communities. Taking those needs into account means that we must reflect further on how to ensure responsible development that respects the environment and is truly sustainable.The Assembly is aware of my personal commitment to issues involving the oceans and seas. In accordance with the Monaco Message on the acknowledged importance of the oceans in “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  which was adopted in November 2011  I am once again committing to promoting the role of the oceans in the definition of the post-2015 agenda and to reiterating my support for a sustainable development goal focusing on the oceans. Climate regulation  food and nutrition security  energy  tourism  transport and international trade — all areas directly or indirectly affected by the oceans — are linked to the three pillars of sustainable development. I think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental the oceans are to the world and how serious are the risks presented to them through the excessive human activity that contributes to their acidification and the acceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.In that context  I would like to say how crucial I believe it is that the international community address the status of the high seas without delay  and how urgent it is that protected marine areas be established  especially in the polar regions. If the viability and sustainable management of the oceans are to be achieved  only an unswerving political willingness to form strong partnerships that unite all the parties concerned will be able to combat the effects of the overfishing  pollution and acidification of the oceans and restore them to health and productivity.Strengthening cooperation and partnerships  as well as deciding on concrete action  are also at the heart of the preparations for the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to which I want to give my full support  along with a needed boost in the solidarity that is essential to promoting sustainable development.The stakes are clear. Let us  who wish to reaffirm the central place that the Organization occupies in international governance  give it the means to assure that leadership role by being ambitious and resolute in our task. Let us remember the words of the novelist Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “Being a human being means being responsible”."
"107",4419,"MDA",68,2013,"I would first like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to wish him every success in his post. I am confident that his diligence and perspicacity will contribute to our efforts to address the challenges of today’s world. I would also like to express my appreciation for the work of Mr. Vuk Jeremi. in presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and my best wishes for his further success in his career. And I pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless work promoting peace and security  human rights and prosperity in a sustainable global environment  as well as for his efforts to make this Organization more transparent and efficient.Before the key points of my statement  I would like to offer my condolences to the victims of the senseless attack in Kenya.The United Nations is in the midst of establishing a new post-2015 development agenda that will continue and advance the ambitious commitments laid down in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). We welcome the inauguration earlier this week of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development as a key step towards the implementation of the outcome document of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex). We expect that the high-level dialogue will reinforce and launch the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development — economic prosperity  social equity and environmental protection — with the firm commitment of Member States to deliver on those priority areas. We recall the huge effort it took for this Organization to agree last year in Rio on the wide-ranging framework for a world working cooperatively towards a sustainable future  and we are hopeful that this effort will yield results sooner rather than later.For the Republic of Moldova  sustainable development is the only way to ensure a decent life for our people. It follows that we must foster economic development and solve our energy security problems while ensuring an ecologically healthy environment. My Government has been working hard to achieve those ends  together with its relevant international partners  particularly the European Union (EU)  which gives us a reference point for our national policies. We are convinced that political will  mutual assistance and transparency in every significant issue can bring just as much positive change to emerging and developing economies as to poor ones. We reaffirm that issues such as poverty eradication  human rights and tolerance  access to quality education without gender discrimination  decent jobs for all and the preservation of nature and biodiversity should have special priority on the United Nations development agenda in the years to come.Cooperation between sectors is also a key issue  which is why international partners and the donor community  including the private sector and civil society  should work hand in hand with the United Nations and Governments in order to mobilize the necessary resources and use them to target specific results-oriented projects as well as investments in essential areas.I would also like to touch on the problems of migration and population movement. The United Nations has acknowledged more than once that migration can benefit the development of countries of origin as much as that of countries of destination  if international cooperation is strengthened and suitable policies are put in place. That is certainly the case with the Republic of Moldova  where migration has contributed to our macroeconomic stability in recent years. At the same time  we are living through a period of considerable change that is likely to influence the demographic  economic  social and security aspects of our population. There is no doubt that investing in human capital is fundamentally a way out of demographic volatility and an indispensable condition for our country’s prosperity  while ensuring respect for human rights. That is how we aim to reduce the interdependence between development and migration flows and to create an environment conducive to community development  including small and medium-size businesses  with financial aid awarded directly from the State budget.However  I would also like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the positive examples derived from the mobility partnership between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union. That initiative has strengthened the Government’s capacity to formulate and implement migration policies  find shared priorities with the EU and develop innovative and strategic legislative initiatives  based on best practices. We must definitely continue in that spirit  which is the only way to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions for regular and circulating migration that can benefit our citizens  while ensuring that human rights are protected and social security guaranteed.I would like to mention here one of the most significant achievements of the Assembly  the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)  which was made possible after several years of intense debate and negotiation on the regulation of the world’s arms trade.The Republic of Moldova has signed the ATT  and we hope that the rapid entry into force of the Treaty will make the global arms trade more transparent and legitimate. The ATT could be a great step forward in controlling the proliferation and illicit circulation of weapons  especially in vulnerable areas and in areas that do not respect the constitutional system of sovereign States.In addition  the Government is working closely with its European and international partners  in particular with Germany’s Federal Office of Economics and Export Control and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  to review and amend national legislation on the export control of dual-use goods in order to adopt the best international standards and rely on the best international experience in that field.As a member of the Human Rights Council  my country has completed the first cycle of the universal periodic review  which is  in our opinion  one of the best exercises for monitoring and evaluating the results of national human rights institutions and mechanisms. At the same time  we agreed to undertake new commitments to meet the challenges involved in implementing the recommendations of the universal periodic review.The Republic of Moldova continues to advocate for a review of the human rights situation by all countries and States and believes that a robust  apolitical and impartial Human Rights Council should exercise greater authority  especially in cases of serious human rights violations  and should provide guidance on the implementation of the best practices and standards in this area.My Government is pleased to announce the fourth seminar of Francophone countries  to be held at the beginning of 2014  in Chisinau  our capital  to discuss the results of and lessons learned from the first cycle of the universal periodic review. We hope that the findings of that seminar will contribute to the advancement  strengthening and improvement of the universal periodic review as a unique mechanism for the review of human rights practices in all States members of the International Organization of la Francophonie.(spoke in English)The Republic of Moldova is pursuing an intensive and comprehensive reform programme in the political  economic  institutional  legislative  demographic and judicial areas and others. We are firmly committed to building a State based on the rule of law  good governance  transparency and accountability. Through those difficult efforts  we are becoming a stronger nation and a better international partner  and we must keep pushing ahead.In that connection  we are proud to announce that the Government has embarked on a new course of technological modernization to enable direct public access to Government services. Our aim is to make all such Government services electronically available to all citizens by 2020 at any time  from anywhere  using modern communication technologies and devices such as computers  mobile phones and interactive payment offices. Such a system will combat corruption  reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and ensure true transparency in the relationship between citizens and public officials. The Republic of Moldova is among the leaders in that field  and our efforts have already yielded real benefits for our citizens with the implementation of our electronic catalogue for public services  mobile digital signatures  the Government’s electronic payment portal and many more services.The ambitious reform agenda of the Government and its foreign policy are both directed towards the fulfilment of our country’s strategic objective — European integration. At this stage  we have concluded the negotiations on the Association Agreement with the EU and its component part  the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement  and the initialling of the texts is going to take place at the upcoming Eastern Partnership summit to be held in Vilnius in November. All of those actions — the political association with the EU  the economic rapprochement and the perspective of visa-free travel for our citizens — are bringing us closer to our final goal  namely EU integration  and they open new perspectives for political and economic cooperation in the region.Every year  my delegation brings to the attention of the Assembly the issue of the protracted conflict in the Transnistrian region  which has affected my country ever since independence. As a nation that values national consolidation and unity  that conflict is a constant challenge that undermines our development efforts. The political settlement of the conflict and the reintegration of the country are our strategic priority. We envisage uniting the population from both banks of the Dniester River around shared goals and providing them with a better future. It also means removing one of the most fundamental challenges to our national security  economic development and social cohesion. Ultimately  resolving the Transnistrian conflict means guaranteeing secured national borders and opening a new perspective towards stability and fruitful  bilateral and equitable relations with our neighbours and international partners.Peace and dialogue are fundamental prerequisites for a political solution to any conflict. Let me emphasize that there have now been more than two decades of peace in the region  and we will spare no effort to preserve that peace. Moldova is fully committed to dialogue through all available channels. But in order to achieve the desired outcome  we desperately need trust within the resolution process and genuine engagement and commitment from the outside. We advocate for the continuation of the confidence-building activities that have been taking place since 2007 with the support of the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union  aimed at bridging the gaps between all stakeholders from both banks and involving local authorities  business communities and civil society.The vision of the Government of the Republic of Moldova for a final solution to the conflict is unambiguous and inclusive. First  a comprehensive and viable solution must be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. We are open to a reasonable compromise on a special status for the region within the Republic of Moldova  which would provide the population from the left bank with a comfortable and guaranteed level of self-governance in various areas of public life. There should be a single constitutional  economic and defence space within the internationally recognized borders of Moldova. At the same time  the Republic of Moldova should remain a functional State that continues to advance on its European path and makes every effort to allow the population and the business communities from both banks to benefit equally from our extensive partnership with the European Union and  hopefully  within the European Union.On the conflict resolution matter  we will continue with renewed impetus to seek solutions in order to ensure the freedom of movement  improved transportation links and new and real opportunities for businesses on both banks of the Dniester. We will also redouble our efforts to convince our partners to start talks on political and security issues  including the future status of the region within the recognized borders of the Republic of Moldova. Moreover  we will seek to intensify law-enforcement interaction and preserve stability in the security zone  and we reaffirm our stance on the need to transform the current peacekeeping mechanism into an international civilian mission.Strengthening respect for human rights is of utmost importance to us. The report of the United Nations senior expert on human rights in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova  Mr. Thomas Hammarberg  offers a good road map for joint activities in that regard. In addition  I would like to reiterate our long-standing and unwavering call to finalize the withdrawal of the Russian military forces and ammunition from the territory of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with the relevant international commitments.In conclusion  I would like to express my Government’s conviction that the future of the region will be brighter if we unite our efforts in building a stronger and unified country  open to Europe where it naturally belongs  and to diversity  tolerance and economic and market opportunities. We are optimistic that we can achieve that because there is no better vision that we could embrace for the well-being of our people and the consolidation of our nation. The Republic of Moldova places peace and real  constructive dialogue above any political goal or ambition. We follow with great concern the continuing violence in the Middle East and abhor the loss of so many lives and futures  which will perhaps irremediably maim the consciousness of a whole generation  not only in the conflict zones but worldwide. The refugee crisis in Syria magnifies the perils of war  Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced as they try to salvage their lives and find peace. My own country has offered protection to a number of Syrian refugees  and we recognize the significant burden that Syria’s neighbours and other receiving countries  many in Europe  face as they seek to alleviate the Syrian refugees’ suffering  offer them a better chance for survival and affirm their basic human rights. It is time for all sides to take a step back  find a peaceful solution and build a future for their people rather than pursue fleeting  treacherous and  so often  deadly political goals.In conclusion  I would like to express the hope that during the current session the members of the Assembly will succeed in reaching important decisions on topical issues  such as sustainable development  peace and security  human rights and many others. My delegation is willing and open to making its contribution in a collaborative and constructive way. "
"108",4462,"MDG",68,2013,"It is often said that things always come in threes. Indeed  this is the third time that I have had the privilege to address the Assembly as President of the Transition of the Republic of Madagascar. Here we are again  convening as we do every year for the General Assembly. All the leaders of the planet meet regularly to debate  exchange views and share their experiences within the framework of a process of consultations that belongs to a long collective march towards peace  security and sustainable planetary development. But each year  new  ever more violent and more lethal conflicts are waged  requiring that we respond with equal intensity. Shall we limit ourselves to simply speaking about conflict resolution  or shall we to challenge ourselves  analyse the underlying causes and take the necessary measures to preserve stability in the world? As I add my voice to those who have spoken before me  I warmly congratulate the President on the votes that he won in support of his candidacy. Madagascar will endeavour to provide him its sincere support and cooperation.Regrettably  over recent decades  when we speak of Africa  we generally see States that are exposed to permanent violence and the progressive loss of democracy  States where wars  conflicts and crises continually break out and there is more division than consensus. According to Ambassador Jeremi.  who presided at the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly  humankind is facing an existential crisis  with symptoms such as economic instability  social inequalities and environmental degradation. For my part  I would add that humankind may be losing its forward momentum but that it is not giving up. Yes  the news delivered by the media every day is extremely worrying throughout the world. Whether the country is developed  emerging or poor  no segment of society escapes deterioration of various kinds  including poor employment conditions  unemployment  declining purchasing power  the total absence of any income at all  lack of access to basic necessities in food  clothing  health care and education  and  in addition  poverty  deprivation and indigence. Those are all factors that are the nurturing ground for intolerance  confrontation and conflict  thereby helping to give rise to global insecurity. I refer here particularly to recent events in Kenya  Iraq  Pakistan and Syria  to name just a few. We fully share in the pain and sorrow of the families of the victims. Some 800 days from the deadline of 2015  like most African States and many developing countries  Madagascar is finding it difficult to attain all the Millennium Development Goals  despite the efforts everyone has made. Given that situation  I have to wonder what sort of contribution we  the leaders of our nations  can make individually to that collective effort  with a view to finding ways of improving the daily lives of those who have put their trust in us and placed their destiny in our hands.In his statement yesterday (see A/68/PV.5)  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the fact that  in streets and squares across the world  people are pressing those in power. They want world leaders to listen. They want to know that we are doing everything we can to secure a life of dignity for all. The popular unrest in the context of the Arab Spring and the movements of the outraged exemplify this observation and reflect a legitimate aspiration. I fully support the Secretary-General’s remarks and call upon all of us to ensure that we clearly understand the demands of the demonstrators. Madagascar would also have wished to benefit from such understanding when the Malagasy people rose up against an unpopular regime to demand a better life through the establishment of genuine change. But that was not the case. On the contrary  Madagascar encountered misunderstanding and the inflexibility of an international community operating at various speeds  not to mention the application of dogmatic texts  even though popular uprisings elsewhere  in very similar circumstances  had been viewed sympathetically and with concern.Efforts must therefore now be made to end the unequal treatment of countries in crisis. We must become aware of popular aspirations and realities on the ground so as not to take the wrong decision. If it is valid elsewhere  surely it is also valid in the case of Madagascar? All the conditions were in place in Madagascar. The danger of a social explosion and a fratricidal conflict was omnipresent  but fortunately — unlike some countries that continue to experience unrest and even armed violence  and despite all the economic and social restrictions and the absence of support and assistance from the international community from which Madagascar has suffered in recent years — the people of Madagascar did not fall into the trap of internal conflict  which some would have taken advantage of.It is with great national pride that I announce from this rostrum that Madagascar was able to avoid civil war. That required considerable sacrifice  self-denial and humility  but we came through thanks to our patriotism. I reiterate the fact that despite our disagreements and our different points of view  we have reached a settlement of our conflict using all available negotiation methods. I would like to solemnly thank the Malagasy people  who are a peaceful people and aspire to peace and whose courage and patience have been unmatched in the peaceful settlement of our political crisis. The Malagasy people deserve a better future. Citizens will be able to freely express their choices on their future leader through the ballot box at the upcoming presidential elections  scheduled to take place on 25 October this year  for which the electoral campaign began yesterday.Madagascar is now starting a new phase in its history. I would like to warmly thank all those who  throughout the process of Madagascar’s emergence from its crisis  supported and assisted us during the transition period  in particular  the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the various presidents of the SADC Troika  the African Union  the European Union  the United Nations  the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  the International Organization of la Francophonie  and all friendly countries without exception  without forgetting those who have already demonstrated their willingness to provide international observers for the elections. At the same time  I would like to renew my appeal to the entire General Assembly to join the ranks of our partners.We are at a crossroads. The people expect specific and tangible results. The question is  do we have the courage and the wisdom to sacrifice ourselves for the well-being of our people and to avoid conflict and civil war  so that innocent people do not lose their lives  so that those who are in power no longer use weapons and so that no one resorts to violence? As a leader  I realize that the exercise of power requires an awareness of our humanity and our fallibility. That is the message that Madagascar would like convey as its contribution to this general debate today. The world is changing very quickly  a new generation is rising to replace the old one  and leaders have the duty to meet the expectations of our people and to find a solution to ensure their well-being.In my case  I did everything I could to overcome the political crisis in Madagascar and maintain national unity and the best interests of the Malagasy people. I also decided that I will not be a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. It is on that note  and with the well-known words of American theologian and writer James Freeman Clarke  that I would like to conclude: “A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman  of the next generation.”"
"109",4502,"MDV",68,2013,"I wish to begin by extending my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly on his assumption of office at the sixty-eighth session. I also wish to commend the Secretary-General on his leadership during what is a trying and testing time around the globe. We are confident in his leadership and in the Organization’s resolve in tackling the many unprecedented challenges of our time.Challenges  old and new  seem to be a recurring theme during this general debate  and it is only right that it be so: it is when we face enormous challenges and when we feel most uncomfortable  vulnerable  unhappy and unfulfilled that we are most likely to think above and beyond and seek new answers to old questions.The most pressing challenge for the United Nations is definitely that of remaining relevant  given the realities of the twenty-first century  as the Organization remains the ultimate guarantor of the sovereign equality of nations and the only international institution to which all countries  big and small  can look to ensure justice  freedom and peace. The Maldives  along with other States  has been calling for the reform of the Security Council to make it more inclusive  and thereby more credible and reflective of the voices of not only the powerful but also the weak  and more representative of the global population and its geographic distribution. In addition to the Council’s composition  its working methods must also be improved — only then can the United Nations restore its credibility  authority and legitimacy.Global challenges are of significant importance to the Maldives. The situation in the Middle East is particularly close to the hearts of Maldivians. We are appalled at the human cost of the conflict in Syria. The use of chemical weapons at any time  by anyone  and for whatever purpose must not be tolerated. In that regard  the Maldives welcomes Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  on the destruction of the chemical weapons in Syria  which was adopted unanimously. The Council’s decision will  we hope  take us a step closer to ending the atrocities taking place there as we speak. Violence begets violence. We therefore call on both sides of the conflict to choose the path of dialogue  not of violence.The Maldives also calls on the General Assembly to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. We urge the Assembly to support a two-State solution through the establishment of the State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on the lands occupied in the 1967 war. Is it fair that Palestinian children grow up without a country of their own? Is it fair that the Palestinian needs for security  stability  prosperity and development go unanswered and unfulfilled because of the continued violence? We have discussed that issue enough. It is time for action. We are encouraged by the renewed United States-led Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. It is our earnest hope that those talks will ultimately lead to a peaceful and secure future for future generations of Palestine and Israel.With the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) fast approaching  the focus of the world and the Assembly has turned to the post-2015 agenda. However  accelerating the achievement of the original Millennium Development Goals remains an urgent necessity. The Maldives therefore calls on all nations to fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) commitments and thereby help the most vulnerable populations overcome the challenges they face in achieving the MDGs.We in the Maldives have made remarkable progress on the MDGs  having achieved five out of the eight ahead of the deadline. Although we have not achieved three of the MDGs  we are proud of the work we have done towards achieving them  in particular on the advancement of women. Our country has shown promise in addressing gender equality  especially in the area of health and education. It has nearly achieved universal access to basic health care for women and is proud of high literacy rates among boys and girls alike. The Maldives regards improving the socioeconomic rights of women as an integral part of national development and a core component of sustainable development. Unfortunately  we are facing setbacks on some of the MDGs that have been achieved  and are even regressing  owing to emerging issues  especially the loss of ODA as we graduate from the status of a least developed country (LDC)  while persistent challenges hinder the achievement of the whole set of MDGs. Therefore  achieving and sustaining the progress on the MDGs will remain the key development challenge for the future.In formulating the post-2015 developmental agenda  we should be mindful of the fact that MDGs are multidimensional and interconnected. They are not an end in themselves or a final solution  but merely a beginning.The Maldives is encouraged by the multi-stakeholder mechanisms that are ongoing within the United Nations. It is our hope that all of those mechanisms will be considered holistically and not in isolation  as we move towards a more concrete post-2015 development agenda.It is also our sincere hope that the Millennium Development Goals will not be left non-fulfilled and that the post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals (SDGs) are not seen in isolation from the MDGs. We hope that the sustainable development goals will be seen as a continuation of the MDGs. The formulation of the SDGs and the post-2015 development agenda should complement the achievement of the MDGs and reflect any gaps therein. We also hope that no nation will be left without an avenue towards progression and that no small island developing State (SIDS) is left behind.As we talk about the development agenda that we set for ourselves at the turn of this millennium  I cannot help but wonder whether the Maldives and other low-lying island States will survive to see another century  let alone another millennium. The Maldives is a small nation with meagre resources that faces numerous challenges when it comes to food  water and energy security — a nation that has  despite our small size  advocated loud and clear for international actions to address climate change. We have sought to help the world to see that the right to a safe and secure environment is a basic human right.I urge all United Nations institutions to solidify and strengthen all standards and move towards the creation of an international mechanism. We need to strengthen institutions and cultivate a more dependable and consistent approach towards climate change and the consequent human rights issues that will become the most pressing challenges facing humanity.For example  the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented to world leaders just last week underscored the need for urgent action on the issue of climate change. The report concludes that  in the event of a business-as-usual scenario  low-lying nations will face grave existential threats.What does that mean for the Maldives? With 80 per cent of our small nation barely 1.5 metres above sea level and with more than 45 per cent of settlements within 100 metres of the coastline  all facets of our lifestyle  culture and economy depend almost exclusively on coastal and marine biodiversity. At present  our biodiversity contributes to 70 per cent of our national employment  49 per cent of public revenue  62 per cent of foreign exchange  98 per cent of exports and 89 per cent of our gross domestic product. Any loss of that biodiversity will result in catastrophic consequences for the Maldives.Those are facts  but we have known those facts for a long time. What we need now is action. Our inaction speaks louder than words.As a nation  Maldives has witnessed the trials of graduation from LDC status without due consideration for the inherent vulnerabilities of small island nations. Simply having a high gross national income or a high standing in the human development index does not make SIDS less vulnerable to external shocks  including emerging threats such as climate change; nor does it remove the difficulties associated with their smallness and remoteness  and in achieving economies of scale.The Maldives is a perfect example of a SIDS graduating from LDC status based on distorted data and geographically disassociated global aggregates and indices. Even upon graduation  our country continues to face numerous economic  social and climate-change challenges. That must be a lesson to learn from as we develop the post-2015 development agenda.SIDS require differential treatment because of their unique inherent vulnerabilities. That is why the Maldives and other countries in the same plight have been advocating relentlessly to find a comprehensive definition for SIDS. SIDS need to be given full recognition within the global governance regimes and multilateral and financial institutions  and adequately integrated and institutionalized within the United Nations system. Doing so would help to target assistance more effectively. That is also why we support the inclusion of a SIDS-focused goal in the post-2015 development agenda.All of the challenges I have outlined are key to the Maldives. However  the most pressing challenge to the Maldives remains democracy consolidation and concerted efforts by external forces to prevent the emergence of an indigenous democratic system of governance in the Maldives.A few weeks ago  the Maldives held its second multiparty elections. It was one of the most competitive elections in the country’s history  yet it did not produce a clear winner. Some of the parties that competed in the election have identified serious issues with the conduct of the elections and have asked the Supreme Court of the Maldives for a ruling. We are expecting the Court to hand down a ruling in the coming days. The integrity of the second round of our presidential election cannot be maintained without ensuring the integrity of the first round through constitutional means. We await the Supreme Court’s verdict to continue the electoral process  allowing for a new President to be sworn in on November 11.However  some external forces are attempting to shape the outcome of what in effect is an internal issue. The Maldives is small. Our democracy is in its infancy. Our institutions are young. That does not  however  mean that larger countries have a right to intervene and attempt to dictate outcomes in the domestic affairs of the Maldives.Non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States is a core principle of the Charter of the Organization. Yet small States have frequently been the victims of the predatory designs of larger countries. It is for that reason that the Maldives initiated resolution 44/51  on “Protection and security of small States”  in the Assembly in 1989. The call for protecting small States from external threats is further reiterated in resolutions 46/43 and 49/31  recognizing the particular vulnerabilities of small States to external threats and acts of interference in their internal affairs. The resolutions also call on all nations to respect the principle of territorial integrity and national sovereignty. Therefore  my delegation trusts the United Nations to be the ultimate guarantor of the security of small States such as the Maldives.Democracy consolidation is not just about holding elections. Nor is it about having a democratically sound Constitution. In the Maldives  too  we quickly found that changing the Constitution  or having a multiparty election  did not instil democratic values within our society.For democracy to be cultivated and consolidated  the supremacy of the Constitution must be upheld above all. The institutional deficiencies we face must be addressed within constitutional provisions  and the political leadership must sustain an unshakeable commitment to the principles and values of democracy. The rule of law must prevail.Our institutions are young. Therefore  institution-building and reform remain a key challenge for the Maldives. More importantly  cultivating a culture of respect for human rights  tolerance  pluralism and freedom remains incredibly important as we move through the democratic journey.Those are the reasons why the Maldives decided to present its bid for re-election to the Human Rights Council. Our membership in the Council over the past three years has helped the country to take some unprecedented and bold measures to bring the country’s national human rights mechanisms up to international standards. The Maldives believes that its continued membership would help it to further accelerate ongoing efforts in modernizing institutions and in promoting a culture of respect for human rights and democracy in Maldivian society.Without democracy  the rule of law  human rights and peace we would have nothing  we would achieve nothing  and we would sustain nothing. In order to tackle the many challenges confronting the Maldives  we must adopt an inclusive form of governance where the voices and opinions of even the most vulnerable and the most disadvantaged in our society are heard. Without equality and justice  societies cannot prosper at all.Democracy consolidation is a long and arduous journey  but it is one worth making. Our pace may not be as fast as the international community desires. But the Maldives is in the process of solidifying the foundations of our society for development  for democracy and for the protection of human rights. But that does not mean that we do not need the international community’s assistance.We know better than most that to be an emerging democracy is to be constantly challenged by volatile  new and emerging issues. There is no leeway to stumble  no room to hesitate  and we will not falter in our resolve. We will strengthen and redefine our institutions. We will adhere to our Constitution. We will work with our international partners  and we will move forward as a nation and as a sustainable society."
"110",4549,"MEX",68,2013,"On behalf of President Enrique Peña Nieto  it is an honour for me to address the plenary of this Organization  a symbol of universal values and of the best causes of humankind. On behalf of the people and Government of Mexico  I thank the international community for the generous expressions of solidarity and support following the weather-related events in my country. They contribute to the work of the Government and to the fraternal participation of civil society in providing assistance to those affected. Over the past two weeks  Mexico has suffered the unprecedented simultaneous arrival of two hurricanes  Ingrid and Manuel  one on the Pacific coast and the other on the Atlantic coast. Over the past few decades  Mexico has worked hard to bolster its capability to prevent and respond to natural disasters. However  the increased vulnerability we face in the world underscores the need and urgency for action. That is why we welcome the Secretary-General’s decision to convene a summit in September 2014 to address the impact of climate change. Mexico will participate enthusiastically and will continue to contribute to the implementation of the agreements reached in 2010 at Cancún. I join in the international community’s unanimous condemnation of the unspeakable attacks against civilians in Nairobi. Mexico expresses its solidarity to the Government and people of Kenya  as well as our condolences to relatives of the victims. Such unfortunate acts constitute an affront to peace and clearly demonstrate the need for us to remain vigilant in the fight against terrorism. We also join those who have expressed their condolences to the Government and people of Pakistan following the recent earthquake.My countrty believes in multilateralism and reiterates its unflinching commitment to the Organization. We support the diplomatic initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful political solution to the crisis in Syria  in particular the agreement reached by the United States and Russia on eliminating chemical weapons in that country. The prohibition of the use or threat of use of chemical weapons is absolute. The events of 21 August outside Damascus are unacceptable. The dismantling and destruction of the Syrian arsenals  under the auspices of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security Council  must be immediate and unconditional. There can be no room for dilatory tactics or blackmail. Mexico supports the convening of the “Geneva II” international conference on Syria as soon as possible  with the goal of achieving lasting peace there.The challenges we face today compel us to seek a Security Council that is truly representative of the international community  without positions of privilege reserved for a few; a Council that is transparent and accountable; and a Council that acknowledges that a veto does not work in situations involving genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity.Mexico believes that disarmament should continue to be one of the key goals of the United Nations. In keeping with my country’s longstanding contributions to the cause of disarmament  in February 2014 in Nayarit  on Mexico’s Pacific coast  we will host the second Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons.Human security is also affected by the irresponsible use of  and illicit trafficking in  conventional weapons. Mexico therefore welcomes the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. Demonstrating great vision  the Mexican Senate has approved the Treaty  and I deposited our instrument of ratification yesterday. We will comply with it immediately  even before its entry into force worldwide. Mexico calls on all States to ratify the Treaty  which is a testament to the Organization’s ability to achieve common solutions to shared challenges. I also hope that the United Nations will show the same willingness to take on the fight against sexual violence as a weapon in conflict situations.Mexico is also acting responsibly in dealing with the global drug problem. Like Chile  Colombia and others  Mexico believes we should evaluate internationally agreed policies in the search for more effective responses based on a focus on health and a framework of respect for human rights and from a perspective of damage control. The goal must be the well-being of society in all its aspects. Along with Costa Rica  Paraguay and others  we believe we should give priority to prevention so as to reduce the impact on health and  in particular  the violence associated with drug problems. Similarly  it would be helpful to strengthen international cooperation so as to reduce the illegal flows of arms and money that fuel criminal networks. Along with Guatemala and others  we believe the new global strategy should be based on an open and inclusive debate leading up to the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome the Antigua Declaration issued at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States as a first step in the right direction towards the 2016 special session.The fight against organized crime must always respect the rule of law and human rights. When there is a risk or merely a possibility that the right to privacy of any citizen might be infringed by any Government  we have demanded that it be investigated and the parties responsible held accountable. In Mexico  the protection of personal data is a human right guaranteed by the Constitution.Mexico believes firmly in free trade and in building mechanisms that promote the free circulation of people  goods and capital. That is why we and Chile  Colombia and Peru formed the Pacific Alliance  which is organized in a spirit of openness and plurality  as the heterogeneity of its members with observer status reflects. Our only goal is for the Pacific Alliance to be an inclusive  useful tool for the promotion of prosperity for the citizens of our nations. That is also the spirit behind our work this year in the Association of Caribbean States.During this session of the Assembly we will begin the process of evaluating our achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and outlining a road map for the post-2015 agenda. The success of the Millennium Development Goals is rooted in focusing the actions of the international community on clear and ambitious targets. Despite that  it is important to acknowledge that painful inequality and a lack of participation and access to development still persist among the most vulnerable groups in highly industrialized countries  as well as developing ones. Poverty  inequality and social exclusion exacerbate conflicts and help to undermine the rule of law. The development agenda must be based on a commitment to inclusion. Policies that bring together mechanisms promoting development and openness to innovation  coupled with political determination on the part of the international community  will enable us to advance towards a world with opportunities for all.Inclusion should be a central premise in the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda  thus ensuring not only a narrowing of the poverty and inequality gaps but also active participation by society’s most vulnerable groups. That is why we will convene a meeting in Mexico to promote a global perspective on inclusion  in which Governments  civil society and United Nations agencies  funds and programmes will participate with the aim of defining the parameters of inclusion and its impact on development policies  so we can establish minimum thresholds for inclusion to which every human being is entitled. In that context  we acknowledge the high-level events being held within the framework of this session of the General Assembly — on persons with disabilities and on international migration and development. Full observance of the rights of such groups is an essential component of the post-2015 development agenda.Mexico is a multi-ethnic and multicultural nation that is proud of its 68 indigenous peoples. That is why we attach such importance to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples to be held in 2014  for which great event we will host a preparatory meeting.Our experience shows that to achieve the goal of inclusion  we must consider every dimension of poverty — lack of income and financial inclusion  nutrition  health  education  housing and basic services. Both through our national crusade against hunger and as a member of the Group of 20  Mexico has sought to place such deficiencies at the centre of the debate. The innovative feature of our national crusade against hunger lies in its focus on a multidimensional measurement of poverty and in the fact that it seeks to overcome the deficiencies thus measured in order to arrive at sustainable and structural ways of mitigating the conditions that lead to hunger.In the spirit of moving Mexico forward  we are undertaking transformative reforms for increasing access to quality education  telecommunication  the financial system and social security. Strengthening international support will be crucial to implementing the post-2015 development agenda. We must meet the international commitments on financing for development agreed on under the Monterrey Consensus and achieve coordinated  transparent cooperation with clear goals. That is why Mexico will host the first High-level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation next year. Central to the agenda for that forum will be the mobilization of domestic resources for development. Mexico therefore agrees with all measures that help prevent the erosion of our tax base and its migration to jurisdictions with low or no taxes.Today the world is coming closer together  because we have a greater global awareness. We are all affected by the suffering and challenges of other nations  wherever we are. Let us capitalize on that awareness in order to include those who are excluded and to extend a hand to those who have not had our opportunities. Let us do what is necessary to make our world a place where greater equality is a reality. President Enrique Peña Nieto wishes to leave no doubt as to his and Mexico’s commitment to a peaceful world  a world in which the best causes of humankind make headway  an inclusive world in which inequalities are reduced and extreme poverty is eradicated and a world in which economic growth produces prosperity for all. From this rostrum  Mexico declares its firmly held belief in its global responsibilities. "
"111",4574,"MHL",68,2013,"It is my honour to convey to the Assembly the warm greeting of “Yokwe” from the Government and people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.Every September  world leaders take to the stage of the General Assembly to broadcast our common concerns. But I am concerned that this poetic ritual too often hides the problem of political will. In January  the Secretary-General outlined two key political priorities for leaders: addressing climate change risks and the growing insecurity within Syria. As autumn sets in  it is evident that efforts are falling short. This year  leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum expressed strong concern about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Government and called for leadership on the part of the members of the Security Council to resolve that threat. While I am optimistic about recent diplomatic developments  the common international voice may come too little and too late for what could have already been prevented. That is only one example of a growing list of the tragic human costs of inaction. How many more mistakes will the world make in distant conference rooms? For how long can we turn a blind eye to realities and headlines?Pacific nations are now dedicated to changing the pace. This month  Pacific Islands Forum leaders adopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership. Although many of our States are small  the common responsibility to act falls on all Governments and persons  no matter how different we are. The Marshall Islands is well on track to achieve the complete solarization of our outer islands — a goal we are meeting with assistance from Japan’s Pacific Environment Community funds and from the European Union  Taiwan  Italy  France and other donor partners. The entire region is also aggressively cutting its emissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive. The message to our partners  the world’s largest emitters  is clear. If we can do it  they can too. Climate change is a risk that demands direct political ownership  and it is high time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific in showing the statesmanship so urgently needed. Simply repeating well-worn negotiation slogans has not got the world anywhere. It is time for new solutions. I strongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye at the Secretary-General’s climate summit next year. Never has the need for true statesmanship been as dire.Global efforts on climate change are falling short  and low-lying island nations  such as mine  are already paying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a global crisis. In every sense  the world must build for future risks  and we are still setting course based on current conditions  as is often the case. It is the seas that are rising — not the islands that are sinking. I will not concede my own land or my nation; nor will I rest until my fellow world leaders have signed on to act  not just out of economic convenience  but out of a common responsibility of all to strive for upward momentum.Our Pacific legacy is not as small island States  but as large ocean nations. We are stewards of what is a truly global resource — our oceans and fisheries. Even a casual glance at a map reveals a world of deep and vast blue  and not only scientists but our own local communities see change in our waters. Local and global ocean impacts affect not only every region  but also global food security. I join with other Pacific leaders in urging dedicated treatment of the oceans as a post-2015 United Nations sustainable development goal.Pacific nations  including the States parties to the Nauru Agreement  are leading the world in changing fishing practice. We are not only leading the world in advancing sustainable fisheries  but at the same time boosting our own economic growth. Perhaps no other effort or region is such a strong textbook example of sustainable development in action. But for all of the expressed plenary sympathies and common international responsibility  existing legal commitments to safeguard fisheries all too often fall victim to the short-term trade interests of our partners. We Pacific leaders will sacrifice neither our resources nor our growth or livelihood for quick returns; our future generations are not for sale. The threat of harmful fisheries sanctions from distant fishing nations — perhaps as punishment for our conservation efforts — is hardly a helping hand either to our regional development or to international food security.Next year’s international meeting on small island States and development partnerships  to be held in Samoa  will offer our political partners a moment for careful reflection. Is the global thirst for rare earth minerals beneath our waves and is the hunger for our vast fisheries so great as to outstrip our rightful economic development and our conservation efforts? Perhaps it is high time that island leaders set forward our island vision of partnership and collaborate accordingly. We cannot forge progress through political will alone. Here  Pacific Islands Forum leaders have forged a ground-breaking mutual dialogue to enhance and improve effective United Nations partnerships in our region. Those are not isolated words; already  the United Nations  together with our bilateral partners  is playing a valuable role in working with the Marshall Islands to recover from a climate-driven drought and other coastal flooding emergencies.But we need not wait for disasters. In every sector of basic development and environmental efforts  our door is open for increased collaboration among the United Nations  our regional resources and bilateral partners. The statements of sympathy in the plenary are all too often not translated into effective  island-tailored results. Our in-country United Nations presence still has a long way to go in truly delivering as one and better addressing pressing threats. I encourage a direct discussion between the United Nations and our region on practical efforts to enhance in-country effectiveness and collaboration. No one people or nation should be passed over.Even as the United Nations enters into a new discussion in setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  improved progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains no less a priority. I would also like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan has made in helping my country in efforts to achieve the MDGs.Pacific Islands Forum leaders have  for the first time  recognized the role of the United Nations in authorizing nuclear-weapon testing during the Cold War and welcomed the recommendations of the United Nations Special Rapporteur’s recent report (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1). Nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands is no mere historical event  but an international legacy that will stay with us for generations. While the bulk of the unmet responsibilities still rest with our historical Administering Power  the United States  the United Nations can  for its part  no longer ignore its own role during the Trusteeship era. I am strongly encouraged by the Secretary-General’s commitment to addressing the ongoing impacts of nuclear testing in the Pacific and look forward to practical steps in that regard.My Government is gratified to note that — with solid international support and cross-strait cooperation — the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will continue to encourage positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.Too often  despite our own aspirations  we struggle to move inches when urgency demands miles. We wish to inform the Secretary-General that our political will stands ready and that our hands are extended for a durable partnership."
"112",4598,"MKD",68,2013,"Allow me to begin by congratulating President Ashe on his election and wishing him great success in presiding over the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  on his successful presidency. I also thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in strengthening the United Nations ability to respond to today’s and tomorrow’s challenges.Each year in September  world leaders gather in New York to develop joint responses to challenges. That is a great challenge for all — national Governments  international and regional organizations  civil society and the private sector. We share the primary responsibility for a peaceful and secure world that ensures the rights and interests of individuals  nations and countries within the framework of the rule of national and international law. That was also the objective when the United Nations was established following the Second World War.We thank the President and the Secretary-General for their engagement and leadership in the work to establish the new post-2015 development framework  building upon the Millennium Development Goals to include an economic  social and ecological dimension of sustainable development. What is important for the post-2015 development agenda — an ambitious and complex project — is the building of a global partnership among Governments  the private sector  civil society and individuals  including the mobilization of institutional and human resources. The environment must be a key building block of sustainable development: it is nature that sustains us  and its resources should be used wisely. Economic growth facilitates human growth  reduces poverty and facilitates better education and health care and is thus a crucial element of any development framework. The Republic of Macedonia will fully contribute to the achievement of all global objectives through its national agenda  in which investment in education  health  agriculture and food  the environment and infrastructure and the partnership between the Government and the business community are the highest priorities.Peace  conflict resolution and human rights protection are United Nations goals. Today they represent an even a greater challenge  which we should respond to and overcome. The Republic of Macedonia supports the approach of the United Nations in responding to those challenges. We actively contribute to the promotion of peace on an international level  participating in international missions that safeguard freedom and democracy.With regard to one of the major issues — the crisis in Syria and the internal conflict that has created more than 100 000 victims and 2 million refugees — what is more troubling is that chemical weapons were used against the Syrian people while diplomatic efforts were under way  although their use is strictly prohibited under international law. That must not be tolerated. We are among the countries to have asked for an urgent investigation under the auspices of the Secretary-General’s mechanism for the investigation of the alleged use of chemical and biological weapons. Despite differing views  all member States of the Security Council and of the United Nations agree that to achieve a final resolution of the Syrian crisis  the political approach should be given a chance. It is therefore essential to focus maximum effort on revitalizing the search for a political settlement and to convene the “Geneva II” conference as soon as possible. The Syrian people deserve better days through decisive action by the international community that will end the violence and threats.The region of South-East Europe has entered a phase of positive development  and in general the national and regional primary objectives are either fulfilled or are within reach. Regional cooperation is expanding in a number of new fields. Despite such advances  certain long-standing unresolved or partly resolved bilateral issues are clearly having a negative impact on our present and immediate future. In the case of the Republic of Macedonia  that happens to be a serious obstacle to our agenda for integration into international organizations.The Republic of Macedonia is celebrating the twentieth anniversary of its United Nations membership with the still unresolved issues of the use of the name of my country  the Republic of Macedonia  and of the identity of my people  the Macedonian identity. Those questions emerged because of a dispute raised by our southern neighbour Greece  which opposes our name  which is our fundamental individual and collective right. The issue  which should have been promptly resolved among neighbours  partners and future allies  has lasted for 22 years. While being a very realistic problem for my people  this is an issue that I deeply believe is essentially hypothetical and does not have any basis in international law or in the United Nations acts. It is difficult  I would say even impossible  for someone to find a legal justification for such an objection.The fact that the overwhelming majority of countries have recognized our constitutional name — the Republic of Macedonia — with more than 135 of them being United Nations Members  clearly shows that most of countries do not believe that the dispute has a justified basis  or if it does they denounce it. I believe that this issue was a created one  a classic case of politicization and an instrument that  approximately 20 years ago  was either supposed to make someone score some political points or  by creating an atmosphere of conflict  to bring about some strategic regional shifts  as well as to slow down the spread of freedom  democracy and the introduction of market economies in the Balkans.At the last session  the General Assembly discussed the rule of law  with all Member States unanimously agreeing that respect for internationally agreed norms and principles was a must. Unfortunately  norms are not always adhered to. The United Nations must be neither idle in that regard nor renege from its responsibility to counter any disrespect for the rule of law.The Republic of Macedonia became a United Nations Member in 1993 with an atypical membership condition  namely  the denial of its constitutional name. It was admitted with an interim country reference — an unprecedented event in history that was contrary to the provisions of international law. But we have endured all that  although it lingers to date as a problem.In 1995  under United Nations mediation  we signed an interim accord with Greece by which we changed our flag and parts of our Constitution  while Greece undertook not to create obstacles to our NATO accession in 2008. Not only did Greece obstruct our act of accession to the international Organization itself  it also obstructed the processes for opening the membership procedures in another organization. For four years in a row  Greece has prevented the start of negotiations for our membership in the European Union. On the basis of our appeal concerning the obstructions of Greece with regard to our application for membership  in 2011 the International Court of Justice\ — a principal organ of the United Nations established by States Members and located at The Hague — issued a judgment that Greece had violated international law by not adhering to the interim accord and that the Republic of Macedonia had not violated international law or the commitments it had agreed to. However  we were hindered again  notwithstanding the decision of the highest body of justice in the world  and that is apparent to the Assembly and its member countries.The United Nations was established in order to protect international law. There is no regulation of international law that restricts a country from calling itself as it wishes  or restricts its citizens from being able to be called and named as they wish. Naming is one of the five prerogatives of States  as well as an undisputed right of every Member country.Why do we need international law if we do not adhere to it? If we turn a blind eye to that injustice and obvious violation of international law  we will be directly responsible for breaking one of the principles of world peace and of the United Nations. We do not want that  nor can we allow it. If it were not for international law  anarchy would reign and the United Nations would become a debate club without any basic competencies. We do not want to participate in that  at the expense of everything  even to our own detriment.Not respecting international law also means having no respect for the 50 million victims that fought for it 70 years ago  as well as going against the decisions of our predecessors — the founders of the Organization. International law should not be a platitude  but rather should provide a solution to every challenge.According to international law  the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to decide on its own name and to use the word Macedonian to denote its ethnic identity. Settling our differences with our southern neighbour is our priority  but only and precisely within the United Nations resolutions that define the solution that is the subject of discussion  and by reaching a mutually acceptable solution. We should settle our differences in no other way  especially not by expanding those limits.Sixty-six years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  this dispute  unjustly imposed on us by Greece  violates one of the fundamental rights of the individual — the right to decide one’s own name. Every representative of my people is denied the right to be called as they wish  as their mothers and fathers  grandparents and all other ancestors throughout history were called: Macedonian. In addition to disputing the constitutional name of my country — the Republic of Macedonia — Greece also disputes the identity of my citizens  that is  it does not allow them to be called Macedonians or the language that they speak to be called the Macedonian language  despite the fact that for more than half a century there have been departments in universities throughout the world where the Macedonian language has been studied and it has been called the Macedonian language. It is the same as if somebody denied an individual the right to speak French  German  Polish  English  Dutch  Portuguese  Japanese  Hindi or any other language. The United Nations must not overlook the violation of the basic human right to decide one’s own name  and should take action to enable the exercise of that right. In this particular case  the United Nations should take action that will lead to the settlement of the outstanding issues that Greece has with us.At the previous session  we debated preventive diplomacy and concluded that it should be an essential element of the international community. Therefore  the United Nations must not  and should not  stand aside in this process  which severely hinders Macedonia’s aspirations to a better future for its citizens. Commitment is necessary to make it possible for Greece to begin resolving this issue  because in the past two years there has been great inertness on the part of Greece. Although that is a result of objective reasons caused by its adverse economic situation  it also entails a strategic and tactical political element based on the analysis that prolonging the process of solving the dispute would contribute to the Republic of Macedonia being isolated in its positions  which are based on international law and values  and to its resignation to a kind of self-annihilation of the State and the nation by agreeing to be renamed. According to that line of thinking  with the lack of commitment in the discussions and the blocking of European and Euro-Atlantic integration that my country faces — integration that is directly hindered by the dispute despite our having met the standards required of us by the international multilateral organizations  NATO and the European Union — we would thus be prevented from joining and face the possibility of internal misunderstandings regarding the hindrance caused by our southern neighbour  and we would drop our guard in spite of the force of the arguments  which are on our side. It is true that by putting off the solution of the dispute  more challenges in the country and the region are created  and the tension becomes greater at certain moments. But it should be clear to everyone that such challenges should not be considered a trigger for any changes of our justified and internationally correct position that would lead to a change in our Macedonian identity. It is not possible to change something that has existed for centuries by imposing blockages or by threats about possible misunderstandings  tensions or unrest  not even by implementing them. The Macedonian people will never accept being renamed. If it is not possible for that issue to be resolved now — although we are the ones who are most interested in its resolution and we sincerely wish for a sustainable  balanced and  most important  mutually acceptable solution to be found — then some other generation in different circumstances will be able to resolve it  but precisely on the basis of the values  positions and principles that I mentioned before  which indicate a just and fair solution  without winners and losers. However  I personally believe that we must not leave those thorny issues to future generations. We must try to find a solution and find strength to provide prosperity for the countries and the region. It is said that actions speak solely of those who undertake them. Faced with the lack of interest by the Hellenic Republic in substantive talks for a solution to the dispute  two months ago I suggested to the Greek Prime Minister a change in the format of discussions  that is  raising them to a much higher political level. I as a Macedonian and he as a Greek Prime Minister  together with ministers from both Governments  would meet directly and talk about a solution. That would lead to greater efficiency  because we are the ones most often called upon to solve the issue. Twenty-two years is too much time to not get anywhere and is sufficient proof that there must be a change in the game. Our mandate  entrusted to us by the citizens  should be essential to achieving a mutually acceptable solution — which I believe can be attained — a solution that will be accepted and agreed upon by the citizens of our countries. The examples of Serbia and Kosovo  as well as those of Croatia and Slovenia  where political representatives at the highest level managed to overcome challenges  are the best proof that results can be achieved in that way. I invite the Assembly to directly take part in the realization of this initiative  overcome the standstill and  through its commitment  provide intensity and forward movement  as well as greater interest on the part of Greece in a solution and progress. Actions speak of the one who undertakes them. With our openness and with our justified initiative  we are showing that we wish for a solution to be found. However  our meetings must not be purely a formality; rather  they must have substance and must not create an alibi for not finding a solution. I am convinced that only a substantial commitment by the international community  above all by the United Nations  will lead to a solution  taking into consideration the basic documents of the United Nations on the rights of countries and individuals  the United Nations resolutions that defined the talks  agreements guaranteed by the United Nations  the decisions of United Nations bodies and international law as a whole.However  if there is no progress  the United Nations must not remain inactive and be satisfied with the status quo  as that would mean showing further irresponsibility. Aware of this already discouraging situation  the United Nations should help via its organs  through the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is on the basis of Security Council resolution 817 (1993) that we are in discussions with our neighbour to arrive at a solution that will free the identity of my country. Otherwise  the United Nations will be faced with failure again and will bear the responsibility for not having acted in accordance with its own principles and values. I do not want to spare anyone. We all have responsibility  including the Organization. Instead of assuming that responsibility  the Organization has accepted the comfort of remaining silent and not resolving the dispute; instead of defending itself  it has remained inactive with regard to the status quo  which is obviously creating problems and challenges for the region. It should start considering alternative scenarios and doing more to stimulate a solution to this long-standing dispute.I am confident that we have the capacity to jointly respond to the challenges. In the name of the people that we represent  we must assume responsibility for the present and the future. Assuming such responsibility means taking decisions  changing habits and reinforcing cooperation and prosperity  but it is something that can be done. That is the responsible way to proceed."
"113",4642,"MLI",68,2013,"Allow me at the outset to convey to President Ashe the heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Mali on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His election is quite clearly a recognition of his qualities as a seasoned diplomat  as well as a tribute to his country  Antigua and Barbuda. He may be assured of the full readiness of my delegation to work to ensure the successful outcome of our efforts.I should like to take this opportunity also to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia  for the outstanding manner in which he led the work of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Allow me also to reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  our deepest appreciation for the praiseworthy efforts he has made to achieve the lofty objectives of our Organization.A few weeks after my accession to Mali’s highest office as the third elected President of the Republic since the advent of democracy  it is for me a badge of honour to address the Assembly.At the outset  let me assure the Assembly of my unshakeable determination to defend the ideals of our Organization  which are based on the values of peace  security  justice and development  all values contained in the oath that I swore to the people of Mali.I come here before the Assembly to express the gratitude of my people to the whole of the international community for the invaluable support it showed to my country  Mali  which today has recovered its sovereignty over the whole of its territory. From this lofty rostrum  and on behalf of all the people of Mali  I pay tribute to the work of the United Nations  and especially to the Security Council  which through four resolutions and a number of statements condemned the jihadist terrorist aggression suffered by my country and reaffirmed its attachment to the unity and territorial integrity of my country. The Council authorized the deployment of international forces to assist the armed forces of Mali in the difficult task of recovering the areas of its territory that were controlled by terrorist groups.Allow me to convey my gratitude to UNESCO for formally condemning the destruction of the global heritage sites and mausoleums in Timbuktu and Gao. At that time  Morocco was President of the Security Council. I would therefore like to thank His Majesty King Mohammed VI for the very significant contributions made by the Kingdom of Morocco  which right from the start of the occupation of Mali condemned the act of aggression to which we had fallen victim  and offered our people emergency humanitarian assistance. This is also the right time and place to thank France and its President  François Hollande  for launching Operation Serval  a life-saving operation  that halted the advance of jihadists towards the south of Mali. Had it not been for that intervention  I would not be standing here before the Assembly today.Allow me to also convey my gratitude to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the African Union and to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation for their concern and continuing commitment to seeking a lasting solution to the Malian crisis. In particular  I would like to commend the leadership of Mr. Alassane Ouattara  President of the Republic of Côte D’Ivoire and current President of ECOWAS  for his ongoing commitment to supporting the Malian people. I also thank President Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso  mediator during the Malian crisis  as well as Mr. Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria  co-mediator during the crisis  for their ongoing efforts aimed at finding a solution to the crisis that struck our country. We also thank President Boni Yayi of Benin  who during his mandate as head of the African Union devoted all his energy to resolving the Malian crisis.I would also like to thank the President of Chad  our brother Idriss Deby Itno. His country deployed 2 000 men in Mali  many of whom died. Our thoughts and sympathy are with all the sons and daughters of Chad who died in Mali. They sacrificed their lives for Mali. I would also like to pay tribute to President Mahamadou Issoufou and the brave people of the Niger for extending a fraternal welcome to our people  which eased a great deal of suffering. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay my respects to the memory of all of our Nigerien brothers who died in the battlefields during savage attacks on Agadez and Arlit in the Niger.I also pay tribute to the President of Algeria  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  and to our brothers the people of Algeria  who have always stood by Mali. There is a long-standing history of friendship between our peoples  something that was confirmed again when Algeria recently helped Mali during the humanitarian crisis. I would like to take this opportunity to state that Algeria and Mali are two brotherly States. They are linked by a solid friendship and a shared history.To the people of Mauritania and President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  I would like to express my gratitude for their troops  who stood by us in our pursuit of the jihadists who ran amok in the north of Mali for so long. To Mauritania  which has also been in mourning because of jihadist attacks  I would also like to extend our heartfelt condolences and our sympathy to those who perished fighting for our country. Many of our Mauritanian friends and brothers died in the Timbuktu region.Finally  to the European Union and all bilateral and multilateral partners  I would like to say that the people of Mali are grateful for the wonderful international mobilization to help our country  which enabled us to overcome the crisis  making it possible for me to stand here today. I also believe that the restoration of peace in Mali today allows us to look to the future in a calm  reasonable and confident way. Furthermore  I would like to assure them that the fight against drug traffickers and jihadists  in all their guises  is an ongoing struggle  one to which we are committed. I thank you very much for standing by us in this continuing fight.I would like to extend my heartfelt thoughts to all those friends of Mali who perished on the battlefields to safeguard the future of our country and the future of our children. There were many heroes  anonymous civilians  men and women alike  who suffered in Mali. Our thoughts are with all the injured  the women who were raped  those who were maimed  those who suffered under the yoke of barbarity  enduring endless months of suffering yet remaining steadfast  standing up for Mali despite all the intimidation rained down upon them.It would be heartless of me to move on without a thought of compassion for all the families of the Algerian  French and other hostages still held by jihadist groups in the Sahel region  including northern Mali. I can assure the Assembly that we will spare no effort in working to speed up their release  in close cooperation with the States concerned  of course.Mali is back. Yes indeed  with the support of friendly States  Mali stands tall  ready to turn a page on the darkest periods of its history  one marked by nine months of grave human rights violations  looting  the destruction of unique historical and cultural monuments and sites  and its cultural heritage. Mali has recovered its sovereignty and national integrity  backed by its cultural diversity  and now is setting off on the path towards national reconciliation.A process of dialogue for peace and national reconciliation has been launched through the preliminary Ouagadougou Agreement signed on 18 June. The transition  which was launched in March 2012  following the coup d’état  ended last August  following presidential elections that were deemed credible and transparent by the entire international community. Through that exemplary election process  Malians recalled and demonstrated their commitment to democracy and constitutional order. To finalize that process  my Government has made a commitment to holding  without any further delays  the first round of legislative elections on 24 November and the second round on 15 December.As a President who enjoys the trust and confidence of the Malian people  I understand the huge scope of the challenges. Malians have a deep-seated yearning for peace and national reconciliation  as well as economic and social development. As soon as I became President  I took the initiative to meet with the heads of armed groups from the north of the country in Bamako to remind them of the sacrosanct principles of respect for the territorial integrity of Mali and the secular nature of our State. I made them aware of our readiness to organize candid  inclusive political dialogue where everything  except for any form of independence or autonomy  could be discussed openly. Our message has been heard  and we will commit to dialogue in the future in order to find a lasting solution to the crisis in northern Mali.At this point  we would like to revive the inter- and intracommunitarian dialogue to recreate conditions conducive to enabling all Malians to live together. A general meeting for decentralization will be convened to create the conditions necessary for an effective transfer of governance and resources to local authorities throughout the country. Thereafter  the Government will hold a national review conference on the north of Mali.In preparing for future decisions with the armed groups and in order to create the conditions for pacifying the situation  confidence-building measures have been taken  as called for in the preliminary Ouagadougou Agreement. In that connection  it is hard to understand why the rebel elements have decided to suspend negotiations  which represents a flagrant violation of the Agreement. We will have to discuss that. In that regard  the Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission will be turned into a commission for dialogue on truth and reconciliation to deal with the remaining wounds of war within Malian society.The cyclical crisis in the northern regions of Mali is rooted in the precarious living conditions of the local population and poverty. I established the Ministry for National Reconciliation and Development of the Northern Regions upon my arrival at the helm in order to accelerate development in the areas of health  education and infrastructure.I am pleased to note that the international community has understood what is at stake  and I take this opportunity to express my deep-seated and heartfelt gratitude to all the friends of Mali who committed themselves on 15 May  in a wonderful show of exceptional solidarity to backing the implementation of the plan for the sus tainable economic recovery of Mali.With the support of the international community  Mali is working resolutely to address peacebuilding  national reconciliation and the reform of the national defence and security forces  to rebuild the northern regions devastated by the terrorist and jihadist forces  to improve institutional governance and to launch the economic recovery of our country. Within the framework of good governance  pride of place has been given to our national justice system. After the Prime Minister  the Minister of Justice is the most senior Minister in my Government  which clearly shows our dedication to turning Mali into a State where the rule of law truly prevails.Mali has come a long way  but it has arrived. It is here and it wishes to play its full role. However  the situation that our country is facing  I must say  is symptomatic of the challenges that all the countries of the Sahel region are facing  including the worst possible forms of transnational organized crime  including trafficking in drugs  human beings and weapons of all kinds  of which some very sophisticated types have come from the Libyan arsenals since the fall of the Al-Qadhafi regime. Despite the hope raised following the successful military operations through the combined efforts of Operation Serval  the troops of the African-led International Support Mission in Mali  now the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali  and Malian armed security forces  small armed terrorist groups continue to make themselves felt in our subregion and to move from one territory to another — we know that they are present in the southern territory of one of our neighbours — which represents for us and the international community a serious threat to the stability and territorial integrity of Mali and to peace and security in the Sahel region as a whole.It is in that context that the United Nations Mission for the stabilization of Mali was deployed. That Mission was successful  and we wish to congratulate the United Nations  especially the Security Council  for that outstanding initiative.Our country stands at a crossroads. Just a few months ago  no one could have thought that I would stand in this Hall before the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to working unstintingly for the implementation of the United Nations strategy for the Sahel region. We familiarized ourselves with the strategy yesterday at a high-level summit on the situation in the Sahel. As a result of the complexity and seriousness of the situation in the Sahel  my delegation welcomes the report presented in June by Mr. Romano Prodi  Special Envoy of the Secretary- General (S/2013/354)  which we believe accurately reflects the regional dimension and should enable us to extricate ourselves from the situation prevailing throughout our country.This is the right time for me to forcefully underscore that finding a lasting solution to the Sahel crisis will require a strengthened and dynamic cooperation between all the States in the Sahel and Saharan regions to fight against religious extremism and organized crime. Under my leadership  Mali is determined to work to give a new impetus to the subregional cooperation mechanisms that we have. In that regard  the assistance of the international community will be indispensable in the fight against transnational terrorism in the Sahel region as a whole.The stakes are high and the terrorist threat is of alarming proportions  to the point that no country is safe from violent and barbarous acts. The attacks that took place in Nairobi  Kenya  are the most painful examples of that. My country  which is slowly recovering from the atrocities carried out by jihadist terrorist groups and the allied drug trafficking groups  reiterates its firm condemnation of terrorism of all stripes and in all its manifestations. On behalf of Mali  I present my most deep-seated and heartfelt condolences to the Government and the people of our brother country  Kenya.The delegation of Mali is particularly gratified by the central theme of the general debate of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The relevance of that theme lies in the uncertainties being faced by the world today  uncertainties resulting from economic and financial instability at the international level  from an accentuation of the scourge of poverty  the continued deterioration of the environment and the increase in the number of natural disasters. Just a few months ago  we suffered flooding that claimed at least 50 lives in my country alone.Indeed  10 years after the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the Heads of State and Government gathered here at the General Assembly in September 2010 in the framework of a mid-term review and expressed their serious concerns about the insufficient results. It is clear at this point that the path to be travelled to achieve the MDGs remains a lengthy one. In that regard  it is crucial that we cast a critical glance at the shortcomings noted in order to pave the way for sustainable development.One shortcoming of the MDG programme that caught our attention was the lack of commitment regarding MDG 8  on the setting up a global partnership for development. Without setting up open and equitable financial and trade systems that would respect the promises made to least developed countries  small island States and landlocked States — our Samoan colleague has just referred to that — and faced with a shortfall of assistance to those countries  we run the risk of failing. Faced with that situation  Mali encourages the adoption of a unique consolidated development programme for the post-2015 period whose priority objective will  in the long run  be the eradication of poverty and the promotion of economic  social and environmental sustainability. That is a vision that has resulted from the pressing nature of the challenges and the shortage of resources available to deal with them.In line with my predecessors  I would like to reaffirm here and now my firm determination to defend the ideals of peace  security and justice that mark the Organization. In Africa  Mali is extremely concerned about the situation in the Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Egypt and Libya  and expresses its firm condemnation of violence as a means of political expression. Mali welcomes the progress achieved on the path of reconstruction and national reconciliation in Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.With respect to the Middle East  we remain concerned by the ongoing deadly violence in Syria  with its daily lot of humanitarian disasters. Accordingly  we condemn with the utmost firmness the use of chemical weapons in the country. Mali urges all parties to favour negotiated political solutions under the auspices of the United Nations.We encourage the Israeli-Palestinian talks currently under way and urge all parties to take the steps necessary to establish a climate of trust and launch direct negotiations to achieve a just  comprehensive and lasting peace based  in particular  on the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. I take this opportunity to reiterate the solidarity and full support of the people and the Government of Mali for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for the exercise of their inalienable right to sovereignty.I welcome the measures taken in recent years by the United Nations to bring about qualitative changes in the priority fields of development  peace and collective security  as well as human rights  and to reform the Organization. Despite the progress achieved  much remains to be done  especially concerning the necessary reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly. We must continue our efforts to ensure that the General Assembly  the main deliberative organ of the Organization  occupies a central position  with the means to implement its resolutions.Turning now to the reform of the Security Council  Mali reiterates its commitment to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration adopted by the heads of State and Government of the African Union  and supports the legitimate demands by Africa to have two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council.The Security Council thus reformed would better reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s world and would repair the “historical injustice” done to Africa  the only region of the world that does not have a permanent seat on the Council.Mali is back. Mali now takes back its place  its rightful place in keeping with its rich history  in the community of free and democratic States. The Malian people stand ready to take part  to play a full-fledged role in building a world of peace  tolerance  freedom  justice and democracy. Malians remain convinced that it is along that path that we  the leaders of the world  will lay the milestones of sustainable development for our peoples and will spare present and future generations the scourge of war. That is our mission and  God willing  we will accomplish it."
"114",4685,"MLT",68,2013,"I wish to join other delegations at this gathering in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am sure that under your guidance and through your excellent diplomatic skills we will have a rich exchange of ideas and a fruitful outcome. I also wish to extend my congratulations and gratitude to your predecessor  Vuk Jeremi.  for his successful stewardship of the previous session of the General Assembly. My deepest appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  whose passion and commitment have been instrumental in the work of the organization.I will start by taking the Assembly back a few years. All here will certainly remember how not too long ago the world waited in anticipation and hope for the clock to push past midnight to the year 2000. As with most fresh starts  the new millennium brought with it a sense of promise and  indeed  something extraordinary was taking place.For the first time in history  Governments had committed themselves to “walk the talk” by adhering to a set of measurable targets aimed at lifting millions out of poverty by the year 2015. The so-called Millennium Development Goals were bold and ambitious. They became national and global priorities  setting Government policies and generating a strong commitment across wide areas towards their attainment. Failure  it was felt  was not an option.Undoubtedly  there have been remarkable successes. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen  as have poverty rates. Access to sources of clean water has improved. The proportion of urban slum dwellers has declined substantially  and there has been visible improvement in the areas of health and education.Yet  as significant as those achievements are  we are now at a watershed moment. The international community has already recognized the need to push the Goals further  beyond 2015  and to see that they become sustainable development goals. An important stock-taking exercise has been taking place so as to ensure that no one is left behind  that no human being feels merely like a scrap of life  living at the edge of existence.It would be easy for us to think of poverty as belonging elsewhere  if we did not see it all around us. We have the luxury of exercising wilful blindness to malnutrition and disease  pretending that they belong to a different culture  to a different nationality  to a fictitious world that is wiped away as easily as flipping a television channel. It would also be easy for us to think that we can be altruistic  since we are lucky enough to live without want. But we are not here today to be blind. What brings us together at the General Assembly  year after year  to hear speech after speech  is a longing to belong. We want to be part of something bigger  something that goes beyond our self-imposed borders of language  culture and tradition. We want to belong to that global sea of peoples sharing a single purpose. That longing or need to come together tugs at our hearts with hope and empathy for those at the margins of humankind. We want to do something worthwhile. We want to commit our intelligence to being effective agents of change. “Make poverty history ” we once heard  and indeed we have worked towards that aim. But  as we hold those noble aims high  we also question whether our plan is a priority  whether it will fit within our national budget or our political life cycles. And then we pause to consider our options  to choose what will hurt us the least. The poor do not have the luxury of granting us time to take our decisions. Humankind cannot wait for a better time  when there is no financial crisis. We  the international community  need to forge ahead with determination to reach all our goals. I am proud to note today Malta’s long-standing history of solidarity with other nations all over the world. Our accession to the European Union took that solidarity a step further  and my country assumed responsibilities and obligations in the context of providing overseas development assistance to developing countries. That remains a cornerstone of Malta’s international relations  and we remain firmly engaged in seeking the eradication of poverty and the sustainable development of societies in need. We are proud to form part of the European Union  which is the world’s largest donor of development aid  and we are committed to reaching the goals that we have set and to being a reliable partner for those in need.I am equally proud to recall that this year marks the twenty-fifth year since Malta proposed to the General Assembly that climate conservation should be part of humankind’s shared concerns  a concept that launched the process leading to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Malta is proud to have been at the forefront of that discussion. We are adamant about keeping the issue alive  for we are conscious of the fact that climate change hits hardest the world’s most vulnerable.In defining a common vision for the future  we believe that the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development must be at the heart of the post-2015 development framework. In the words of the former President of South Africa  Mr. Nelson Mandela  “[o]vercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid  poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.” Malta is committed to continuing to engage with its international partners in developing a post-2015 global development agenda that delivers on the promise of a better and fairer world for all.Malta also understands the need to act in other very tangible ways. When rickety boats laden with irregular migrants reach our shores  which happens each and every day  we see the suffering  we feel the loss of dignity etched on people’s faces. We understand that they are caught in a web of poverty and criminal exploitation. We feel for those fleeing persecution and poverty. They are desperately searching for safety and prosperity. We do everything we can to provide them with the help they need  offering refuge and respite.Yet Malta cannot do that alone. The international community must do more in the face of an ongoing situation that is nothing but tragic evidence of our global failures. It would be easy to flip channels once again  to “park it in someone else’s back yard”. But it is not someone else’s problem. Irregular immigration  human trafficking and modern-day slavery are everyone’s problem. We all have to play a part in solving it  not only regionally but also globally.There needs to be a sustained evolution in our thinking. At the threshold of the year 2015  we urge fellow nations not only to think beyond the current Millennium Development Goals and how to ensure their sustainability  but also to think of other goals that could be included. There can be no unfinished business. There can be no sustainable development goals without peace  without fighting corruption  without respect for human rights and without economic equality  which is the social justice issue of our time. The news headlines may not shock us anymore  but those living in fear of losing their lives and those of their families do not live in order to make news. They look to survive. Whether scrapping for food or seeking shelter from bullets  whether hiding their daughters to prevent them from falling victim to rape as a tool of war or keeping sons from being forcibly recruited as child soldiers  millions of people all over the world live dreading tomorrow. Each day they die a little bit more.We bear responsibility for not safeguarding their sense of belonging as equal human beings on this planet. Malta firmly believes that the United Nations can and must do more to safeguard human dignity and stir the conscience of humankind. No undertaking can be as fundamental as addressing the needs of the peoples of the world  and no organization is better situated to see that that can be done than the United Nations.Malta’s geostrategic location makes it look most closely at that which surrounds it. We are proud to be a people of the sea  of a Mediterranean Sea that has given us life and marked our history. We are proud of our contributions towards the health of that sea  the many exchanges that we support and the good relations we maintain with all our neighbours  North and South. But we are also troubled by the conflicts and suffering that we see around us. Waves of new tomorrows and hopeful struggles for democracy in North Africa have given way to new realities that were unthinkable when the Millennium Development Goals were drawn up. Sectarian strife  religious tensions and power struggles have halted or reversed the progress of development. It is almost correct to say that the Mediterranean Sea is at a boiling point and that the next conflict — one over scarce resources  contested borders or even cultural offences — is just waiting to happen. But there can be no stalemate or acceptance of the status quo if we truly believe that the peoples of the Mediterranean deserve better. No violations of human rights or shaky institutions can be accepted if we are to look truly holistically at a new positive agenda for humankind. The deepening links between the lives of peoples across countries demand coordinated global action. We must face that challenge.Malta firmly believes that more can be done by the community of nations gathered here to support the fragile democracies that are struggling to take root where dictators formerly ruled. More can and should be done to ensure that the economies of the region are able to flourish  that intraregional trade is supported and that cultural exchanges are fostered. More needs to be done to stop the violence and bloodshed that risk becoming the norm for those of us who see the evolution of events.Malta calls upon the international community to look with compassion on the innocents in Syria. That is a humanitarian catastrophe with no end in sight — a horrendous and indiscriminate tragedy. Each child’s death and each mother’s wail should shame us all. People are morally outraged around the world  and justifiably outraged  for there can never be any justification for the appalling suffering that is taking place. The Mediterranean Sea basin remains awash with promise but polluted with pain and prejudice. The Middle East remains a hate-filled maelstrom and the most explosive region in the world. How many more need to die  not just in that region but everywhere else because of conflict and terrorism? How many more need to leave all their belongings to join hurried convoys  fearful of losing their lives? How much longer can the rights of others be ignored and trampled upon while others enjoy their perceived rights? We need to stop that wildfire. We need to stop the further descent into brutality and carnage. Those responsible must be brought to international justice.Malta is convinced that we cannot start talking of a post-2015 agenda if we cannot solve our differences today. We do not have a carte blanche privilege to be immune and indifferent  for the cost of our inaction is greater than the cost of our effort and commitment. Conflict saps the focus from our goals. It drains our resources and stifles our potential. The United Nations family  committed as it is to the purposes of peace and prosperity among nations  understands that. Malta firmly believes that true peace in our time needs to be the overriding goal  the one target to which we should all aspire and for which we should all work. We need to ensure stable and peaceful societies if we want to take the Millennium Development Goals further. The opportunities for all to thrive are at hand. The United Nations is and should be the force field to which all nations gravitate in order to solve differences and push boundaries together. Our global goals and commitments cannot be solely time-bound but must also be outcome-oriented. We need to think inclusively and holistically. Post-2015  we should not be looking towards rebooting  but towards continuity with greater purpose and greater ambition. Fewer people dying every day is a great achievement  but more people truly living is an astounding victory for all.However  to get there we have to realize that everyone has an equal voice. People need to be involved in decision-making  since it affects their lives and their livelihoods. They should be foremost in our minds as we consider the world’s natural resources and tackle global concerns such as climate change. There is never only one way of doing things. We can achieve our targets only if we listen to the people whom we are meant to represent and make them part of the decision-making process.A few weeks ago  a young girl  Malala  from Pakistan  spoke in this very Hall of her dream for girls to get an education and wield the power of the pen. Yesterday  at a gathering I attended  she said that everyone should send books  not bombs. Thirteen years ago  our leaders had a dream: to live up to the millennium moment and to better peoples’ lives. As we approach the year 2015  we need to remember the hope and determination we felt as we crossed into the new millennium  that determination to make the world a somewhat better place through the goals we reach together. We need to carry that forward and continue to make dreams happen. Every day  millions of people around the world dream of something more than a scrap of a life. Indeed  there are no scraps of life."
"115",4731,"MMR",68,2013,"At the outset  I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Myanmar delegation. I am confident that your diplomatic skills and vast knowledge will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I should also like to pay special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for a job well done in guiding the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly.We are fast approaching the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals. With fewer than 850 days to go  there is now a sense of urgency to look back on our past journey and chart the way forward. Despite the laudable advances made in meeting several of the global Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in the past 13 years  there remain inequality and variations in achievement across regions and within countries. Therefore  we need to intensify our efforts and accelerate actions towards the full realization of the MDGs in the remaining short span of time.In many developing countries  especially the least developed ones  a large proportion of the population is still grappling with poverty  hunger  economic and social disparity  and environmental degradation. It is therefore most pertinent and timely for the United Nations to set the post-2015 development agenda. For its part  Myanmar has been exerting relentless efforts to raise the socioeconomic conditions of its people  with poverty alleviation as the core priority of the national economic strategy  commensurate with the MDGs.My delegation adds its voice to that of the Group of 77 in calls to address the key implementation gaps of the MDGs and the poverty agenda over the next two years. In this regard  national efforts should be assisted by international support and an enabling environment. The role of the global partnership for development must also be strengthened. Achieving inclusive and sustainable development will be one of the most paramount challenges of this century for the United Nations. Therefore my delegation welcomes the establishment by the General Assembly of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.This year  Myanmar celebrates the sixty-fourth anniversary of its membership in the family of the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations system remains relevant and important in the current international situation. In this age fraught with global challenges  the United Nations is more essential than ever. We have trust in the world body’s capacity and capability to maintain international peace and security  to safeguard fundamental human rights  and to promote economic and social development. Therefore  Myanmar has always cooperated with the United Nations in good faith.As cooperation with the United Nations is the cornerstone of our foreign policy  we have always strictly abided by the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations should be more democratic  representative and effective in order to face the security and economic challenges in many parts of the world.The continued existence of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  poses the greatest threat to humankind. Myanmar is therefore actively pursuing the cause of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in international forums. One testimony of our aspiration is demonstrated by the annual resolution on nuclear disarmament that our delegation has submitted since 1995. Through that resolution we have been calling on nuclear-weapon States to cease immediately the qualitative improvement  development  production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons with a view to taking measures leading to their total elimination within a specified framework of time.In that firm belief  the Government of Myanmar signed the additional protocol to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 17 September. That is yet another significant development testifying to our commitment to the goals of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.Myanmar fully subscribes to the fundamental principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Accordingly  Myanmar has been contributing its fair share to regional and international peace and security.On the domestic front  the Government of President U Thein Sein has been undertaking unprecedented wide-ranging political and economic reforms over the past two and a half years. The Government has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling the twin objectives inspired by the people: to establish peace  stability and the rule of law  and to advance socioeconomic development of the lives of the people.The first component of the reform was political transformation. The objective was to bring about peace  stability  national unity and reconciliation. Now we have been able to establish a firm foundation for building a democratic society. Political space has been created for every stakeholder  and the all-inclusive political system is in place. The legislative bodies are also functioning well  in an active and vibrant manner. Numerous pieces of legislation have been enacted to the benefit of the people  including new laws permitting greater freedom of the press  speech and association. A series of amnesties have been granted which have set free thousands of prisoners. We are speedily working through a screening mechanism to ensure that no prisoner of conscience will remain in prison by the end of the year.The emergence of civil societies has also contributed to strengthening democratic values and practices. We have now been able to nurture a new culture of dialogue and accommodation among people of differing views and beliefs. We are also taking steps to establish the rule of law  good governance and clean government.We have also made tangible progress in our efforts towards national reconciliation. The Government’s peace overtures have led to ceasefire agreements with all armed groups  for the first time in more than 60 years. We hope that we will be able to celebrate the signing of a nationwide ceasefire agreement in Nay Pyi Taw very soon. We are optimistic that we will be able to start a new round of political dialogue at the Union central level in the near future to strike a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement. We have no illusion that the next step will be easy  but we are determined to pursue this path for the sake of our people  as they have for so long deserved.The hard-won peace and the success of the democratic transformation will not be realistic or sustainable until and unless we deliver on the economic and social needs of the people. Therefore  as the second component of reform  we have opened up the economy through economic liberalization  financial reform  inviting foreign investment  a people-centred development approach  rural development  poverty alleviation and equitable development. We have also created an investor-friendly environment. The Government is focusing on poverty alleviation and rural development. We have aimed at reducing the current poverty rate from 26 per cent to 16 per cent by 2015  as prescribed in the Millennium Development Goals.Recently  the Government turned its focus to private-sector development as another wave of reform. At this stage  the Government is strongly emphasizing the improvement of the institutional infrastructure and regulatory framework so as to facilitate business  trade and investment.We are truly grateful to the international community for its invaluable support and encouragement in our democratic transition as well as in our efforts for the socioeconomic development of the people of Myanmar. We welcome responsible trade and investment that will transfer technology to develop our economy  to create jobs and to lift our people from poverty. We are now taking the necessary steps to become a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We will try our best to ensure that no one from the communities or our national ethnic groups will be left behind and excluded from enjoying the fruits of our reforms and the exciting life of the nation.Myanmar is a multiracial and multifaith nation. Various ethnic populations with the world’s four great religions — Buddhists  Christians  Muslims and Hindus — have been living side by side in peace and harmony as fellow citizens of Myanmar. The Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar also designates the four religions as officially recognized faiths of the country. There are always people who wish to rock the boat. We will not let anyone take advantage of political openness to instigate violence among the different ethnic or religious communities. President U Thein Sein has clearly stated that the Government will take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone fuelling ethnic hatred.The Government has been making serious efforts to resolve the problem through short-term and long-term plans. These include our extensive efforts  in cooperation with the United Nations and humanitarian non-governmental organizations  to improve the living conditions and livelihoods of all affected peoples  without discrimination. Parallel with these efforts  the Government is also encouraging interfaith dialogues across the country with a view to promoting understanding and trust among the different communities. In addition  the National Human Rights Commission  an independent human rights body of Myanmar  has also been working closely and intensively with domestic civil society organizations  interfaith groups and regional and international human rights bodies for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country.Our reform process is still nascent and at a sensitive stage where there is little room for error. With this in mind  the President has publicly emphasized the need for everyone to refrain from doing anything that could jeopardize Myanmar’s peaceful transition. While undertaking political and other reform processes domestically  we have also been able to reach out to the international community. The overwhelming support that we have received from the international community and the United Nations has contributed significantly to the transition efforts in the country.Myanmar is ready to take over the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2014 for the very first time since the country joined the Organization in 1997. We regard this opportunity as a great honour. We shall be working closely with our fellow ASEAN members and with ASEAN dialogue partners in discharging this important responsibility so as to move forward in unity to a peaceful and prosperous community.In the process of Myanmar’s transition to democracy  expectations are high within the country as well as in the international community. For the Government and the people of Myanmar  the task is daunting. There are many challenges ahead. We are still in a critical transition period. However  we are resolute in marching forward along our chosen path. There will be no turning back. But we will not take anything for granted. It is incumbent upon the Government and people of Myanmar to be vigilant at all times so that we do not fall into the trap of the detractors of the reform process.We need the continued support and encouragement of the international community. We always welcome friendly and constructive advice and the helping hands of friends far and near in our nation-building process. However  we are fully cognizant of the fact that ultimately the people Myanmar themselves are responsible for deciding their own destiny and shaping their own future.The Government of President U Thein Sein is laying a solid foundation for democracy  peace and development for the people of Myanmar. Observers have applauded Myanmar’s transition to democracy as one of the most promising efforts of democratization in the world today. The success we have achieved so far on the road to democracy has been made possible through the joint efforts of the leadership and the people of Myanmar  driven by a strong and genuine desire to change.The road ahead is long and full of challenges. We will spare no effort to overcome any challenges and move ahead on the journey on which we have set out to build a nation of peace  democracy and prosperity. As we continue our journey we need the understanding  continued encouragement and support of the United Nations and the international community. We will never lose sight of our goals  and we are determined to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Myanmar."
"116",4742,"MNE",68,2013,"It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly today on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and its Charter.I wish to congratulate President Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to express the full support of the Montenegrin delegation to him personally and for the programme he has put forward. I wish also to extend my gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  our neighbour  for his energetic efforts and leadership  which contributed to dynamic and constructive discussions on various issues on the United Nations agenda. It is a special pleasure for me to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts to build a safer and more prosperous world.The numerous challenges that the United Nations is currently facing are far more complex than previous ones. Those challenges are such that all of us have to ensure  through joint efforts  coordinated and efficient action to overcome them. That is our moral  collective obligation towards the well-being of future generations.The challenge of achieving sustainable development and integrating its three dimensions is the greatest of them all. It is encouraging that the General Assembly  bound by the Rio outcome document (resolution 66/288  annex)  is successfully addressing this priority. With the establishment of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing and the High-level Political Forum  the institutional framework as a platform for substantive work has been strengthened.In that context  the role of the United Nations and the results of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are becoming more important than ever. I am certain that the United Nations  guided by the synergy and pragmatic approach of its Members and all stakeholders  will be able to respond to that highly complex challenge. Such an approach will contribute to our well-being and a safer future for all of us  further strengthening the central role of the United Nations in the system of global governance. To that end  poverty eradication and the other unmet MDGs must remain at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda. We must define future sustainable development goals on the basis of the experience and lessons learned from our success or failure in accomplishing the tasks set by the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Montenegro is working diligently on the MDGs and is close to meeting them.Our sustainable development goals must be clear  universal  flexible and coherent  and represent a central part of the post-2015 global development agenda. They must clearly reflect political commitment to sustainable development and promote economic development  social inclusion  the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of the environment as well peace and security. As a member of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  Montenegro is working assiduously to define those goals  taking into consideration national characteristics and capacities and individual countries’ development priorities.After three years of strong economic growth in Montenegro  the global economic and financial crisis affected us  too  leading to a drop in investment  banks’ credit activities and foreign trade. The patterns of economic growth have changed  so we have adapted our economic policy to the new circumstances. At the same time  the Government has adopted a medium-term development plan modeled on the European Union’s Europe 2020 strategy. The three pillars that Montenegro will base its sustainable development on are smart growth  sustainable growth and inclusive growth. The national plan will make our structural and institutional reforms more consistent with development-oriented public measures and investments. Aware of the importance of that issue  we are setting up a centre for sustainable development in Montenegro that will become operational in early 2014. We hope that in time it will take on a regional role and become part of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network  based on the outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.One issue that is inseparable from the post-2015 development framework is that of climate change. Montenegro is committed to intensifying its efforts to promote the adoption by 2015 of a comprehensive and legally binding agreement that would apply to all. We call on every country  in particular the major world economies  to step up their efforts related to mitigating the impact of climate change and reaching a global climate agreement. In that regard  we emphasize our full support for the Secretary-General’s initiative in convening a conference on climate change in September 2014.The maintenance and promotion of international peace and security is a continuing challenge for the United Nations. We note that in some crisis areas  such as Mali  significant progress has been made in reducing violence and instability  while the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Central African Republic  the Sudan and South Sudan still need the continued attention and efforts of the Security Council and other relevant actors.Due to the overall consequences for the country itself and for the broader region  the crisis in Syria regrettably still monopolizes the attention of the global body politic and is at the top of the agenda of the United Nations. We are deeply concerned about the continuing deterioration of the situation in Syria and most strongly condemn any form of violence  killing of civilians and violation of human rights. We especially condemn the use of chemical weapons confirmed by the United Nations inspection team  which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has labeled a war crime. We urge that those responsible for crimes in Syria and for violations of international law be brought to account. The agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation gives us hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and an end to the conflict in Syria through resolute action on the part of the Security Council. We believe that a political solution and a democratic transition are the only way to end a tragic conflict that has led to a humanitarian crisis of incalculable proportions  affecting the whole region.The case of Syria  among others  highlights the importance of preventive measures and mediation in preserving international peace and security. Strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to achieve an early response and suppress threats before they become a source of conflict will be key to dealing with similar situations in future. Montenegro supports the promotion of the concept of the responsibility to protect and its operationalization  with prevention as an integral element. We are in favour of continuing the debate on the international community’s responsibility for taking timely and decisive action to prevent mass suffering.In the context of the situation in the Middle East  we are particularly pleased by the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations after several stalled years  and we commend the mediation efforts of the United States Secretary of State. Montenegro believes that direct negotiations are the best way to reach a comprehensive and sustainable settlement.With the intention of taking on additional responsibilities and contributing to the promotion of global peace and security and the observance of universal values  rights and freedoms as a responsible and proactive member of the international community  Montenegro is seeking a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2026-2027.Besides its strong support for improving the conception and structural development of United Nations peacebuilding and peacekeeping capacities  Montenegro recognizes the importance of the rule of law and the protection of civilians  particularly women and children  and urges United Nations missions to consistently fulfil their mandates in that area. We condemn all forms of violence  especially sexual violence against women and girls in conflict situations  and we therefore support the implementation of the agenda on women and peace and security and  in that context  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and other relevant resolutions.The adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty as the first legally binding instrument in that area will undoubtedly contribute to global efforts in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. I am pleased to emphasize that Montenegro was a firm supporter of a comprehensive and strongly worded Arms Trade Treaty from the outset and was among the first 65 countries to sign it. We are conscious of how important it is that the Treaty enters into force as soon as possible and will therefore make every effort to ensure its speedy ratification.The increased integration of human rights into every aspect of the work of the United Nations  ensuring universal respect for human rights  and the effectiveness of the United Nations system in the area of human rights constitute the guidelines for action for Montenegro  especially through the Human Rights Council  of which my country is a member. By cooperating actively with the Council and its special proceedings  as well as with Member States  we contribute to timely and efficient deliberations on issues relating to the promotion of human rights and responding adequately to cases of human rights violations. At the national level  we are striving to strengthen a political  social and economic environment that allows for the free exercise of human rights without any form of discrimination. We focus particularly on strengthening the position and role of women in society and on preventing violence against them and other vulnerable groups  including children  disabled persons and members of the lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender community. As Chair of the Decade of Roma Inclusion for 2005-2010  Montenegro has also focused particularly on improving the position of Roma in our society.Montenegro remains committed to an effective multilateral system in which the United Nations plays a central role  and we support pragmatically oriented initiatives and actions for its reform. We believe that reforming and reorganizing the Security Council  as the key actor in the maintenance of international peace  is essential  as are revitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the Economic and Social Council. In general  such reform  particularly of the Security Council  would contribute greatly to strengthening the position  relevance and authority of the Organization as a whole and bringing it into harmony with modern geopolitical processes and challenges. Montenegro’s work within the Organization is based on the principle of multilateral cooperation and respect for the principles and values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We are aware of the importance to our visibility and effectiveness at the international level of strong and stable neighbourly relations and of strengthening cooperation in all areas.We are successfully implementing the internal reforms required for the achievement of our main foreign policy priorities — membership in the European Union and NATO. The accession negotiations with the European Union  after the provisional closing of two chapters  are entering a new and more demanding phase. The new approach in that phase of the process is based on reforms in the areas of the rule of law  strengthening judicial processes and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  which are of particular importance for the citizens of Montenegro.In parallel  my country is strongly committed to Euro-Atlantic integration. As a country that will soon become a NATO member  we are working devotedly on the fourth annual national programme and reform implementation in order to be fully ready by the time our invitation for alliance membership is formalized. We believe that membership will also contribute to reinforcing security in the Balkans  where events of the recent bitter past can be attributed  in part  to a lack of strong security arrangements.Montenegro is seen as a stability factor in our region  as confirmed by continuing advances in political  economic  social and cultural cooperation with all of its neighbours. With regional cooperation high on our agenda  Montenegro actively participates in regional organizations. We believe that the recently launched West Balkans 6+2 initiative  the modalities of which are the subject of intense discussion  will help us to focus regional activities on specific development projects of common interest to participating States that are aimed at speeding up European integration and improving the quality of life of our citizens. We believe that those efforts  together with European Union synergy  the South-East European Cooperation Process and the Regional Cooperation Council  will draw the States of the region closer together and to the common goal of the European Union.The international community  led by the United Nations  with the active participation and decisive contributions of all stakeholders  must continue its search for adequate responses and channel its efforts towards solving the increasingly complex issues and challenges that we are facing. Each and every country  irrespective of size  has  without any doubt  a part to play in finding such solutions  based on the mutual trust and cooperation necessary to build a better world."
"117",4788,"MNG",68,2013,"Allow me to first congratulate Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. Mongolia pledges its full support to him.We gather here at the United Nations to collectively assess the state of the world  share our thoughts and our vision  and agree on common actions. I shall begin by reviewing where we are today. Over 70 million people around the world join the middle class each year. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have improved the lives of billions of people. The world has attained poverty-reduction targets — in some places  even ahead of the proscribed deadline. Rather than seeing 2015 as the end  we should view it as the beginning of a new era. In this era  we should build on our successes  attend to gaps and meet emerging challenges.Sadly  we face many such challenges. Today  over 200 million people are jobless  over 50 million children are not in school  and one in eight of our fellow citizens still goes hungry. Yet over $900 billion dollars are earmarked for military expenditures every year. Only a fraction of that sum is spent on health care and education. Such a state of affairs should not be tolerated.When it comes to the climate  a temperature increase of more than two degrees Centigrade would be disastrous  if not catastrophic. Our environment is changing rapidly. On the production side  global consumption far exceeds our fragile planet’s capacity. Resources are being exhausted. Humankind is gravely endangered. We are running out of time. The world has too many hungry people  too much violence and too little commitment to human rights. We need to change that.I want to share with the Assembly Mongolia’s views and experience. Mongolia is a great nation with a rich history. It is an old nation with a young heart. We are fortunate to have abundant natural resources  which offer great growth prospects and a unique opportunity for economic development and social progress. With double-digit percentage growth  we are one of the world’s fastest developing economies.Mongolia has achieved many development goals in areas such as universal primary education  reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. However  our fifth national MDG progress report suggests that more needs to be done. To reach our development goals  the Government is working closely with all national stakeholders  including political parties  the private sector  research institutions  civil society and the media. Likewise  we invite investors to work together for our common interests. Just a few days ago  we hosted the World Economic Forum Strategic Dialogue on the Future of Mongolia. That event gathered representatives of multiple stakeholders to explore future economic pathways for my country’s development.Mongolians care deeply for the environment. We take seriously our shared responsibility to confront the threat from climate change. That is why we are promoting a green development policy. We have also created and preserved national parks to curb desertification. At the same time  these scenic parks form the backbone of new ecotourism. They will generate both conservation income and green jobs.My country is creating an Asian super-network for green development. It will produce renewable energy and provide it to Asian consumers. Mongolia’s first wind farm  which is privately owned  is now in operation. Wind energy has the potential to produce electricity well beyond the country’s needs.We face many environmental challenges  including land degradation  deforestation  natural disasters and pollution. Those issues need to be resolved urgently and collectively. Environmental education and wider public participation are vital to resolving those challenges. This year we hosted the United Nations World Environment Day. Indeed  we are at the centre of the green economy. The Mongolian people  particularly our young people  are committed to building a better environmental future.Last year I spoke of the importance of Mongolia’s battle to root out corruption at all levels. We are combating corruption — the scourge of democracy — with a zero-tolerance policy at every level of Government. As a result  Mongolia moved up 26 places in Transparency International’s rankings of States.Transparency is the key to fighting corruption. Citizens have the right to know how their taxes are spent at every level of Government  from national agencies to the local administration. Our “glass account” system ensures that all funds are accounted for openly and transparently. Citizens deserve access to information and a say in how their communities are developed. The best Government is the one based on strong civic participation.Mongolia believes in democratic development. Over 20 years ago  it was unimaginable that Mongolia would one day chair the Community of Democracies. That well-known and highly respected global democratic movement is dedicated to promoting freedom and democracy. Hundreds of human rights activists and democratic leaders from many countries gathered in Ulaanbaatar last April. The Ulaanbaatar Declaration charts a future course for promoting democracy. Our initiative  the Asia Democracy Network  and the ministerial consultative meeting  have laid a solid foundation for democratic development.I believe that efforts to foster civic engagement are more effective with democracy education. The implementation of resolution 67/18  on education for democracy  will strengthen democratic institutions and improve the human rights situation for more of our fellow citizens  because knowledge is power.We all must focus on promoting human rights. In the past two decades  Mongolia has been learning and advancing democracy at home. With a view to supporting emerging democracies  we initiated and established an international cooperation fund and have already started implementing several projects. We are actively sharing the lessons of parliamentary democracy and conducting legal reform with Kyrgyzstan. We organized training for diplomats and public servants from Afghanistan. We are also discussing the possibility of cooperation with Myanmar and other emerging democracies.I call on Member States to support our policy of protecting and promoting democratic governance and human rights. I humbly ask for States’ support of Mongolia’s candidature for the Human Rights Council in the elections to be held in 2015.Peace and security remain a fundamental human right.Today people the world over are distressed by endless cycles of conflict. Military forces and weapons are being used to settle disputes. Thousands of human beings are losing their lives  millions are displaced and many more are suffering. The grave situation in Syria is the latest example. We hope that the United States-Russian initiative will bear fruit and lead to a peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict.Mongolia firmly supports non-proliferation and the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction. We cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons and strongly condemn any violation of universally accepted international law. This morning I participated in the High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament (see A/68/PV.11). As a country with internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free-status  uniquely situated between two nuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of the Security Council  Mongolia has been working hard on nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.As a result of our efforts  the five nuclear-weapon States  permanent members of the Security Council  have issued a joint declaration recognizing Mongolia’s unique status. They pledged to respect that status and not to contribute to any act that would violate it. Their joint commitment ensures that we will not be used as a pawn in any future nuclear plans or strategies. That is Mongolia’s contribution to greater confidence and stability in the region.Strengthening peace and stability in North-East Asia is one of Mongolia’s national security priorities. We firmly believe that dialogue and open discussions foster confidence. We have therefore put forth an initiative: the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East Asia Security. We invite the other States of the region to jointly address various issues of common interest  including security issues in North-East Asia.Mongolian military officers and troops are honoured to serve along with their fellow United Nations peacekeepers to maintain international peace and security. We are very proud of our peacekeepers for their dedicated service and their invaluable contributions to the cause of peace.We all know the complexity of contemporary conflicts. Our peacekeepers are serving in areas with high security threats and risks. To support and encourage our peacekeepers  last February I took a trip to South Sudan and visited the United Nations Mission there. During my visit  I met the President of South Sudan and offered my support to him and to his nation  the youngest member of the international community.Let us make our world safer and more prosperous. Let us be fearless when it comes to fighting for fairness  transparency and the rule of law. Where there is the rule of law  there is less corruption and more human rights. Where there is transparency  there is less economic disparity and greater accountability.Where citizens are engaged and informed  good things happen. We must be fearless in our efforts to promote and achieve a fair  open and transparent world community."
"118",4829,"MOZ",68,2013,"It is always a great honour for me to address this magnificent House  symbol of equality among States and an irreplaceable forum of multilateralism that seeks sustainable solutions to the growing global challenges.I join those who spoke before us in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at this session. We believe that your vast experience and knowledge will contribute to the success of our work. We would like to assure you of our support so as to ensure that your mandate is crowned with success.We also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for a job well done during the sixty-seventh session  which resulted in the reaffirmation of the role of the United Nations as an indispensable multilateral forum.We are shocked by the sad news from Kenya regarding the killing  in an act of terrorism  of innocent citizens at a shopping mall. We would like to convey our solidarity to the people and the Government of Kenya and to all those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. Mr. President  we commend you for your wise and opportune choice of the theme of this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  based on the goal of creating a better world for us all. That agenda  like the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  should be based on principles such as inclusiveness in its approach; national ownership  within the context of its sustainability; and shared responsibility among development partners for its implementation.The theme of this session is the logical outcome of the decisions emanating from the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  which galvanized the ongoing preparatory process for the development agenda that will follow the MDGs and is based on a multidimensional approach to development.In carrying out that agenda  it is important that we eradicate  from both our vocabulary and our attitude  the dichotomy by which an attempt is made to group the members of the United Nations family  which is all of us  into two categories — the generous and the deprived — because in this partnership each complements the other with one’s natural and human blessings. Those that do not contribute financially contribute in kind.In that context  the inability of a State to meet its development targets as conceived and agreed upon in this great House represents a collective failure on the part of the entire international community  because such targets are the shared responsibility of all States. Otherwise  why would we set international targets that are later incorporated into national agendas if they are not to be met?On that basis  we reiterate our appeal for the commitments made to be honoured within the context of the MDGs  because promises must be kept and we must not fail to meet the expectations that we have created.We would like in particular to commend the Secretary-General for his initiative in creating the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The valuable conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Panel constitute an important reference in the formulation and negotiation of the development agenda that is to follow the MDGs.Mozambique had the privilege of being part of the group of countries chosen to carry out a national consultation on the post-2015 development agenda. The trust shown in Mozambican civil society to drive that process must be commended because it strengthened the principle of national ownership of the process. It also created the conditions for Mozambican social actors to demonstrate their growing vitality  which is in itself a true reflection of the consolidation of the processes of democratic and inclusive governance in our country.Indeed  we have been furthering our democracy  reinforcing our democratic institutions and consolidating our democratic practices. We do so through transparency  dialogue and participation  instilling respect for the Constitution and broadening inclusiveness to encourage more Mozambicans to become involved in the fight against poverty. An open and inclusive presidency and a governance mechanism replicated at other levels lead us  on the one hand  to interact in a direct and comprehensive way with our people in the places where they live and fight against poverty and  on the other hand  places our governing method under the scrutiny of the people.It is in the context of our commitment to democratic principles and values and to abiding by the legal tenets of our Constitution and laws that  on 20 November  we will hold municipal elections for the fourth time and  in 2014  our fifth general and multiparty elections. The implementation of this electoral cycle is the pinnacle of the exercise of freedom of choice and of citizens’ political participation in the democratic process.In the context of our commitment to the disarmament agenda — an issue of paramount importance in promoting peace and fighting poverty in Mozambique — and as a way for us to associate ourselves with the cause of international peace and security  we will host  from 29 June to 4 July 2014  the Third International Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. We invite all Member States  observers and international and civil society organizations to participate in the Conference.In August  Mozambique successfully concluded its mandate as Chair of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Given its relevance to our theme  we would point out that  over the course of a year and in close collaboration with other member States  the Africa Union  the United Nations and other international partners  we engaged in galvanizing the process of regional integration and in seeking peace and stability for the region.We reiterate our congratulations to Zimbabwe on holding successful elections  whose results were validated by the country’s institutions and endorsed by SADC and the African Union. All the conditions have now been met for the sanctions imposed on that country to be lifted in order to allow for Zimbabwe’s development and full participation in the global agenda. The stability of the Democratic People’s Republic of the Congo continues to be a challenge for our region. We would like  once again  to congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts — in conjunction with SADC  the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the African Union — which resulted in the signing of the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and in the appointment of President Mary Robinson as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  whom we also congratulate. We reiterate our appeal to all signatories to honour the tenets of that agreement. We appeal to the Congolese actors to conclude the Kampala negotiations so as to ensure the return of lasting stability in the Democratic People’s Republic of the Congo. The establishment of dates for the presidential and legislative elections this year in Madagascar creates good prospects for the conclusion of the political transition process in that country. We must therefore continue to provide our support to ensure that this process is successful.Within the framework of our chairmanship of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  we remain steadfast and committed to the stability of Guinea-Bissau. We welcome the efforts of the Guinea-Bissau political actors to restore stability to their country. We also commend other partners of Guinea-Bissau — including the Economic Community of West African States  the African Union  the European Union and the United Nations — which have contributed to the creation of a new dynamic that seeks to find lasting solutions to the political crisis. We also welcome the appointment of President Ramos-Horta as Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of Mission for the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea Bissau. We reiterate our appeal to the international community to continue to mobilize the resources needed to fundamental elections and  above all  to strengthen State institutions in Guinea-Bissau.The agenda of this session focuses on development  the successful implementation of which can occur only in a climate of international of peace and security. In seeking solutions to the conflicts in different parts of the world  the multilateral approach  based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  must prevail. Safeguarding world peace will always be our collective responsibility and never that of one country or of group of States. In that context  the reform of the United Nations  particularly of the Security Council  must continue to receive our special attention so as to ensure that that organ is more representative  democratic and credible and that it can respond more effectively to the various challenges of the contemporary world.It will always be a paradox that whenever social  environmental and economic issues arise  all countries understand that multilateral cooperation is a mechanism that cannot be avoided  but that decisions involving peace or war tend to be made behind closed doors by a small group of States. At a time in which concepts such as democracy  inclusion  ownership and transparency enjoy renewed prominence  we must all accept that the time has come to balance the imbalances that are contrary to multilateralism. It is in the context of this overall framework that the Republic of Mozambique maintains its support for the self-determination of the Palestinian people  the existence of a Palestinian State based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the two-State solution in which Palestine and Israel live side by side and in an environment of peace and security. We further support the self-determination of the Saharawi people. Moreover  the Republic of Mozambique reaffirms the need to end economic trade and financial embargos against Cuba. Once again  we reiterate our commitment to the noble ideals of the United Nations and reaffirm that we will continue to do our part in building an increasingly better  more stable and prosperous world."
"119",4875,"MRT",68,2013,"I am particularly pleased to present our warmest congratulations to the President on the occasion of his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that he will spare no effort to strengthen the gains made and to firmly establish international peace and security  so as to create an international system in which all of mankind enjoys well-being  stability and progress. The President’s experience and political skills in heading his country’s Mission for over a decade are also factors that make him a natural leader during this session.I should also like to praise the efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  and commend him for his interest in the problems of the African continent and his efforts to strengthen the principle of dialogue as an effective tool for consultation and the role of the rule of law and good governance.I would also like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his unflagging efforts in the service of international peace and security and his focus on climate change issues and the fight against famine and deadly diseases  as well as on realizing the Millennium Development Goals.Last June  in the important speech that the President delivered to the General Assembly on the occasion of his election to preside over the sixty-eighth session (see A/67/PV.87)  he outlined his ambitious programme of action  which takes into account the participation of women  youth and civil society in the post-2015 development agenda  the role of South-South cooperation  the role of human rights and the rule of law  and the role of information technology and communication in the proposed development agenda. Those are important topics  and we thank him for including them.Over the past two decades — in step with the Human Development Report — some developing countries have experienced substantial economic change. However  the majority of developing countries  especially the least developed ones  remain very far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. On the threshold of 2015  it behoves us today to implement plans and programmes that take into consideration the failures of the past and the challenges of the future and to effectively prepare the post-2015 development agenda. In that regard  we call upon the wealthy countries of the world to live up to their promises regarding the financing of development programmes in those developing countries that have such pressing needs. We also call upon those countries to implement an appropriate policy  under the supervision of the United Nations specialized agencies and in cooperation with the international financial institutions  that will be based primarily on the following: support for health and education systems; debt forgiveness; the transfer of the necessary technology; the improvement of North-South trade; the removal of customs duties on exports from the developing countries  especially the least developed countries  to the markets of the North; the promotion of South-South cooperation  which will probably strengthen economic cooperation between group members; the establishment of new international mechanisms that will be charged with overseeing regional complementarity  strengthening South-South relations  as underscored in the aforementioned Human Development Report  which will facilitate the sharing of know-how  lessons learned and technology transfer between those countries.Under the leadership of the President of the Republic  Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  our Government is working to improve the standard of living of our citizens  despite our limited resources. In order to attain that objective  the Government has pursued a rigorous educational policy  based on compulsory and widespread primary education and the strengthening of a modern secondary education with free higher education in several different fields. Basic schooling is now available in almost all of our villages and cities. That was made possible thanks to the Government policy of limiting anarchic urbanization by merging numerous villages.With regard to secondary education  all the departments throughout the country now have middle schools and many have high schools. That has allowed the children of people living in remote villages to continue their secondary schooling. High schools reserved for the most promising students were also established to take advantage of their talents and steer them towards specializations that meet the needs of the labour market. Higher education took a large qualitative step forward. A university campus has just been completed in Nouakchott. An Islamic studies university has been opened in the interior of the country  as well as four specialized schools of higher education  including the School of Mines  the Polytechnic  the School of Agricultural Training and Public Works. The Faculty of Medicine has been strengthened and endowed with the means necessary to cover the shortfall in medical personnel in our country  in addition to the creation of four medical schools to train nurses and senior technicians.Health  which goes in line with education  is a major challenge for developing countries and the African continent in particular. Given that  our Government has allocated an important percentage of its budget for that vital sector and has created national programmes to fight against such deadly diseases as AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. In that connection  we have created four new fully equipped hospitals in various parts of the country  in addition to 70 primary-care clinics. We must also note the construction of a specialized oncology hospital  which is considered to be among the most sophisticated in the region. The health-care sector also works closely with United Nations specialized agencies in organizing ongoing vaccination campaigns for children under 5 years of age. As with most developing countries  our country depends on imports of basic goods from the global market  which weighs heavily on our balance sheets  especially since the prices of such products are subject to fluctuations in the world market. Aware of that  our Government has pursued an economic and financial policy that would alleviate the effects generated from outside. Our agricultural sector has therefore been able  thanks to the policy  to fulfil 60 per cent of the country’s rice needs and 37 per cent of its need for other grains. Wheat crops  which were recently introduced  have begun to produce. In that context  a sugar-cane cultivation project was launched to make sugar available locally. Generally  our Government has worked tirelessly in all sectors to ensure that its citizens can live in dignity. A free-trade zone has been created in Nouadhibou — the economic capital of the country and the third-largest city in population — which will transform the region into an important economic centre benefiting the country and the region as a whole.In order to strengthen good governance and the fight against corruption  the Inspector General and the Court of Auditors have been revitalized since President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took office. Significant funds in some sectors have been poorly managed  but have been reimbursed to the State. Civil servants have been made accountable for the poor allocation of certain resources. Agreements were reached to end the no-bid contract system. The lack of competitive bidding has undermined equity among the various economic drivers of national and international markets.Transparency now prevails in the recruitment of civil servants — thanks to competitive examinations — fostering equality among men and women and providing hope to young people. Merit-based candidate selection is now possible  leading to an end to nepotism and favouritism.The Government’s austerity policy  including its reduced administrative budget and increased investment budget  has contributed to the self-financing of the majority of the country’s development projects. The policy has also led to reduced unemployment  which now hovers around 10 per cent. The policies have also contributed to an increased growth rate  which should attain  according to current forecasts  more than 6 per cent by the end of the year. We have also been preparing for municipal and legislative elections slated for the end of the year. That will strengthen good governance and allow our citizens to participate in the process of defining the country’s future  and setting political and economic priorities for our country.Our foreign policy is solidly based on a concern for strengthening good-neighbourly relations and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We will work with our Maghreb region — Arab and African — with a sense of duty towards international relations and issues so as to disseminate a culture of peace  encourage dialogue and the resort to wisdom  and facilitate the role of diplomacy as a means of resolving conflicts and avoiding or ending war.President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  who has not wavered in exerting his utmost efforts  as the Head of the African Union Peace and Security Council  to find solutions to certain conflicts in the African continent  including in Côte d’Ivoire  Libya and Mali. He has played a very important role  through his presence at subregional and international summits  focusing on peace and security around the world. For a number of years  the African Sahel region has been subjected to all types of cross-border organized crime  including drug trafficking  arms trafficking  illegal immigration and kidnapping. We reiterate our call to the international community to support the States of the region in tackling those dangers  which have recently threatened the very existence of a States Members of the United Nations. That clearly shows that the States of the Sahel cannot tackle the scourge on their own. Based on its sense of duty  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  which has stood by Mali since the beginning of the crisis  quickly opened its borders to our Malian brothers and sisters who were seeking refuge in our territory. We have provided and continue to provide shelter for those individuals. Our capital  Nouakchott  over many months hosted a series of negotiations between the Malian provisional authorities and the Azawad groups  which led to the signing of the Ougadougou accords  thus facilitating the preparations for the presidential elections. We take this opportunity to express our sincere congratulations to the people of the sister nation of Mali and the hope that the changes will lead to a new era of well-being  security and progress.Our country strongly condemns the horrific terrorist attack on the Kenyan capital  Nairobi  which cost the lives of dozens of individuals.For more than two years  certain countries of the Arab region have experienced instability owing to the so-called Arab Spring. Our country  respectful of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  expresses its full solidarity with the peoples of those countries. With deep concern and worry  we are following the most recent developments in the Syrian Arab Republic. We invite all stakeholders to refrain from violence and any escalation of violence and  instead  to follow the logic of dialogue  aimed at finding a peaceful solution so as to spare the brotherly Syrian people from suffering and tragedy. At the same time  with respect to the preservation  territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Syrian territory  it is our hope that the mission of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States on the Syrian crisis  will achieve success. It is our firm hope that a swift solution can be found that will bring an end to the bloodshed  destruction of infrastructure and economic devastation in sisterly Syria.We hope that the people of Egypt  Yemen  Libya and Tunisia can quickly conclude their transition periods and build democratic institutions that will guarantee the rights and dignity of their citizens in an atmosphere of well-being and prosperity.Our country pays close attention to the situation in Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the endeavours of the Secretary-General and his personal envoy in their search for a definitive  lasting  fair and comprehensive solution that is acceptable to both parties. Such a solution would bolster peace and security in the region and facilitate the building of a prosperous Arab Maghreb that is in step with the legitimate aspirations of its people.The Arab-Israeli conflict is considered a source of hostility and a threat to peace and security in a vital and critical region of the world. It remains so in spite of the legal framework and general conditions for the settlement of that dispute that have been established over the years by a series of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Those foundations were recently further backed by the Arab Peace Initiative based on the land-for-peace principle. In spite of all of that  the conflict continues  as it has done for too long.We welcome resolution 67/19  of 29 November 2012  whereby the General Assembly granted Palestine the status of non-Member observer State in the United Nations. We hope that that resolution will mark the beginning of a new era that will see justice done for the Palestinian people and their rights restored through the establishment of their independent and sovereign Sate along the 4 June 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital. That would put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people  which dates back to the inception of our Organization.Based on the need to ensure justice  credibility and equity in the relations between the two parties to that conflict  and out of respect for the relevant resolutions and decisions under international law  the international community should live up to its historic responsibilities with regard to Palestine. We reiterate our condemnation of the ongoing blockade against the Gaza Strip  and we condemn the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli war machine against Palestinian civilians and the destruction of their facilities. We welcome efforts  most recently by the United States Administration  seeking the resumption of negotiations between the two parties. We hope that those efforts will contribute to the realization of the Palestinian people’s simplest right: the establishment of their independent State.The commitments made by the international community through the United Nations will go unrealized if the people of the world are unable to fulfil their potential for development  especially in developing countries  to live lives of dignity and freedom  and to enjoy justice and equality — the very lofty principles for which our Organization was created. These are the only guarantees of our success."
"120",4921,"MUS",68,2013,"As we meet this morning to address global concerns and seek ways to ensure progress and lasting peace  the people of Kenya are emerging from a terrorist attack that has cost them many lives and shaken the continent. In expressing our solidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya and with the families of the victims  Mauritius would also like to express its unreserved condemnation of that abominable and dastardly act of terrorism. The Nairobi attack should also compel us to revisit regional and global responses to national and international security threats  including extending support to countries  particularly those on the African continent.Mauritius commends you  Mr. President  for the theme you have proposed for the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The goals we set ourselves for the sustainable development of our national and global economies will shape the lives of generations to come. I would like to say at the outset that Mauritius welcomes the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  and in particular the recommendation that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty for all in the context of sustainable development. We also welcome the Panel’s view that one of the transformative shifts for the post-2015 agenda should be to bring a new sense of global partnership into national and international politics.Climate change should be one of the top priorities for the global agenda. The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis  released only yesterday  is unequivocal. It provides clear scientific confirmation that we humans are responsible for global warming  and that it is up to us to take appropriate measures to try to save our home planet. We cannot and should not any longer ignore the evidence that we humans are putting life on Earth in jeopardy. In our region  we have recently seen an increased and unprecedented intensity and unpredictability of weather events. In March  my country experienced unprecedented flash floods that caused losses of human life and heavy economic losses. No country is safe from natural disasters and the damaging effects of climate change. But for many small island developing States (SIDS)  the foreseeable consequences of climate change threaten us even more dramatically  in terms of both human and economic development. For some SIDS  they pose an existential threat.We fully support the Secretary-General’s proposal to convene world leaders to a climate summit in New York in 2014. We hope that that meeting will provide an opportunity for world leaders to focus political attention on climate change and take meaningful action to mitigate its effects. We must start putting the interests of our home planet above everything else. The world needs a global  legally binding agreement on climate change by 2015. At the Paris meeting of the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  we should adopt a treaty that is universal and ambitious and that concretely addresses the concerns of all  including those of the most vulnerable States.The international community should also pay more attention to disaster risk reduction and adopt a more concerted and accelerated approach to reaching the goals set out in the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (see A/CONF.206/6). The time has come to address disaster risks and climate-change adaptation through an integrated approach  and to adopt resilience as a common and shared vision. Mauritius welcomes Japan’s decision to host the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in early 2015 to review the implementation of the Hyogo Framework and chart an ambitious post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction. In that regard  the holding in Samoa next year of the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States could not be more timely. We hope that the Conference will be a landmark in the history of a more active and collaborative partnership among SIDS and between SIDS and the international community. Furthermore  it could be an opportunity to give new meaning to the concept of global concerns  issues that are  or should be  the concern of the global community at large  and not only of those who are more vulnerable and more at risk. That would be in line with the spirit of the global partnership that the High-level Panel has called for.The prospects for growth in the global economy remain uncertain  largely as a result of the multiple challenges faced by developed countries. In such an interconnected and interdependent world as ours  no nation is immune to external shocks. Small developing countries are very concerned about the slowdown in global growth  declines in international trade  decreasing job opportunities and rising inequality. Small States are particularly susceptible to external shocks  as they are heavily dependent on foreign markets for trade  tourism and investments. They are also concerned about energy and food prices  which are subject to high volatility.My Government believes that the post-2015 development agenda should include a road map for an interconnected world economic system  premised on the assumption that the global economy could very well be as weak as its weakest links. Of course  the specificities of some countries or regions and the pace at which the transformative shifts are implemented may not always be appropriate for universal targets. But the conceptual approach to  and the design of  the post-2015 agenda should  more than ever before  start with the shared conviction that economies are interdependent.Eradicating extreme poverty  empowering more women  providing wider opportunities to young people for education and jobs  improving health care and the management of energy  water and food are all universal concerns. The conventional divides of the past are no longer valid. We need a common development framework but with differentiated milestones and implementation strategies  given the existing disparities in the levels of development. Actions taken at the national level are not sufficient; there should also be reinforced cooperation and partnerships at the regional and international levels. It is therefore imperative that the weaknesses and the inequity of the current global economic governance should be addressed urgently.We are at a juncture where we have no option but to revisit the existing global economic governance mechanisms. An overhaul of the current economic governance is clearly long overdue. We must have a more participatory system of global economic governance  where developing countries would be more involved in international economic decision-making and norm-setting. The voice of all nations  big or small  should be equally heard and taken into consideration.Mauritius has  on several occasions  reiterated that the United Nations Economic and Social Council needs to play a more prominent role in global economic  social  and environmental issues. We cannot overstate the importance of coordination and synergy for avoiding duplication among parallel United Nations processes and initiatives so as to ensure optimal benefit for all.My Government is of the view that all the processes initiated in the Rio+20 Conference last year  including those relating to strengthening the Economic and Social Council  sustainable development goals and sustainable development financing  should converge towards a single post-2015 development agenda that should be adopted during a high-level development summit in 2015. The post-2015 development agenda should complete the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals. However  it should also go beyond them and provide for a systemic change and a new global economic governance. The guiding principles enshrined in the Declaration on the Right to Development  adopted in December 1986 (resolution 41/133)  are still relevant today and should not be overlooked in the formulation of a post-2015 development agenda.My country will follow  with particular interest  the work of the high-level political forum on sustainable development  especially since it replaces the Commission on Sustainable Development  which was the primary intergovernmental forum for monitoring the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.As we set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  we must  as global leaders  define a new global vision for the world’s oceans. The United Nations system has played a crucial role in formulating  implementing and enforcing a new international order relating to the oceans. Indeed  the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 will remain one of the landmarks of the twentieth century.The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has contributed to the settlement of maritime disputes and the promotion of international peace  security and equity in a manner not always witnessed in other areas of international relations. The establishment of the International Seabed Authority is another significant example of what international cooperation can lead to in other sectors. The International Maritime Organization and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO are also making significant contributions.I believe that the United Nations must now take the lead in formulating a global vision for the oceans that will  in particular  expand the economic space for small island States while ensuring sustainable use of living and non-living resources. The health of our economies will depend on the health of our oceans. Our vision for the future must also preserve the inherent values of the ocean space  to which we are looking for economic expansion.Mauritius has taken the initiative of launching a national dialogue on how to promote the ocean economy as one of the main pillars of development. We urge the international community to build on what the world has achieved so far in relation to ocean-related economic activities and conservation  and we propose for future generations a fundamental paradigm shift with respect to economic space. While such a global vision and strategy will be beneficial to all nations  it will be of particular interest to small islands. With limited land areas  the islands can potentially be large ocean States and thus overcome some of their vulnerabilities as small island developing States. As the world realizes the tremendous potential of marine renewable energies  we will see the oceans from a different perspective.The United Nations has a key role to play in promoting the rule of law at both the national and the international levels. The rule of law at the international level must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda. Open and participatory democracy  accountability and transparency are not concepts that should be promoted only at the national level. The United Nations should lead by example here. We should focus on reforming our Organization and on making it more responsive to the needs and aspirations of its constituents.In that context  we should work together on the reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly and on improving the working methods of our Organization. Mauritius believes that a comprehensive reform of the Security Council should include reform in the membership of both the permanent and non-permanent categories. We reaffirm our commitment to the African common position enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We believe that Africa should not be deprived of its right to permanent representation in the Council. Likewise  we believe that Latin America deserves permanent representation in the Council and that SIDS should also be entitled to a seat on the Council. Mauritius further reiterates its support for India’s legitimate aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.Mauritius also reiterates its firm conviction that the rule of law should prevail in the resolution of disputes  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the international community has an obligation to ensure that  in line with the principles of the rule of law  nations should submit their disputes to conciliation  mediation  adjudication or other peaceful means  both judicial and non-judicial.The dismemberment of part of our territory  the Chagos archipelago  prior to independence  by the then colonial Power the United Kingdom  was in clear breach of international law and left the process of decolonization  not only of Mauritius but of Africa in general  incomplete. Yet  the United Kingdom has shown no inclination to engage in any process that would lead to a settlement of that shameful part of its colonial past. I am confident that the United Kingdom and the United States of America want to be on the right side of history. States that look to the law and to the rules of the comity of nations for the resolution of disputes should not be frustrated by the lack of avenues under international law for the settlement of such disputes.Tromelin  which is also an integral part of our territory  is the subject of ongoing discussions with the French Government  and pending a final resolution of the issue  Mauritius and France have concluded a framework agreement on the co-management of the island and its surrounding maritime areas  without prejudice to the sovereignty of Mauritius over Tromelin.In our part of the world  we welcome the rise of a re-energized Africa. The return to normalcy in Mali and the recent holding of elections there show the relevance of international partnerships. The situation in Madagascar and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will  hopefully  be resolved soon through the support of the international community for the initiatives of the Southern African Development Community in that regard.Earlier this year  Mauritius hosted an African ministerial conference on regional integration. We are convinced that African nations will benefit significantly from a greater focus on regional cooperation  and I am pleased to note that the solemn declaration adopted on the fiftieth anniversary of the African Union supports that view.The tragic events in Syria over the last two years are of serious concern to the global community. There is also concern about attempts to bypass the Security Council and to initiate action in breach of the United Nations Charter. Respect for the rule of law at the international level entails compliance with internationally agreed norms. Mauritius will support the decisions taken by the organs of the United Nations under the Charter.We welcome the Security Council resolution that addresses one of the issues in the Syrian crisis. However  the international community needs to go further and address the issue of political dialogue  which will enable the Syrian people to live in peace.Mauritius also supports a Middle East that is free of weapons of mass destruction. That means that no country in the region should hold nuclear or chemical weapons.Mauritius is convinced that an essential condition for peace and prosperity in the Middle East is the peaceful coexistence of the States of Palestine and Israel. Mauritius wishes to reiterate its solidarity with the Palestine National Authority and the Palestinian people in their rightful aspiration to win full recognition as a State Member of the United Nations.Mauritius also supports the peaceful restoration of democracy in Egypt  which has a key role to play in promoting stability and security in the region. But the international community cannot condone the removal by force from office and the detention of a democratically elected leader.(spoke in French)The general debate of the General Assembly offers us a unique opportunity to highlight the most urgent challenges that humankind is currently facing. We must take advantage of this opportunity to review recent events and to outline new approaches that will enable us to respond to these challenges in keeping with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We must address those challenges through a shared vision of peace  security  interdependence and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.We must remain staunch in protecting the right to development. We also have the duty to take a differentiated approach so as to ensure that our development model is sustainable and allows us to leave to future generations the values our world holds dear. Our success will depend on the collective will and commitment. If we succeed  we will go down in history as having met today’s challenges and expectations in terms of the future.(spoke in English)To conclude  let me say that we need to act together  in a spirit of compromise and tolerance. We should constantly remind ourselves that we are of one kind  humankind. There are not  and never will be  ideal solutions that will satisfy all of us. But we  the leaders of our respective countries  need to look beyond the horizon and have the moral courage to look at our common humanity so that we may move forward towards making our world a better  more prosperous and safer place for the whole of humankind."
"121",4958,"MWI",68,2013,"Allow me to congratulate President Ashe on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Let me assure him of my full support and cooperation and that of my Government during his tenure of office. His credentials and experience as a career diplomat here at the United Nations assure us of a successful session. It is indeed an honour for me to have the opportunity to address the Assembly once again. In my maiden address last year  I spoke of the challenges that Malawi faced at the time that I assumed the office of the President of the Republic of Malawi. I outlined my Government’s commitment to addressing the political and economic governance problems that I inherited. I sought to achieve macroeconomic stability and restore the rule of law and the observance of human rights.The reforms my Government has undertaken have been painful but necessary. I am therefore pleased to report to the Assembly that Malawi is registering a strong economic recovery. For instance  foreign exchange and fuel are available  the currency has stabilized  inflation is declining  and industrial production is up from 30 per cent in 2012 to 75 per cent in 2013. Economic growth is forecast at 5 per cent this year  up from 1.8 per cent last year. Furthermore  Malawians are once again enjoying their freedoms and civil liberties  as enshrined in the Constitution.I am pleased to say that Malawi  the “warm heart of Africa”  is warm again  and my Government is committed to staying the course with these reforms. In moving forward  my agenda is to build on the foundations we have laid in order to realize sustainable and inclusive growth.Today we are gathered here to reflect on the progress made on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to debate the post-2015 development agenda. Before I provide my reflections  I would like to commend the Secretary-General for his efforts to ensure an inclusive global debate on the post-2015 development agenda. As I understand it  more than 750 000 people from 194 countries provided their views  indicating their readiness for bold change. I am pleased that Malawi was one of the countries selected for the national consultations.I believe that in Malawi and beyond  the MDGs have played an important role in concentrating our efforts around the common purpose of eradicating poverty. They have raised public awareness about unacceptable levels of poverty and helped to mobilize action towards a fairer world.At the same time  the MDGs have provided a common framework for monitoring progress and highlighting areas of achievement as well as challenges. Yes  they have transformed the way in which both developing and developed countries approach development cooperation.Malawi is on track to achieve four of the eight MDGs: reducing child mortality  combating HIV and AIDS  malaria and other diseases  ensuring environmental sustainability  and developing a global partnership for development. However  like other countries  we are unlikely to meet the Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger  achieving universal access to education  ensuring gender equality and the empowerment of women  and improving maternal health.As the deadline for the MDGs draws closer  Malawi is stepping up its efforts to accelerate their attainment. We have identified best practices as well as bottlenecks in the context of our progress. In particular  we have understood that gender inequality and lack of empowerment of women are the common constraints limiting our progress towards the MDGs. In response  my Government has developed a new MDG acceleration framework that places significance on removing these barriers once and for all.In building the foundations for the post-2015 architecture  I want to reflect on the lessons from Malawi’s experience in the implementation of the MDGs.First  I believe that the strength of the MDGs lies in the fact that they are focused and targeted. That has helped us to narrow our focus and concentrate our efforts on the most critical issues while allowing local ownership. In the case of Malawi  the MDGs were localized through the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy.Secondly  the past 13 years have taught us about the importance of the linkages between these Goals. A poor family is not just economically deprived. It is also likely to face a host of other challenges such as environmental vulnerability  abuses of human rights and lack of or limited access to essential services. Lifting people out of poverty therefore requires a holistic approach.Thirdly  strong political will and the transformation of partnerships have accelerated the attainment of most of the MDG targets. Finally  I wish to make a cautionary note that we need to be aware of the fact that different continents were at different stages of development when we established the MDGs. That created pressure  sometimes leading to unintended consequences. In the case of Malawi and other countries  in our efforts to achieve universal access to education  the quality of education was compromised  yet access and quality should not be separated.We all recognize that the task of developing and achieving consensus on the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” may not be an easy one. However  we know a lot more today about what works and what does not work than we did 13 years ago. We know that in order to achieve real and lasting change  we must be committed. We know that in order to inspire and motivate action  we must be bold and ambitious. We know that in order to maximize our resources and talents  we need smart partnerships.The report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda provides a strong foundation for a new framework. I applaud in particular the overall vision of ending extreme poverty by 2030. I also commend the focus on  among other things  empowering girls and women  creating jobs  sustainable livelihoods and equitable growth and ensuring good governance and effective institutions. I am aware that many people have argued that the best strategy to achieve the MDGs is to realize growth in the gross domestic product. However  I am of the view that that idea is premised on a top-down-approach. In my opinion  it is income for poor households that must come first. The issues that affect population growth — malnutrition  girls’ access to education  maternal health — are all rooted in poverty and  particularly  in a lack of income at the household level. If we have to overcome those challenges  we need to promote policies and programmes that bring decent incomes into households.In that regard  my Government has sought new partnerships with the private sector  local communities and development partners in order to deliver development in more innovative ways. My Government is focused on transforming rural economies and breaking the vicious cycle of underdevelopment and poverty. We have decided to invest in improving the livelihoods of poor people in rural and urban areas. That transformation initiative is aimed at modernizing our rural communities by bringing a standard package of interventions in health  education  water  sanitation and housing.The Government has also rolled out the Malawi Rural Electrification Programme  which aims at spurring industry  trade and agricultural productivity through the provision of electricity. The Government is also implementing a community saving and investment programme to promote a culture of saving and building assets to enhance income and wealth creation. I see that leading to the majority of the poor being active participants in our economy.If we cannot uplift the people that live in rural areas  as is the case in many developing countries  so that they can earn a decent income in the household  the vicious cycle of population growth  malnutrition  maternal risks and poverty will remain. If the post-2015 development agenda is to realize its dream  we need to go to the grass roots  where the people are.For that reason  I welcome the idea that under the post-2015 development agenda  we should track progress against our goals by looking at them across all levels of income. That will drive equal opportunities for people across all income groups and help us realize our dreams of shared prosperity. That is key to restoring the dignity of all our people.Finally  let me emphasize the need to attain global peace and security. We are all aware that conflict  instability and civil unrest disrupt our development efforts. As we look forward to the post-2015 agenda  we should recommit to global peace and security. As a mother and grandmother  I felt compelled to make this appeal.Malawi will continue to engage fully in the post-2015 development agenda. I am hopeful that the voice of the poor  of women  of people with disabilities and of the marginalized will be included in the agenda. I am optimistic about a world of shared prosperity. "
"122",5004,"MYS",68,2013,"Allow me to begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election. I offer him Malaysia’s full cooperation and support as he seeks to further the cause of peace and prosperity.Three years ago  I stood before the General Assembly and called for a global movement of moderates (see A/65/PV.19). It was a call to reject extremism in all its forms  because the real divide is not between East and West or between the developed and developing worlds or between Muslims  Christians and Jews. It is between moderates and extremists of all religions. Much has changed since 2010  when a current of protest and reform surged through the Middle East and North Africa. Out of the heat of the Arab Spring  new questions arose about the pace of democratic change  the role of Islam in politics  and the need for more inclusive development. But the search for answers to those questions has been put on hold. As authoritarian regimes have fallen  and Governments have been swept away by political change  extremists have tried to fill that space. Motivated by ideology  politics and religion  they have sought refuge from the hard work of development in the unholy practice of violence. Conflicts have spilled across borders  inflaming old tensions and igniting new ones. All over the world  extremism is claiming lives and crushing opportunity. This affects all of us  but it is one people of one faith who suffer the most. I believe the greatest threat to Muslims today comes not from the outside world  but from within.The conflict between Sunni and Shia threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of Muslims. Our religion  which was founded on peace and premised on tolerance  is now being twisted by extremists who are deploying false arguments to foster division and justify violence. Across the Islamic world  extremists are wrapping their perverse agenda in religious cloth  tearing families  countries and the Ummah apart. With each new atrocity  tensions are wound tighter and peace seems further away.The corrosive influence of extremism cannot be countered easily  but we are not too powerless to act. I believe that moderation in religion and the political process can stem the loss of life and liberty in the Muslim world. Behind the tragic violence  there is a battle being waged for the future of Islam. By reaffirming our commitment to moderation and solving the political problems that drive instability  we can seize back the centre ground. We can marginalize the extremists and advance an agenda for peace  harmony and justice.Around the world  Muslims have watched in despair as conflict tears into some of our oldest communities. Rarely in our history has the Ummah faced violence on this scale. Right now  the world’s attention is rightly focused on Syria. United Nations investigators have concluded that the focus of the war has shifted along ethnic and religious lines and become overtly sectarian. A conflict that began with anti-Government protests threatens to descend into a war of ethnic cleansing.With fighters from Hizbullah engaging on Syrian soil  the conflict now threatens Lebanon  too. Last month  after car bombs killed dozens in Beirut  42 people died in explosions outside Sunni mosques. Communities are dividing along religious lines  with hard-line preachers urging violence between Sunni and Shia. Meanwhile  the security situation in Iraq continues to unravel  as Sunni extremist groups and Shia militia struggle for control. Over the past four months  nearly 3 000 people have been killed. In the past week alone  three funerals have been bombed in Baghdad. Women and children have been blown apart while mourning. Again  the violence is carried out between Sunni and Shia. In one Iraqi town  four children from one Shia family were slain with knives. In another  local people — neighbours for generations — have built blast walls to keep themselves apart. Forced displacements are growing.In Pakistan  bombings have wrecked the city of Quetta  killing hundreds. Revenge attacks spread to Lahore and bombs have been detonated in Karachi. In August  militants ambushed buses  dividing the passengers according to belief. Those who answered incorrectly were executed.Each of these conflicts has a distinct cause  but they follow a darkly familiar path: emboldened by political failures  radical preachers and militant groups turn civil conflicts into wider religious wars. Yet the preaching of such violence is completely counter to the Islamic faith. The Holy Koran not only condemns suicide  unjust war and retribution by force; it also makes clear the Prophet’s desire for Muslims to live in peace with one another and their neighbours. It says “And if they incline to peace  then incline to it and rely upon Allah” (The Holy Koran  VIII:61) and that “whoever kills a soul  unless for a soul or for corruption in the land — it is as if he had slain mankind entirely” (ibid.  V:32). It also holds that “there shall be no compulsion in religion” (ibid.  II:256).It should come as no surprise that there is no scriptural basis for the atrocities being committed in the name of Islam. Under the six higher objectives of Islamic law  the first and foremost is the protection and preservation of life. Yet even during Ramadan  our holy month  when contemplation  devotion and compassion reign uppermost in Muslim minds  the extremists would not stop. More than 4 400 people died this Ramadan in Syria  371 in Iraq and 120 in Pakistan. This is a burden we can no longer afford to bear. It is time to end the killing; it is time to concentrate instead on building a common agenda for peace and prosperity.There are two things we can do. First of all  I believe that peace-loving Muslims — the overwhelming majority of Muslims — should unite against the extremists who use our religion as an excuse to commit violence. And one of the most powerful tools we have to do so is al-wasatiyyah — the practice of moderation. The Holy Koran says that “we have made you into a community that is justly balanced” (ibid.  II:143). This concept of balance and moderation  of social justice within our faith  is a central tenet of Islam. It asks of us that we hold to the principles displayed by the Prophet Muhammad in the Medina Charter.Our task therefore is to reclaim our faith by articulating clearly the true nature of Islam as a religion of peace  moderation and tolerance. We should speak that message clearly so that all may hear it and stand firm against the minority who use Islam to further violent and unjust ends. We should not mistake moderation for weakness. To face those baying for violence and call instead for calm is a sign not of frailty  but of strength. Muslim leaders should speak up and condemn such violence  lest their silence be mistaken for acceptance.Moderation can be practiced at the national level  as it is in Malaysia  by choosing mutual respect and inclusivity and strengthening the bonds between different communities and faiths. All countries should reinforce their commitment to the principles of moderation  not just in religion  but for sustainable development and stable economic growth.Moderation can also direct regional policy. It sits at the heart of Malaysia’s efforts to bring peace to the southern Philippines and to Thailand’s restive South. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations  which endorsed the Global Movement of Moderates  has made a commitment to the peaceful settlement and non-use of force in territorial disputes. At the international level  moderation can guide our approach to the great global challenges of our age: violent extremism  sustainable development and equitable growth.Secondly  we should give our all to resolve the political problems that raise tensions in the Muslim world  starting with Syria. We cannot underline strongly enough the need for a Syrian-led inclusive political process. Malaysia is against any unilateral action to resolve the conflict. All sides must come together to work out a political settlement. We welcome the recent United States-Russia framework agreement  condemn without reservation the use of chemical weapons  and call on the international community to intensify its efforts to explore all possible diplomatic options for peace under the auspices of the United Nations.We must also find the vision and political will to commit to a just solution for Palestine. We fervently hope that progress towards a viable Palestinian State  based on pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital  will be made  and that the United States and other members of the Quartet will continue to play their role as honest brokers in the process. Only with peace can there be development and dignity for the Palestinian people.Finally  we should continue to focus on building stronger and more prosperous societies predicated on the rule of law and the practice of democracy. The Arab Spring showed that the Muslim world is crying out for change. Governments must answer that call. We must provide good governance to fight corruption  create jobs to tackle poverty  and deliver sustainable growth that builds a world of opportunity for our citizens. We must create economies in which people can fulfil their own aspirations  not those of extremists.By acting to solve our most difficult political problems  we can bring an end to the immediate suffering in Syria  in Palestine and in the wider world. By committing to the cause of moderation  Muslims can secure something even greater. We can reclaim our religion  choosing harmony and acceptance over division and conflict  and we can broadcast a vision of Islam as it is understood by Muslims around the world — as a religion of peace  tolerance and moderation.Last month  when militants attacked those buses in Pakistan  a 19 year-old Sunni student named Ghulam Mustafa stood up for such a vision. Confronting the Sunni gunmen  he said killing Shiites was wrong. Ghulam was shot dead  but his life was not lost in vain. With guns to their heads  the Sunnis on the bus refused to identify the Shia passengers whom the gunmen wanted to kill. In their defiance  we see the true measure of courage and the true test of faith. Under unimaginable pressure  facing the greatest possible threat  they chose to stand with their brothers and sisters. They chose unity over division. Faced with unimaginable pressure  and the greatest possible threat  we must summon the will to do the same."
"123",5031,"NAM",68,2013,"Last week a heinous terrorist attack was perpetrated against the Republic of Kenya  resulting in the death and injury of dozens innocent civilians as well as the destruction of property. We condemn this senseless attack and express our fraternal solidarity with the people of Kenya.The theme for the sixty-eighth session is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. It echoes the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations: “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. As leaders  we are therefore challenged to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda promotes sustainable development and a secure future for current and future generations.When the Millennium Summit adopted the Millennium Development Goals in 2000  it emphasized the urgency of making the world a better place for all humanity. That promise gave hope to millions who live in abject poverty and deprivation in many parts of the world. As we approach the 2015 deadline  we should ask ourselves whether we have lived up to the commitments that we made in 2000. We believe that the post-2015 development agenda should be people-centred and inclusive  with a focus on the provision of health care  education  food security and nutrition  energy  potable water  gender equality and the empowerment of women  young people and people with disabilities.The challenges of climate change and environmental conservation should continue to be a focus of our attention. During the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012  we made commitments to create a new global partnership characterized by a new spirit of solidarity  cooperation and mutual accountability. The outcome document of the Conference  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  identified poverty eradication as the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.As I speak  the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is about to conclude its deliberations in our capital city  Windhoek. We believe that the outcome of the Conference will further strengthen the Convention’s role in mitigating the effects of desertification and droughts  particularly on the continent of Africa.While developing countries have made commendable advances in the areas of social and economic development  many challenges remain. Namibia holds the view that the post-2015 development agenda should take into account the valid concerns and challenges faced by middle-income countries  such as access to grants and concessional funding for developmental purposes. The post-2015 development agenda should also embrace the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms  the rule of law and the maintenance of international peace and security. I wish to emphasize that sustainable development requires adequate and predictable financing at the local and international levels.Namibia is concerned about the conflict situations and growing instability in many parts of the world. We welcome the signing of the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Region. Namibia urges all signatories to the Framework to work together in good faith towards its full implementation. We commend the efforts of the Intervention Brigade to restore peace in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and call on the international community to give its full support to achieving the success of that important mission. We also appeal to the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the communities affected by the conflict.Namibia welcomes the decision of Madagascar’s reformed special electoral court  paving the way for holding presidential and parliamentary elections there next month. We call on the international community to provide the financial  technical and logistical support necessary for those elections to be successful.Our Government continues to support the efforts of the African Union (AU)  through the African Union Mission in Somalia  to stabilize the situation in Somalia.The Southern African Development Community and AU election observer missions have declared the harmonized elections that recently took place in Zimbabwe to be free  peaceful and credible. In that context  Namibia calls for the unconditional lifting of all sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe.We welcome the holding of democratic elections in Mali and congratulate President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on his election. We commend the Economic Community of West African States and other international partners for the leading role they have played in resolving the crisis in that country.I take this opportunity to reiterate our steadfast solidarity with the people of Cuba  who have endured harsh conditions due to the illegal economic blockade imposed on their country. We once again call for the unconditional lifting of the embargo on Cuba.The attainment of self-determination of peoples living under foreign occupation is one of the principles that this Organization was founded on. In that regard  we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Western Sahara  and call for the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan for that country. Similarly  we call for the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestine.Namibia condemns the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population in Syria  as confirmed by the United Nations inspectors. We welcome the agreement reached between the Russian Federation and the United States of America to place Syrian chemical weapons under the control of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We also support the efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the League of Arab States to help the Syrian parties find a peaceful solution to the conflict in their country.The process of reforming the United Nations system  especially the Security Council  must be accelerated in order to make it representative and democratic.This session of the General Assembly presents an historic opportunity for the international community to take concrete steps to eradicate poverty and enhance international peace and security in order to create a world free of want  as envisaged in the Millennium Development Goals. Let us summon the necessary political will to act now.I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and assure you of the full support of my delegation."
"124",5076,"NER",68,2013,"It is a great honour for me to take the floor at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which is being held in the context of some rather disturbing developments in terms of peace and security — developments that  very appropriately  we have an opportunity to consider and to deal with under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.As I begin my statement I should like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency  without forgetting the team that is helping him. I should also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in areas such as sustainable development  peace  security and counter-terrorism  particularly in our region of the Sahel.The theme of the sixty-eighth session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  leads us to ask what measures to take  in the spirit of solidarity  once we have established that many countries will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals within the time frame  as is the case with my country  the Niger. This session of the General Assembly gives me an opportunity to review the ongoing efforts in our country in that area. The renaissance programme established since President Mahamadou Issoufou was elected to head our country makes agriculture  health and education absolute priorities  so that we can substantially improve our human development index performance. Resources expended for that purpose have enabled our country to make significant progress. We have  in particular  reduced the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty and chronic undernourishment. I should like to welcome the significant assistance from bilateral partners and from international organizations  including non-governmental organizations  which are assisting the Government of the Niger in its policies and programmes for a harmonious socioeconomic development. It is for that purpose that the Government launched an ambitious socioeconomic development programme. A round table of donors was held last November in Paris  at which pledges totalling more than $4.8 billion were announced. That amount exceeded the expectations of my Government.We call for the effective mobilization of those commitments  so that we can take action in five strategic areas:  namely  building the credibility and effectiveness of public institutions; establishing conditions for sustainable  balanced and inclusive development; food security and sustainable agricultural development; a competitive and diversified economy designed to promote accelerated and inclusive growth; and the promotion of social development.Given the particular interest accorded to rural populations by our President  we have developed and launched the “three N’s” initiative — Nigeriens feeding Nigeriens — with the goal of promoting food security and food sovereignty  in order to end the food shortages caused by recurring droughts. The programme is intended to improve agricultural productivity by promoting irrigation through the judicious development of the substantial water potential of our country  by improving production techniques through the substantial use of inputs and machinery  by reorganizing the farming sector  by rationalizing distribution channels for agricultural products and by building roads in rural areas.Always bearing in mind the Millennium Development Goals  our Government is paying particular attention to the vital question of education  including the construction of schools  the delivery of school supplies  the extensive recruitment of teachers and the improvement of teachers’ working conditions. It is determined  too  to pursue a bold  consciousness-raising policy aimed at controlling population growth  which is currently negating the impact of the remarkable economic growth that we have experienced in the past two years.As I said at the beginning of my statement  this session is taking place at a time when the purpose and role of the Organization are being sorely tested  owing to an international situation characterized by persisting or new crises and conflicts. Now more than ever  we need to rise to the challenge  bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.We call upon the General Assembly  and in particular the Security Council  to continue to work resolutely to arrive at negotiated and lasting solutions to situations where lethal crises have the potential to cause desolation and displacement and compromise socioeconomic development. For us in the Sahel the major concern in 2012 and 2013 has been Mali. The Niger is pleased with the positive outcome in that country and the follow-up machinery put in place by the Organization through the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)  whose establishment was possible thanks to a considerable mobilization of the international community. That mobilization was driven by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  which dedicated a number of very high-level meetings to the subject of Mali  and was effectively relayed by the African Union through its Peace and Security Council. It was followed up on a regular basis by the United Nations  whose Security Council has adopted many resolutions on the subject.But today  as we take stock of that joint action  we are duty-bound to recognize that we owe the health of Mali more especially to the far-sighted decision of President Hollande to launch Operation Serval  which was able to put an end to the terrorist coalition in early January 2013  thanks to the sizeable means put at its disposal  making it equal to the task.We must recognize also that  while ECOWAS rightly and promptly opted for a military intervention  most of the States that were supposed to mobilize troop contingents were slow to make them available and operational. The United Nations  for its part  sought to differentiate between terrorist organizations  so that  against all the evidence  it could promote a dialogue with some of them. We who were facing the threat were made very anxious by some of the debates at the United Nations  which could have been avoided if only the facts had been faced and the straightforwardness of the evidence noted. The unjustified stalling by the international community encouraged the terrorists to press their advantage by adopting a new agenda and new goals  enabling them to envisage total victory over Malian territory  and even beyond.If I dwell on this it is  first  because I know how close we came to disaster  and  secondly  because it is my deep conviction that just because our enterprise is complex it does not necessarily mean that we are doomed to inaction at best and to mistakes at worst.In spite of what I have just said  the action of the international community in Mali yielded very positive results  thanks to the support of all. Mali  in addition to being free  on 11 August chose its President in an election that was in every respect remarkable. I should like to extend once again my congratulations to President Keita.The international community should continue to support Mali  adding to the troops and capacity of MINUSMA  so that it can complete the job of eradicating the terrorist groups. These are now in difficult straits  but are far from having  as it were  uttered their final word.It is also urgent to put in place regional and international coordination  the job of which would be to provide security for all of the Sahelo-Saharan area. Vigorous measures of a general nature need to be taken against drug trafficking and cross-border organized crime. In that regard  I wish to express my sympathy for the plight of the hostages held by terrorists in the Sahelo-Saharan area. I convey my condolences to their families and call for more efforts to achieve their prompt release.The problems of the Sahel are not just security problems. That part of the world is among the most afflicted. It is subject to the effects of climate change  desertification and recurring droughts  as well as the resulting food shortages and malnutrition. It needs significant investment as part of a sustained global strategy  supported by the entire international community  to ensure the economic progress that is vital for its stabilization and its deliverance from the clutches of violence.Terrorism in Africa affects not only the Sahel  but also the Horn of Africa. It struck the Kenyan people on 23 September in the form of the bloody and murderous attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. I should like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the Government of Kenya.The populations in the Central African Republic are  tragically  experiencing an unprecedented level of violence. The Niger calls for an international intervention  as in Mali in January 2013  to put an end to the martyrdom of the people of the Central African Republic.With respect to Palestine  it is heartbreaking to think that in today’s world  so characterized by highly sophisticated technology and so imbued with modern values  a people could be deprived of its most elementary rights. The Niger is hopeful that the current initiative of the United States Government will be successful and will lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State beside and in harmonious coexistence with Israel.What is happening in Syria is a veritable tragedy  even in this topsy-turvy world. A millennial civilization is crumbling before our eyes. We condemn the use of chemical weapons  as occurred on 21 August  and call upon the United Nations to reach a political solution at the upcoming “Geneva II” conference.For a number of decades now  the Cuban population has endured a trade  economic and financial embargo. We call for the lifting of that embargo.In conclusion  I express my fervent hope that our deliberations will help advance the cause of peace  security and progress throughout the world."
"125",5122,"NGA",68,2013,"On behalf of the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  I salute the President as he presides over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure him of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation. I also wish to extend our commendation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to place on record Nigeria’s appreciation of his focused and committed leadership of the United Nations system.This session comes at a particularly trying period when our world faces a number of critical challenges  which make it imperative for us to work within the Charter of the United Nations to address them meaningfully. It is therefore apt that the theme for this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  signposts our desire and determination to actively cooperate for the improvement of the overall welfare and well-being of the most vulnerable citizens of the States Members of the Organization.Nigeria appreciates the consultative nature of designing the post-2015 development agenda. Earlier in the year  we supported this global outreach through inclusive consultations and surveys of a number of Nigerians  who expressed their aspirations with respect to the world they expect beyond 2015. A major highlight of that process  which has increased national ownership of the agenda  is the emphasis on the eradication of poverty as the overarching principle in the formulation of the successor framework. Tomorrow  Nigeria will host a side event on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  in collaboration with the United Nations  a number of African countries and our development partners.As I had cause to say before the Assembly at its previous session (see A/67/PV.8)  the year 2015 is not a destination but only a milestone to a better  safer  healthier and more compassionate world. Let us therefore renew our commitment to the processes that will develop the post-MDG framework.That objective is of particular resonance to us in Africa  where the challenges of poverty  illiteracy  food insecurity and climate change continue to engage the attention of the political leadership. The good news  however  is that in the past decade  a sustained democratization process across the continent has made significant difference in governance processes  institutions and structures. Today  we have a renascent Africa  which has moved away from the era of dictatorship to a new dawn  where the ideals of good governance and an emphasis on human rights and justice are beginning to drive State-society relations. This is the present reality of Africa that must replace the old prejudices and assumptions about the continent.We are firm in our conviction that democracy is fundamental to achieving the requisite stability that will enable the realization of a sustainable post-2015 development agenda in Africa. This emergent Africa will require the continued support and partnership of the international community — an Africa that is no longer merely a destination for aid but one that is involved in constructive  multi-sectoral exchanges on the global stage. Our continent stands ready to continue to engage the rest of the world as a partner in formulating a global development agenda that will guarantee peace  security and stability.I wish to express my appreciation at Nigeria’s selection as co-Chair of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing. The importance of the Committee’s assignment cannot be overstated. For the post-2015 development agenda to be realistic  it must be backed by a robust financing framework  which I hope will receive the strong backing of the Organization’s better-endowed Members.Nigeria’s commitment to sustainable peace and security propels the country to action along with member States of our subregional and continental organizations whenever stability is threatened in our continent. In recent years  Africa has had its share of conflicts  notably in Mali  Guinea-Bissau  the Democratic Republic of Congo  the Central African Republic and Somalia. It is noteworthy that African leaders  with the support of the international community  have demonstrated the capacity to work in concert and decisively in pursuit of long-term solutions in the affected States. While a lot more still needs to be done  we are convinced that progress is being made.The recent presidential elections in Mali herald a new beginning that should translate into peace and prosperity for its people and provide a stronger basis for stability within the subregion. I congratulate President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita  who is here with us today. Similarly  the political transition process in Guinea-Bissau holds much promise. Among African leaders  there is a greater determination and focus on the transformation of the continent. That is the required impetus for the achievement of development objectives that will benefit the people  and rebrand the continent even more positively.Although our world has not witnessed a global war since the establishment of the United Nations  there have been several conflicts with devastating consequences and impact in virtually all regions of the world. As global citizens  we have a sacred duty to free our world of wars  rivalries  ethnic conflicts and religious divisions. Our collective effort in our drive for a better world will continue to bind us together.Nigeria continues to support the efforts of the United Nations in addressing the global initiative to combat the menace of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. We have redoubled efforts to address this onerous challenge within our borders and across the West African subregion. In doing so  we also recognize the need for a broad-based global partnership in the ongoing battle against transborder crimes  including terrorism and acts of piracy. It is regrettable that these scourges are sustained by unfettered access by non-State actors to illicit small arms and light weapons  with which they foster insecurity and instability across our continent. For us in Africa  these are the weapons of mass destruction.It is therefore in the light of our collective obligation and unceasing struggle to end this nightmare that I congratulate Member States on the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty in April. Our hope is that  upon its entry into force  the Treaty will herald an era of accountable trade in conventional arms  which is critical to the security of nations. In line with our continued commitment to that project  Nigeria has signed and ratified the Treaty. We will continue to engage other Member States for its successful implementation.Terrorism constitutes a major threat to global peace and security and undermines the capacity for sustained development. In Nigeria  the threat of terrorism in a few states in the north-eastern part of our country has proven to be a challenge to national stability. We will spare no effort in addressing this menace. We are therefore confronting it with every resource at our disposal  with due regard for fundamental human rights and the rule of law. Nigeria would like to place on record its appreciation to the international community for its support in that regard. The reign of terror anywhere in the world is an assault on our collective humanity. Three days ago  the stark reality of that menace was again brought to the fore by the dastardly terrorist attack in Nairobi. We must stand together to win this war together.Piracy  like terrorism  is another menace that has attained worrying proportions  especially in Africa’s coastal waters. At the bilateral and multilateral levels  Nigeria has promoted cooperation to mitigate piracy’s impact on and consequences for the security and economies of affected coastal States. Indeed  in June  the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States  the Economic Community of Central African States and the Gulf of Guinea Commission met in Yaoundé and came up with practical steps to collectively confront the menace of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. That effort will no doubt require reinforcement and wider support and collaborative action on the part of our international partners.The situation in the Middle East remains volatile. The reported use of chemical weapons in the Syrian crisis is unacceptable. Nigeria condemns  in the strongest possible terms  the use of chemical weapons prohibited by international conventions. We applaud the current diplomatic efforts to avert a further escalation of the crisis. We urge all parties involved to end the violence and seek a negotiated solution  including through the instruments of the United Nations.The threat that nuclear weapons pose to the survival of the human race is to be understood not just in the context of States that aspire to such weapons but also of the nations already in possession of them. It is our collective responsibility to urge the international community to respond to the clarion call for a peaceful universe in an age of uncertainty. We can attain that objective if we adopt measures and policies that promote nuclear disarmament  protect and renew our environment and push towards an international system that is based on trust  mutual respect and shared goals.I believe that I express the concern of many when I bring up the slow pace of effort and apparent lack of progress in the reform of the United Nations  especially the Security Council. We believe strongly that the call for democratization worldwide should apply not only to States but also to international organizations such as the United Nations. That is why we call for the Council’s democratization. It is desirable in order to enshrine justice  equity and fairness and to promote a sense of inclusiveness and balance in our world.Our support for the Security Council in its primary responsibility — the maintenance of international peace and security — has been total and unwavering. In our previous membership of the Council we demonstrated both the political will and the capacity to engage in key Council responsibilities. Nigeria has therefore decided to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2014 to 2015  for which I am pleased to be able to say we have been endorsed by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union. We urge the Assembly to endorse our candidature.Our world continues to be confronted by pressing problems and threats. No statement made during this session can encompass the extent of those problems. The world looks to us  as leaders  to provide hope in the midst of crisis  to offer guidance through difficult sociopolitical divisions and to ensure that we live in a better world. We have obligations to the current generation  but we have a greater obligation to those yet unborn  who should one day be able to inherit a world of sufficiency  irrespective of the circumstances of their birth or where they stand on the globe. We must work to make that world a reality in recognition of our common heritage. We must strive to eradicate poverty  hunger  disease and human misery; we must eliminate the scourge of nuclear  chemical and biological warfare  as well as that of small arms and light weapons. We must dedicate ourselves to working together to address global  regional and national challenges and to deliver a more peaceful  equitable and prosperous world for all. It is our duty. We must not fail."
"126",5167,"NIC",68,2013,"On behalf of the people and Government of Nicaragua  Comrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Comrade Rosario Murillo  I want to begin by paying tribute to the Commander of the revolution of our America and the Caribbean  leader of the free men and women of the world  Hugo Chávez Frías  who has left us a legacy of strength  hope and certainty of victory in defending the inalienable rights of humankind  such as sovereignty  justice  freedom  democracy  solidarity and peace.On behalf of the people and the Government of reconciliation and national unity of Nicaragua  led by Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased that a representative of a brother country and member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  Petrocaribe and the Community of Latin America and the Caribbean States will guide us in the activities of this important organ so that our efforts may contribute to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which must be implemented by the Organization.The United Nations continues to require profound reform that cannot be delayed any longer. The position of some permanent members of the Security Council on the issue can no longer be an insurmountable obstacle. We continue to support the proposed reinvention of the United Nations proposed by our colleague Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. The power of the Organization must rest completely with the General Assembly.The economic and financial situation imposed by global capitalism continues to rapidly dismantle the welfare State in developed countries and seriously affects developing countries. Now more than ever  it becomes essential to establish a new global economic model that is sustainable  based on justice  solidarity  complementarity and committed to the defence of the Earth and the environment.International democracy cannot exist without respect for international law. Nicaragua continues to demonstrate with reliable facts its adherence to international law and its respect for the principle of resolving our differences through dialogue  negotiation and recourse to international bodies such as the International Court of Justice to settle territorial and other types of disputes.We welcome the central theme selected by you  Mr. President  for the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session  namely  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. It is important  therefore  that we agree to launch an intergovernmental process for that new phase.In Latin America and the Caribbean  we are deepening our political  economic  social and cultural integration process  all the while respecting our diversity and building unity. Our Community of Latin American and Caribbean States has been achieving a shared vision of social development  education  health  the environment  energy and financing  among other sectors. It is now preparing to work collectively on cooperation  nuclear disarmament  fighting corruption  agriculture  science and technology.In the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and in Petrocaribe  Nicaragua has found a model of integration to overcome poverty  hunger and inequality  while strengthening the Central American Integration System   the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project and its economic and commercial relations with the international community and its organizations.In this difficult context  Nicaragua continues to make progress. We have opted for a development model that produces results. Despite the difficulties and limitations  the Millennium Development Goals in Nicaragua are being realized in a tangible manner that demonstrates our Government’s respect and promotion of the human rights of its citizens and its deep ethical commitment to the common good.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recognized our country’s remarkable progress to ensure the food security of our citizens and to reduce the prevalence of undernourishment.Our Government guarantees the right to universal primary education. Major programmes are under way — the “battle for ninth grade”  the intercultural bilingual education programme  the inclusive education programme and the comprehensive school nutrition programme.UN Women ranks Nicaragua among the leading countries in the world with the highest percentage of women in the executive  legislative and judicial branches. Today 42 per cent of the deputies in the National Assembly are women. Women hold 54 per cent of positions in the executive branch  60 per cent in the judicial branch and 50 per cent in municipal councils. We established a Ministry of Women to promote gender equality and to empower women  while our laws ensure that women enjoy human rights.Nicaragua received the Americas Award of the International Training Centre for Local Actors/Authorities (CIFAL) Atlanta and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research for achieving its goals in reducing maternal mortality and in recognition of the national strategy called Maternal Homes. In 2006 the national maternal mortality rate was 92.8 per 100 000 live births. In 2012 the rate was nearly half that  reduced to 50.9  and we continue fighting to reduce it further.We continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. Preventive measures are being disseminated and supportive care is provided to patients. In 2012 Nicaragua received recognition from the Pan American Health Organization for its contribution to the community vigilance programme against malaria. Campaigns are being developed to curb dengue fever  leptospirosis and influenza. We have successfully carried out the campaign “Live clean  live healthy  live a good life  live well”  which aims to clean and beautify communities  provide preventive health measures against epidemics and pandemics as well as to maintain a harmonious and respectful relationship with one another and with the environment.All of those projects are made possible by the enormous efforts our people  who have made a social  economic and political model of dialogue  alliances and consensus  recognized by all. Our people’s inexhaustible capacity for hope and essential relationship with the Christian  socialist and solidarity model that we have built together  in which all sectors of the country participate  has meant that our people continue to move ahead while promoting peace  serenity and the full exercise of their rights.Our defence of peace and international security remains unwavering. Similarly  we continue to fight against drug trafficking and the various manifestations of transnational organized crime. Our retaining-wall strategy produces positive results. We are committed at the regional level to implementing the Central American Security Strategy. It is urgent that the international community give more support through additional financial resources to the efforts and investment the Central American countries are making against those scourges. Despite its limitations  Nicaragua invests considerable resources from its budget to ensure an optimal environment for public safety. Its successes are internationally recognized  and Nicaragua is seen as one of the safest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.We are committed to the struggles of other peoples for their full independence and sovereignty. Therefore  we demand once again the immediate and unconditional termination of the economic  trade and financial embargo imposed against Cuba by the United States of America and the immediate and unconditional release of the Cuban patriots imprisoned in that country. The United States must also stop its arbitrary and capricious inclusion of that brother country in its unilateral list of State sponsors of terrorism.We reiterate our full support for the legitimate rights of the Argentine Republic in the sovereignty dispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands.We recognize and welcome the progress in the political process of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and reject international campaigns aimed at weakening it.We condemn  once again  the arbitrary conduct of the Government of the United States in preventing the aircraft of our colleague  Nicolás Maduro Moros  President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  from flying through Puerto Rico’s airspace. We condemn that act  as well as the refusal of the United States to grant visas to our Venezuelan brothers so that they could attend this General Assembly plenary.We reiterate our support for the brotherly people of Puerto Rico in their struggle for self-determination  independence and social justice. Puerto Rico is one of the last colonial enclaves in our continent. Its brave people deserve our full support and solidarity in order to take their place within the United Nations and in our Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  thereby eliminating colonial situations from the region. We express our solidarity with comrade Oscar López Rivera and demand that he be freed immediately.We express the hope that the peace process in Colombia will come to fruition  bringing peace and social progress to the people of that country.We support the efforts being made to achieve lasting solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. Nicaragua continues to support a negotiated solution to the bloody conflict in Syria. The proposal of the Russian Federation to put an end to the war has received broad international support  including from countries that are members of the Security Council with the right of veto.We reiterate our commitment to the cause of the Palestinian people in their struggle for self-determination and their legitimate right to establish their own State. We consider the resumption of talks between Palestine and Israel to be a step in the right direction. The talks must be accompanied by the suspension of the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.We reiterate our solidarity with the struggle of the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi people  which this year marks its fortieth anniversary.We welcome the fiftieth anniversary of the African Union under the banner of pan-Africanism and the African renaissance.Furthermore  Nicaragua continues to support the just aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan for greater participation in the various bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations.Much has been said and heard in recent days about the Grand Canal of Nicaragua. With that project  our Government intends to take advantage of the unprecedented transformation in global maritime trade that has taken place in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Maritime trade is expected to continue to grow  particularly between Asia and the Americas  and our project is designed to complement the Panama Canal expansion. We are planning a canal for peace  for the development of all peoples  constructed with a sense of responsibility as a world heritage site — a canal open to international investment in a reliable and transparent fashion  a canal that is the fulfilment of the dreams of the General of Free Men  Augusto C. Sandino  and of the people of Nicaragua  for their greater progress.Climate change continues to be a grave problem. “Our environmental  economic  political  social  and spiritual challenges are interconnected”  states the Earth Charter. In that statement lies the essence of our vision and our duty — to save Earth’s vitality and ourselves as the human race."
"127",5214,"NLD",68,2013,"This year  we celebrate the centennial of the Peace Palace in The Hague  seat of the International Court of Justice (ICC) and the Permanent Court of Arbitration  and symbol of the pursuit of peace by means of law. Next year  we will commemorate the centennial of the first of two suicidal world wars that caused unspeakable human suffering  horrible crimes against humanity and the oppression of half of Europe’s population until the Berlin wall came down in 1989.Out of the ashes of those global conflagrations grew the desire of the peoples of the world to put an end to violent conflict and to guarantee human rights for every human being in every country. “Never again” is what humankind wanted. Unfortunately  so far it is not what we have been able to deliver to everyone.During the festive celebrations this year in The Hague  which gave fresh impetus to the peaceful settlement of disputes  there were scenes of unspeakable violence in Syria  including the use of chemical weapons. More recently  in Nairobi  dozens of people were killed by terrorists. One of the victims was Dr. Elif Yavuz  a young Dutch woman who was eight months pregnant with her first baby. My heart goes out to Dr. Yavuz’s family  to all the victims of the Nairobi attack and to their loved ones.The powerlessness of the international community to put an end to abuses like those has led in the past to the establishment of new bodies and instruments. After the Second World War  the United Nations was founded and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. Following more recent genocides  the International Criminal Court was established. The use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein led to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). So the institutions and instruments are in place. The question is  what is preventing them from delivering results? Perhaps the answer to the question was given already four centuries ago by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza when he wrote: “Peace is not an absence of war; it is a virtue  a state of mind  a disposition for benevolence  confidence  justice”.It is my conviction that the international community must keep working on the project we launched a hundred years ago. We should follow the example of Dr. Yavuz  who was committed to helping people suffering from HIV/AIDS and malaria. We should work to achieve her aims and uphold her ideals. We should make clear that terrorism will never triumph. We should invest in the United Nations and support it as effectively as we can. We strongly support the Secretary-General and the message he delivered here on Tuesday (A/68/PV.5). We will join him on the road to peace  justice and development.The Netherlands advocates a coherent agenda for strengthening the international legal order. A peaceful world demands a sustainable legal order and a powerful agenda for development. It demands a strategy for disarmament and a focus on human rights. Those are the principles of the foreign policy of the Netherlands. A partnership for peace  justice and development is the cornerstone of the Dutch candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council in 2017-2018.The world was shocked to discover that an attack with chemical weapons had taken place in Syria on 21 August. The attack violated one of the most important peremptory norms of international law. The 1925 Geneva Protocol  to which Syria is a party  bans the use of chemical weapons. The situation in Syria poses a clear threat to international peace and security. The Netherlands calls on the Security Council to take concerted action to address that threat. We have just heard from the representative of Australia what is going to happen today.Syria does not comply with the international norm that requires it to protect its citizens. But the international community also has a responsibility. The Netherlands supports the proposal that permanent Security Council members should henceforth refrain from using their veto power in votes on intervention to stop the mass atrocity crimes identified by the 2005 World Summit. They should show that they are serious about their responsibility to protect vulnerable populations  underlining our consensus that genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing must never be tolerated.As the Secretary-General said  those responsible for the atrocities in Syria should be held accountable in accordance with international law. The use of chemical weapons is a war crime under the Rome Statute. If the Syrian Government itself sees no possibility of tracking down and prosecuting the guilty parties  it can ask the ICC to do so. If Syria makes no request  the Security Council must take action. Finally  as the Secretary-General also said  we can hardly be satisfied with the destruction of chemical weapons while the wider war continues to destroy Syria and kill innocent people. A peaceful solution is needed. And the women of Syria should be involved in making that happen  as there can be no solution without them.Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security provides an outstanding tool for promoting inclusive conflict resolution. This week we hosted a side event marking the importance of women’s political participation for successful transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. The Executive Director of UN-Women told me earlier this week that courage is every woman’s middle name. It certainly is in Syria.The Netherlands supports John Kerry’s efforts to encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to arrive at a two-State solution through direct negotiations. The international community should support the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Only a political solution can lead to lasting peace.Fifty years ago  United States President John F. Kennedy expressed the fear that in the 1970s there would be 15  20 or even 25 nuclear-weapon States. Thanks in part to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  that danger was averted  but the risk of further proliferation of nuclear weapons has not receded. While much has been achieved in the field of disarmament  there is still a long way to go. In his speech in Berlin in June  President Obama warned of the danger of nuclear weapons. “As long as nuclear weapons exist  we are not truly safe”  he said — and he is right. He plans to take new steps to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. He also wants to make substantial reductions in the number of United States and Russian non-strategic weapons in Europe. The Netherlands is in favour of those steps  strongly supports the efforts and wants to contribute to them.In March of next year  the Nuclear Security Summit will convene in The Hague. My country’s hosting of the Summit is in keeping with our tradition as a country of peace  justice and security. Nuclear materials can play an important role in curing our illnesses and heating our homes. And fortunately  the likelihood of terrorists using nuclear materials in an attack is small. But if it did happen  the consequences for the world would be very serious indeed.The Nuclear Security Summit is meant to give fresh impetus to global efforts to ensure nuclear security and prevent nuclear terrorism by making and implementing agreements at the highest multilateral level. Governments  businesses  researchers and organizations from many countries are working together to reduce the quantities of nuclear materials  to enhance the security of the materials that remain  and to combat nuclear smuggling.The centennial of the Peace Palace is a good occasion to highlight the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Netherlands has used the celebrations to strengthen instruments for peaceful settlement. We advocate taking three interrelated steps.First  we need to encourage countries to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. As States Members of the United Nations  we recognize the Court as a principal organ of the United Nations. In my view  recognizing its compulsory jurisdiction is a logical and necessary next step. Secondly  we must help countries realize how useful and flexible arbitration is as a way of settling disputes. The Security Council and the General Assembly could draw parties’ attention to that instrument more often and we should advocate it more often in the public debate. Thirdly  we must reduce the obstacles to the peaceful settlement of disputes by making alternatives available. This is why the Netherlands enthusiastically supports the Department of Political Affairs and non-governmental organization that promote mediation.In his 2011 report on the responsibility to protect (A/65/877)  the Secretary-General rightly pointed out the importance of mediation as a means of preventing atrocity crimes. National legal systems are the foundation of the international legal order. Strengthening national legal systems should make it possible to keep the courtrooms of the International Criminal Court closed.The ICC is inextricably linked to the global chain of legal institutions. It delivers justice in the wake of international crimes  thus helping to prevent future offences. So it is crucial that countries continue to accede to the Rome Statute and that popular support for it be maintained. We need to ensure that countries that have acceded to the Statute continue to work with the ICC.This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration. The Universal Declaration is an enduring source of inspiration. It was adopted without a single dissenting vote under the inspired leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  who acted as a change agent before the expression was coined. Just before the vote she said  “We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life of the United Nations and in the life of mankind” (see A/PV.180).The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna underlined that human rights are universal  indivisible  interdependent and interrelated. Twenty years after Vienna  the blueprints of our human rights infrastructure are complete. Now it is time to ensure the necessary implementation  political will  capacity  financial resources and treaty body reforms. To that end  Dutch human rights policy stresses the importance of forging trilateral partnerships in different regions of the world. We focus on protecting human rights defenders and promoting LGBT and women’s rights.Without development  there can be no global peace and security. We are fast approaching 2015  and have made great progress. In the next two years we can still make a difference and advance towards the Millennium Development Goals. The post-2015 development agenda will also benefit from a single  unified framework. We cannot talk about the plight of the world’s poorest people in isolation from the environmental problems endangering life on our planet. It is crucial to ensure that development is sustainable so that we can balance and integrate its economic  social and ecological dimensions. Peace  security and the rule of law constitute a fourth vital element of sustainable development.The key words for the post-2015 development agenda are better aid  more trade and stronger policy coherence for sustainable development. Also  we need to promote women’s rights. That includes sexual and reproductive health and rights  as well as equal opportunity. I have four children — two of them are girls. It would be unbearable for me  as a parent  if they did not have equal opportunity as their brothers.It goes without saying that a nation that was built by claiming its lands from the sea is concerned when rising sea levels might endanger that claim. Therefore  we feel a strong solidarity with other countries that are threatened in the same way. The Netherlands wants to strengthen the synergy between climate and poverty-reduction policies  particularly in the field of water and food security.Exactly 75 years ago today  British Prime Minister Chamberlain said  in a radio address on the Sudetenland crisis “How horrible  fantastic  incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing.”Czechoslovakia was dismembered shortly afterwards. That was not just the fault of the signatories of the Munich Agreement. The entire international community — especially Czechoslovakia’s fellow democracies in Europe  including my own country  the Netherlands — looked the other way.Today we can no longer pretend to know nothing of quarrels in faraway countries or of the people who live there. If we fail  it is not because of the deficiency of the legal instruments that we have developed. It is because of the international community’s deficient sense of responsibility. It is our duty to take responsibility in addressing the crisis in Syria.The Secretary-General talked earlier this week about leadership and identified Nelson Mandela as a shining example. I wish we would all listen to “Madiba” more often. On Syria  we should follow the Secretary-General’s lead and make peace and justice a reality.Investing in the United Nations is an investment in our common future. We are shareholders with a long-term interest. We need to have the instruments for peace  justice and development ready for the moment that they can help avert catastrophe. That is why we invested in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  which has now proved crucial in the Syrian crisis. That is why we should invest in the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council. That is why we should work as hard as we can to come up with a clear and ambitious post-2015 sustainable development agenda. We are all in this together; we should invest together in our United Nations."
"128",5259,"NOR",68,2013,"We are living in times of rapid change. Global and regional dynamics are transforming global governance. A changing world will inevitably change the United Nations. But we  the Members of this great Organization  can influence the direction of the change. In order to do so  however  we must set strategic priorities. We should develop an agile multilateral system for the twenty-first century.The architects of the United Nations were in many ways ahead of their time. The Charter  in its Chapters VI and VIII  foresaw a world where the United Nations should safeguard international peace and security  the settlement of disputes and the promotion of common interests at the regional  as much as at the global  level. By 1945  however  there were few established regional mechanisms. In other words  the Charter’s provisions for regional arrangements were largely aspirational.In today’s world  regional organizations and arrangements are increasingly proving their relevance. Economic  social and political integration is taking place at the regional level. Cooperation is not only about outcomes  but also about processes. Practical cooperation can lay the foundation for strategic trust and shared values. It was only after the past century’s two horrific wars that my own continent chose close integration. That was instrumental in the creation of a peaceful Europe. For that historic achievement  the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo last year. The African Union (AU) has seen its continent through 50 transformative years. Freedom came at a high price. Yet  Africa has never been more prosperous than it is today. We see economic growth  improving governance and enhanced regional cooperation.From Somalia to Mali  the African Union and its subregional partners continue to prove their relevance. The African Union is  beyond doubt  becoming one of the United Nations most important regional partners. I commend the AU for its dedicated efforts  and I want to express my deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life in the heinous terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We must never allow terrorists to set the agenda. Hence our efforts to work with the AU to promote peace and stability in Somalia at this crucial moment must be redoubled.In recent years  Norway has worked with the people of Colombia to lay the foundations for lasting peace between its Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia movement. In doing so  we have seen the strong commitment of Colombia’s neighbours. There  as everywhere else  we have learned that peace cannot just be established within one country alone; it has to be rooted in a regional context.In South-East Asia  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is becoming the source  as well as an architect  of regional stability. I commend ASEAN for its constructive role in supporting the democratic reform process in Myanmar. Myanmar will even preside over ASEAN next year  which in many ways is a testimony to the organization’s adaptability.Organizations such as ASEAN have also taken upon themselves the development of multilateral responses to regional challenges  including those pertaining to maritime security. Those strides are not only of regional importance  but are important to us all. The freedom and safety of the seas is one of the most important public goods in an interconnected world. Just like in South-East Asia  Norway and our fellow Arctic States have built our deepened maritime cooperation on one of the most salient organizing principles of the United Nations — the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. And regions reach out to each other. Earlier this year  Norway acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. Likewise  again during the spring  China  Japan  India  the Republic of Korea and Singapore all joined the Arctic Council as observers. In doing so  they subscribed to the founding principles of the Arctic Council  principles that  yet again  are a direct reflection of a key a United Nations norm.Where I live  we observe global warming at close quarters. As the polar ice cap melts  we are reminded of our shared responsibility for saving the planet’s climate. Today  the Arctic Ocean is opening up to human activities in ways hard to imagine only a few years ago. Over the past decade  we have strived to develop forward-looking strategies for the safe management of the new maritime crossroads between Asia  Europe and North America. The emergence of regional institutions as a feature of global governance is in fact good news for the United Nations. We need a United Nations that can be a catalyst that supports and encourages regional developments  which — and as long as — they reinforce our common global and multilateral agenda. We must acknowledge that trend. We must revisit the Charter of the United Nations  in particular its Chapters VI and VIII  and seek to identify the opportunities and potential pitfalls it represents for the United Nations. The Middle East has yet to find an effective regional architecture. It is also a part of the world that is causing considerable concern these days. Israel and Palestine are facing a moment of truth. This month marks 20 years since the signing of the Oslo Accords. We have witnessed positive achievements on the ground. State institutions have been built and are ready for statehood. But for many years  a political horizon has been missing. Time is running out for a negotiated two-State solution.But now  as Palestinian and Israeli leaders have returned to negotiations  hope is renewed. This afternoon  in the Conference Building  I presided over a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of the International Assistance to Palestinians  the international donor group for Palestine. The donors reaffirmed their commitment to providing necessary assistance to the Palestinian Authority through the current transition to statehood. This may be the last chance — a chance we cannot afford to miss.As we speak the horrors in Syria are continuing. Thousands upon thousands of children  women and men are being killed and maimed. Millions are fleeing their homes. The use of chemical weapons is utterly unacceptable and is a grave violation of international law. Their further use must be effectively prevented. Those responsible must be brought to justice and the case referred to the International Criminal Court. The Syrian crisis as such can be resolved only through a political solution. The Security Council must now live up to the responsibility that we  the Members of the United Nations  have entrusted in it. We must seize the momentum created by the United States-Russian agreement. Humanitarian access must be ensured by all parties and to all areas. The bloodshed in Syria must come to an end.Frustrated by Syria  many have criticized the United Nations for its inability to act. However  we should not lose sight of the United Nations many achievements. Every single day  the United Nations provides shelter for refugees  vaccinates children  promotes maternal health and stabilizes fragile States. Evolving norms of human security have placed new issues on the agenda. Children and armed conflict  women  peace and security and the protection of civilians are recent examples of the important normative role of the United Nations.Faced with a scarcity of resources accentuated by a global economy under pressure  we should increase  not decrease  the flexibility of the Secretariat and the Secretary-General to run the Organization. In autumn of 2012  the Assembly decided that the 2014-2015 budget should be cut by $100 million. Reducing the budget while increasing the number of tasks is a recipe for a weaker  not a stronger  United Nations. The Assembly must be coherent in its policies. The role of the Assembly should be to provide guidance  not to micromanage.In conclusion  to meet the regional and global challenges of our time  we  the Member States  must work together to fulfil the aspirations and potential of the Charter of the United Nations. The efficiency of this great Organization depends upon its ability to innovate and to adapt to changing circumstances. "
"129",5305,"NPL",68,2013,"Allow me to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to serve during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I repose full confidence in him to steer the deliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion  and I assure him of our full cooperation in the discharge of his important responsibilities.I take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for having successfully presided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his able and visionary leadership and excellent reports on issues before the Assembly.I bring with me a message of peace and non-violence from Lumbini  the birthplace of Gautama Buddha  the apostle of peace  and the greetings and best wishes of the Government and people of Nepal. Nepal has unflinching faith in the principles and purposes of the United Nations as enshrined in its Charter. Nepal upholds the centrality and indispensability of the United Nations in forging global peace and security  development and human freedom  as well as its role in the promotion of multilateralism  befitting the needs of our age.It is an irony that one eighth of the world population has to live without enough food at a time when 150 per cent of the Earth’s annual regenerative capacity is being consumed  and that nearly 1 billion people will still be forced to live in extreme poverty in 2015. Looking at this unfair and unjust scenario  one can hardly envision global sustainability without a system of economic growth and development that ensures the progress and well-being of people on this planet in an equitable  inclusive and judicious manner. We can hardly realize sustainable development when pervasive poverty  unsustainable consumption and production patterns  and spiralling environmental degradation are allowed to continue.Nepal attaches great importance to the full attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  our countries demonstrated the wisdom to take the MDGs forward with greater vigour through universally applicable sustainable development goals. The report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda reminds us that there is a need to build on the foundations of the MDGs  leaving no one behind in global development efforts. Clearly  any new development agenda that does not keep the elimination of extreme poverty at centre stage loses the spirit of sustainability. I therefore call upon all Member States to direct concerted efforts to completing the unfinished tasks of the MDGs before embarking on a post-2015 development agenda and any subsequent sustainable development goals.The High-level Panel has set forth a vision for shaping a common destiny for the global community through inclusive economic growth  human progress and sustainable development. That collective vision needs to be translated into concrete action with deliverable goals and targets that can be measured globally and locally  based on the Rio principles.We underscore the need to breathe life into the post-2015 development framework with the principles of universal human rights  equity and sustainability. To that end  we should take into account its global applicability  on the one hand  and regional  national and subnational circumstances and priorities  on the other. We believe that all processes relating to the sustainable development goals should reconcile these fundamental aspects  especially in the interests of the poor and marginalized countries and societies. Nepal is constructively engaged in mainstreaming the concerns of the least developed countries (LDCs) into the new global development agenda.While no country is immune to the ominous effects of climate change  countries like Nepal disproportionately have to bear the brunt  in stark contrast to their negligible contribution to greenhouse-gas emissions. Nepal is the fifth most vulnerable country in terms of climate change risks. The risk of multiple disaster in overwhelming proportions and the increased vulnerability we have to face also threaten our fragile mountain ecosystem and fabulous diversity  as well as lives  livelihoods and heritage in Nepal.We welcome the understanding reached in Doha by the Member States on a firm timetable to adopt a universal climate agreement  during the eighteenth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We call on all for an early conclusion to climate change negotiations  with binding emission commitments and guaranteed  enhanced  predictable and easily accessible financing for the most vulnerable countries  such as Nepal  to enable their speedy implementation of suitable adaptation and mitigation measures.Least developed countries face severe structural constraints and multiple vulnerabilities  and are the furthest off track in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed-on development targets. The Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2010 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1) has outlined eight priority areas to be implemented in order to overcome those constraints and enable half of the LDCs to graduate from that status by the year 2020. However  in order to achieve that urgent but ambitious goal  external and internal enabling environments must be created through synergistic efforts on the part of the LDCs and their development partners. Integrating the Programme of Action’s priorities into all our relevant plans and programmes and the ongoing post-2015 development discourse in the United Nations is a must to that end.Nepal has set itself the goal of graduating from LDC status by 2022. The Government is committed to pursuing that goal by mainstreaming the internationally defined priority areas. I ask for genuine partnerships and enhanced cooperation in efforts towards a full  effective and speedy implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action and other internationally agreed-on development goals  with sufficient and predictable funding mechanisms for our goal to become a reality. Nepal’s ability to benefit from trade-induced growth is constrained by the structural problem posed by the high transit-transport costs that its landlocked nature imposes. Our remoteness from markets  marginalization and lack of integration into regional and global value chains all limit the competitiveness of our trade and our attractiveness as an investment destination. Despite the tremendous advances in technology and innovation that global trade has benefited from  Nepal has yet to catch up with that trend  owing to its lack of the basic transport and trade infrastructure that facilitates trade. We look forward to the 10-year review process of the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries  and to forging a successor plan of action capable of addressing landlocked developing countries’ specific concerns and development aspirations.LDCs are still waiting for results from the Doha Development Round and the full implementation of the decisions of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Hong Kong and subsequent meetings. Forty-nine LDCs represent less than 1 per cent of world trade. The recent Fourth Global Review of Aid for Trade further confirmed its capacity to deliver and noted that together with the Enhanced Integrated Framework as a vehicle  it helps to address supply-side constraints  enhance productive capacity and promote economic diversification. We will participate in the ninth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Bali in December  with the expectation that LDCs’ core issues — the full implementation of the duty- and quota-free provision  the adoption of simple and flexible preferential rules of origin and the operationalization of a service waiver for LDCs — will be addressed effectively.The structural deficiency and democratic deficit of globalization must be addressed by making it more inclusive and responsive to the needs of poor and marginalized people around the world. More attention must be given to international migration and its potential contribution to the development of countries of destination and origin  and to ensure that globalization is also fair to the bottom billion of the South. International migration is a cross-cutting developmental issue of common concern. Migration is significant all over the world  but more so in countries like Nepal  where nearly 1 500 people leave for foreign employment every day. While remittances constitute nearly 25 per cent of Nepal’s gross domestic product  Nepalese migrant workers fill labour-market gaps and contribute significantly to the well-being of the people and the economic development of their destination countries. It is extremely important to keep human values and dignity at the centre of administration and governance related to migration. It is also essential to define the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin  transit and destination in order to ensure the basic rights of migrant populations and show respect for their contribution to development.North-South  South-South and triangular types of cooperation are becoming more significant than ever before for forging an inclusive development agenda and ensuring that equality and justice prevail in the world. It is vital that the North make good on its commitments for resources to the developing South. Likewise  South-South cooperation should be promoted by sharing development experience and transferring technology  and by exploiting latent synergies and complementarities in developing and integrating trade  investment and infrastructure facilities.We uphold the view  close to the ideals of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)  that an environment of lasting peace and security  conducive to people-centric development  can be created only through strengthened multilateralism. As a distinct multilateral forum and moral voice of the developing world  NAM has a greater role to play in fostering international peace and security at the United Nations and beyond. We believe that NAM should pursue the issues of reforming the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions  which shape global social and economic policies in general  and financial architecture in particular  in order to make them more inclusive and responsive to the needs of the developing world.Nepal reiterates its call for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction — biological  chemical  radiological and nuclear — in a time-bound manner. Our efforts to achieve the goal of total nuclear disarmament must be matched by efforts to achieve the non-proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. As host this year to the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for Asia and the Pacific in Kathmandu  we stand for strengthening regional initiatives for peace through dialogue  education and awareness  and for subsequent confidence-building measures. Nepal supports establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones  keeping outer space free of weapons and keeping small arms and light weapons out of the reach of illicit hands. The Arms Trade Treaty is a landmark achievement of this year.Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations perpetrated anywhere in the world under any pretext. Our hearts go out to the victims of terrorism  most recently in Kenya and in Pakistan  which only strengthens our resolve to fight the menace. We call for the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism to fight that heinous crime against humanity.As a country emerging from conflict  Nepal underscores the importance of addressing issues of exclusion  discrimination  inequity  corruption and the violation of human rights  and it also supports the strengthening of the rule of law at the national and international levels.Nepal is concerned about the long  drawn-out peace process in the Middle East. We are overdue in fulfilling our commitment to a comprehensive  lasting and judicious solution to the problem. We support the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign Palestine State  based on United Nations resolutions and a solution that enables Israel and Palestine to live as neighbours within secure and recognized international boundaries.The situation in Syria is of serious concern to us all  due mainly to the violent conflict and its attendant large-scale humanitarian tragedy. We believe the international community should facilitate the easing of tensions and confrontation through diplomacy and dialogue towards a peaceful and durable political solution. We condemn the recent use of chemical weapons in Syria and call for the total destruction of chemical-weapons stockpiles in all parts of the world.I reiterate my country’s principled position that the protracted embargo on Cuba is unjustified and needs to be ended immediately and unconditionally.Nepal supports the early and peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiations based on the will of the Korean people.Needless to say  making women partners in all efforts for peace  security and development at all levels  treating them equally without discrimination  and ensuring the protection of their basic rights to unleash their potential have positive implications for the advancement of society as a whole. Moreover  their mainstreaming and empowerment through access to power and productive resources directly contribute to comprehensive development. In Nepal  constitutional  legislative and institutional provisions ensure equal rights to women and their meaningful participation in and contribution to society  focusing on capacity-building  institutional strengthening  legal protection  empowerment and gender mainstreaming. We are committed to our national  regional and international commitments and obligations to human rights  despite our protracted political transition  low level of economic growth and capacity constraints. Peace  democracy  human rights and development reinforce each other and impinge upon the people’s uninterrupted participation in governance and an inclusive development process. The National Human Rights Commission and several other human rights institutions seek to safeguard the human rights of our people. We are strengthening their institutional capacity to deliver on their constitutional and statutory responsibilities  including ensuring the rights of women  children and persons with disabilities. The current national plan  policies and programmes of the Government are geared towards the empowerment of all the people  regardless of class  creed  gender or ethnicity  and embarking on a path of socioeconomic development that is inclusive  fair  equitable and just for all  in line with the country’s national and international commitments. Nepal is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and a member of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)  through which we are actively involved in forging a synergy of collective efforts in several areas of regional cooperation  including poverty reduction  trade expansion  investment promotion  connectivity improvement and socioeconomic advancement. Nepal is constructively engaged with arrangements such as SAARC and BIMSTEC for peace and prosperity at the regional level and with the United Nations at the global level.My delegation looks to the United Nations as the repository of our hopes and a true upholder of the universal values of peace  justice  equality  freedom and human dignity. Given that the United Nations mandate and structures were founded nearly seven decades ago  its reform has been a continuous process aimed at meeting the growing requirements of changing times. There are growing concerns that the United Nations bodies and the Bretton Woods institutions should be made more democratic  accountable  financially stable and responsive to all  as their decisions pervade the social  economic and financial architectures of nation States. Nepal supports the timely re-engineering of those institutions in order to ensure the representation of developing countries in their decision-making.Nepal holds the view that the reform of the Security Council should reflect changes in contemporary political and economic realities. It should be more representative in composition  transparent in functioning  democratic in character  balanced between the North and South  and above all be capable of taking prompt action when peace is threatened.For over six decades now  Nepal has consistently contributed to the work of the United Nations  particularly through peacekeeping missions around the world  including in the most challenging situations. More than 100 000 peacekeepers have served so far with distinct professionalism  and 63 soldiers have laid down their precious lives in the line of duty.My country  Nepal  is in a crucial phase of taking the peace process to a logical conclusion and institutionalizing the gains made in the democratic rights of the people  which came through various continuous movements and struggles carried out over decades. The country-driven and owned peace process enjoyed the support of the United Nations and the international community  for which we express our deep appreciation. The first Constituent Assembly  elected through the democratic process in 2008  expired in May 2012 without completing its mandate of making an inclusive constitution. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly  attempts to form a consensus Government  led by leaders of political parties  could not coalesce in the absence of general consensus  even after a series of attempts through dialogue and negotiations. The country started to slide into political uncertainty in the absence of certainty that an election would be held  and more complications appeared imminent. To overcome the situation  the major political parties were guided by their collective wisdom to work out an alternative outlet that resulted in the formation of an apolitical and neutral Government  under the leadership of the Chief Justice  with the aim of holding free  fair and credible elections to a fresh Constituent Assembly. In view of the demands of the situation to form a Constituent Assembly that would function as a pivotal institution for the balance of power  I had to accept the responsibility in the larger interest of the nation and the people and as a responsible citizen.We have made the necessary preparations to hold the elections on 19 November this year. We have been trying our best to listen to the dissenting parties and to bring them on board for the election through the political process. There is no alternative to elections to revitalize the democratic process and ensure political stability. The election will provide a mandate by the people for writing a constitution  advance civil and political rights  ensure people’s sovereignty in decision-making in State affairs and institutionalize multiparty democracy  federalism and republicanism. It will be instrumental in completing the remaining tasks of the peace process. The settlement of political issues through the democratic process will ensure political stability and  eventually  will open up prospects for broad-based economic development  to which the people have aspired for so long. I express my sincere thanks to the international community for the moral and material support made available for the elections and would like to convey how meaningful that gesture of goodwill is to us.It is my hope and belief that  with continuing understanding  support and assistance on the part of all friends of Nepal  we will be able to go beyond the protracted political transition and focus on the consolidation of the political accomplishments made so far  the further democratization of the country and economic development  so that we may graduate from least-developed-country status by 2022. We are fully confident that democracy provides leverage for bridging differences and promoting peace  tranquillity and prosperity."
"130",5322,"NRU",68,2013,"May I first congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency at the current session. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will guide our deliberations on the many challenges that the world faces today. Also  allow me to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his excellent leadership during the sixty-seventh session.The President knows better than most the unique combination of challenges faced by small island developing States. We are being battered from all sides  both literally and figuratively. Over the past decade  we have faced a flood of crises with a genesis far from our shores that have stretched our capacity to protect and improve the health and prosperity of our people.The near collapse of the global financial system and spikes in food and energy prices have caused enormous difficulties for our small and vulnerable economy. A severe drought caused additional hardship and foreshadowed the much more difficult future we will face in a warming world. At the same time  the flow of official development assistance and climate financing have begun to stagnate.Thankfully  we are presented with an unprecedented opportunity over the next few years to transform how the international system supports sustainable development. We will be continuing work on a number of important processes over the next year.  They include the crafting of sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda  the work of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and — of particular importance to my country — the proceedings of the third Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. In addition  we must make rapid progress towards a new climate-change agreement in 2015  which will obviously have enormous implications for the sustainable development prospects of small islands. We must work in a coordinated fashion so that those processes are mutually reinforcing and deliver concrete results  rather than produce the usual rhetoric. It will be a challenge  but under the President’s skilled leadership  I am confident we can succeed.However  I fear we will come up short of our ambitions for transformational change if we shy away from making fundamental reforms in the way the global economy works. We began a promising conversation on the matter back in 2008 when the financial crisis was still fresh in our minds  but as stock prices have rebounded  our attention has wandered. Let us not forget that most of the problems that caused the previous crisis have not been fixed. Those same problems also undermine sustainable development in many countries and communities around the world.In 2009  the Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System submitted a report (A/63/838) to this body in which it indicated that finance  which should be the servant of the economy  had been promoted to be its master. The rules of economic governance had been increasingly written to serve the interests of a shrinking few as they pursued risky ventures — ventures that often played havoc with people’s lives and livelihoods. We are very familiar with some of the results of that system: stock-market bubbles  currency bubbles and property bubbles. When they burst  they leave behind enormous hardship. Even worse  investments in risky activities of that type compete with more productive investments in basic infrastructure  renewable energy  health services and the like — investments that contribute to true sustainable development.Our reckless inaction is demonstrated by the inflation of the latest bubble: the carbon bubble. At least two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned if we are to limit the rise in global temperatures to below two degrees. The cost of renewable energy has fallen considerably in the past decade. By any measure  fossil fuels are a very bad long-term investment  yet that has not prevented trillions of dollars in private investment and fossil fuel subsidies from pouring into new infrastructure for the exploration  extraction and consumption of fossil fuels.The size of the recent housing bubble has been estimated at $4 trillion. The carbon bubble could be more than five times larger. That should be an issue of serious international concern. How do we allow trillions of dollars to flow into destructive activities while the most basic needs of millions go unmet? The reasons are complicated  but make no mistake that this is a choice. It is a choice made by international policymakers to prioritize profits over people.As the President said earlier this week  “it is time for us to concede that our efforts at reforming and revitalizing our Organization need new impetus” (A/68/PV.5  p. 5). Reclaiming the global economic system and putting it to work for the good of the people will be a long and difficult process  but it may be the only way to reach our sustainable development goals.The Commission’s 2009 report made many good recommendations for our consideration  and the first step must be to bring more transparency and democratic oversight to economic governance. The most important decisions are not made in universal bodies  such as the General Assembly  but rather far away from the small  the isolated and the vulnerable. Is it any surprise that the system has failed to meet our needs?To address that problem  we should start by relaunching the discussion on global economic governance here in the General Assembly  as well as by reforming the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions  so that they are more inclusive.The systemic barriers to sustainable development are formidable  but that has not stopped Nauru from seeking practical solutions that can be readily implemented in the short term. An example is the recently completed Nauru case study on climate change financing. The study identified a number of steps my Government and our development partners can take to make official development assistance more effective. For example  project-based financing was found to be markedly less effective than more flexible modalities  such as general budgetary support.Another key finding concerned the need for domestic institution-building. Accessing many sources of multilateral finance is  quite frankly  beyond the capacity of my Government  and the traditional strategy of conducting regional workshops has simply not worked. We hope to collaborate with development partners to design sustained programmes with a significant in-country component  so that there is a durable transfer of the skills necessary to benefit from international support mechanisms.Nauru has also made its best efforts to contribute at the international level. We have the tremendous honour of presiding over the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSlS)  a group that has been a leading advocate for climate action for more than two decades. The upcoming nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-19)  to be held in Warsaw  will be important to laying the foundation for an ambitious agreement in 2015. A key priority for the COP-19 will be jump-starting near-term mitigation action through the launch of a process guided by more technical expertise and focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. AOSIS has proposed a very practical and collaborative approach to rapidly scale up the implementation of policies and the deployment of technologies that not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also advance domestic sustainable development priorities. In the view of AOSIS  that technical process can prepare the ground for a much more ambitious post-2020 agreement.The proposal in no way relieves developed countries of their international obligation to take the lead in addressing climate change. They should be held accountable for fully implementing best practices to reduce their own emissions  while also providing the means for implementing adaptation and mitigation actions in developing countries. The AOSlS proposal indicates the way to accomplish those objectives. Establishing an international mechanism to address loss and damage is also a key priority for AOSlS  as is mobilizing climate financing and making sure the Green Climate Fund is ready to accept donor contributions in 2014.Climate change is the greatest challenge to the sustainable development of small islands. We must come to terms with the fact that  owing to our delay  some grave impacts are now unavoidable. Some will have security implications. Addressing the security implications of climate change remains a key priority for Nauru and the Pacific small island developing States. I would like to reiterate our proposals for moving forward.First  we are calling for the appointment of a special representative on climate and security to help expand our understanding of the security dimensions of climate change. The special representative would regularly report to the General Assembly and the Security Council on emerging climate-related security threats and would facilitate regional cooperation on cross-border issues. Vulnerable developing countries in particular could benefit from a special representative equipped to help them evaluate their security situations and develop action plans to increase the resilience of their institutions. At some point in the future  the special representative could become an invaluable asset in preventive diplomacy efforts and post-conflict situations.Secondly  we are requesting the Secretary-General to lead a joint task force of all the relevant organs and specialized agencies to immediately assess the capacity and resources of the United Nations system to respond to the anticipated security implications of climate change. We have heard in countless forums about the potentially destabilizing effects of climate change  yet we have only the vaguest idea of what an international response to those effects would look like. That needs to change. We must start preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. As the Secretary-General said at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  “We must strengthen the interface between science and policy”. The world’s attention is now focused on the immense suffering in Syria. On behalf of the people of Nauru  I would like to offer my condolences to the millions of people whose lives have been affected by the Syrian conflict. We are horrified by the scale of human atrocity there. I am compelled to ask: Do we always have to wait for well over 100 000 people to be killed before we can find solutions to restore peace and security? As the President observed  the mandate of this body has limitations  and we cannot issue resolutions that bind countries. The United Nations invests enormous power in the hands of a tiny minority of five  which is not so different from global economic governance being dictated primarily by eight.Nauru is always striving to improve bilateral relations. I would like to express my gratitude to Australia  which has always been an important partner.We look forward to our continued work with the new Government as we continue to collaborate on joint projects that are delivering important benefits in my country.Nauru is gratified to note that  with solid international support and cross-Strait rapprochement  the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage the positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore  I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan has made to helping my country make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. We also express our gratitude to the Governments of New Zealand  the Russian Federation  Japan  the Republic of Korea and India; they are all invaluable partners in our joint effort to bring sustainable development to my island.As the President of the General Assembly aptly described in his opening statement  setting the stage for sustainable development will require introspection  frank discussion and coming to terms with some hard truths about the nature of the challenges we face and the institutions we have at hand to respond. Only by correctly diagnosing the problems and choosing the appropriate tools to begin our work will we be able to reach satisfactory outcomes that benefit us all. "
"131",5369,"NZL",68,2013,"Greetings! Let me begin by congratulating President Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. He is taking the reins at an important time. We wish him every success  and he has New Zealand’s support.The recent events in Kenya  Iraq and Pakistan show how troubled the world can be. We commiserate with the Governments and peoples of those countries and extend our deepest sympathies to those who lost family and friends in those tragic incidents.For most of us  born after the Second World War  the United Nations has been at the centre of our conception of how the world organizes itself. But the reality of the United Nations can be quite challenging. It is the one place where the countries of the world meet  talk and try to find solutions to global and regional issues.Sadly  some of those discussions can become so arcane that they are sometimes quite removed from the issues they claim to be addressing. That is a concern in particular for small States  to which the Organization is so vitally important. Even more sadly  the United Nations has too often failed to provide solutions to the problems the world expects it to resolve. The gap between aspiration and delivery is all too apparent  as the situation in Syria has again so brutally reminded us. But any failures of this institution are less failures of the Organization than they are failures on our part  as its Member States  and on the part of those who have the responsibility of leading those States.There would be no dreadful humanitarian situation in Syria if Syria’s leaders had upheld the commitments made to the international community and to the Syrian people when Syria joined the Organization and ratified the human rights covenants.The Organization would not also have been a powerless bystander to the Syrian tragedy for over two years if the lack of agreement among the Security Council’s permanent members had not shielded the Al-Assad regime  thereby reconfirming the fears of New Zealand and others that had opposed the veto at the original San Francisco Conference  in 1945.New Zealand is pleased that the Security Council has at last met on the situation in Syria. The Secretary-General has advised the Council and the General Assembly that the United Nations Mission has now confirmed  unequivocally and objectively  that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. The report (see A/67/997) found clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were used on 21 August.The information in the report also makes it very clear that those rockets must have been fired by the Syrian regime. As the Secretary-General has said  these are war crimes  and those responsible must be brought to account.Those that try to cast doubt on the report’s conclusions make themselves look foolish and do a disservice to the United Nations.It is imperative now that the Council act. It must adopt a resolution that responds to the use of chemical weapons. It must find a means to hold those responsible to account and establish an effective mechanism for the destruction of those weapons in line with the proposal developed by the United States and Russia. The resolution must also provide for the protection of the civilian population. While Syria necessarily commands our attention  I also want to spend some time on some more positive developments for both the Organization and its Member States. I want to begin with my own country  New Zealand  whose emergence as a fully independent State has proceeded in parallel with the development of the United Nations.New Zealand was present at the founding in San Francisco. We take pride in the fact that we were able to influence the drafting of the Charter  particularly the section on the Trusteeship Council  which paved the way for a number of States to become full Members of the Organization.New Zealand has come a long way since the Charter was adopted. Then  we were emerging from our status as a dominion of the United Kingdom. Today we proudly assert ourselves as a small but independent and diverse country that has a wide network of friends and trading relationships in all the major regions and markets of the world. We value our traditional relationships with Australia and the Pacific  and in Europe and North America as we build new links with partners in Asia  the rest of the Americas and the Caribbean  and Africa.Building and sustaining political and commercial links across the regions of the world is no small matter for a country like New Zealand. We are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and located over three hours’ flying time from our nearest neighbour  Australia  in one of the least populated parts of the world. We share with our Pacific island neighbours the challenges of distance and isolation  and of having to hold our own against much larger countries whose economies of scale and proximity to markets give them a considerable competitive advantage. These factors have reinforced New Zealand’s approach to the United Nations and to the other international organizations that have shaped the post-Second World War environment.We have a strong preference for a rules-based  multilateralist approach  whether in the United Nations  the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the World Bank. We know that rules and standards set internationally provide us the greatest certainty and the greatest protection. We draw strength from global agreements and from the collective commitment they represent.That is why we attach such importance to the completion of the Doha Round. While New Zealand continues to actively negotiate bilateral and regional trade agreements  we acknowledge that free trade agreements often leave least developed countries on the sidelines. The benefit of the WTO  as with the United Nations  is that the rules negotiated there apply across the globe  irrespective of a country’s size or wealth.Our preference for international rules reflects New Zealand’s national approach to governance. We have a robust and transparent system of Government and sound financial institutions that have helped us ride out the worst effects of the global financial crisis. That was despite the significant economic and social challenges we faced after the destructive earthquake that struck Christchurch  our second largest city  in 2011.As we work to restore the built environment in Christchurch  New Zealanders are also conscious of our dependence on and our responsibility towards the natural environment. In policy terms  climate change has been a challenge for New Zealand and for the international community more broadly  but New Zealanders know we must play our part  and we have taken action. We have introduced an extensive emissions-trading scheme. We are investing in the Global Research Alliance to find new ways to manage agricultural greenhouse gases  and we have committed to reducing emissions to 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.We made that commitment under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change rather than the Kyoto Protocol. We did that because  while the Kyoto Protocol once seemed to provide a path forward  things have changed. The Protocol now covers only a small percentage of global emissions. We need a single legal framework that commits all major emitters. While climate change is an important issue  it pales in comparison to the problems faced by many Member States. One of the most intractable is that of Israel and Palestine. As long as that problem is left unresolved  there can be no assured peace in the Middle East and no security for the wider region. There can be no resolution without the Israeli and Palestinian peoples both being assured of viable homelands within secure borders. New Zealand pays tribute to the tenacity of United States Secretary of State Kerry and to the courage of President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu in agreeing to resume the Middle East peace process.In our own region  we have celebrated the successful conclusion of the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste and the transition of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands from a military to a police-led operation. We look forward with intense interest and cautious hope to the reinstatement of democracy in Fiji. We acknowledge the positive developments there  including with regard to election preparations and voter registration. The countries of the Pacific  including New Zealand  want and need Fiji to be successful  democratic and well-governed.Earlier this year  New Zealand withdrew the bulk of its forces from Afghanistan  following the closure of the New Zealand-led provincial reconstruction team in Bamian province  which provided security and helped bring about a significant improvement in governance and development. Schools and hospitals were rebuilt and health centres re-opened. Mortality rates for children under 5 were halved. Maternal deaths are now a quarter of the Taliban-era levels. Girls now make up half the number of primary-school-age children. New Zealand expertise also helped substantially improve agricultural yields through the implementation of modern farming techniques. We are building the largest solar energy system in Afghanistan  which will bring a renewable source of electricity to much of Bamian township. That was a big commitment by a small country situated far away. It also came at a considerable cost: 10 of our servicemen and women lost their lives while on duty there. Even so  we are proud of what we achieved in partnership with the people of Bamian and hope that those gains can be sustained in the years ahead.In Africa we see a continent where many countries have faced real challenges. However  as the President of Nigeria reminded us earlier this week (see A/68/PV.5)  the new story of Africa is the growing number of countries in the region that are enjoying the benefits of good governance  sound economic growth and development  driving positive change throughout the continent. All of that is good news for Africa and for the world. New Zealand will do what it can to help with targeted assistance in areas where we have real expertise to offer  namely  in the fields of agriculture  renewable energy and good governance. New Zealand also recognizes and supports the critical roles of the African Union and Africa’s subregional bodies in ensuring Africa’s security and future prosperity.New Zealand recognizes the importance to Africa  the Caribbean and our own region of the Arms Trade Treaty  adopted in April and signed by New Zealand and many others on 3 June The Treaty should curb the flows of small arms and other weapons  especially to conflict regions  and help arrest the deaths and human misery that they cause.I want to also applaud the progress made in implementing the Millennium Development Goals  while at the same time acknowledging the fact that much work remains to be done. We now need to work together on a post-2015 development agenda focused on creating economic opportunities and the eradication of poverty.Many of the same issues will be addressed at the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  which Samoa is to host in 2014. New Zealand is pleased to be a major supporter of that important United Nations effort and  with the rest of the Pacific  looks forward to welcoming the world to our region.We need to remind ourselves that sound governance arrangements and transparency of process are also vital virtues for international organizations  including the United Nations. By any objective assessment  the Organization has not been equipped with the structures and rules it needs to operate as it should. Yet there has been deep resistance to efforts to make things better. That needs to change. The rationale for United Nations reform is clear. Membership has quadrupled since 1945  yet over the same period its key organs — particularly the Security Council — have become hostage to their own traditions and to the interests of the most powerful. From the 1950s to the 1990s  we could blame the Cold War when the Security Council did not act. That does not wash today. The problems are more systemic and relate both to the composition and the formal and informal processes of the Council. We now seem to have a practice whereby the permanent members not only can block Council actions through the use of the veto  but also appear to have privileged access to information and can stop the Council from meeting if it does not suit their collective purposes. Such behaviour damages the reputation and credibility of the wider Organization and must be challenged. Such issues are not necessarily matters of Charter reform  which we know is difficult  but have to do with the effective functioning of the Organization — an issue in which we all have a stake.New Zealand is not advocating revolution  but we are asserting that the Council can and must do better in the way it conducts its business. That is the approach New Zealand will bring to the Security Council if we are elected next October. If successful  it will be 21 years since New Zealand last served on the Council — a long time ago  but not so long that we have forgotten the lessons learned during our last term. At the top of that list is the imperative that members have to be engaged; they must listen to the concerns of others and have a view and a voice if they are to be relevant. There is no point in joining the Council simply to make up the numbers. Sometimes there is a need to speak up and shine a light on what is going on  or not going on  even when that may be inconvenient to others. That applies whether the issue was Rwanda  Somalia  Yemen or Yugoslavia in 1993-94  or is the Democratic Republic of Congo  the Sudan or Syria in 2013 to 2014.My hope is that when Member States make their decision on whom to vote for in October 2014  they will look at New Zealand’s record and know that we will be a credible  positive influence on the Security Council and a voice for the interests of the wider Organization."
"132",5413,"OMN",68,2013,"It gives me great pleasure  at the outset  to extend my warmest congratulations to the President and his friendly country  Antigua and Barbuda  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We wish him every success in his endeavour and assure him that the Sultanate of Oman stands ready to cooperate with him and all delegations and Member States to achieve the desired objectives.We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  of the friendly Republic of Serbia  for the outstanding manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session  as well as to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts to enhance the role of the Organization and develop its operational mechanisms to respond to current challenges and recent developments and ensure optimal future preparedness.The numerous achievements and successes of the United Nations since its establishment  in 1945  have contributed positively to increased security and stability in the world. However  the rapid developments witnessed today  including steady population growth  rising global demand for energy and natural resources and tremendous advances in communications and new technologies  have given rise to numerous difficulties. Joint efforts and greater cooperation among Governments are required to address them and find appropriate solutions. Such action requires that the Organization and its various organs be empowered to strengthen their capacity to respond to global demands and developments  with a sharp focus on vital and urgent issues.Modernization  development and change constitute the norms of life. However  they must go hand in hand with increased security and stability  which should be based on cooperation among all nations and should be aimed at achieving sustainable development goals.The recent events in various countries in the Middle East resulted from genuine reactions to the socioeconomic hardships faced by the peoples of the region and to diminished institutional capacities to respond fully to their needs and demands. Despite the loss of lives and property in those countries  current efforts are aimed at stability and restoring the economy  and as such deserve our support.My country welcomes the consensus achieved in the Security Council on the issue of chemical weapons in Syria and the unanimous adoption of resolution 2118 (2013). The “Geneva II” conference is of critical importance in facilitating negotiations between the Syrian Government and the opposition forces. We believe that the goal should be a ceasefire and the formation of a transitional authority with the necessary power to overcome the enormous difficulties resulting from a war that has been ongoing for approximately three years.The international community should prepare to provide support and humanitarian assistance to displaced Syrians and to all those affected by that abhorrent war. My country confirms its continued assistance to aid the displaced Syrians and expresses its readiness to contribute to international humanitarian aid inside Syrian territory.We welcome the positive developments taking place in Somalia thanks to the efforts of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to rebuild the Somali State. It is our hope that our brothers in the Federal Republic of Somalia will be able to implement the political and economic reform programme that has gained the support of the international community.Among the important international issues that have yet to be resolved is the Palestinian question  which is considered the cornerstone of any possible peace in the Middle East. Despite the efforts made and the agreements concluded through direct negotiations between successive Israeli Governments and the Palestine Liberation Organization  no settlement has yet been reached. In that regard  my country supports the efforts of President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State  Mr. John Kerry  as they represent an opportunity for all the peoples of the region to establish peace. That would lead to economic and social development and revive the hope for peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region — all of which would ensure a positive contribution by the Middle East to global civilization.My country continues to support the initiatives aimed at transforming the Middle East into a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  as it is fully aware of the effects of those weapons on the security and stability of States  regions and the entire world.With our emphasis on the right of States to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy  it is worth mentioning that the current dispute will not be resolved through coercive policies and practices  such as sanctions and other tough measures. Because those measures are limited  their effectiveness is weakened. Rather  creative diplomacy can help all States to benefit from nuclear power for peaceful purposes.On the other hand  we hope that the international community  particularly the depositary countries of the NPT  will be able to persuade other Middle Eastern States to become parties to the Treaty and to subject their nuclear facilities to the comprehensive system of safeguards that exists under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. That would contribute to achieving the universality of the Treaty and would make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That goal deserves the support of all countries  especially the major Powers.We express our regret at the non-convening of the international conference on the Middle East mandated by the decision of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  owing to the fact that some parties did not support its convening. That reflects a lack of understanding of the conditions  objectives and aspirations of the peoples of the Middle East region.In the light of our commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  we would like to announce that we have attained the Goals and all their indicators. In fact  we recently announced that we had been 100 per cent successful in achieving Goals 4 and 5.With regard to protection of the environment and natural conservation  since the dawn of the renaissance led by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said  my country  in line with the national strategy to protect the environment  has consistently integrated environmental issues into its plans and development goals  with a view to achieving a balance between the aims of sustainable development and the preservation of the environment.My country has also sought to share its interests in the environment and natural conservation with the international community. We have participated in many regional and international conferences on the environment  including the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  held in Qatar in December 2012. We look forward to participating in the nineteenth session  to be held in Warsaw in November.The right to science and knowledge should be enjoyed by all humankind  and the great evolution in the use and application of modern technology has become an essential tool in our daily lives  thanks to scientific and intellectual creativity. Consequently  my country has sought to keep up with advances to meet our current needs. To that end  we have established many centres and councils that encourage research and development  including the Scientific Research Council  the Industrial Innovation Centre  the National Centre for Enterprises and Commercial Activities  and the Oasis of Knowledge. We also have a Middle East Desalination Research Centre.My country continues to develop the main guidelines for a national strategy of research and development and scientific knowledge. We are also trying to familiarize ourselves with modern technology and to encourage Omani youth to take part in different science — and technology-based professions. In that context  we welcome future constructive cooperation  investment and partnerships with all other centres  universities  institutions and specialized industries in both the public and the private sectors and at the national  regional and international levels. We also want to take advantage of Oman’s geographical position as a main gateway and bridge to knowledge and creativity in regional and international markets.In conclusion  we wish the President every success at this session  and we hope that it concludes with a realistic and renewed vision — an inspired vision and one that also imparts new momentum for our times  a vision that reflects the aspirations of every generation and every people and makes every effort to achieve them."
"133",5460,"PAK",68,2013,"I stand here today before the Assembly  soon after my country has seen a new dawn. I come to this Hall in all humility as the elected Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. I feel exonerated  as my supporters and I have stood firm in our commitment to democracy.I am happy to inform representatives that we now have a strong Parliament  an independent judiciary  a free media and a vibrant civil society. But there is no room for complacency. We cannot lower our guard. Democracy needs constant vigilance and strong institutions. It needs careful nurturing. More importantly  it is not promises but good governance that sustains democracy. My Government has put the people at the centre. We will work to give them peace and security  an environment of growth and development. I am pursuing an inclusive approach for the entire nation.Pakistan is an ardent supporter of the United Nations  which is an anchor of peace and a beacon of hope for all nations. The United Nations universal character provides a forum to discuss  develop and implement global responses to the pressing problems of our times. Pakistan upholds international law and promotes international consensus. The security of our world is ensured and reinforced by friendly relations among nations and respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States.The United Nations needs reform  but it should be a reform that reflects the interests of all  not just the ambitions of a few. We believe that the Security Council’s composition should be made more representative  democratic and equitable  and its work more effective  transparent and accountable. The intended reforms must  however  plan for a dynamic future  not entrench or replicate outdated historical patterns based on privileges. The role and authority of the General Assembly must be fully restored and revitalized. In the past few years  the General Assembly has regained influence in responding to challenges in regard to peace and security  development and climate change. It is becoming a platform of choice. Yet  it has to go a long way to acquire its full authority.To save the world from the scourge of war  we have to continue to strive for a fair and just international order based on the rule of law. Festering disputes must be resolved. In that regard  the United Nations has to play a critical role.The United Nations must  for instance  continue to remain attentive to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and the full realization of the right to self-determination of its people. The suffering of the people cannot be brushed under the carpet because of power politics. As in the past  Pakistan calls upon the international community to give an opportunity to the Kashmiris to decide their future peacefully  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. The issue of Jammu and Kashmir was presented to the Security Council in January 1948  and yet the issue remains unresolved after nearly seven decades.I have aspirations for regional peace and stability. I have shared that vision with leaders in our neighbourhood. Shortly after assuming office  I received a message of goodwill from the Prime Minister of India  Mr. Manmohan Singh. I extended an invitation to him to engage with us so as to address all outstanding issues between our two countries  and Prime Minister Singh’s response was positive. Our two countries have wasted massive resources in an arms race. We could have used those resources for the economic well-being of our people. We still have that opportunity. Pakistan and India can prosper together; and the entire region would benefit from our cooperation. We stand ready to re-engage with India in a substantive and purposeful dialogue. I am looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Singh here in New York so as to make a new beginning. We have a solid basis for doing that. We can build on the Lahore Accord signed in 1999  which contained a road map for the resolution of our differences through peaceful negotiations. I am committed to working for a peaceful and economically prosperous region. That is what our people want and what I have long aspired to.It gave me great pleasure to welcome President Karzai in Islamabad last month. We reaffirmed our shared goal of a peaceful  stable and united Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan are and should remain masters of their own destiny. We support an inclusive  Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process  leading to national reconciliation. I assured President Karzai that we do not wish to interfere in Afghanistan’s internal affairs; nor do we have any favourites in that country. In fact  we hope earnestly that the Afghans themselves will unite for the peace  prosperity and development of their great country.Pakistan encourages United Nations efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. We will work together with Afghanistan for regional and economic cooperation aimed at establishing and reinforcing regional trade  energy and communications corridors. Our solidarity with the Afghan people has been demonstrated through our willingness to host millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan for many decades. International support for their repatriation to and reintegration in Afghanistan is indispensable. We also look forward to United Nations support for addressing other transregional challenges  including the flow of narcotics.Last year  the Assembly gave Palestine the status of non-Member observer State. We hope that it will soon join this body as a full Member State. We are glad that the stalled peace process has started again. It should lead to the consolidation of an independent  viable and contiguous State of Palestine  based on the pre-1967 borders  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Pakistan will continue to demonstrate its solidarity with the people of Palestine.Even as we meet here  Syria is in turmoil  with Syrians killing Syrians. We appeal to the Syrian Government and the opposition groups to move to the negotiating table in Geneva to prepare a road map for national reconciliation and the necessary political transitions. More war will lead to more killings  which must be stopped. As a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction  Pakistan remains opposed to the use of chemical weapons. We condemn their use in the strongest terms.We welcome the agreement reached between the United States and Russia  and supported by the other permanent members of the Security Council  to secure and destroy chemical weapons in Syria. That crucial step has facilitated consensus within the Council to adopt resolution 2118 (2013)  which not only addresses the issue of chemical weapons but could start the stalled political process in Syria  leading to national reconciliation and solutions that are acceptable to the people of Syria. Pakistan will support that resolution. Acceptance of the Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522  annex) and a decision on dates for convening a Geneva II conference will be a big step towards ending the crisis in Syria. I call on all forces to invest their political will and capital in diplomacy to bring peace to that country.As a responsible nuclear-weapon State  we will continue to pursue the goals of disarmament and non-proliferation and adhere to a policy of credible minimum deterrence without entering into any arms race. We cannot  however  remain oblivious to the evolving security dynamics in South Asia  nor can we agree to an arrangement that is detrimental to our security and strategic interests. Our position on the proposed fissile material treaty is determined by our national security interests and the objective of strategic stability in South Asia.The safe  secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy  without discrimination  is essential for economic development. Pakistan qualifies for full access to civil nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in order to meet its growing energy needs for continued economic growth. By the same token  as a mainstream partner in the global non-proliferation regime  Pakistan has impeccable credentials for joining the multilateral export control regime  including the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Pakistan will continue to participate constructively in the Nuclear Security Summit  which is a laudable initiative.As a country that has suffered grievously for many years from terrorism  we condemn that phenomenon in all its forms and manifestations. Over the past 12 years  we have made huge sacrifices in blood and resources. We have lost 40 000 precious lives of men  women and children  including 8 000 defence and security personnel. There has been colossal damage to our social and physical infrastructure  too. Our economy has been denied the opportunity to grow fully. That must change now. I have tried to forge national consensus on a cohesive policy to eliminate terrorism from our soil. For that purpose  I convened an all-parties conference that spoke out unanimously against terrorism. We are resolved to oppose the forces of terrorism with every means at our disposal. At the same time  we have offered dialogue to end violence  wean young extremists off extremism and integrate all segments of our society into the national mainstream. Winning young people’s hearts and minds is as important as using guns to deter terrorism. But dialogue should not be seen as a sign of weakness or a tool of appeasement.The war against terrorism must be waged within the framework of international law. The use of armed drones in the border areas of Pakistan is a continued violation of our territorial integrity. It results in innocent civilian casualties and is detrimental to our resolve and efforts to eliminate extremism and terrorism in Pakistan. I have urged the United States to cease those strikes so that we can avoid further casualties and suffering.Terrorism knows no borders. It has no religion or creed  which is why maligning a whole people or a religion on that account is unfair and unwise. Islam is a religion of peace  compassion and brotherhood. And the yet most insidious form of contemporary racism in the name of religion is on the rise. Peaceful Muslim communities are profiled and subjected to discriminatory practices. Their faith  culture  holy personalities and scriptures are under attack. The stereotyping of Muslims as extremists and terrorists must stop. We must all use the influence and reach of the United Nations to avert a clash of civilizations and to promote harmony among followers of diverse religions all around the world. Terrorism negates Islam’s humanistic outlook and noble values. Those who perpetrate terrorism are enemies of Muslims and Islam itself.Pakistan is the largest troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping. Since 1960  we have contributed 150 000 troops  and 135 of our peacekeepers have lost their lives in the service of peace. That has been our most tangible assistance to the United Nations efforts to maintain international peace and security.We fully support the United Nations effort to finalize and implement a single  coherent post-2015 development agenda that identifies benchmarks for poverty alleviation  sustainable development and social inclusion. More importantly  we should prepare ourselves to respond effectively to save our planet from the ravages of climate change.Our Government is undertaking an economic revolution in Pakistan so that it  too  can become part of the emerging markets. We have all the fundamentals and human and natural resources for such a transformation. In the immediate future  our challenge is to overcome a volatile security environment  correct structural imbalances in the economy and bring an end to energy shortages. We are building a new Pakistan with a robust economy. From the international community  we seek not aid but enhanced trade  market access  investment and strong economic partnerships.We are creating a new framework for change to provide equal opportunities and social justice for everyone  eliminate the exploitation of the poor  harness our human resources and restore the dignity of our citizens. We intend to use education as a key driver of the socioeconomic development of Pakistan. We are introducing a national health service across Pakistan with the participation of the private sector. We have also made the eradication of polio in Pakistan a matter of great importance for my Government  as we are determined to make Pakistan a polio-free country.It is our strong resolve to promote the full participation of women in national development  while protecting their political  social and cultural rights as agents of change. More than 63 per cent of our population is under the age of 25. By investing in their education and skills  we aim to tap into the demographic dividend. Minorities are equal citizens of Pakistan. They will not only have complete freedom to worship  but also full protection of their rights to education  employment and political participation.We are deeply saddened by the recent terrorist attack on the members of a minority community in Peshawar. That heinous attack has united the entire Pakistani nation in support of our brothers and sisters of all faiths in Pakistan. We share their grief and have declared three days of mourning. The attack was carried out by the same elements who have attacked our mosques  shrines  innocent citizens and members of our security forces. However  the attack has further strengthened my Government’s resolve to deal with terrorism and extremism in a resolute and comprehensive manner  as I reiterated in my very first speech at the National Assembly of Pakistan.In conclusion  I wish to emphasize to the Assembly that Pakistan is a strong supporter of multilateral diplomacy  convinced that it is the most legitimate and ultimate guarantor of peace and security  economic and social development  and respect for universal human rights. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  Pakistan has been making every effort to strengthen the role of diplomacy to resolve conflicts and to help build States in post-conflict situations. In all instances  we have upheld the primacy of the Charter of the United Nations. We need multilateral diplomacy so that we continue to respect diversity while reaching decisions that impact our fate as members of the international community. Towards that end  the United Nations — the virtual world parliament — is our best hope."
"134",5503,"PAN",68,2013,"It is a great honour for my country to congratulate Mr. Ashe upon his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. He can count on the unconditional support of the delegation of Panama during his tenure. We cannot think of a more appropriate theme for this high-level debate than to focus on “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The theme invites us to reaffirm our commitment to continuing to work towards an agreement on the new development agenda. The agenda will be available for our people and the planet. The 13 years that have elapsed since we identified a way to achieve development through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have witnessed the fastest reduction in poverty in the history of mankind. In that connection  we as Panamanians have had great pleasure in carrying out studies indicating that half a billion fewer people now live below the poverty line  that infant mortality rates have fallen by over 30 per cent  and that deaths owing to malaria have declined by a quarter  among other things. Panama has presented three national reports on the MDGs. They have demonstrated our country’s progress in improving the living conditions of our population and in setting the issue of poverty as a priority on the social agenda and focusing the Government’s contribution on achieving clear  concrete and measurable goals to reduce poverty and the inequality gap. We have made notable progress in various areas. That is where we need to redouble our efforts so as to provide Panamanian citizens with a better future and so that all may benefit from a better Panama.In 2012  along with 17 other countries  Panama received the Americas Award for reducing poverty and hunger. On behalf of the people of Panama  we recently accepted an award from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization for reaching the goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger  between 1990 and 2015  by halving the number of people who suffer from hunger and by reducing the prevalence of undernourishment by 50 per cent or more  with respect to the levels in 1990-1992  now below five per cent. We are pleased with the work we have done.For the first time in history  humankind has the technological  economic and sociopolitical structures to eradicate extreme poverty. With an agenda for development coordinated between the public and private sectors and civil society  we can carry out a meaningful process that makes a difference and reaches everybody. Because of its capacity and scope  the United Nations has played a facilitating role  unlike that of any other organization  in order to coordinate the global conversation about development  and it has a special responsibility to its Member States to provide information  analytical thinking and experience from the field.In that regard  I wish to thank the Secretary-General for establishing a United Nations task force and in particular for convening the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  whose extraordinary efforts are now giving us more insights into a more productive discussion about what path we should follow. The post-2015 agenda should focus on eradicating extreme poverty from the face of the Earth within a set time frame. Countries have learned much about development. We have realized that development that is not sustainable is simply not development.The MDGs were silent on conflict and the effect of violence on global development  nor was the impact and importance of institutions that guarantee freedom of expression and the rule of law for development included. The Government of the Republic of Panama believes that we need to integrate the economic  social and environmental aspects of development more sustainably. For that we support the efforts resulting from decisions made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro and the work resulting from the meetings convened for the establishment of the High-level Political Forum.Global inequality is still prevalent and very much a part of this conversation. Some 1.2 billion people account for only 1 per cent of global consumption. The Republic of Panama has successfully reformed its trade  tax policies and transparency. In the same manner  we have reviewed the regulation of our financial markets and productivity. As a result  we have  as far as possible  charted a successful path towards development. It is clear that now we face even greater challenges  different from the previous ones.Financing development is not easy  but we have a great capacity and the patterns of productivity are becoming more sustainable and equitable. Panama supports the view that the post-2015 agenda must make sustainable development a cornerstone and not leave anyone behind.The original promise of the MDGs must be kept. The new route towards development must be transformed from reducing poverty to ending extreme poverty. Furthermore  the fight against inequality must be a substantial part of our development agenda and should be measured by the social inclusion generated from economic growth. The promotion and protection of universal human rights must be an integral part of a post-2015 development agenda.Similarly  institutions and the rule of law must be evaluated as contributions toward the development of countries. Equally  a sustainable planet is crucial not just for the growth of our peoples  but also for their survival. Finding a solution for global environmental problems should be a priority of the development agenda. That is why we support the integration of sustainable development objectives into the post-2015 agenda.Panamanians believe that unless we forge a global partnership  nothing we say in this Hall will be effective. We need a new spirit of mutual accountability that supports the post-2015 agenda and the work done by the United Nations towards that end. There is no doubt that the post-2015 agenda will depend on new economic partnerships and financing.The post-2015 agenda cannot possibly succeed without the active support of the Group of 20 and the institutions of economic cooperation and governance  such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. The General Assembly has been given an historic opportunity to promote a platform for global development  with so many leaders present here  together  with only one theme in mind. We believe that effective political leadership emanating from the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals and its forum can give us decisive momentum to make a legitimate change to our post-2015 agenda.As we ponder the post-2015 development agenda  we cannot set aside the purpose for which this Organization was created  namely  to ensure the maintenance of world peace  through undivided and full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people on Earth  without any discrimination. In that regard  we cannot let this moment pass without expressing the deep concern that Panama shares with many members of the Assembly on the grave situation in Syria. We condemn  in the strongest terms  the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population of Syria. We share the view that such acts constitute a crime against humanity that should be investigated and punished in accordance with the norms of existing international law. We firmly call upon all members of the Security Council to assume their responsibilities to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and international protection of the human rights of the Syrian people.We are concerned about the escalating violence in the Middle East and the veiled and open threats of the use of nuclear weapons  which infringe on the right of countries and peoples to live in peace in their territories. Our global Organization has the supreme duty to speak forcefully and clearly in support of world peace and the right of humankind to continue living on our planet. In this crucial time for life and survival on Earth  we must not fall into the habit of believing that nothing serious is happening and that life will still go on after the atomic mushroom cloud delivers its final verdict of death to every species on the planet. The number of interested parties in the Middle East with nuclear power and the capacity to introduce and test weapons of mass destruction in a conflict situation is sufficiently large that those of us gathered here cannot afford to ignore what is happening there. This is no time to hide our heads in the sand like ostriches  thinking that we can thereby stave off the danger that threatens us and save our lives. It is rather the moment to firmly demonstrate our collective responsibility to defend world peace and life itself.I wish to inform the General Assembly that my Government is aware of a request made by the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf  established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  to extend its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. Without objecting to the right of the Republic of Nicaragua to make such a request  as stated in paragraph 8 of article 76 of the Convention  my Government wishes to express its strong concern about the fact that the coordinates given in Nicaragua’s application constitute an unquestionable infringement on our maritime space and on treaties between the Republic of Panama and its neighbours  resulting in a reduction of our maritime area of 49 892.54 square kilometres. The serious concern on the part of the people and the Government of Panama is not motivated by Nicaragua’s request to extend its continental shelf but rather because  despite the fact that our two countries are connected through friendship  geographic and regional proximity and political and economic integration  we were not consulted before the request was made  so that we could consider all of its possible effects. The Republic of Panama  in accordance with its national Constitution  complies with the standards of international law and has always recognized the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as one way of achieving the pacific settlement of disputes  as laid out in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations.In that regard  we should also emphasize that according to article 59 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice  the decisions handed down by the world’s highest universal tribunal should neither benefit nor harm third parties. My Government is therefore compelled to categorically reject the Republic of Nicaragua’s attempt to delimit its maritime boundaries in this manner  since it violates existing treaties with the Republic of Panama that we have complied with in good faith  as well as our legitimate maritime rights  recognized and accepted by the international community in that area. In accordance with international law  I will produce all the necessary evidence to correct the Republic of Nicaragua’s efforts in this matter. But on the occasion of the current session  officials from both our countries have begun the process of resolving our disagreement  which I hope will soon reach a happy conclusion.Today I also wish to mention a third issue that is very important to Panama  the case of the merchant vessel MV Chong Chon Gang  sailing under the North Korean flag  detained in Panama since mid-July. My country  as a State Member of this international forum  complies with the norms and regulations of its internal bodies  and article 4 of our Constitution requires Panama to comply with the norms of international law. That mandate has governed all of our acts as a nation. The vessel in question was transporting undeclared war materiel from the Republic of Cuba destined for North Korea. Acting on intelligence that we obtained  we detained the vessel before its transit through the Canal on the suspicion that the cargo contained drugs. When the ship was seized  an enormous amount of war materiel — which  by definition and because of its destination  clearly violated Security Council Sanctions Committee mandates — was discovered hidden under 200 tons of raw sugar.In compliance with the mandates in question  my Government notified a panel of experts and invited them to Panama to verify the findings and confirm our initial impression  as presented by the drugs prosecutor who initiated the investigation under the Republic of Panama’s laws. The panel inspected the cargo and later made a preliminary report in accordance with Security Council resolutions. The evidence is now with the Security Council. My Government would like to emphasize the significance of the action it took  not just as a Member State but also in its promotion of respect for the decisions of this body and of the peaceful coexistence of nations. We are talking here about an unprecedented and possibly unique situation  at least on our continent  which is why I stress its importance today. Panama complied with its duty as a Member State  even in the face of possible risks  high material costs and potential consequences to be defined in accordance with Panamanian law  as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006)  1874 (2009) and 2094 (2013).As President of a sovereign nation  I have not come before this forum to demand action against the countries involved in the incident. Panama simply desires and requests recognition that our conduct was based on our firm wish to comply with the rules that the Organization has laid down. We will respect the results of the investigation  and we wish to make it clear that Panama has no issue with the States involved in the matter  which is why its settlement is not a bilateral one. We Panamanians did our duty  and the United Nations must now also do its duty  at a time when following the rule of law is the only way to solve the delicate international problems that threaten the peaceful and human coexistence of the peoples of the world. Panama and its people anxiously await just recognition of their act  which we see as an important precedent for our hemisphere. We call on the international community to implement programmes and solutions conducive to peace. Panama reaffirms its historical position that we should use the tools of mediation and dialogue to deal with all current conflicts in the region and to seek solutions that defend and protect the right of peoples to live and work in peace.Since the end of my term is approaching and this is the last address I will give to the General Assembly  I wish to say that I feel the satisfaction of a task completed as I leave Panama in the place it now occupies in the world. We leave behind a legacy of social and political stability and sustained high economic growth throughout the Latin American region  and we have helped to promote and build the common welfare of the Panamanian nation. I would like to cite some favourable statistics that illustrate our growth and social welfare  published by entirely credible international entities. On the index of human development for 2012  according to the United Nations  Panama is classified as a country of high human development  scoring 0.780 as compared to the average for Latin America  which is 0.741  and for the world as a whole  which is 0.694. In a country of 3.63 million inhabitants  1.83 million are men and 1.79 million are women  according to the United Nations Human Development Report 2013. On the literacy index  Panama is at 94.1 per cent  also according to the Human Development Report 2013. Panama invests 4.6 per cent of its gross national product in public expenditures for culture and health  the highest level in Central America  according to the Genral Treasury of the Republic. Average life expectancy in my country is 76.3 years  according to the Human Development Report 2013.When it comes to the enjoyment of political rights  we have a rating of 1 according to Freedom House in 2012. Panama’s competitive ranking on the 2013 index of the World Economic Forum was forty-eighth out of 148 countries reviewed  and its Fitch investment rating was upgraded from BB+ to BBB  indicating a stable perspective. Our Moody’s rating was Baa2  a stable perspective  and according to Standard and Poors we rose from BB+ to BBB  again indicating a stable perspective. The latest United Nations Conference on Trade and Development report shows Panama as one of the highest ranked Latin American countries for maritime connectivity. According to the 2013 index  Panama improved its score from 42.38 to 44.88  similar to Mexico  which moved from 38.81 to 41.80  while Brazil dropped from 38.53 to 36.88. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that Paraguay leads Latin American growth with an increase of 12.5 per cent in gross domestic product  followed by Panama  with 7.5 per cent.The International Monetary Fund estimates regional gross domestic product growth in the region as follows for 2013: Paraguay at 11 per cent and Panama at 9 per cent. In sum  Panama is on a firm path to full development  and with the support of the international community we will continue responsibly to meet the challenges that still face us in order to achieve the sustainable development for the well-being of all our citizens.The year 2013 has been one of great international events for our country. We will soon have the honour for the second time of hosting a Summit of the Americas  the thirteenth  when Heads of State and Government will discuss the Ibero-American community within the new global context as it pertains to the political  economic  social and cultural spheres. In November  we will also host the forthcoming Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption  which reflects the priority that our country accords to the struggle against corruption as a factor in development. In a similar vein  we will continue to advance projects for the establishment in our country of a regional hub for humanitarian assistance and of a regional centre of the United Nations for Latin America and the Caribbean. That project will serve as our contribution to the international community  with respect both to humanitarian actors and to the United Nations system  and expresses our full support for their efforts on behalf of those most in need.I am an optimistic man. I believe in human intelligence and in the capacity of our species to recognize errors and dangers in order to change course and ensure our continuity on this planet. Moreover  the nation of men and women of which I am the leader shares the dreams of a world united by its respect for life and by the way it values and loves the vast cultural heritage that has been built by generation upon generation of people. I am convinced that however great the challenges and dangers that lie in wait for us may be  we will know how to meet and overcome them with courage and intelligence. Nevertheless  I feel compelled to mention the great dangers that surround us today. Only through concerted  responsible action will we be able to overcome the difficult hour that faces humankind.Today  multilateralism itself is being sorely tested. We are facing one of the most serious and decisive moments in the history of the planet and the human race. At this unprecedented moment  the Organization will have to take serious decisions in order to honour its responsibility to our peoples with concrete results. The Governments of the world need to focus their efforts on raising the level of discussion so that our ambitious contract with humankind and our planet can be fulfiled in time. Not to do so in the face of all the destructive forces that exist on the face of the Earth  and to allow the passions that lead peoples and nations to conflict and war to be unleashed  would be to lose one of the last remaining opportunities for humankind. "
"135",5550,"PER",68,2013,"I am pleased to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  and to welcome the fact that this lofty responsibility has been entrusted to a dear friend from Antigua and Barbuda  a member of our community of Latin American and Caribbean States. You can count on the firm support of Peru in the execution of your work.At the outset  I wish to express our respect for and solidarity with the people of Mexico and Pakistan  who are suffering as a result of natural disasters. I also wish to express the strong rejection and condemnation of the Government and people of Peru of the terrorist attack in Nairobi. We are relieved that this horrendous attack has come to an end. We express our unwavering solidarity with the families of the victims and with the Government and people of Kenya at this difficult time.The world is changing  the agenda is realigning  new actors are emerging and new horizons are coming into view for the future of humankind. All countries and peoples are affected by such rapid transformation. However  we note with concern that some fundamental truths have not changed. Wars continue  mostly in new forms  emerging from the shadows and exacting an ever higher price from innocent populations.Regarding the Syrian tragedy  we express our solidarity with the Syrian people. Peru condemns the use of chemical weapons as unacceptable in all circumstances. It is an affront to humankind and a clear violation of international law. The Syrian people deserve an immediate solution to the bloody conflict ravaging their country. We therefore urge all parties involved to find a peaceful and negotiated solution that respects the mechanisms for the settlement of disputes. We also call on the Security Council to uphold its responsibility to maintain international peace and security.At the same time  inequality is becoming ever more extreme. The gap marginalizing the poor from the benefits of progress and development widens by the day  robbing them of the rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.It is crucial for us to strengthen  renew and uphold our global commitment to developing peaceful relations among peoples and to seeking solutions that reject the use of force as means of solving our problems. It is therefore particularly gratifying for Peru and a source of genuine pride that we addressed our maritime delimitation dispute with Chile in the most constructive and cooperative way possible  through a mutual commitment to abiding by and enforcing the judgment to be rendered by the International Court of Justice. This process will  I trust  transform the very nature of our relationship into a profitable and enduring coexistence for the future of our neighbouring peoples.The rule of law and its principles in the conduct of international affairs are therefore indispensable tools for our conduct as members of the community of peoples of the United Nations. However  the greatest threat to international peace and security falls not in the realm of relations between States  but transcends them and may even use them as tools for shadowy schemes. We are referring to terrorism  drug trafficking  organized crime  mafias and corruption. All of these crimes pose a genuine threat to life  progress and development  affecting primarily the poorest  which means that such crimes are increasingly becoming the main obstacle to the realization of the goals of the United Nations. The underlying problems remain the same. Peru therefore welcomes the fundamentally important theme you have chosen  Sir  for our discussions — the development agenda for beyond 2015  which is the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Our country  happily  has made progress and attained some of the best benchmarks for achievement. Since 2000  according to United Nations Development Programme indicators  we achieved certain goals early  in particular in the fight against poverty and extreme poverty  hunger  child mortality  and access to safe drinking water. In 2000  more than half of Peruvians lived in poverty; today  only a quarter of my countrymen still face that situation. Our goal is to reduce those living in poverty to one fifth of our population by the end of my term  in 2016.We have undertaken to realign the growth model by focusing on inclusion. In those efforts  the State is implementing a number of connected and interdependent policies. It is worth underscoring the unprecedented measure of devoting expenditure to the poorest and most excluded through a range of social programmes aimed at improving the living standards of the population  enhancing education for children and young people and promoting gender equality and access to health services  paying particular attention to those in vulnerable situations.We are deeply concerned to note that the environment is deteriorating  which is having an impact on our security  in particular that of the most vulnerable. This is happening even as we remain unable to agree on measures to ensure our sustainable development. The development agenda must also pay particular attention to the empowerment of women and the protection of vulnerable groups. Our Government attaches particular importance to the rights of indigenous peoples. We were the first in the world to legislate and regulate the right to prior consultation on measures directly affecting such groups in accordance with Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization.We are equally concerned about the rights of migrants and the opportunities for integrated development  to which they contribute  fostering inter-cultural dialogue and economic exchanges between their countries of origin and their host countries. In that vein  we have promoted the free movement of people and welcome the initiative of the Government of Spain to promote visa-free entry for Peruvian nationals into the Schengen Area .We therefore welcome the commitments contained in the document “The future we want”  adopted at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held last year (resolution 66/288  annex). The process proposed at that event to establish sustainable development goals should converge with the post-2015 development agenda  leading to the greater capacity of the Organization to contribute to solving urgent problems and dealing with development challenges. We urgently need to integrate the various separate efforts. The United Nations should have a single  comprehensive development agenda. But to do so  we need to change the equation and place the fight for equality and against inequality at the centre of our efforts. Let us not make growth an end in itself; rather  we should turn it into a tool. That is why in Peru we believe that the right formula is “inclusion for growth.” That is the direction Peru proposes for the post-2015 agenda.Peru has made a quantum leap in its economy. We are currently among the fastest-growing countries. Responsible management of our economy has helped to create 800 000 new jobs so far during my Administration and has also helped to reduce unemployment by 7 per cent. We are gradually diversifying our economy. Non-traditional exports account for one third of our total exports — more than $11 billion dollars today — and service exports account for $5 billion. We are developing our immense potential for tourism.The economic growth in recent years has been extraordinary  and I must say it has been the result of much effort  rigour and work  as well as democratic continuity and perseverance. Peru has managed both to avoid the worst effects of global instability and to attract levels of investment flows that are unparalleled in our country’s history. Our task is to strengthen the foundations that have enabled such growth  in particular by strengthening democracy  institutions  the rule of law and security  building citizenship and opening spaces for participation.We have the means to do that  since we are a country of entrepreneurs: 98 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized. They employ 75 per cent of the economically active population and contribute 42 per cent of the gross domestic product. Thanks to our efforts  Peru is now considered an emerging  middle-income country  with new middle classes and a growing domestic consumption  and it is able to attract long-term investments for large projects.Thanks to that and to the extent that we have strengthened our national capacities  we will be able to encourage industrial policies geared towards changing economic and social structures. For us  industrialization is a national goal. In order to move in that direction  in December Lima will host the fifteenth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.Being centrally located on the map of South America and having played a key role in Latin American history  Peru views its region from the perspective of a country that seeks consensus  both internal and external. Peru is a country that perceives regional integration as an effective way to improve the present and future of our security and development. We Peruvians have an overriding conviction that  on our own  we can move forward rapidly  but together we can do that better and reach farther.Peru is part of the Pacific Alliance  along with Mexico  Chile and Colombia. Together we are moving towards integration with a strategic projection towards the Asia-Pacific region and the world. In that region  which is home to the most dynamic economies of the twenty-first century  we are also part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. We hosted the Leaders’ Meeting in 2008 and will host it again in 2016.We are also a member of the Union of South American Nations  having recently completed our term as pro-tempore president. We participate in the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  which this year held its first summit with the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. We maintain our hemispheric roots through the Organization of American States  and at the subregional level  we are currently the pro-tempore president of the Andean Community. We consider all those forums to be complementary. We participate in them with a constant call for integration  dialogue and consensus.Peru is a reliable partner committed to global causes. Our commitment to the values and principles of the General Assembly brings us to point out the need for reform. That is necessary in order to make the United Nations system more legitimate  representative  accountable and effective through the strengthening of its principal organs  specialized agencies and various organizations in the areas of security  development and human rights. Peru shares the position held by a large number of Member States on the need to reform and expand the Security Council so as to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century.Our aspirations also entail more transparency and accountability on the part of individual economic actors and greater justice in the distribution of wealth. With those objectives in mind  in 2014 Peru will host the thirty-fifth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and in 2016 the fourteenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We thereby hope to contribute so that the Doha Round can be resumed  in the scope of the World Trade Organization  with better prospects.In many parts of our Latin America and in Peru  republican States were weak from the start  concentrated in the capital city. Their core problem has been therefore that they have been unable to deal with the entire nation and have focused perhaps on one third of the country. It was impossible to build citizenship  since in practice there were different categories of Peruvians: those who received Government services and those who did not.Our efforts must be directed at the creation of a twenty-first-century State  a State that serves all  not just a few. While this includes an eminently ethical component  its basis is not restricted to that important dimension. It also has profoundly practical repercussions for society at large. We cannot forget that a State that does not serve the entire population breeds and exacerbates inequality. As long as such degrees of inequality exist – and I will never tire of saying this - any policy aimed at combating poverty will have only relative effects.For that reason  my Administration has worked not only on economic growth but in all areas of growth. The history of my country has seen other periods of growth  but they proved to be unsustainable and benefited very few. Economic growth is a means and not an end; it is an indispensable tool  but it is not sufficient. Our people  especially those who are most forgotten  cannot wait indefinitely for growth without the State actively promoting the extension of its benefits.In addition  that will set in motion a virtuous circle in which progress for our most vulnerable countrymen and the development of a population free of extreme poverty  with health care and education for all  will create the conditions for even greater economic growth. That is why we stress the new political concept of simultaneous growth and redistribution. That is what I mean when I stress the necessity of “including so as to grow”.Two years ago  less than two months into my term as President of Peru  I stood before the Assembly to emphasize my Government’s commitment to social inclusion. I said then that we were working to turn our economic growth into development and quality of life for my countrymen. I also said that we intended to hone our democracy so that it could solve the problems and meet the needs of all. The country we want is a prosperous one where all the Peruvians  women and men  without any distinction  can enjoy the benefits of growth in a dignified  safe and free manner. After two years in office  I reaffirm what I said; our commitment remains the same."
"136",5597,"PHL",68,2013,"On behalf of the Philippine Government  I proffer my warmest congratulations to the President on his election. I wish him success and assure him of my country’s steadfast support for his presidency.The theme that has been selected for this session is indeed timely and relevant. We must start setting the stage for the new development agenda that will succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) framework. Barely two years before its deadline  considerable work still lies ahead of us. For instance  the global economic and financial crisis has underscored the need for reform towards greater systemic coherence; the multilateral trading system remains frozen in the past; and the persistence of an outdated development paradigm results in policy prescriptions and conditionalities inimical to the interests of many developing countries.As we set the stage for the post-2015 framework  let us reaffirm the very raison d’être of the United Nations  which is to accord every person the opportunity at a life that is secure  progressive and dignified. That purpose is enshrined in the Philippine Constitution and is central to President Benigno Aquino III’s social contract with the Filipino people. Under President Aquino’s leadership  my country has embarked on a journey along a straight path — or  as we say in Filipino  “daang matuwid” — resolving to work towards inclusive growth  combating corruption  promoting transparency and accountability  improving global competitiveness  making better use of resources  achieving just and lasting peace  and upholding the rule of law.The Aquino Administration firmly maintains that good governance is good economics. As a result  the Philippines is reaping the first fruits of its hard work. In the past four quarters  the Philippine economy has experienced unprecedented growth of over 7 per cent. As a result  the Philippines won three investment-grade ratings and is now considered a growth engine in the region.These glowing reports are  of course  well received by my Government  but we are under no illusion that these indicators alone constitute success. For the past 13 years  the MDGs have been integrated into the Philippine development plan for 2011-2016. Yet our work continues and the challenge we now face is clear. It is how to ensure that growth is inclusive  resilient and sustainable. As we pursue the path towards this very type of growth  my Government is guided by the following important lessons learned from our experience in working towards the Millennium Development Goals.First  strong institutional arrangements are necessary. For the Philippines  that means that the highest political support is given to the attainment of the MDGs  involving all branches of Government and other key stakeholders.Secondly  specific policies  programmes and projects must be aligned with national development goals. In our MDG experience  innovative social protection programmes include conditional cash transfers  universal health care  the comprehensive and integrated delivery of social services  a K-12 basic education programme  and a community mortgage programme.Thirdly  the active participation of various stakeholders — namely  the private sector  civil society  non-governmental organizations  the constituents and international development partners — must be strongly promoted and supported. This ensures that policies and programmes are responsive and inclusive.Fourthly  local Government units should be empowered. Beyond the delivery of basic social services  the capacities of local Government units in formulating and implementing policies and programmes must be strengthened and guided by the principles of transparency and accountability.Fifthly  the capability to generate accurate  timely and relevant data at the national and local levels must be enhanced.Sixthly  disaster risk reduction must be mainstreamed to enable communities to better cushion the impact of man-made and natural disasters. Building the capacities of national and local stakeholders to help reduce the vulnerability and increase the physical and economic resilience of communities must be a key development goal.These important elements will further enrich the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2012-2018 for the Philippines. With the overall theme “Supporting inclusive  sustainable and resilient development”  the United Nations Development Assistance Framework seeks to fully align United Nations work with the Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016.My Government is actively participating in the international discourse on sustainable development and in crafting the post-2015 development agenda. The Philippines was one of 66 countries chosen by the United Nations to conduct open  inclusive and transparent consultations with a broad range of stakeholders aimed at generating perspectives on how the post-2015 development agenda framework should look. We took to this task earnestly by undertaking consultations with more than 500 stakeholders representing the Government  civil society  the business community and academia.Our national consultations on the post-2015 development agenda have identified the following building blocks of the new framework  as well as the development themes deemed most relevant to the Philippines. These building blocks are composed of four principles  five themes and various development enablers  and were offered to the United Nations system as the Philippines’ contribution to the ongoing discourse.We need look no further than the United Nations Charter to identify the building blocks for the global post-2015 development agenda. For this agenda to be relevant and responsive  it must be anchored in four main principles: human rights; equality  equity  people empowerment  social cohesion and justice; accountable governance; and inclusive development.My country has identified five pillars that we believe will address our own specific development challenges. These pillars represent the areas where progress is most needed to build a rights-based  equitable and sustainable society. These pillars are poverty reduction and social inclusion; environmental sustainability  climate change and disaster risk management; accountable  responsive and participatory governance; a fair and stable order based on the international rule of law; and peace and security.My Government will formulate and implement policies that will be defined by these pillars. These policies will duly be integrated into my country’s national development agenda  and progress will be monitored at regular intervals. On the global front  the Philippines proposes that the duration of the post-2015 development agenda should be 10 years  with a major review to be undertaken by 2020. Reforms should be front-loaded within the first half of the period to pave the way for substantive accomplishments by 2020.Allow me to further elaborate on aspects of the principles and themes the Philippines has put forward. The Philippines continues to aspire to a global economic system that places development at the centre and promotes democracy in international economic decision-making. Ultimately  it behoves us to consider reform of the overall global economic system as we craft a sound  sustainable development agenda.To achieve meaningful reform  what we need now is a strong political impetus from all of us to make this happen. Governments must see beyond political differences and agree to work together to ensure a level global playing field. It is for this reason that the Philippines staunchly supports the High-level Political Forum on sustainable development goals.The post-2015 development agenda should squarely address migration. It is a cross-cutting issue relevant to our efforts to promote human rights  reduce poverty and foster sustainable development. The Philippines  for its part  will continue to advocate the protection of the rights of migrants  regardless of migration status; the recognition of migrants’ positive contribution to development in the sending and receiving countries alike; and the creation of programmes that support families  especially the children who are left behind.Our national experience of these issues will be my Government’s contribution to the discussion in the forthcoming High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development later this week. In addition  we hope to include in the discussion the plight of migrants who find themselves in conflict areas — a situation that my Government has had to address in recent years. In several instances  we have repatriated Filipino workers to get them out of harm’s way.Our experience has been instructive and enriching  as it has opened for us new windows of cooperation with our bilateral partners  as well as with the United Nations  the International Organization for Migration and other international organizations. My Government wants to focus international discussion on the plight of these migrants  with a view to forging creative platforms on which States — whether countries of origin  transit or destination — can cooperate to better address this complex issue.The Philippines hopes that the High-level Dialogue will reaffirm that migration is an indispensable element in the global sustainable development agenda. Migration influences each country’s socioeconomic growth  human capital and involvement in global affairs. Managing migration through policies that uphold the dignity of the individual should therefore be a vital component in the development agenda of each nation and of the world.Achieving sustainable development requires an enabling environment of peace  security and the rule of law. It is to this end that my Government’s approach in managing conflicts within and outside its borders is anchored in international law. As such  we avail ourselves of the various means for the peaceful settlement of disputes  including mediation and arbitration  in accordance with Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter.As declared by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/10  on the peaceful settlement of international disputes  otherwise known as the 1982 Manila Declaration  recourse to the judicial settlement of legal disputes should not be considered an unfriendly act between States. On the contrary  it is a measure that generates clarity  benefiting all stakeholders. In this spirit  my country reaffirms its unwavering support for the International Court of Justice and the various specialized tribunals  such as the dispute settlement mechanisms of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The Philippines has also relentlessly and tirelessly pursued the peace process in the southern Philippines. The signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was a milestone in this regard. We remain steadfastly committed to achieving just and lasting peace that will be inclusive for all.Furthermore  in accordance with the application of the rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes  the Philippines  as a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and a staunch advocate of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  also welcomes Syria’s accession to the Treaty. The Philippines hopes that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will effectively assist the Syrian Government in disposing of its chemical weapons stockpiles.The Philippine Government’s commitment to peace is resolute. This commitment is demonstrated in its continued participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions  particularly in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the occupied Golan where  despite the dangers  our peacekeepers have stood their ground. Their courage to stay and hold the line at the most critical time led to the continued fulfilment of UNDOF’s mandate as charged by the Security Council.The post-2015 development agenda also demands that Governments address the devastating effects of climate change and natural disasters. My country is among those at highest risk from typhoons  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. In terms of disaster management  my Government has instituted a cluster model that mobilizes both Government and non-governmental entities at the local and national levels  as well as international partners. The United Nations has recognized this model as a best practice that other countries could emulate. We will continue to share our knowledge and experience in disaster-risk reduction  preparedness  response and recovery to help other States better manage similar occurrences. In 2015  we will also actively participate in the World Humanitarian Summit and in the review of the Hyogo Framework for Action  our blueprint for disaster risk reduction cooperation.The year 2015 marks an important juncture in the history of nations. It will mark the beginning of a new era of sustainable development  one  it is hoped  that gives every individual on this planet a better chance at a better quality of life. That may sound ambitious; it may even sound daunting. Yet  this is an historic time and historic times call for acts of great ambition. Our national hero  Mr. José Rizal  also recognized the importance of ambition and ideals. He wrote that“it is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great ideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without becoming a part of any edifice”.Let the post-2015 development agenda be the edifice upon which we will manifest the collective dreams and ideals of humankind."
"137",5616,"PLW",68,2013,"At the outset  let me extend my congratulations and appreciation to the President of the General Assembly for his leadership and work with the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to the Secretary-General for his continuing leadership.The Palauan flag depicts a yellow full moon against a blue ocean. That combination of moon and ocean is a metaphor for nature’s balance and harmony through the consistency of the rising and falling tides. Just before I left to come to the General Assembly  during a full moon high tide  my back yard  which nestles against the ocean  flooded. Typhoon Usagi passed through the Pacific just a few days later and landed in Asia  killing many people. It was followed almost immediately by Tropical Storm Pabuk.When I was a child  my back yard did not flood and we did not have tropical storm after tropical storm pass through our Pacific islands. It is therefore as clear to me as it is to other Pacific leaders that the full moon and the ocean are no longer metaphors for balance and harmony. Today they represent imbalance from our past excesses and a lack of harmony due to our current inability  as the Secretary-General has so often said  to create the world we want.The leaders and the people of the world certainly face many challenges moving forward in creating the world we want and in developing a sustainable future. In addressing the next round of sustainable development goals and in responding to the ever-growing challenges of global warming  it is imperative that we all do a better job of working together to solve the serious issues that we face.World leaders at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio established a positive and rational vision of partnership and sustainable development for the world. Unfortunately  that vision seems to have been sidetracked. There is therefore frustration in many countries today related to our failure to move that vision forward  the slow pace in progress in meeting our joint goals  and the fear that those goals are being diluted.Today  it appears that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has stalled  that the Kyoto Protocol is on life support  and that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development has not done enough to strengthen our three pillars of sustainable development. Our job as leaders is to reinvigorate our efforts by establishing real mitigation commitments and identifying immediate  sufficient and long-term implementation financing.Together  we reaffirmed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities at Rio and moved forward with the green economy approach to sustainable development issues. We must not allow our green economy to become business as usual. Rather  we must take concrete actions to make real our stated reaffirmation of the principles of the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development. Only then will our sustainable development goals discussed at this session of the Generally Assembly have a real chance to respond to our current worldwide environmental and developmental emergency. It is clear that what is needed today is leadership — leadership from the developed world and leadership from the developing world; leadership that focuses beyond borders and looks farther than today’s problems; ultimately  leadership that creates a broad consensus vision to preserve our planet for tomorrow’s children. Such leadership must be based upon concrete and clear principles that will help guide all of our actions.First  all nations  large and small  must accept direct and primary responsibility for global issues that threaten our planetary future  and must immediately take appropriate action. Secondly  we must protect the natural resources of all people and all nations  and recognize that no nation has the right to pollute the resources of another. Thirdly  we must recognize the need for the richer nations of the world to actively address actions that threaten the poorer nations of the world. Fourthly  we must protect human resources through governing strategies that focus on broad-based education  health  jobs and equal opportunities  and that acknowledge cultures  traditions and homelands. Finally  we must agree  in all matters  to promote and protect the human rights and peaceful existence of all the people of the world. Discussion  not weapons  is the best way to resolve differences and uphold human rights.Let me interject here that as we witness so many areas of conflict on our planet  I think it is time for all of us  as leaders  to use this great institution and our own efforts to condemn violence against people  including the use of chemical weapons  for any reason  and to seek an end to armed conflict wherever we can. The events in Kenya are but one of a series of violent acts against people that we must work together to eliminate.Our global warming doomsday is already set in stone if we fail to act. It is therefore our job as leaders to take all necessary action to eliminate the current threat. My country  along with other Pacific island nations  is unwilling even to discuss a 3°C-to-5°C temperature-increase scenario by the end of the century  for that will ensure our demise. We are also unwilling to discuss the issue of migration. Instead  we will continue to work with our developed partners to implement strong mitigation commitments and follow-through action to hold the line on that increase to a more realistic 1.5°C level.My small Pacific country supports the concepts inherent in the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  issued at the Pacific Island Forum this year. The Declaration acknowledges the gross insufficiency of current efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. It also recognizes the necessity of ramping up climate change responses immediately and provides a platform for country leaders to establish new and realistic reduction commitments. As leaders  we must all respond to global warming in both the short and long term  from the top down and the bottom up  both pre-2020 and post-2020.We should not forget  however  that the primary responsibility for reducing greenhouse gases still rests with our developed partners. We must therefore use the opportunity of the nineteenth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Warsaw  and thereafter  to support the technical work needed to fast-track the policies and technologies appropriate to accomplishing our goal; to revive the Kyoto Protocol or develop a more responsive alternative  and deliver and expand on commitments to reduce greenhouse gases; to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that distort world oil prices; and to arrive at a legally binding agreement to respond to and compensate for loss and damage associated with the impact of climate change in vulnerable countries.Here at the United Nations in New York  we must deal with global warming security issues by appointing a special representative on climate and security to help expand our understanding of the security dimensions of climate change  and by establishing a joint task force  led by the Secretary-General  to assess and expand United Nations capacity to respond to the security implications of climate change. We must make 2014 the year of ambition. As host of the forty-fifth Pacific Islands Forum  Palau pledges to use that summit to build on the Majuro Declaration and to drive greater action. As leaders  we must also come to the Secretary-General’s climate change summit next year ready to discuss the new mitigation actions we are prepared to take and the plans necessary to see that they are fully implemented.My country is trying with all its might to embrace its leadership on issues of sustainable development. To date  Palau has committed to providing 20 per cent of its energy through renewable sources by 2020 and to reducing energy consumption through efficiency and conservation efforts. We have also declared and begun to implement the Micronesia Challenge  which commits the Micronesian region to effectively conserving at least 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent of terrestrial resources by 2020. In that effort  Palau and other Micronesian jurisdictions have strengthened or established more than 150 protected and managed areas covering more than 680 000 hectares  leveraged more than $20 million in operational funds and inspired other efforts  such as the Caribbean Challenge  the Coral Triangle initiative and the Western Indian Ocean Coastal Challenge.In addition  we have recently sponsored the creation of a Pacific Islands Forum invasive species advisory group to improve regional efforts to reduce the expansion of invasive species throughout the Pacific. Palau has also pioneered the planet’s first shark sanctuary and  finally  recently engaged to pursue our most ambitious commitment to date — establishing the world’s first comprehensive marine sanctuary  which will close Palau’s exclusive economic zone to commercial fishing. We ask all the nations of the world to move in a similar direction  while recognizing their own unique circumstances  to help protect our planet’s natural resources. An example of one simple action that would have a major impact on saving our shark population would be the prohibition of shark’s fin soup. That is something that everyone in the world can clearly do without.We are at a historic global moment. A year from now  the United Nations will launch the sustainable development goals  in a framework that will define the relationship between our peoples and our planet for generations to come. Through those goals  we must commit to a more sustainable use of the oceans. They cover two-thirds of the world’s surface and connect 90 per cent of its population. A billion people are dependent on their fish. The oceans’ health is undeniably linked to our culture  societies and economies. Yet in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the oceans received no mention. As the MDGs wind down in 2015  we need a new paradigm.It is therefore time to enunciate our commitment to our oceans with a sustainable development goal that deals exclusively with them. Drawing from the lessons learned from the MDGs  we as leaders must create a goal that is resonant  measurable and easily communicated. Failure to do so will leave us naked before the shifting tides. In our sustainable development goals  we must also focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  which cause two-thirds of the world’s 57 million deaths annually. Within that context  we should also recognize that tobacco consumption  which was not included in the MDGs  has a direct impact on worsening NCDs and must therefore be separately targeted.None of our leadership goals can be achieved without strong partnerships. Fortunately  Palau has been blessed over the last half-century with strong regional and international partners. I would first like to acknowledge the more than 50 years of support and leadership shown to us by the United States. We stand with the United States in its ongoing efforts to guide the international response to the horrific actions in Syria. We are also grateful for its very generous economic support over the years  and for being a reliable ally on which we can depend. We look forward to the final completion of the treaty that will renew and reinforce our relationship.Palau would also like to acknowledge the significant support we have received over the years from our friend Japan. We are hopeful that expansion and reform of the Security Council will result in permanent membership of the Council for Japan. In addition  we would like to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic support in helping Palau to achieve its Millennium Development Goals and move on to the post-2015 development agenda through grants and technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure  food security enhancement and human capacity. We strongly support Taiwan’s expanded participation in the United Nations system  acknowledge the expansion of its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms  and call on the United Nations system to accept Taiwan’s participation as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts.Beginning with the leadership of those assembled here  and working down to every level of international action and cooperation  we can respond  in a timely and expedited fashion  to the real emergencies we face. But the time for excuses is over. It is now time for leaders to lead."
"138",5657,"PNG",68,2013,"I am honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of Prime Minister Peter O’Neill and the people of Papua New Guinea. I also wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. We welcome your overarching theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  advocating a solid global foundation for a results-oriented partnership that is people-centred and inclusive in our common pursuit of sustainable development. Papua New Guinea pledges its support to you as you take on that important task. We acknowledge the contributions of your predecessor and wish him well in his future endeavours.I take this opportunity to address the Assembly on the state of our economy  highlight the challenges before us and put forward the policies and development plans of my Government.Papua New Guinea continues to be a vibrant and thriving democracy. However  as experienced by other developing nations  the road has not been easy in terms of the political  economic and social challenges that have confronted us domestically and globally. In the past  our development efforts have been littered with missed economic opportunities. My Government is therefore determined to reset the development and wealth-creation direction for our nation.We have set a transformative agenda for our country and people under our long-term Papua New Guinea Vision 2050 policy framework and five-year medium-term development plan. We are determined to achieve those development plans  as they continue to reinforce our work aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals and making progress on the post-2015 development agenda.Our economy continues to record unprecedented growth levels  which can be attributed to a stable Government with responsible and sound monetary and fiscal policies. Such positive economic growth complements the Government’s long-term development policies aimed at stimulating the economy and achieving our development aspirations. Strategies to strengthen economic growth include reinvesting in key enablers  such as infrastructure  health and education  so as to maximize opportunities and improve the lives of our citizens.My Government is harnessing that positive economic growth to address and improve our social indicators  including low literacy levels and high maternal and infant mortality rates. We have also embarked on a major strengthening of law-and-order enforcement infrastructure. This year  50 per cent of our budget has been allocated to education and basic health care  law-and-order enforcement  and critical infrastructure improvement.My Government is committed to a public-private partnership model as an important catalyst for national development. We are also committed to strengthening existing programmes and networks with the private sector  churches  donor agencies and non-governmental organizations through cooperative and mutually beneficial arrangements.We are equally committed to investing in provincial and local-level government so as to improve service delivery for the majority of our population living in rural areas. We firmly believe that such partnerships will create an enabling environment and empower our people to take ownership of their lives and be proactive in nation-building.My Government has also embarked on investor-friendly policies  supported by public-private partnerships and prudent economic management  so as to promote growth in key non-mining sectors. In that connection  my Government is reviewing taxation policies with a view to providing incentives and concessions and encouraging strategic investments in areas that are critical to driving our economic growth. Exporting our raw materials is not an option. We therefore encourage downstream processing through genuinely joint ventures and other acceptable economic cooperation.My Government is committed to strengthening governance at all levels by combating corruption. We have adopted the principle of zero tolerance. To that end  the Government has adopted a national anti-corruption strategy and established an independent task force with powers to investigate and prosecute. An independent commission against corruption will be established to enhance the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.Given the importance of cross-border security and related issues  a national security policy is in the final stages of completion. The focus of that policy is on dealing with national security issues as contained in pillar 4 of the Vision 2050 policy framework. In line with our national security policy  we are committed to rebuilding our disciplinary forces and institutions as well as continuing our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.My Government is committed to addressing some of my country’s unflattering international human development indices  including those regarding human rights issues. We recognize our development challenges  including gender-based violence  sorcery-related deaths  access to social services and the low level of representation of our women in the public and private sectors. In our assessment  many of those human rights and human development reports are exaggerated and insensitive  with scant attention paid to the positive efforts by the Government to promote and protect basic rights for all our citizens. Over the past six months  my Government has enacted the Family Protection Law and repealed the Sorcery Act of 1971  effectively making domestic and sorcery-related violence criminal offences.I am pleased to announce that my Government has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The instrument of ratification has been deposited with the United Nations at this session.In recent months  there have been many reports about Papua New Guinea’s bilateral agreement with Australia on the regional resettlement arrangement for asylum-seekers. Papua New Guinea  as a State party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol  recognizes the importance of addressing that international humanitarian issue. Our two Governments are jointly working on the issue and call upon the international community to support our efforts. Furthermore  we call upon like-minded Member States and other stakeholders to assist our efforts to address the root causes of the displacement and dislocation of people  as well as to combat human trafficking and people smuggling.As an emerging economy in the Pacific region  Papua New Guinea will enhance its level of engagement on issues of mutual concern  both within the region and globally. In the spirit of friendship and neighbourly South-South cooperation  we are committed to sharing the benefits of our natural resources development with our Pacific island neighbours. We have embarked on that path by providing development assistance to our neighbours  including the Solomon Islands  Fiji  Tuvalu  Marshall Islands  Tonga and Samoa.Through the Melanesian Spearhead Group  we are forging dynamic and strong bonds in areas that include trade and investment  education and training  judicial support  sporting and cultural exchanges and visa arrangements to facilitate the movement of skilled persons. To further consolidate such very important partnerships at the regional level  we are collectively reviewing the relevance of the Pacific plan in relation to regional integration. Papua New Guinea is playing a leading role in that review exercise.Papua New Guinea supports the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  entitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  as the basis for the post-2015 development agenda. That agenda addresses balanced human development  including issues relating to eradicating extreme poverty and improving living standards for humanity. We also support inclusive economic growth  while preserving the environment for future generations. We welcome the work of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the creation of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development  which succeeded the Commission on Sustainable Development. Both serve as a good starting point for driving the agenda forward.Papua New Guinea and the Pacific small island developing States call on the international community to support the inclusion of the oceans as a stand-alone sustainable development goal. We are now in the initial stages of preparing a sustainable development policy and strategy for our country  which is to complement our long-term Vision 2050 policy framework. We welcome support from the international community to enhance that work. Papua New Guinea is pleased to note that the sustainable development issues of small island developing States are a priority on the General Assembly agenda  further reaffirming the importance of the Rio+20 outcome document and the relevant General Assembly resolutions. Your two visits this year to our Pacific region  Mr. President  underscore your commitment to small island developing States  for which we applaud you. We look forward to the strengthening of that important work during your presidency.As the global community prepares for the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in September 2014 in Apia  Papua New Guinea reiterates the call for small island developing States to remain a special case for sustainable development. The adverse impacts of climate change continue to be of serious concern to the global community  but especially for small island developing States. While contributing the least to that threat  small island countries are not only suffering the most from the serious impacts of climate change but also run the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels.We support the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  recently adopted by Pacific Island Forum leaders. We therefore reiterate the challenge to the international community to accept its responsibilities and its leadership role. We also urge the international community to renew its political commitment to prioritize the sustainable development issues of small island developing States in the post-2015 development agenda. As part of our continued efforts  I am pleased to note that Papua New Guinea has now become a member of the Governing Council of the Global Green Growth Institute.Papua New Guinea agrees that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  despite their shortcomings  have galvanized the international community’s development efforts to shape the post-2015 development agenda. We agree with the view expressed in the Secretary-General’s 2013 annual report on the work of the Organization (A/68/1) that we should remain focused and redouble our efforts to consolidate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for improved outcomes. We also welcome the outcomes of the recently concluded high-level special events on the MDGs and on disability and development during the sixty-eighth session.Papua New Guinea is unlikely to achieve most of the MDGs by 2015. However  my Government remains committed to implementing the goals beyond 2015. We have tailored our Millennium Development Goals targets and indicators in accordance with our 2011 to 2015 medium-term development plan and the Vision 2050 policy framework. We are making progress in the areas of universal primary education enrolment  poverty reduction  reduced infant and maternal mortality rates  combating HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and other health issues and strengthening gender equality and empowerment.Papua New Guinea expresses its appreciation for the support it has received from United Nations agencies and other development partners complementing our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.I am pleased to report on the continued progress in the implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement and the successful scaling down of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We thank the United Nations  regional partners and the international community for their continued assistance in both instances.On international peace and security issues  Papua New Guinea remains concerned about conflicts and tensions in various regions of the world  including in the Middle East  North Africa  the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea. We urge all parties involved to defuse the situation through peaceful dialogue.We join the international community in condemning the use of chemical weapons in Syria and urge full compliance with the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We therefore commend the Security Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013) with a view to dismantling and eradicating Syria’s chemical-weapons programme.Since October 2011  Papua New Guinea has been contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Sudan and South Sudan. Earlier this year  we became the 148th State Member of the United Nations to join the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. We are now looking at expanding and increasing our troop contributions. We also pay tribute to the United Nations peacekeepers serving around the world  often in very trying conditions  and especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives.We express our concern over the lack of progress on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. As a strong supporter of a nuclear-free world  Papua New Guinea calls on the United Nations and the international community to address that serious lack of progress. We also need to revitalize United Nations disarmament work so as to foster international peace and security. Papua New Guinea welcomes the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty  which will regulate the trade and transfer of conventional arms  including small arms and light weapons.Finally  Papua New Guinea welcomes the leadership of the Secretary-General in reforming the United Nations system. We encourage robust and constructive reforms in the context of the growing budgetary constraints faced by the United Nations in recent years. A lean  effective and responsive United Nations is imperative so that it can better deliver on its mandate. We also call for the Security Council to be reformed in order to reflect today’s geopolitical realities."
"139",5703,"POL",68,2013,"First of all  I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. John Ashe for his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. In one month’s time  it will have been 70 years since the Foreign Ministers of the four major Powers agreed to set up a universal organization dedicated to ensuring international peace and security. In Moscow  in 1943  high representatives of the United States  the Soviet Union  China and the United Kingdom took that decision in the very midst of the most devastating war in human history. They knew that maintaining peace and the creed of “war no more” required harmonious and concerted international cooperation. They knew that it required collaboration among the great Powers and respect for the principles of international law  as well as the building of infrastructure for peace. The declaration published back then rightly spoke of the need to act for justice among nations. That is important  because it is from injustice or from the sense of a lack of justice that many conflicts  both internal and international  have originated and continue to originate.On the eve of that anniversary  it is worth examining to what extent the international community copes with threats to peace and with open-ended  prolonged disputes. The Organization and its States Members are right to be satisfied with the body of work produced since then to help maintain security and peace. The United Nations has proven to be an instrument that  since the Second World War  has made international relations more civilized in very many areas  not just in relations among countries but also within them. Understandably  the world is still far from ideal  but we should not lose heart. A better world is possible  and we should not lose sight of that. That is the real ideal outlined in the Charter of the United Nations  and it is a duty that belongs to all of us  the Members of the Organization.The justified satisfaction with the progress made  which was ensured with the aid of the United Nations and enjoyed by the whole of humankind  cannot hide the weaknesses of the Organization and its ineffectiveness in situations it was set up to resolve. One such current situation is the civil war in Syria. That conflict has led to a large number of victims and has created a major humanitarian crisis. It is a threat to regional security and stability. In such situations  Members of the Organization are authorized to demand efficient action by the Security Council. That is a justified expectation of ours based on Article 24 of the Charter. Regrettably  we must conclude that in the Syrian dispute  members of the Security Council have spoken out for individual sides in the war and supported them in various ways  rather than make the parties stop fighting and commit to peace talks. That has revealed the lack of capacity and efficiency of the decision-making mechanisms of the United Nations.Thisis all the more reason not to procrastinate or wait for another anniversary as a pretext to return to our efforts to reform the Security Council in a way that would also bolster its authority  legitimacy  representativeness and effectiveness. We are talking about a more systemic solution that would not limit the Security Council but would go beyond the Council by reinforcing its representativeness. We are thinking today about the significance of the original principle of the right to veto of the Security Council’s permanent members  in the light not just of current or future challenges but also of the changes in the global international order  which are unfolding before our very eyes. It would be beneficial if the discussion about those issues could follow a formula similar to the one that proved successful prior to the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization  which brought about a rather ambitious reform agenda for the Organization  some of which found its way into the World Summit Outcome adopted by Member States in 2005 (resolution 60/1). Poland was an active participant in that work and intends to continue its engagement for further necessary reforms.The Syrian tragedy  including the use of chemical weapons  is symbolic of a broader phenomenon — the ignoring of international values  norms and obligations adopted by the Organization and the entire international community. After all  they should apply to everybody to the same degree  with no one set outside or above them. Too often  the immediate national interests of countries have the upper hand. That leads to tragic consequences in terms of human rights and humanitarian issues  including the principle of the responsibility to protect  for which we had such high hopes when it was adopted in 2005. Armed conflicts are an extreme manifestation of the mass violation of human rights. The tragic development of the situation in Syria  which has claimed more than 100 000 victims by now  could have been prevented  especially if the Security Council had adopted the necessary decisions early enough. Therefore  the solution of the difficult  complex and interrelated problems of the Middle East entails a comprehensive  imaginative and impartial approach.In a context where everyone is focused on security issues — including new  non-traditional ones  and where the dominant concerns are the economy. crisis mitigation  the fight for growth and competitiveness  competition for markets and land that could provide valuable raw materials for economic development — we cannot forget about human rights. Recently  many actors in the international arena have failed to care about them. But is it possible for us to ignore them  when  for instance  the violations are too close to genocide? Let me remind the Assembly that this year  on 9 December  we will be celebrating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  which was  by the way  initiated and drafted by the Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin. The message from his research and initiatives  which started in Warsaw in the early 1930s  is as follows: we must be alert and sensitive to the symptoms of future violations of human rights; it is our duty to respond to them and not just show moral outrage. As the effectiveness of the response depends on international cooperation  the United Nations is to be a centre for such international cooperation. The United Nations is the best  and often the only  such centre. We must not allow the instruments for the protection of human rights developed by the United Nations to be eroded. Their effectiveness will depend upon whether we remain united  and not just in name. It is necessary to establish a mechanism that would  in an objective and uncontroversial manner  force harmonious cooperation between the permanent members of the Security Council in the face of situations that fall under the principle of the responsibility to protect  in order to ensure that the prevention of such crimes and the effective response to them prevail over individual geopolitical interests.The practice of exploiting children in armed conflicts is particularly saddening and causes a lot of outcry. The fact that many Governments tolerate such practices and that the Organization  despite existing conventions and protocols  is unable to do more in this area is unacceptable. Let me remind the Assembly that the Convention on the Rights of the Child was also developed on Poland’s initiative. For children  their safety  development and rights  it is the family that matters most. Looking at the family and its role in society makes us aware of how much the family means when it comes to respecting human rights. We are particularly sensitive to that in Poland.What in many countries is a tangible but slight deficit in the exercise of economic and social rights  while in many others it is poverty and chronic underdevelopment. Poverty and underdevelopment are not just human rights issues and factors that undermine the dignity of the individual and entire social groups. They are also the reason that individuals and nations are unable to ensure survival on their own  or to fulfil their creative potential for their own benefit and that of humankind. That is why international efforts aimed at helping regions and countries that suffer poverty and are constantly underdeveloped are so important for them to be able to take the path of sustainable growth and stop being chronically dependent upon external assistance. First and foremost  however  that is necessary so that fundamental human rights are respected and local residents regain their sense of dignity in order for their inherent potential to serve the development and enrich the diversity of the human civilization.Those objectives will be served by the climate negotiations that Poland is going to chair when the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change takes place in November. We know in Poland that just one single generation can be enough to make unbelievable progress. When communism fell in 1989  Poland was a poor country  economically ruined and badly indebted. It needed international aid  not in the form of non-repayable borrowing but debt relief and restructuring  technical and training assistance  access to markets of better developed countries and foreign investment. Coupled with the hard-working nature and entrepreneurial spirit of the Poles  that has all borne fruit in abundance. Since then  our gross domestic product has increased by approximately 400 per cent  while our emissions have dropped by more than 30 per cent  as compared with the baseline year. That attests to the fact that it is possible and realistic to achieve economic growth while curbing the growth of harmful emissions. Obviously  we are aware that there is no single formula for everyone and no single path to sustainable growth. There are different baseline circumstances  environments and cultural and geographical conditions. The Polish example  however  and that of other post-Communist countries  should be considered in other regions of the globe. The same is true for the European development model of the European Union  which strives to combine democracy and human freedom  economic competitiveness  social justice and solidarity. It is not about being Eurocentric. It is an experience most appreciated by those who come to Europe from the furthest parts of the world and want to stay there. Do not be misled by the economic crisis in the European Union  which most countries in the Union are already beginning to overcome. The European development model remains universally attractive. Our experience also suggests that even the most generous foreign assistance will not replace efforts made internally by a country. It is frequently an indispensable precondition  yet is insufficient in itself. Internal efforts and factors — the freedom and empowerment of individuals  economic freedom and the stability of the State — always form the foundation. Good governance is another important aspect of successfully pursuing sustainable growth  as it combines democracy  self-government  human rights  competence  a lack of corruption and the primacy of the interest of the country as a whole over particular interests  whether they are political or economic. The entire notion of good governance is spelled out in a resolution of the Human Rights Commission initiated by Poland in the late 1990s. Only with good governance in place can international aid bring about desirable results in combating poverty and taking the route of sustainable growth.Poland is an active participant in the international community  and not just through its bilateral relations and membership regional organizations such as the European Union  or supra-regional ones such as NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We are also trying to create a better international order by being active in the United Nations. Poland  an unflinching believer in the purposes and principles of the United Nations  is convinced that it is necessary to respect the treaties and commitments made by the Organization — by us — and supports institutions and programmes that facilitate their implementation. For years  one of the priorities of our policy has been the promotion of human rights and democracy. Poland currently holds the presidency of the Human Rights Council. The European Endowment for Democracy was established on Poland’s initiative as well. Our country’s share in development aid is growing  particularly within the European Union. Next November  Warsaw will host the climate summit  where we will preside over the most important development process  namely  that of climate-related negotiations.Poland has always been active in efforts aimed at ensuring the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  particularly chemical weapons. Drawing on our experience and rich relations with other countries  we wish to continue to contribute to reinforcing international peace and security. That is why we are seeking a seat on the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. We believe that as a member of the Security Council  we will be able to help achieve the purposes and principles of the United Nations  as well as represent the interests of Member States in line with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations."
"140",5729,"PRK",68,2013,"First of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  allow me to congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that his competent leadership will lead this session towards success.The Millennium Summit  held in 2000  advanced peace and security  sustainable development and the protection and promotion of human rights as the three key objectives of the United Nations. Ever since the inception of the United Nations  humankind has aspired to build a new  peaceful world  free from war  while at the same time aspiring to achieve common prosperity and development based on cooperation among Member States. That aspiration  however  is far from coming true  even after a new century and the passage of the first decade of the new millennium.A high-handed and arbitrary approach is becoming ever more rampant in international relations. Infringements upon sovereignty  interference in internal affairs and regime change continue unabated under the pretexts of non-proliferation and the protection of human rights  for which the United Nations is being abused. Confrontation between forces with different interests  States and civilizations  and wars large and small  keep taking place in different parts of the world  severely damaging the credibility of the United Nations  whose primary mission is to ensure peace and security.Those developments clearly demonstrate that sustainable development and the real protection of human rights will remain a figment of our imagination as long as there is no peace and security as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. International relations should reject any State’s high-handed and arbitrary approach on the part of a State that undermines peace and security in order to achieve genuine cooperation and development among countries based on the sovereign equality of States. The unjust intervention  pressure and use of force that is unfolding in Syria by way of infringements on its sovereignty and territorial integrity  which further breach peace and stability  should not be allowed under any circumstances  and the United States blockade against Cuba should be brought to an end at the earliest possible date.The international community unanimously demands the elimination of all nuclear weapons and encourages the building of a nuclear-weapon-free world through nuclear disarmament. As agreed at a High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament held during the current session  on the initiative of the Non-Aligned Movement  negotiations on nuclear disarmament should begin without further delay to work on universal legal instruments that codify negative security assurances and the prohibition of nuclear weapons  among other things.The choice of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the theme for the current session serves to highlight the importance of sustainable development for world peace and our common prosperity. We have little time left before the 2015 deadline for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  including poverty reduction in particular. However  much to our regret  international efforts in that regard have not produced the long-overdue results. By identifying and successfully attaining the post-2015 sustainable development goals  practical measures need to be taken to address issues such as establishing fair international economic relations  transferring environmentally sound technology to developing countries and strengthening financial support.Despite international efforts towards the protection and promotion of human rights  high-handedness and double standards are becoming ever more visible in United Nations human rights forums  targeting developing countries as selectively as in the past. Politicization  selectivity and double standards should be put to an end in such forums  and no one should be able to justify or allow the continuation of a situation where the human rights situation in some countries is either called into question or simply ignored in accordance with the political purpose and interests of the West and Western values.The reform of the United Nations is becoming an issue that brooks no further delay in achieving the major United nations goals to which I have referred in the twenty-first century.In addressing key international issues  the General Assembly should be empowered to have the final say  since it represents the overall will of the entire membership. In particular  Security Council resolutions pertaining to peace and security  such as those on sanctions and the use of force  should be made effective only under the authority and with the approval of the General Assembly. Instances of the Council being abused by a certain State as a tool of strategic interest should never go unchallenged.Last January  under the manipulation of the United States  the forcible adoption of an unfair resolution on sanctions took place (Security Council resolution 2087 (2013)) by making an issue of our legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes — something that was conducted and recognized under international law. That represents a typical example of how and for what purpose the power of the Security Council is being abused. The reform of the Council  which is a key component of reforming the United Nations  should be undertaken on the basis of principles for ensuring accountability  transparency and impartiality in its activities  thereby ensuring the full representation of developing countries in its composition.Today in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  the entire population is engaged in an all-out campaign to build a thriving socialist State in the nearest possible future  under the wise leadership of the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un. Marshal Kim Jong Un  the supreme leader of our people  gives continuous on-the-spot guidance across the country  offering direction and innovative ways for speeding up economic development and the improvement of people’s livelihoods.Practical measures are being taken  one after another  to revitalize the overall national economy  bringing about success in the fields of economic development and improving people’s welfare. Nothing is more precious than creating a stable and peaceful environment for the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Korean people  who helped build economic power and improved people’s livelihoods as part of the Government’s overall objective. Although our efforts for peaceful development are faced with grave challenges  the Korean people will surely bring about the day of final victory by advancing with full confidence and optimism  united single-handedly around Marshal Kim Jong Un and under his wise leadership.Sixty years have passed since the gunfire that ended a fierce three-year-long war and the signing of the Armistice Agreement in the Korean peninsula last century. Yet there is still no mechanism in place to guarantee peace  resulting in the continuation of the unsustainable situation — one of neither war nor peace — on the Korean peninsula.With the aim of achieving military domination of North-East Asia  the United States  using the Korean peninsula as a stepping stone  has designated the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as its primary target of attack and is beefing up its military presence in South Korea and the vicinity. Furthermore  it stages a series of war exercises against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea every year  with massive build-ups of hundreds of thousands of troops and modern military equipment  continuously escalating confrontation and fuelling tensions.The United Nations Command  the outdated legacy of the Korean War  continues to serve the United States military strategy by abusing the name of the United Nations. The United Nations Command  which has nothing to do with the United Nations  continuously conducts military actions threatening the Korean peninsula and its surrounding area in the name of the United Nations under the baton of the United States. That shows that resolution 3390 (XXX)  which the Assembly adopted at its thirtieth session and which calls for the dissolution of the United Nations Command  remains nothing more than a piece of paper. It also shows to what extent the credibility of the United Nations has been undermined.The repeated vicious cycle of mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula has its roots in the hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The United States designated the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  with its different ideology and system  as its enemy from the very day of its foundation and has refused to recognize its sovereignty and has imposed all sorts of sanctions  pressure and military threats on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for more than half a century.The only way to ensure lasting peace on the Korean peninsula is to bring the hostile United States policy to an end. The United States should abolish its hostile policy by  among other things  respecting the sovereignty of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace mechanism  dismantling the United Nations Command without further delay and lifting all sanctions and military threats.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains consistent in its stance and in its efforts to put an end to the tensions on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiations  and to contribute to ensuring peace and security in the region. In order to achieve genuine peace and ease tensions on the Korean peninsula  we are making every possible effort and displaying maximum patience.Reunifying the country is a long-cherished desire and the most pressing task of the Korean nation. As we entered the new century  North-South summit meetings were held on two occasions  with joyful enthusiasm shared by all our countrymen  adopting the 15 June North-South joint declaration and the 4 October declaration  thus providing a milestone for reconciliation  collaboration and reunification between the North and South of Korea.Thanks to the active and generous efforts of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  a window of opportunity has opened for improving North-South relations after a long period of deadlock. However  the outdated confrontational approach we are coming up against from the South Korean authorities risks driving relations back into a destructive stage.As clarified by the 15 June joint declaration and the 4 October declaration  the only way to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country and to open the way forward for the nation is to promote dialogue and cooperation between the North and South of Korea by joining hands in the spirit of the Korean nation itself.We will work hand in hand with anyone who truly seeks reconciliation and the reunification and prosperity of the nation. We will strive to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification through the concerted efforts of the nation under the 15 June joint declaration and the 4 October declaration.In conclusion  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue to strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all States Members of the United Nations  support the placing of the situation on the Korean peninsula under stable management as a member of the international community  and fully exercise its responsibility and role in ensuring world peace and the common prosperity of humankind  pursuant to its foreign policy of ideals  independence  peace and friendship."
"141",5774,"PRT",68,2013,"As this is the first time that I take the floor before the General Assembly  at the headquarters of international legitimacy and multilateralism  I would like to begin by reiterating Portugal’s firm and unwavering commitment to the United Nations  its Charter and the values and principles that guide its action.I congratulate the President on his election. His long international career and vast experience in the United Nations system have placed him in a privileged position to preside over the central organ of the Organization. His election reflects a recognition on the part of all Member States of the strong commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism of his country  Antigua and Barbuda  the Caribbean Community and the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. I would also like to convey my country’s acknowledgement of the dynamism and dedication with which the President of the General Assembly at its previous session  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  performed his duties. I wish also to express special appreciation for the Secretary-General’s untiring work in defence of peace during an extremely challenging period for the international community. As always  the Secretary-General can continue to count on Portugal’s support. I take this opportunity to strongly condemn the terrorist attack that occurred in Nairobi and to deliver a message of solidarity to the authorities and the people of Kenya. Acts such as those remind us that efforts to combat terrorism continue to be of paramount importance. We will not live in a world of peace and liberty or in an environment of tolerance and mutual respect until we eradicate terrorism.The Organization was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  basing its action on faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person. The United Nations has undertaken much in its 68 years to achieve those goals globally. Unfortunately  in many regions those goals remain an illusion. Such is the case in Syria  where the horrors of war and the unspeakable suffering of the population now prevail. The devastating images that reach us daily show a country that is being physically destroyed. The numbers speak for themselves: more than 100 000 dead  almost 7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance  4 million internally displaced persons and 2 million refugees. A tragedy on that scale is the result of serious and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law  aggravated by the recent and unacceptable use of chemical weapons  something we believed had been universally banished forever.The world was shocked at the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta on 21 August. I want to be very clear about this: the use of chemical weapons represents a violation of international law  a heinous crime and a regression from civilization. We cannot stand idle in the face of such a violation of the barrier between civilization and barbarism  a barrier that the international community has vowed never to cross again. We  the members of the Assembly  once again face a serious international crisis where we are in a position to reaffirm the centrality of the United Nations in solving it. With the Security Council blocked and powerless  it was the absence of the United Nations in the period when prevention and control were still possible that allowed the Syrian crisis to reach such dramatic and unacceptable political and humanitarian proportions. We would certainly have had fewer casualties and refugees  and would surely not now be dealing with a huge international crisis resulting from the use of chemical weapons. Now  when an agreement has been reached to remove the threat posed by the chemical arsenal of the Syrian regime once and for all  the international community has again turned to the Security Council.I would like to commend the enormous political and diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia  with the involvement of Joint Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. The commitment and spirit of compromise that they demonstrated in the process enabled them to arrive at an important agreement and the adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  which  hopefully  will ensure its implementation. The Security Council  in close collaboration with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  has assumed its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations  finally creating a prospect for hope for a global political solution to the Syrian issue. It is now essential that we seize the opportunity created by the initiative on chemical weapons to consolidate the political-diplomatic track and hold the “Geneva II” conference. Nevertheless  the primary responsibility for resolving the Syrian crisis lies with the parties to the conflict. Without their will and commitment  no political solution is possible. The international community must keep up the pressure on the parties  particularly the Damascus regime  with a view to achieving a peaceful and sustainable democratic future in which every sector of Syrian society feels represented.The Middle East has also seen some positive recent developments with the resumption of the peace process between Israel and Palestine. I would like to reaffirm before the Assembly Portugal’s full support for that process. I congratulate the United States of America on its initiative and applaud the Palestinian and Israeli authorities for the courage and leadership shown in their decision to resume negotiations. There can be no lasting peace  stability or security in the Middle East unless the question of Palestine is settled. The present opportunity to ensure security for all and justice  finally  for the Palestinians must not be missed. We have a unique opportunity to find a peaceful solution on the basis of United Nations resolutions and internationally agreed parameters that establishes a sovereign  independent and viable Palestinian State and addresses Israel’s security concerns.Also in the Middle East  we have been following with great concern the prolonged deadlock in the search for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. It is regrettable that  despite all the diplomatic efforts and pressure on the part of the international community  no solid progress has been made so far. Nevertheless  we view as positive signs the recent statements made by high-ranking Iranian officials  in particular by President Hassan Rouhani here in the General Assembly (see A/68/PV.6). I appeal to the Iranian authorities to translate those encouraging political signals into concrete steps conducive to a negotiated solution that can restore the international community’s confidence in a peaceful and civilian Iranian nuclear programme.Another issue of concern is the situation in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  where the constitutional order has been subverted since the coup d’état of 12 April 2012. As a member of the European Union  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) and the United Nations  and in close coordination with the Economic Community of West African States  as well as through bilateral measures  Portugal is continuing with its efforts to help the people of Guinea-Bissau overcome the current crisis. We acknowledge the work done by Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ramos-Horta to promote a dialogue among the main political actors with a view to restoring the constitutional order. The formation of an inclusive Government was  in that sense  a step forward.However  restoring constitutional order and normalizing Guinea-Bissau’s relations with the international community require that presidential and legislative elections be held  in accordance with the commitments undertaken by the current Guinean authorities and as reiterated in the press statement issued by the President of the Security Council on 11 September. We are  however  very concerned about the possibility that has been raised of a new extension of the transitional period. The international community should also emphasize that for the elections to be free  fair and transparent  the current authorities must guarantee that all Guinean citizens  without exception  can participate in those elections  in full enjoyment of their rights  including the rights of the freedoms of speech and association. Only a new Government that enjoys the legitimacy conferred by a free popular vote and is appointed in accordance with the Constitution can promote long-overdue reforms in the security  administration and justice sectors.The crisis in Guinea-Bissau also has clear and worrying connections with the Sahel region through drug-trafficking routes. Europe  and especially its southern countries  is following the situation in the Sahel with particular concern. I can assure the Assembly that we will continue to make every effort to help stabilize the region. In that context  the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel represents a major contribution.Portugal is currently co-President of the Western Mediterranean forum known as the 5+5 initiative  which brings together 10 countries on the northern and southern Mediterranean coasts. The dialogue and confidence-building that that informal instrument provides represents important added value for its members and the region. We are therefore engaged in exploring all of its potential for cooperation.The Charter of the United Nations defends the importance of using international mechanisms to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In the noble spirit of the United Nations and following the historic and inspiring launch in 2000 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the current session of the General Assembly will be a critical launching pad for defining our priorities and the path we will follow in our common efforts towards the 2015 summit at which we will adopt our development principles and goals for the coming years.I commend the President for the timeliness of his choice of theme for this general debate  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. On 25 September  I had an opportunity to participate in the special event on the Millennium Development Goals  which enabled us to thoroughly discuss the progress achieved to date on the MDGs and provide important guidance for our future work. It is our conviction that the set of MDGs should serve as the reference point for establishing the new development agenda  which should maintain a focus on poverty reduction and sustainable development in all its dimensions  while giving special attention to the needs of least developed countries.But we need a broader  more inclusive and strategic vision. We must go beyond the traditional relationship between donors and recipients to create partnerships that involve new international actors. For Portugal  different modalities of assistance  new sources of financing and a strengthened principle of shared responsibility  leadership and ownership on the part of developing countries are the main guiding principles for the post-2015 development agenda. The inaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development was politically highly significant. Portugal remains committed to ensuring that the Forum acts as a catalyst for international efforts  ensuring a more efficient and coherent link between the various processes in the area of sustainable development and poverty eradication.In the context of the outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  I would like to stress the importance of progress on the issue of oceans  which is a crucial matter for a maritime country like Portugal. We welcome Member States’ commitment to discussing the issue of the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. In this context  Portugal is strongly in favour of the negotiation and adoption of an international instrument in the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Reforms and institutional innovations such as those I have just mentioned represent important changes in the architecture of the United Nations  adapting and preparing it for new times and new challenges. However  the reform of our Organization will never be complete without Security Council reform  including of its working methods and  above all  of its composition. It is increasingly difficult to justify why countries such as Brazil and India are not permanent members of the Security Council. As stated on previous occasions  Portugal is of the view that Africa also deserves permanent representation in that body. It is imperative that Africa be treated in a way that is just and reflects its size  economic growth and its weight in today’s world.I take this opportunity to congratulate the African Union and its member States on the fiftieth anniversary of the continent’s regional organization.Portugal firmly believes in multilateralism and in the United Nations as the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends. We contribute actively to the work of our Organization through a committed participation in its bodies  but we have not yet had a chance to serve on the Human Rights Council. We therefore hope to be able to count on the support of the Assembly in the elections for that body to take place in 2014. We accept and have implemented virtually all of the 86 recommendations that resulted from our experience in the Council’s universal periodic review (UPR) of 2009. We will submit to a new UPR in 2014. If the Assembly invests its trust in us to elect us to serve for the 2015-2017 triennium  we will fulfil our mandate in the deep conviction that the United Nations human-rights-protection system should remain strong  independent  impartial and demanding  and that  in this regard  we should always resolve to aim higher. We will continue in the same vein as we approached our membership of the Security Council in 2011-2012  characterized by openness to dialogue and by a constructive and balanced attitude  and seeking to build bridges and generate consensus  without relinquishing values and fundamental principles.The Portuguese language is the common element of unity that brings together the diversity of States of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. We are a Community of eight countries  with about 250 million speakers spread across four continents. Portuguese is the third most widely spoken European language in the world  with a growing role and status on the international scene  both as a vehicle of communication and as an economic language used in trade and business  culture and social networks.In October  Lisbon will host the second conference on the status of the Portuguese language in the international system  at which participants will consider the challenges faced by their common language. Portuguese is currently the official or working language of several international organizations  including some specialized agencies of the United Nations. The CPLP has the ambition and goal of seeing Portuguese adopted as an official language of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to salute the Mozambican presidency of the CPLP and its efforts to strengthen and deepen our Community.I conclude by wishing the greatest success for the General Assembly at this session. The Assembly can count on Portugal’s active contribution and support in upholding international law  promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes  defending and promoting human rights  and working towards greater prosperity for all of humankind."
"142",5820,"PRY",68,2013,"As President of the Republic of Paraguay  I have the great honour to speak in this global forum to address issues that are relevant to my country and to today’s world in general.I extend a special greeting to the President of the Assembly  Ambassador John Ashe  as well as to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in appreciation of their work towards the noble goals that unite us. Through their efforts  they contribute to the legitimacy of the United Nations and help to ensure multilateral cooperation and the international validity of the rule of law.It has been little more than a month since I took office as President of the Republic of Paraguay  after an exemplary electoral process that culminated on 21 April  when the Paraguayan people went to the polls to freely exercise their guaranteed constitutional right to elect their Government  with irrefutable results. Electoral observer missions from various regional and continental organizations  and from the United Nations itself  were present and certified the legality  legitimacy and transparency of the elections and the electoral process  whereby the will of the people honoured me with the highest office of our Republic. Those events also represent the conclusion of a long transition towards democracy in Paraguay. For the second  time in our history  executive authority was consecutively transferred from one political party to another with full respect for the constitutional framework. That is no small achievement in our 202 years of independence  and it signals the true beginning of a new historic and auspicious period for my country.Republican institutionalism  the building of consensus  the strengthening of the democratic system  unconditional respect for human rights  and freedom of speech and of the press are the cornerstones of my Government  which aims to be an exemplar of patriotism  honesty  inclusion and effectiveness  with the capacity needed to propel Paraguay towards its destined greatness.The people of Paraguay have been waiting for a great Government for a long time. I hope to be able to deliver on that great vision  which will position my country firmly on the global stage  where we want to stand out by ensuring that we are a land of opportunity for Paraguayans and foreigners alike. As has been said  Paraguay is one of the most closely guarded treasures of Latin America  and there are good reasons to hope that it will have a promising future.I have made combating poverty a priority for my Government. It is incomprehensible that a nation so rich in resources should have so many poor. We will give no quarter in the fight to reduce our poverty indicators as much and as quickly as possible. Change is coming  and not through aid but by ensuring human dignity. Social investment is at the forefront of my Administration’s agenda. That is the new direction we want to take in my country  with investment that is for the people  so that they may live in dignity and become the engine of our development  and  better still  so that the general welfare of the people can become the firm basis of our democracy.My Government has also committed to a policy of zero tolerance for corruption and an end to impunity. We expect to face that challenge with the firm support of the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General.Paraguay’s economy has enviable numbers. We are the only country in the region that has not altered its currency  the guaraní  since it was first introduced in 1943. Our macroeconomic indicators are more than encouraging. Paraguay is clearly suited to investment. Nature has endowed my country with an enviable climate  more than 90 rivers  abundant and fertile soil and clean  renewable energy generated by three hydroelectric power plants. One  Acaray  is entirely Paraguayan-owned  while Itaipu and Yacyretá are co-owned with Brazil and Argentina  respectively. The latter are among the largest hydroelectric plants in the world. We have one of the world’s largest freshwater reserves  the Guaraní Aquifer  a great part of which lies beneath Paraguayan territory.Apart from the advantages of nature and abundant  clean and renewable energy  the majority of Paraguay’s population is young  with more than 75 per cent under the age of 30. Our tax system is favourable to investment and our economic growth clearly exceeds the average for the region. My Government is committed to ensuring legal security  with clear and transparent rules for safeguarding people and their property.Today we are a country with a revitalized economy and a focus on efficiency  transparency and a reliable public administration. A few weeks ago I was present in our Congress at the signing of an agreement for Paraguay  whereby the political parties represented in the legislature  along with other social institutions  committed to working together on framework agreements and plans of action to strengthen governance and attain material and spiritual goals for the people’s welfare. In that way  we are seeking to maintain the general good over that of the individual. We do that through dialogue  which is the main instrument of democracy. Together  we assume the responsibility of making Paraguay a country of opportunity for all.After visiting countries in Europe and the Americas recently  I reflect on the great challenge posed by the perception of my country beyond its borders. I have seen with satisfaction the respect  admiration and interest that Paraguay and its enormous potential give rise to. Just as it is our responsibility as Paraguayans to build predictability and reliability  it is for the branches of the Government to provide the legal security necessary for Paraguay’s overdue progress.I would like to underline my Government’s commitment to the defence and promotion of human rights  which in Paraguay are fully acknowledged in the Constitution. We assume that stance out of genuine conviction  while my country is also a respectful signatory of recognized international instruments in that field.The demands of landlocked developing countries like Paraguay must be adequately addressed. Apart from that  my Government is committed to overcome the disadvantages posed by our inland status  making our geographic position an advantage in communications  logistics and infrastructure that connects the world’s zones and regions through Paraguayan territory. In a manner similar to that in which an old border dispute between Paraguay and Brazil finally gave way to what today is Itaipu  transforming a problem into a majestic work of integration and development  we hope that our landlocked position in the heart of Latin America will serve as a development hub for Paraguay and its neighbours.On the international level  I cannot avoid mentioning the upheavals that disturb our times. Economic crises  financial disasters  civil wars and the use of weapons of mass destruction cloud the horizons of great regions of the planet. The events in Syria are a concern for all of us  and the United Nations must play a pre-eminent role in finding a definitive solution to the conflict affecting that country. In that regard  my country calls for supporting the implementation of the framework agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation.My Government has observed with satisfaction that the Republic of China on Taiwan has achieved a greater presence in the specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations  thanks to solid international support and a rapprochement between both parties on the Taiwan Strait. My Government will continue to encourage the positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international sphere.The calm and determination of the nations and the organizations able to help in conflict resolution are more necessary than ever. Paraguay encourages peace  dialogue and development in harmony with the other countries and the world  promoting an integration that is respectful of the rule of law  the dignity of nations and the asymmetries. Integration is a phenomenon that in this global era cannot be halted. Paraguay understands and promotes integration in conditions of equality as a means for supranational insertion  but under fair conditions and looking towards a common future  not as a simple courting of Powers or being a silent guest in global forums that are discussing the future of our peoples.Paraguay’s contribution is essential in today’s integrated reality and is indissolublely linked to our dignity as a free nation  sovereign and independent  under the premise of the right to the self-determination of peoples and the principles of non-intervention and the legal equality of States. The true destiny of the people of Paraguay is to become a prosperous nation  living in social peace  liberty  justice and equality. My management of the Government is geared towards creating and strengthening an environment suited to the unlimited opportunities that my country offers for all Paraguayans and for foreigners who have chosen it. I have realized that my people neither want nor seek handouts  but opportunities to achieve dignity through work and study. My country therefore today presents itself to the world as a land of opportunities for investment and prosperity  with security  formality  reliability and predictability.On this occasion  I cannot fail to mention a key issue — education. Traditional political discourse has significantly undermined certain core ideas that my Government intends to definitively turn into a reality. Much has been said about the need for education  security and health  but little has been done in that regard. Improving education in Paraguay  in terms of quantity and quality  is a fundamental premise of my Government. Today more than ever before  the great change that must take place in Paraguay and the opening of a wide window of opportunity depend on an efficient and inclusive educational system. Institutions of public education should rethink their role in society and assume an unprecedented role as a breeding ground for leaders for a new Paraguay  with a skilled workforce adapted to this millennium  in an interconnected world where those who possess more knowledge  information and abilities are more likely to find more and better opportunities for work  well-being and personal advancement. Those countries that emphasized education from the beginning are proud of their results. There is a clear and direct relationship between education and development. Education is therefore key. The issue is rooted in the quality of training and is the key to escaping geopolitical shakles  backwardness and a lack of opportunities. For my country  the new rules that govern the world therefore represent an access to the ocean of development.Speaking before the Assembly and the world for the first time as President of the Republic of Paraguay  I present the new direction that the Paraguayan people freely and sovereignly chose on 21 April. I belong to a nation whose children have contributed to history with their prowess and boundless sacrifice  such as the supreme sacrifice by our greatest hero  Francisco Solano López  Field Marshal and President of the Republic  who decided to give his life  sword in hand  fighting on the front lines with his last soldiers  rather than see his homeland humiliated. I have decided to devote myself to the service of Paraguay and to bring about the real change that my country demands  which is to return to the path of the true Paraguayan destiny of peace  development and modernity  and to grow in harmony with all nations of the world  particularly with our neighbours.I assure the General Assembly that my country is a very generous and attractive place. I invite the world to learn more about Paraguay  to discover the treasure that pulses in the heart of America  ready to write anew the most glorious pages in its history  today in peace and social and economic development  with dignity and readiness to welcome all those who wish to share in our great destiny.We Heads of State are transients in Government. History will judge us for what we have done for our peoples and will sternly hold us accountable for what we have failed to do. To honour the trust and hope of my people  I have decided to commit myself wholly to the service of my homeland and to do everything necessary for its greatness and prosperity.Paraguay considers it necessary  more than ever before  to give greater impetus to the negotiating process between Israel and Palestine in order to attain a lasting peace  so that Israel and Palestine can live side by side with secure borders and in peace. As a final comment  I wish to convey my most sincere condolences to the people of Kenya for the casualties that resulted from the terrorist attack  an act that we most vigorously condemn."
"143",5839,"PSE",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. on his outstandingly successful presidency of the General Assembly at its previous session. I would also like to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency at its current session and to wish you every success.I am pleased  indeed honoured  to address the Assembly today for the first time in the name of the State of Palestine  following the Assembly’s historic decision on 29 November of last year to raise Palestine’s status to that of a non-Member Observer State. As representatives of their Governments and peoples  Members have championed justice  right and peace  while affirming their rejection of occupation and standing for principles and ethics and on the side of peoples yearning for freedom. For that  I once again offer my deepest thanks and gratitude today on behalf of Palestine and its people. The Palestinian people celebrated resolution 67/19. They rightly felt that they were not alone in the world and that the world stood with them. They celebrated because they realized that the overwhelming result of the Assembly’s vote meant that justice was still possible and there was still room for hope.I assured the Assembly last year that our quest to raise Palestine’s status was not aimed at delegitimizing an existing State  the State of Israel  but at consecrating — I repeat  consecrating — the legitimacy of a State that should exist  which is Palestine. I have also affirmed before the Assembly that our quest was not intended to affect the peace process  nor is it a substitute for serious negotiations. On the contrary  our quest is supportive of the choice of peace and has revived a process that was  in truth  moribund. As we have repeatedly affirmed and proved in practice  the State of Palestine  which abides by the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions of international legitimacy  will exercise its role and uphold its responsibilities within the international system in a positive and constructive manner that reinforces peace.A new round of negotiations was launched a few weeks ago  thanks to the tireless and appreciated efforts of the President of the United States  Mr. Barack Obama  and of the United States Secretary of State  Mr. John Kerry. I affirm before the Assembly today that we have begun those negotiations and shall continue them in good faith and with open minds  strong will and determination and a sharp focus on success. I assure Members that we shall respect all of our commitments and foster the atmosphere most conducive to continuing the negotiations seriously and intensively  while providing guarantees for its success and aiming at a peace agreement within nine months.As we engage in a new round of negotiations  we must remind everyone that we are not starting from a vacuum or from point zero  nor are we lost in a labyrinth without a map or a compass  at risk of losing sight of the destination. The goal of the peace that we seek is defined and the objective of the negotiations is clear to all  just as the terms of reference and the basis and foundations of the peace process and of the agreement we seek are longstanding and within reach.As for the goal of peace  it is embodied in redressing the historic  unprecedented injustice that befell the Palestinian people in the Al-Nakba of 1948. It is the realization of a just peace  the fruits of which can be enjoyed by the Palestinian and Israeli peoples  as well as by all the peoples of our region.The objective of the negotiations is to secure a lasting peace agreement that immediately leads to the establishment of the independence of a fully sovereign State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on all of the Palestinian land occupied in 1967  so that it may live in peace and security alongside the State of Israel. The negotiations must also resolve the plight of Palestine refugees in a just  agreed-upon solution  in accordance with resolution 194 (III) and as called for by the Arab Peace Initiative.We reaffirm our refusal to be drawn into the whirlpool of a new interim agreement aimed at the perpetuation of an interim State with interim borders  or to enter into transitional arrangements that will become the fixed rule rather than an urgent exception. Our goal is to achieve a permanent and comprehensive agreement and a peace treaty between the States of Palestine and Israel that resolves all outstanding issues  answers all questions and allows us to officially declare an end to the conflict and to all claims.The terms of reference and parameters of the negotiations  their goals and the basis of the agreement we seek are all found in the Assembly’s historic decision to upgrade Palestine’s status  as well as in the countless resolutions of this body and of the Security Council and those of the League of Arab States  the European Union  the Non-Aligned Movement  the African Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In fact  over the years  the parameters have become the basis of an international consensus  indeed  near unanimity.Exactly 20 years ago  precisely on 13 September 1993  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people signed  together with the Government of Israel  the Declaration of Principles Agreement on the White House lawn in Washington  D.C  in the presence of our departed leader  Yasser Arafat  and Yitzhak Rabin  the late Israeli Prime Minister  the King of Jordan and former President Bill Clinton. Some five years earlier  on 15 November 1988  the Palestinian National Council had adopted our programme for the achievement of peace  thereby taking an extremely difficult decision and making a historic  painful and harmful concession. However  as representatives of the Palestinian people  and having long been aware of our responsibilities to them  we mustered the necessary courage to accept a two-State solution  namely  Palestine and Israel on the borders of 4 June 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian State on 22 per cent of the land of historic Palestine. Thus we realized our part in achieving a historic settlement  upheld our obligations and fulfilled all of the requirements from the Palestinian side as set by the international community  in order to attain peace.At the same time that the PLO affirmed its choice of peace as a strategic option and a solution resulting from negotiations  the PLO firmly repudiated violence and affirmed an ethical  principled rejection of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — especially State terrorism — while affirming respect of international humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions.As a genuine historic breakthrough  the signing of the Oslo Accords led to an unprecedented political movement that fostered great hopes and generated high expectations. The PLO worked with dedication to implement the Accords in order to end the occupation and to realize a just peace. However  20 years on  the picture appears dispiriting and bleak: great dreams have been shattered and goals have become more modest. As much as we felt in those days that peace was at hand  today we realize how far we are from it  for the goal of the Accords has not been achieved  its provisions have not been implemented and its deadlines have not been respected. All the while  ongoing intense settlement construction  which aims to change the facts on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory  has violated the spirit of the agreement  struck at the core of the peace process and caused a deep fracture in its cornerstone  that is  the two-State solution.The start of a new round of negotiations is good news  but it cannot serve as grounds for complacency or an exaggerated sense of tranquility on the part of the international community. The negotiations we are undertaking today with the Israeli Government under the auspices of the United States require that the international community exert every effort to make them succeed  namely  through international and regional organizations and individual States upholding the international consensus on the goal of peace  the objectives of the negotiations  the terms of reference and the basis for a permanent peace agreement.However  at the same time  the international community is asked to remain vigilant. The international community must condemn and put an end to any actions on the ground that would undermine negotiations. In that regard  I refer above all to the continuation of settlement construction on Palestinian land  particularly in Jerusalem. There is an international consensus among the countries of the world  international and regional organizations and the International Court of Justice on the illegality and illegitimacy of those settlements. The position of the European Union with regard to settlement projects is a positive model of what can be done to ensure an environment supportive of and conducive to negotiations and the peace process. It is also imperative that the near-daily attacks on the religious sites in occupied Jerusalem  the foremost of which is the Al-Aqsa Mosque  cease  as the continuation of such attacks will have dire consequences.History is the best teacher. It teaches us that waging war  imposing occupation and building settlements and walls may provide temporary quiet and temporary domination  but they certainly do not ensure real security or guarantee sustainable peace. Such policies may create a specific reality on the ground  but they certainly do not create a right or provide legitimacy. Such policies may impose weak stability  but they cannot prevent the inevitable explosion  because such polices in fact fuel situations that are already inflamed and cause them to explode. Above all  such policies are incapable of extinguishing the aspirations of a people for freedom  and cannot eradicate their living memory or their narrative.Therefore  what is required now is to heed the lessons of history  to abandon the mentality of force and occupation  to recognize the rights of others and to work on an equal footing and in full parity to achieve peace. What is required is to stop relying on exaggerated security pretexts and obsessions in order to consecrate occupation and to stop contriving demands that push the conflict out of its defined political arena and towards the abyss of religious conflict in a region burdened with such sensitivities. That is something that we categorically reject.I am confident that the Israeli people want peace and that a majority of them support a two-State solution. We have always expressed our firm positions and have always explained them at the negotiations table with the Israeli Government and in the meetings and contacts that we have intensified in recent years with a wide spectrum of actors from Israeli society.Our message is rooted in the idea that the two peoples  the Palestinians and Israelis  are partners in the task of peacemaking. That is why we keep reaching out to the Israeli side  saying: let us work to make the culture of peace reign  to tear down walls  to build bridges instead of walls and to open wide roads for connections and communication. Let us sow the seeds of good-neighbourliness. Let us envision another future  one that the children of Palestine and Israel enjoy in peace and security  where they can dream and realize their dreams  a future that allows Muslims  Christians and Jews to freely reach their places of worship  and a future in which Israel gains the recognition of 57 Arab and Muslim States  the States of Palestine and coexists in peace and each of their peoples can realize their hopes for progress and prosperity.While we discuss the realization of peace between Palestine and Israel as an imperative to achieve a comprehensive peace between the Arab countries and Israel in accordance with United Nations resolutions  we bear in mind the current volatile reality and unprecedented dynamics besetting our region. Palestine does not interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries  but we have clearly affirmed our stance in support of the demands of the peoples of our region  their choices and their peaceful popular movements to achieve those demands  along with the programmes and road maps they have adopted to reach their goals. Furthermore  while we have condemned the crime of the use of chemical weapons in Syria  we have affirmed our rejection of a military solution there and stressed the need to find a peaceful political solution to fulfil the aspirations of the Syrian people.The overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people were born in Palestine and were sent into exile after the 1948 Al-Nakba. However  65 years afterwards  they continue to be its direct victims. Since the start of this year  27 Palestinian citizens have been killed and 951 have been wounded by the bullets of the occupation  and 5 000 fighters for freedom and peace are currently being held captive in occupation prisons. Does anyone deserve an end to this occupation and the realization of a just and immediate peace more than the Palestinian people?This year and in the past few years  Palestinian refugees  despite their neutrality  have continued to pay the price of conflict and instability in our region. Tens of thousands have been forced to abandon their camps and to flee in another exodus  searching for new places of exile. Do the Palestinian people deserve justice less than the rest of the peoples of the world?Since the beginning of the year  construction has been under way on thousands of settlement units by the occupation authorities  and construction tenders have been issued for thousands of others on our occupied land  even as additional vast areas of land are either expropriated or declared off limits; 850 homes and structures have been demolished.Palestinians are forbidden to plant on their own land and to use the majority of the area of our country  which is only 22 per cent. They are prevented from using their own country’s water to irrigate their crops. The wall and checkpoints continue to tear apart the lives of the Palestinian people and to destroy their economy. The siege is growing tighter  along with the attacks and oppressive discriminatory measures against occupied Jerusalem  its holy places and its citizens. In Gaza  for years an unjust blockade has been imposed on our people.So is there any people more deserving of freedom and independence than the Palestinians? Since the beginning of the year  708 terrorist attacks have been perpetrated by settlers against our mosques and churches  our olive trees  our agricultural fields and our homes and property. Is there the shadow of a doubt in anyone’s mind that the Palestinian people have the most need of security?Also  is there a nobler mission on the international community’s agenda than realizing a just peace in the land of the monotheistic faiths  the birthplace of Jesus Christ  the site of the ascent of the Prophet Muhammad and the resting place of Abraham  the father of the prophets?As they remain steadfast on their land  the Palestinian people also continue to build their institutions  to strengthen internal unity  to achieve reconciliation by returning to the ballot box  to wage a peaceful and popular resistance to counter the oppression of occupation and of settlements and settler terrorism  and to hold fast to their rights. The Palestinian people do not want to remain “out of place”  in the words of Edward Said. Our people are waiting for the day when their cause ceases to be a fixed item on the agenda of the United Nations. Our people want to have freedom  God’s gift to humanity  and to enjoy the grace of living an ordinary life. For we  as Mahmoud Darwish wrote  cultivate hope and shall one day be what we want to be: a free  sovereign people on the land of the State of Palestine.I personally am one of the victims of Al-Nakba  one of the hundreds of thousands of my people who were uprooted in 1948 from our beautiful world and thrown into exile. Like hundreds of thousands of other Palestine refugees  I knew as a youth the pain of exile and the tragedy of the loss of loved ones in massacres and wars  as well as the difficulties of building a new life from zero. In refugee camps and the diaspora  in exile  we knew the bitter taste of poverty  hunger  illness and humiliation  and the challenge of affirming one’s identity.Our people have walked the path of armed revolution and have risen from the ashes of Al-Nakba. They have collected their shattered souls and identity to put their cause to the world and ensure that the recognition of their rights is enshrined. We have walked a long  difficult path and sacrificed dearly  and yet we have affirmed at all times our active quest for peace.Twenty years ago  on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization  I signed the Declaration of Principles Agreement  and we have since worked faithfully and diligently to implement it  affirming to all our respect for our commitments and the credibility of our positions. The successive setbacks encountered have not shaken our strong faith in the objective of a just peace  and we shall continue to work tirelessly and unwaveringly to see it realized. My own personal hope is to see the day when a just peace reigns so that the generation of Al-Nakba can pass on to its children and grandchildren the flag of an independent State of Palestine.Time is running out; the window of hope is narrowing and opportunities are diminishing. The current round of negotiations appears to be a last chance to realize a just peace. The mere thought of the catastrophic and frightening consequences of failure must compel the international community to intensify efforts to seize this opportunity.The hour of freedom for the Palestinian people has rung. The hour of the independence of Palestine has rung. The hour of peace for the two peoples — Israeli and Palestinian — has rung."
"144",5885,"QAT",68,2013,"I would like first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session  and I wish him every success in his mission. I would like also to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  for his efforts for the success of that session. I would like also to commend the efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to strengthen the role of the United Nations.The international community faces many different problems related to peace and security  in addition to challenges facing the efforts made to solve disputes peacefully. This calls for strengthening the United Nations capacity to tackle these challenges and problems.Peoples from different regions of the world are expecting the institutions of the international community to dedicate their efforts to finding solutions to the issues of poverty  hunger and sustainable development in a way that goes beyond simply convening conferences and adopting resolutions  and even beyond the necessary collective attention and campaigns that are called for from time to time  important as they might be.Recently  the Arab region has experienced many historic events and accelerating change. It has witnessed turbulent events arising from popular movements and their forceful entry into the public and political arenas.Stalemate continues to characterize the Arab-Israeli conflict. That conflict is at the forefront of the issues threatening international peace and security  owing to the continued Israeli occupation and the injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people  as well as the failure to reach a just and lasting peace in accordance with resolutions of international legality. The continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories cannot be accepted as normal. Its practices include the changing of the demographic conditions in those territories  particularly through the expansion of settlement activity  the Judaization of the city of Jerusalem  the unjust embargo against the Gaza Strip  and intensification of settlement activities in the occupied Syrian Golan and changing its status quo and demographics. This is not simply because such actions represent flagrant violations of international laws and covenants  but also because the Palestinian cause is a just cause and the historical injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people must end.The major international bodies were established on the basis of the right to self-determination in the aftermath of two world wars. It is unreasonable that they cannot do anything about the last remaining colonial issue in the world. Israel should realize that coercion and de facto policies do not bring security. It is wrong for it to establish a State that believes that the prospect for peace lies in subjugating other peoples  denying their rights and making that a priority over peace. There can be no security without peace. True peace can come about only through coexistence among peoples on the basis of good-neighbourliness  mutual respect and respect for the interests of all. The peace we desire is built upon dignity  justice and the principles of international legality  as well as United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative  the principle of a two-State solution and the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories. The experiences of different nations and peoples confirm that unjust settlements do not endure but only lead to new conflicts.The continued de facto policy in Palestine will not make the issue disappear. It is actually becoming more complicated  because continuing settlement activities are leading to the destruction of the foundation for the establishment of a Palestinian State. The current status quo resembles a situation of apartheid under the domination of one State or even within a single State. That cannot but be grounds for fresh conflict  as no people could accept continued injustice and remain silent.The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent State  with Jerusalem as its capital and within the limits of 1967 borders  as well as the right of return for Palestinian refugees  are not only an Arab demand; they also represent an international standard for testing the credibility of international legality  which should not be divisible. Just as the international community has in the past applied the principles of international legality to other crises in the world  we should apply the same legal principles to all issues. We therefore call upon the Security Council to uphold its responsibility to maintain international peace and security and to take the decisions necessary to stop all illegitimate Israeli practices.Destructive actions and appalling massacres  including the policy of scorched earth and the destruction of cities  continue to be carried out by the Syrian regime against its peoples  crossing all red lines dictated by ethics and mandated by law  particularly in view of the regime’s use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people.It is unfortunate that the perpetrators of those brutal crimes and massacres  which have shocked every human conscience  are  undeterred  enjoying impunity from accountability. That raises questions about the credibility of the human rights and international legality mechanisms of the international community.The issue is not whether or not Syria possesses chemical weapons  because Syria is a State that is in conflict with another State that possesses chemical  biological and even nuclear weapons. The issue is the use of such weapons by the regime against its own people. The Syrian people did not rise up in order to place Syrian chemical weapons under international supervision. They did so in order to get rid of despotism and corruption and to put an end to the injustice they have been facing.We all know that the responsibility for the failure to impose the political settlement we would all prefer for Syria is due basically to the Security Council’s inability to take the decisions required to put an end to the bloodshed and to the continued intransigence of the Syrian regime and its rejection of all regional and international initiatives.From that perspective  the decision-making process in the Security Council must change  since it lacks fairness and objectivity. It has also become a major obstacle to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the punishment of war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against humanity. We therefore reiterate the importance of accelerating comprehensive reform of the Security Council in order to make it more capable of dealing objectively with global challenges and responding to the aspirations of peoples. That can be achieved only through equitable representation of the international community in the Council  so that it can become expressive of democracy in international multilateral efforts. While it is obviously impossible for any decision to be taken in the Council without the support of the majority of the permanent member States  decision-making should not be monopolized in the long term by one or two States.I take this opportunity to call upon our Syrian brothers to unify their ranks in order to initiate a transitional period leading to the establishment of a governing system that guarantees freedom and dignity for all Syrians  without discrimination on the grounds of gender  nationality  sect or creed. These large numbers of martyrs have not fallen and all these sacrifices have not been made by this great people so that despotism could be exchanged for chaos or another kind of despotism. The Arab Spring revolutions  during which the Arab people have risen up  calling for freedom  dignity and social justice  are now facing difficulties that seem to be aimed at reversing the march of time. As such difficulties had been anticipated  it is strange that certain politicians have not been able to avoid even expected problems.Anyone who knows the reality of the issues in the Arab region and their historical context knows that these revolutions have taken place in the context of a long-term historical process similar to those experienced previously by various peoples in Europe  America  Asia and Africa. The path to a just rule and to meeting the demands of peoples in all States of the world has never been easy; it has always been replete with sacrifices. It is not easy to follow such a path with patience and determination. Rarely have there been revolutions that have not been followed by desperate attempts by former regimes to abort them. That is why wise people always prefer that regime change should take place through a process of gradual reform. But we also know very well that in some cases  in our region and in other regions of the world  change could not have taken place through reform. We should not jump to hasty conclusions about the future of the Arab revolutions. This is a historical necessity and a long-term one. It is clear that things in the Arab world will not revert to the way they were and that the Arab peoples have become more aware of their rights and more involved in the public domain.The State of Qatar has always opted to be an active and effective party playing a constructive role at the international level through its balanced economic and political relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels. We will continue to take that approach  so that the State of Qatar can uphold its responsibilities and commitments at the national  regional and international levels. The State of Qatar aims to be a hub for dialogue and discussion among various parties to conflicts and not to be a party to such conflicts. We aim also to create opportunities for cultural and informational dialogue between peoples.In that context  the process of reform and modernity initiated by Qatar  which has made it a State of institutions and one that is interacting positively with the international community  was achieved only through a genuine commitment to applying the rule of law and principles of good governance  combating corruption  protecting human rights and basic freedoms  empowering women to participate in public life on an equal footing with men  and creating a healthy environment for children. In addition  our national policies have always focused  as a priority  on the concerns of young people and on creating a suitable educational environment for them aimed at ensuring the maximum use of their capacities. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear weapons  in the Middle East is a very alarming issue. In that context  I affirm the position of the State of Qatar that every State in the region has an absolute right to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes in accordance with the standards and procedures of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We also look forward to convening the Helsinki conference as a step that contributes to the efforts aimed at making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.The issue of climate change remains at the top of our concerns  with all its ramifications for the global system as a whole. In that regard  I would like to confirm and reiterate the commitment of the State of Qatar to continued cooperation with the international community in facing that challenge and implementing the measures agreed upon during the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which was hosted by Qatar at the end of last year  in order to develop a road map for tackling the negative environmental and economic consequences of that dangerous phenomenon.It is worth mentioning that the State of Qatar has gone a long way towards implementing the initiative of the Global Dry Land Alliance  which it launched in order to establish an international organization that would tackle the implications of that phenomenon. That proposed organization will complement the work of the other relevant international organizations in combatting desertification and drought and preserving the environment without duplicating their work. I call upon all Member States to support that initiative.The State of Qatar participates as an active and effective partner in efforts to achieve sustainable development at the international level. We have pledged to allocate the required percentage of our gross national product for the least developed countries  in addition to the humanitarian and relief assistance that our State provides in cases of emergency and disaster.In that context  the State of Qatar has achieved the majority of the Millennium Development Goals and is working towards achieving all the Goals before 2015  as demonstrated by United Nations and regional reports in that field."
"145",5931,"ROU",68,2013,"I have the honour to speak today on behalf of the delegation of Romania.First  I welcome last night’s adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013)  concerning the destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal. We believe that the resolution’s adoption by the Council represents a veritable success for the international community regarding the Syrian dossier.I would like to commend the President of the General Assembly for his well-deserved election  and I wish to assure him of my delegation’s full support in the discharge of his important responsibilities. We are convinced that his rich experience as a seasoned diplomat and the responsibilities that he previously assumed in the sphere of international relations are unquestionable assets for the success of this session.My delegation fully supports the statement made by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy  President of the European Council  on behalf of the European Union (see A/68/PV.8) .In my statement  I would like to touch upon a number of matters of interest to my country concerning the positive developments that have occurred in the activities of the United Nations since our previous debate  as well as our expectations for the next period  in the three main areas of activity of the United Nations  namely  peace and security  development and human rights  and democracy and the rule of law.We believe that the efforts of the international community and the results obtained to date in Mali represent an encouraging trend for that country and for the Sahel region. One year ago  the crisis in Mali was a major concern for the Malian population and for neighbouring countries. Following the positive developments that occurred in the early months of 2013  the Security Council decided on 25 April  through resolution 2100 (2013)  that the United Nations would participate in restoring the situation in Mali and in providing support for the democratic transition in that country. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the interim. Free and fair presidential elections were held  with an unprecedented level of participation of the population. Earlier this month  President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita was inaugurated  and the Prime Minister has already established the new Cabinet.As a member of the European Union  Romania welcomed the adoption of the Security Council resolution establishing the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Similarly  my country has also supported the participation of the international community in the process of rebuilding the capacities and institutions in Mali and has decided to join those efforts by contributing a contingent of 10 military experts to the European Union’s training mission in Mali.(spoke in English)Allow me to refer to other positive developments in the field of peace and security in the past year that confirm the contribution of multilateralism to progress in the field of peace and security. Ensuring peace and security through international cooperation is one of the main tasks of the Organization. Within that framework we have established important goals for ourselves in the past couple of years  and we have proved that working together can lead to concrete achievements and substantial results. That is the case with the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. We have managed to jointly deliver a concrete tool meant to ensure a safer world and address the challenges affecting the security of all our citizens. We must continue on that path and bring the Treaty into force as soon as possible. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Romania is currently undertaking legal domestic procedures in order to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.Similar progress is expected in other areas of multilateral negotiations. Halfway to the next Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  proceedings at the Preparatory Committee  which is being chaired by Romania and which held its second session in Geneva in April  have revealed that expectations are growing that more concrete results will be attained in reaching the targets established in the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty action plan.Romania is a strong supporter of all endeavours aimed at achieving comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We support all the initiatives of the Quartet and the full implementation of the road-map vision of two States — Israel and Palestine — living side by side in peace and security. We therefore welcome the recent resumption of direct negotiations as a long-awaited step forward  made possible by the constant and tireless efforts of the United States Administration. We are hopeful that both parties will take courageous steps aimed at finding a durable solution to a problem of supreme concern to their peoples  the region and the international community.We are gratified that  since our last debate  important steps have been taken to implement the key provisions of the final document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex). Romania commends the efforts and dedication of Brazil and Italy in facilitating the complex and strenuous negotiations that led to the establishment of the High-level Political Forum and made it possible to convene its inaugural meeting on 24 September. As a member of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  sharing a seat with Poland  Romania is joining efforts in that very important process that will craft a comprehensive and coherent set of goals for effective delivery and results at all levels  in accordance with the Rio de Janeiro Conference decisions. The new framework should reinforce the international community’s commitment to poverty eradication and sustainable development. In that respect  we set up an interministerial ad hoc working group to develop our national vision to frame the future goals we wish to promote  along with our partners  during the ongoing negotiations on this issue.In our view  the sustainable development goals (SDGs) should be universal and applicable to all States and should provide references and clear suggestions for action and innovative mechanisms for measuring their implementation  in order to ensure sustainable development. At the same time  the goals should be based on national ownership and take into account differing national circumstances so as to provide political space and the right to development for each country  and should address  as cross-cutting issues  the perspective of human rights  peace and security  good governance  gender equality  the rule of law and equity. Not least  we welcome the establishment of the intergovernmental committee to analyse options for an effective sustainable development financing strategy  and we encourage its coordination with the other relevant processes  in particular the Open Working Group on the SDGs.We strongly believe that the time is ripe to combine efforts to define the global development framework for the coming decades. The current session of the General Assembly represents the best opportunity for comprehensive and multilayered interaction to support those endeavours. The theme of our political debate  as proposed by the President of the General Assembly  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is a confirmation of that  and we are committed to contributing actively to that process.As a current member of the Human Rights Council  we believe that it is our common responsibility to create appropriate conditions of human dignity and welfare around the world and to make progress towards ensuring equality among all human beings. The Human Rights Council has proved itself up to its mandate  addressing in a prompt manner the situations of grave violations of human rights occurring in some countries  especially in Syria. We fully commend the activity of the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the human rights situation in Syria  which reported on the violations committed in that country.We highly appreciate the universal periodic review mechanism  which we consider a very useful and successful process. We hope that it will remain universal. We also commend the professionalism of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  and we strongly believe that its independence is essential for the fulfilment of the mandates of both the Council and the Office. Another major area where the specialized structures of the United Nations and their dedicated staff deserve our wholehearted appreciation is that of humanitarian assistance. In the past year  the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance reached an unprecedented level. Internal and international conflicts  organized crime  poverty  drought and severe violations of human rights are among the causes of that evolution. In too many situations  the assistance offered by the United Nations system  in close cooperation with international non-governmental organizations and international donors  is the only hope of survival for many thousands of people. We commend and support such activities. Despite limited financial resources  we make efforts to contribute to the process. In that respect  I would like to mention the work of the Emergency Transit Centre in Timisoara  Romania. The Centre has proved to be a refuge  offering safety to persons in urgent need of international protection  thus creating humanitarian space. It is an already well-established link in the global resettlement process. We are pleased to see that similar structures have been replicated in other regions of the world  and we express our readiness to engage and share our experiences with them.Allow me now to mention some of our expectations for United Nations activities in the year to come. The long-standing crisis in Syria continued over the past year  with increased violence that has claimed more than 100 000 victims and produced more than 5 million refugees. The harsh confrontations between the Syrian army and opposition forces  which ultimately led to the use of chemical weapons  have triggered the outrage and firm condemnation of the international community.Romania has continuously stated that it is imperative for the international community to curb the escalation of violence in Syria. We favour a political solution under a Syrian-led transition process  based on the cooperation of all Syrian parties with the international community  with a view to preserving Syria’s territorial integrity. With the Security Council’s adoption yesterday of resolution 2118 (2013)  Syria has been given another chance to return to the right path. We urge all parties to respect and act in accordance with the provisions of that resolution  which creates the conditions for a negotiated peace within the “Geneva II” process. In that new context  we call on all States not yet parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention to undertake the necessary internal measures to join it  in order to make sure that the use of such weapons in future is not only prohibited  but made impossible.I would like to recognize yesterday’s historic call between President Rouhani and President Obama as a major breakthrough. The occurrence of such a one-on-one conversation after more than two decades of silence gives us hope that Iran’s nuclear programme will become more transparent and oriented towards energy alone. We await  with justifiable interest  the specific plan Minister Zarif will present in that respect in mid-October in Geneva.United Nations peacekeeping operations and special political missions make a major contribution to achieving the goals of international peace  stability and security. We welcome the inclusion in the agenda of this General Assembly session of a new item devoted to special political missions  and we appreciate the report prepared by the Secretariat for that item. Member States will thereby have a possibility to exchange views and make proposals for policy measures in order to better adapt special political missions to the expectations of international  regional and local communities.Romania welcomes and supports the efforts to coordinate  at the United Nations level  the multidimensional and cross-cutting rule-of-law approach. At the same time  my country supports the gradual implementation of the responsibility-to-protect concept  starting with regional capacity-building and early-warning and preventive functions.The world is made up of regions  and each and every region faces its own challenges. Efforts to identify negotiated solutions to protracted conflicts in the Black Sea region — the Transnistrian region  Nagorno Karabakh  Abkhazia and Ossetia — should remain high on our agenda.We believe that the actions of the United Nations in the field of peace and security could be enhanced through increased engagement with regional organizations. In some regions  we have already experienced the advantages of that kind of cooperation with regional organizations  whose activities are complementary to those of the United Nations system. As a strong advocate of the increased synergies between the United Nations system and regional organizations  I would like to bring to the attention of the Assembly the positive results obtained in recent years in promoting regional cooperation within the South-East European Cooperation Process.Regional dialogue has time and time again proved to be the most efficient tool for overcoming the persisting differences of opinion among our countries. This is particularly true of South-East Europe  where regional cooperation is now more than ever crucial to further consolidating relations between countries and  at the same time  to developing the region itself.Meeting the challenges of change and interdependence through regional cooperation represents the overriding priority of the years ahead for all the actors involved. The South-East European Process is the authentic voice of the region  as it is the only regional format that has significantly contributed  over the years  to the improvement of the overall relations among the participating States. Romania  which holds the chairmanship-in-office of the Process  will focus on results-oriented actions aimed at contributing  in the most concrete manner possible  to the development of the region.As representatives of a country that has since 1990 carried out a complex process of political  economic and democratic transition  we believe that the international community needs to support countries undergoing democratization processes. The challenges that such countries face are complex: promoting democratic governance and the rule of law; addressing specific aspects of past human rights violations; and promoting transitional justice. In order to make a contribution to that process  my delegation will put forward  during the current session of the General Assembly  a resolution on human rights  democracy and the rule of law in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Based on our experience in promoting  during the March 2012 session of the Human Rights Council  a similar resolution  which was widely supported by 127 sponsors  we are hopeful that our initiative will receive the same level of support from the General Assembly.In concluding  I would like to reaffirm our commitment to the values and principles of multilateralism and to reiterate to the Assembly my country’s strong support for all of its efforts to implement the ambitious agenda ahead of us."
"146",5977,"RUS",68,2013,"International relations are becoming increasingly complex and multidimensional  while developments in the world are even more rapid and less predictable. Under these circumstances as never before  there is an urgent need to agree upon collective responses to the key issues of today. It is solely within the power of such a truly universal Organization as the United Nations to do so. Moreover  such solidarity-based efforts will be productive only if they reflect the entire spectrum of views of the international community on global challenges and threats  a broad range of historical experiences and the full cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world.For most of the Members of the United Nations family  that approach is axiomatic. However  there is also another tendency whereby collective actions are understood primarily as agreement with the viewpoint of one group of countries. Such views manifest themselves in various areas: international security  the settlement of conflict situations  the functioning of the world economy  and the choice of development models and core values.Many problems affecting today’s world are reflected in the tragic situation in Syria and in the uncertainty surrounding the development of events in the Middle East and North Africa overall. From the very onset of the turmoil in that region  Russia has consistently called for the development by the international community of a common approach combining support for the Arab peoples on their path to transformation with an understanding of the fact that  objectively  those processes will be lengthy and sometimes painful  and that it will be quite important not to undermine them through gross outside interference.We have emphasized the need to act in a balanced way and to take account of the fact that current complex developments are associated with  among other things  a tireless quest for compromises among the various ethnic and religious groups that make up the mosaic of Arab societies. We have consistently supported the choice of the evolutionary way of development and the peaceful settlement of crises through national dialogue and reconciliation.Another perspective has been reflected in the attempts made to determine who is and is not legitimate among the leaders of the Middle East and North Africa region  to impose a view as to which side should be supported in domestic national conflicts  and to dictate external  ready-made prescriptions for democratic transformation.Attempts to portray  in a simplified way  the developments in the Arab world as the struggle of democracy against tyranny or of good against evil have long obscured the problems associated with the rising wave of extremism  which is spilling over into other regions today. The terrorist attacks in Kenya have demonstrated the full gravity of that threat. It is common knowledge that jihadist groups that include numerous radical elements from all parts of the world are the most combat-capable units of the opposition. The goals that they are pursuing have nothing to do with democracy but are based on intolerance and aimed at the destruction of secular States and the establishment of caliphates. It is difficult to qualify as far-sighted a policy that entails fighting in Mali the same extremist groups that are being supported in Syria.The use of chemical weapons is inadmissible. That does not mean  however  that one can usurp the right to accuse and to render verdicts. All of the incidents associated with the use of chemical weapons in Syria  by whomsoever committed  must be investigated in a professional and unbiased manner and then considered by the Security Council exclusively on the basis of facts rather than of allegations or assumptions. In that respect  at the Group of 20 (G-20) summit held in June  an agreement was reached by leaders of the eight key States.Recently a common argument has been increasingly made to the effect that the threat or use of force  directly prohibited by the Charter of the United Nations  is virtually the most effective method of addressing international problems  including the settlement of domestic conflicts. There have been attempts to extrapolate such an approach to the situation in Syria as well  despite the fact that recent experience with such interventions has proved that they are ineffective  meaningless and destructive. That is an extremely dangerous path leading to the erosion of the foundations of today’s world order and the subversion of the weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation regimes.It is alarming to hear statements about the right to use military force to ensure one’s own interests in the Middle East region under the pretext of a persistent leadership gap in the international arena. Recent history shows that no State  no matter how big or powerful  can cope alone with challenges of the scope faced by humankind today.There is no doubt that leadership is required. However  today it can only be collective leadership based on agreed actions of the leading members of the international community  with strict respect for the principles and norms of international law. It is the growing understanding of that reality that has opened the way towards achieving Russia-United States understandings relating to the placing under international control and subsequent elimination of the Syrian chemical arsenals. That became possible thanks to the decision by Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and fulfil the relevant obligations following the expedited procedure.We expect that the decisions of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Executive Council and the Security Council will contribute to creating the framework required for the elimination of chemical arsenals in Syria.Progress in the area of chemical disarmament in Syria should give impetus to the implementation of existing arrangements to convene a conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East. We know that there are a number of complicated issues related to ensuring full participation of the countries of the region in such a conference  but they cannot be discussed endlessly. That is exactly when true leadership and resolve must be demonstrated for the common benefit.People are continuing to die and innocent civilians to suffer every day in Syria. Religious minorities  including Christian communities  are becoming victims of the conflict  which is increasingly acquiring a sectarian character. Virtually the only possibility remaining today to put an end to this turmoil is to break the deadlock regarding the process of a political settlement of the Syrian crisis. We continue to work tirelessly for the earliest convening of a peace conference to implement the Geneva communiqué of 30 July 2012 (S/2012/522  annex). We hope that  following the example set by the Government of Syria  the opposition will also constructively respond to the Russia-United States initiative.The Syrian crisis should not overshadow the need to address the Palestinian problem. We expect the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to shoulder their responsibility for the future of their people at this current critical stage  where the parties have resumed direct talks after a lengthy interruption. While duly recognizing the efforts made by the United States in the Middle East settlement process  we deem it necessary to intensify the activity of the Quartet  the internationally recognized mechanism for providing assistance to the peace process in the region on the basis of the relevant decisions of the United Nations  the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace Initiative. It is also important to ensure the close involvement of the Arab countries in the activities of the Quartet.Approaches based on negotiation are also required with respect to other situations  including the Iranian nuclear programme and the nuclear problem in the Korean peninsula. As President Vladimir Putin noted in his recent article in the 11 September 2013 issue of The New York Times “We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.”This would help to improve the international environment and contribute to stepping up collective efforts to counter global challenges  including terrorism and drug trafficking. Russia intends to attach priority attention to these challenges during its presidency of the Group of Eight  in 2014.Today  when the rigid frame of the bipolar system has been long relegated to the past  a mark of the time is the strengthening of the democratic foundations both within States and in international relations. That means in particular that the recognition of the right of peoples to independently determine their destiny and to choose the optimal forms of social and political structure and social and economic systems should become an indisputable norm of conduct. In the same way  the complex of exclusiveness and supremacy regarding one’s own customs in the human rights area should be abandoned and instead the universal criteria enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be used as a guideline. Moreover  it is important to respect the traditional values that are common to all the religions.It is obvious that a genuine partnership is hardly achievable without reliance on the foundations of economic cooperation. The prevailing majority of States are interacting within the framework of the World Trade Organization and in that sense they are already operating in a common economic space. This creates the prerequisites for working towards harmonization of integration processes in various regions of the world instead of trying to artificially pit them against each other by creating new division lines. Russia is proceeding from that exact understanding in its joint work with its partners in the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union.Russia attaches great importance to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the drafting of the global development agenda for the post-2015 period on their basis. The main priorities are the eradication of poverty and support for economic growth through the expansion of investment opportunities and the creation of new jobs. Some of the most urgent issues are the strengthening of the energy and transport infrastructures  the fight against infectious diseases and road safety.Cooperation among States should rely on efficient mechanisms and an adequate resource base. In that context  we support the further strengthening of the coordinating role and potential of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. During its chairmanship of the Group of 20  Russia has consistently pursued a policy of developing its interaction with the United Nations. We believe that the General Assembly  in cooperation with the G-20  will develop a realistic programme of long-term cooperation.I firmly believe that  by joining forces on the basis of genuine respect and considering the interests of each and everyone  we will be able to achieve the lofty goals that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations."
"147",6024,"RWA",68,2013,"Thirteen years ago  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) established humanitarian principles for the twenty-first century. Together  Member States and international organizations stood for the idea that the world’s poorest nations and poorest people should not have to live without dignity and hope.The world is a different place now. We have witnessed the struggles of a global economy reeling from a financial crisis and  indeed  a recession. But we have seen a billion people lifted out of poverty  more children in schools  greater care for the sick. And we have observed a generation born in a new age of information  ready to embrace ever-expanding frontiers of technology.But the transformative effect is not yet complete. The list of shortcomings is as long as that of the successes  and as we think about the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  we must have the courage to go beyond business as usual. The report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development  has laid out an ambitious vision for the future  and I congratulate the eminent persons who worked to produce it.But together we must now take an honest look at the MDGs  determine what worked and what did not  and commit to forging a new global partnership founded on mutual responsibility and trust. That will require developing nations to take greater ownership of the post-2015 agenda. One of the failings of aid has been the lack of attention to country-specific context in agreements. So now is the time for the developing world to make its voice heard in order to shape the debate and ensure that policies and programmes are demand-driven. It will also require Governments to empower those whose lives we are trying to transform  to give them a stake in the process and a say in their countries’ progress. In Rwanda  we have found that empowering local leaders while demanding accountability is an effective catalyst of development. But for decentralization to work  the centre must remain stable. That is why we continue to place such emphasis on good governance. It has inspired trust in our institutions and been a foundation for our development. We know it is the best way to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.There must also be a far greater focus on the role of the private sector and recognition of its power to create prosperity. For that  we need a global environment without trade barriers and one that facilitates investment in infrastructure. Greater investment is particularly needed in roads  railways and airports in order to connect domestic markets to regional and global ones. Investment is also needed in energy. Electricity  something taken so much for granted in the developed world  is still a luxury for far too many people and businesses. Access to knowledge  information and technology will also play an important role. It is levelling the economic playing field for developing countries and is beginning to break the cycle of poverty.Post-2015 presents an opportunity to turn that new sense of possibility into a reality  to give people in developing nations increased opportunity. In Rwanda we are on course to meet all the MDG targets  but for us they are the floor  not the ceiling. We remain tireless in our pursuit of progress  because we know all too well the cost of failure. Next April  Rwanda will commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the genocide. Over three long months  flickers of life went out all over the country  but today Rwandans are standing strong  having overcome adversity. In building a new nation  we have a purpose that is shaped by a tragic past but focused firmly on the future. And as within the larger African and world community we move towards the next chapter of global development  we must create strong and meaningful partnerships that have a positive impact on the lives of all. Together  we can make sure that the post-2015 era is defined by opportunity and optimism  prosperity and progress  dignity and hope.On another issue of critical importance  Africans supported the global consensus against impunity and the creation of an international justice system to fight it. We did so on the understanding that such a system would promote peace and security within and between nations  and that it would uphold the principle of the equal sovereignty of nations. In practice  however  the International Criminal Court (ICC) has flouted those principles. It has shown an open bias against Africans. Instead of promoting justice and peace  it has undermined reconciliation efforts and helped to humiliate Africans and leaders  as well as serving the political interests of the powerful. Nowhere have the shortcomings of the ICC been more evident than in the ongoing trial of Kenyan leaders. The people of Kenya have shown their eagerness to heal the wounds of their past  reconcile and move on. That is why they elected the current leaders who are on trial. Those efforts to reconcile their communities and move forward should be supported  and development of the national judicial capacity to fight impunity should be promoted rather than undermined. The General Assembly and the Security Council should be examining this matter as well as the wider issues of universal jurisdiction that have already been brought before them. That is the least we can do to uphold the principles of justice and the equality of nations  support reconciliation processes and respect the dignity of Africans."
"148",6106,"SDN",68,2013,"Today  I address the Assembly at a time when I feel great uncertainty about the future of the Organization and the established rules governing the relations among its Member States. It was expected that yesterday the Assembly would hear  from this rostrum  a statement from President Al-Bashir  the elected President of the Republic of the Sudan. However  with deep regret I must report the refusal by the authorities of the United States  the host Government  to give entry visas to President Al-Bashir and his delegation  thus rendering him unable to participate in the work of the Assembly at this session. The fact that the authorities of the host country did not grant a visa to our President is a serious violation of the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Specifically  it is a violation of the Headquarters Agreement signed in December 1946 with the host country. President Al-Bashir is known throughout Africa. He is known by all those who hold peace dear. He is known by everybody for what he has done — putting an end to the longest bloodthirsty civil war in Africa  inherited from the days of colonialism. The birth of the Republic of South Sudan is clear proof of his commitment to the implementation of the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Despite the tremendous sacrifice made by giving up a valuable part of the territory  one rich in natural and human resources  President Al-Bashir has been prevented from participating in the work of the General Assembly. However  the meeting of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union has highlighted the part that he has played in supporting peace between the Sudan and South Sudan and throughout our region.My delegation would like to say that this unjustified and unacceptable action sets a very serious precedent in the history of the United Nations. It requires that the whole membership take a firm position on this matter. This denial of the legitimate right of a Member State leads us to call on the Secretary-General to exercise his duty and responsibility to protect the rights of Member States under the Headquarters Agreement. If the matter were left up to the Sudan  then the same kind of thing could happen to any other Member State  and we would not like those rights to be violated. I should like to warmly congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to extend my country’s thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for the excellent manner in which he guided the work at the last session. We also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team in the Secretariat for the sincere and diligent work that they have done for us.It is our hope that discussions during this session will be successful. The theme chosen  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is important. The Sudan believes that the Organization and its specialized agencies will indeed devote the importance that is appropriate to such a crucial issue because development is essential to international peace and security  particularly in developing countries. As everyone knows  poverty  underdevelopment  climate change and a shortage of resources are some of the main causes of conflict in the world.The Sudan has made great strategic progress regarding peace  stability and prosperity for its people and has begun a political process that will lead to the adoption of a final constitution. After the peace efforts proved successful vis-à-vis the independence of South Sudan  we accepted the choice of its people. Today we are working to develop a solid economic system  even though we have to deal with the after-effects of economic sanctions that the United States unilaterally imposed on us. We have begun to take economic steps necessary to strengthen our economy and prevent it from collapsing. On the matter of human rights  I should like to share the opinion expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the Sudan. He recognized that progress had been made in various areas of human rights. These matters have been dealt with very seriously  and the recommendations will be dealt with in our policy. We are committed to the principles of human rights  and we have set up an independent national human rights commission in the Sudan  founded in accordance with the Paris principles  that cooperates with the relevant United Nations agencies.To promote and strengthen human rights  we signed a national law to combat trafficking in human beings. We have many specialized institutions and mechanisms that work to defend women’s rights as well  so that women can participate fully in our society and in our State. That can be seen very clearly in the positive discrimination we have been pursuing vis-à-vis women  which has led to greater political participation by women at the legislative  executive and other decision-making levels.In 2010 we adopted a law on the rights of the child that is in accordance with the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols  so that we can promote the rights of children and protect them against any kind of violence or exploitation. Our various national institutions coordinate among themselves  and we have set up a national board for children. We have police who deal especially with the issues of youth and children  and we have a public prosecutor who specializes in this area.Once South Sudan was established  we immediately began to engage in neighbourly and fruitful cooperation with it. We have blood ties with it and a common border more than 2 100 kilometres long. About two thirds of the inhabitants of both countries live along the borders. The period following the independence of South Sudan was a period of some tension because of certain matters that had been left pending  so the two countries entered into very intensive negotiations. On 27 September 2012  exactly one year ago  in Addis Ababa the two countries were able to sign nine agreements covering all matters of cooperation between our two countries. We included mechanisms for implementing the agreements in an accompanying document. We also set forth deadlines for reaching further agreements. At the most recent negotiating session between the two Presidents  in Khartoum on 3 September  and in the presence of Mr. Mbeki  the two Presidents came to an agreement on how to deal with all pending matters. They also appealed to the international community to cancel the Sudan’s debt and to lift the sanctions imposed on it. Turning now to the matter of unilateral sanctions  it is our hope that we will have strong and healthy relations with South Sudan  and we will spare no effort to achieve that. We trust the international community will be supportive of our efforts. We would like to extend our thanks to the African high-level mechanism and the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in this connection. I am happy to be able to report that the efforts of the Government of the Sudan and the international community vis-à-vis Darfur have made possible real and continuous progress in terms of stability and security. There has been a sharp drop in the violence there because those that signed the Doha peace agreement have lived up to their promises. Many of the armed groups joined the agreement later. The voluntary return of people who had left is also being organized and services are being provided.I should like to say that relations between the Government of the Sudan and United Nations bodies with regard to the humanitarian situation are now stable  so that humanitarian needs can be met. We reached an agreement with UNICEF on vaccinations against poliomyelitis and other diseases  and an agreement was reached as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.Regarding non-governmental organizations  the Sudan  like other Member States  is committed to the implementation of the development goals  including combating poverty. We have adopted policies on reducing poverty and on providing more jobs for young graduates. We are also developing a microfinance system for low- and middle-income people. Unfortunately  however  unemployment is not as low as we had hoped  and the unilateral economic sanctions have been a real obstacle to our making progress in development and in strengthening our economy. It has been particularly difficult for young people in the Sudan  who account for about 60 per cent of our population. The Sudan calls on the international community to live up to its promise to cancel the debt and to lift unilateral economic sanctions. The matter of the debt is one of the important goals of the post-2015 development agenda. Debt is a real burden for so many countries in the world.The Sudan is a prominent member of many international bodies dealing with the environment. As a victim of climate change  the Sudan believes that great attention should be paid to environmental issues and goals in the post-2015 development agenda. We would like to work with others through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The situation is deteriorating every year. We have suffered from climate change since the mid-1980s. We have suffered from recurrent cycles of drought in much of our territory  and that has also been a factor in slowing down our development goals. It has also created instability in many parts of our country because of conflict over pasture land and water supplies. That applies also in Darfur  where historically there have been tribal disputes and disputes over pastureland because of long periods of drought. The Darfur conflict became a political issue only in the last decade because of external interference. There is a very close relationship between climate change and armed conflict in that respect.My country attaches paramount importance to the rule of law at the national and international levels. We make sure that our national laws and our legislature are in accordance with international instruments  laws and treaties to which we are a party. So from this rostrum  and based on our own experience  we reiterate our rejection of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Over the past decade or so it has been violating the principles of international law and justice. The ICC has been used as a political tool by certain parties in the international arena. Many of those that signed the Rome Statute have now become aware of the negative impact of the ICC and its destructive impact on stability and peace. The last African Union Summit showed that very clearly.Regarding the crisis in Syria  our position has always been clear. We call for peaceful dialogue among the Syrians themselves towards identifying a peaceful and permanent solution. We have always rejected violence and foreign interference. We condemn the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict  and we support the Russian approach to resolving this matter.The question of Palestine — how to achieve justice and restore the rights of the Palestinian people and stop the illegal aggression by the Israeli authorities in that territory — is still a real challenge in the international arena. The prisoners must be released. The matter must be resolved within the context of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative  but Israel has simply turned a deaf ear to proposals from the Arab sides. There has been a constant call for respect for international law. The reform of the United Nations and its principal and subsidiary organs is a matter of some urgency and importance. It is time for a practical process to start  with a clear work programme  so that the international system can act in a manner that is fair  transparent and effective  so that it can take up the challenges it faces. But no progress will be made in reform until the General Assembly can play its full part and exercise all of its powers without any intimidation from the Security Council. The matter of reform of the Security Council is also of some importance for the Sudan  because that will mean that there is real reform in the United Nations. The Security Council today does not reflect the realities of the world. It adopts resolutions and takes decisions but not in a democratic and transparent way. It is therefore essential that there be comprehensive reform. Partial or transitional reforms are not possible. We support the African Union position on reform of the international system. We want a balanced  pluralistic and fairer system that will be able to deal with the challenges of the world of today  ensure respect for international law and for the noble principles of the Organization and attain the purposes and principles of the Charter — respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in domestic issues under any pretext whatsoever; the non-use of force; and the non-use of the threat of force against others."
"149",6151,"SEN",68,2013,"On behalf of the Senegalese delegation  I would like to wish you  Sir  all the best as President at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. By focusing its debate on the post-2015 development agenda  the General Assembly reminds us that there is not much time left before attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is finally evaluated. Despite progress after more than a decade of implementing the MDGs  the magnitude of the challenges is still overwhelming. In terms of access to food  housing  education and healthcare  the daily lives of nearly one billion people have barely improved. Women continue to die in childbirth. Inequalities persist within and between countries. The economic crisis continues and environmental degradation is worsening. We need to take concrete and resolute actions to transform our collective ambitions into reality. In the quest for sustainable development  a conference on climate change in 2015 in Paris will provides us with another opportunity to pull ourselves together  by reversing the negative effects of climate change on Earth  our common habitat.Addressing the challenges of sustainable development and building the future we want  in the spirit of the Rio+20 Conference  require a more sustained effort than the fight against poverty. We should invest more in education  as the Global Partnership for Education expects of us. We need to modernize agriculture  make electricity accessible to everybody and develop infrastructure to foster trade and investment. These are the pillars that underpin growth and prosperity. It is precisely this vision that the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) seeks to promote through its Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA).As part of that programme  51 priority projects have been identified and established throughout the continent. Overall  they will cost $68 billion between 2012 and 2020. As Chairperson of NEPAD’s Orientation Committee  I am pleased with the consensus that our partners have built around PIDA  namely  the Group of Twenty and the Group of Eight (G-8) and with Brazil  Russia  India and China.I also welcome the very strong signal which the G-8  meeting in June in Lough Erne  sent concerning the need for a concerted campaign against tax evasion and other fraudulent practices affecting our economies. We must now push ahead and launch the mechanisms we have agreed on for improving transparency in international transactions  including the mining industry. This is the best way to support Africa’s efforts to mobilize domestic resources in order to finance its development.Similarly  Senegal calls for the reform of international economic and financial governance  notably the terms for accessing credit and obtaining financing for economic and social development projects. Let us not pave the road to the future with the instruments of the past. While plummeting official development assistance no longer meets Africa’s needs  the trend towards progress should lead us to explore other innovative financing mechanisms available to our countries. Africa is no longer a zone of turmoil and humanitarian emergencies. Africa has become an emerging centre of opportunities and investments for innovative and mutually beneficial partnerships.The world has changed; Africa has also changed. Let us therefore change our paradigms and visions; let us change the way we look at the continent. Change is also needed for the reform of the Security Council. The Council’s legitimacy is not derived only from its status as the guarantor of the collective security system; it is also and especially derived from the representativeness that justifies its action in the name of and on behalf of all Member States.This time last year  Mali was doubly affected by a coup and a terrorist attack reminiscent of a bygone age. They were a source of great concern for us. Senegal  which remains active within United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali  welcomes the restoration of the territorial integrity and constitutional legality of Mali. We congratulate the people of Mali and their political leaders for that happy outcome. We strongly support the national reconciliation efforts being made by the Government in the spirit of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement.Today  while the armed groups have been defeated  the terrorist threat to the Sahel has not yet been definitively ended. It is only through ongoing  coordinated and sufficiently deterrent action that we will be able to address the emerging security challenges on the African continent. It is urgent to make operational the African rapid response force  proposed at the last African Union summit.In Guinea-Bissau  Senegal is supporting the Government’s efforts to successfully carry out the electoral process. We urge our partner countries and institutions to pursue their support for the definitive resolution of the Guinea-Bissau crisis through the country’s economic recovery  the crucial reform of the defence and security sector  and the fight against illicit drug trafficking. We hope that similar attention will be paid to the Central African Republic and to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the legitimate aspiration to peace  stability and the preservation of territorial integrity. Throughout Africa  we are committed to upholding respect for the African Union principles against anti-constitutional changes of Government  regardless of the process used.In regard to the Middle East  Senegal expresses its deep concern over the untold suffering of the Syrian population. We urge the Syrian Government to exercise restraint and to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention in the control and destruction of its arsenal of chemical weapons.In its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  Senegal is following the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It is a courageous and responsible act because it translates the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living within secure and internationally recognized borders. We therefore call for a halt to acts likely to affect that perspective  notably the ongoing establishment of settlements on Palestinian land by the Israeli Government.On 24 September  Senegal joined other countries in launching the international campaign for the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict. Sexual violence in conflict is an act of unbearable cruelty for the victims and their families. It is a war crime and a serious violation of human dignity and universal conscience. In the name of our common humanity  it is time to act to prevent and stop such horrors. It is time to act so that victims will no longer feel alone in their suffering  which destroys the very foundations of society. It is time to act so that the perpetrators and their accomplices in those crimes are tracked down everywhere  prosecuted and punished in a manner commensurate with the atrocities of their crimes."
"150",6198,"SGP",68,2013,"I warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly and wish him success during his term.Over the past decade  the world has experienced a string of crises. Development has slowed. Confidence in the global economic system has been shaken. There are signs of recovery  but growth remains anaemic and uneven. Unemployment is high in many countries  particularly among the young. That has exacerbated problems by increasing poverty levels  widening income gaps  adding to social instability and causing public trust in Governments and institutions to decline. Extreme poverty remains a major concern in many parts of the world.Violence and conflict are as great a threat to global stability as poverty  and the international community must respond firmly to them. In that regard  Singapore welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) on the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria. We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances  as it constitutes a violation of international law. We remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria  and we hope that the “Geneva II” conference will be convened promptly and will find a political solution to end the conflict and violence. We also offer condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya over the brutal attacks in Westgate Mall  a painful reminder of the need to remain vigilant against terror. All countries must unite against violence and terror in order to create an environment in which sustainable development can be pursued.The global ecosystem is under stress from the transnational effects of human development activities. Human progress has come at the expense of the environment and the climate. Deforestation  desertification of land and the transboundary pollution of the sea  land and air degrade our quality of life and threaten human civilization.We cannot go on with business as usual. We need to rethink and retool our economies and societies and to place poverty eradication and sustainability at the centre of our development agenda. The President’s choice of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the theme for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is therefore particularly timely. The 1987 Brundtland report of the World Commission on Environment and Development defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. That should remain our guiding principle as we negotiate the post-2015 development agenda.The United Nations has a critical role to play in the evolution of the post-2015 development agenda. Only the United Nations  with its universal membership and access to global data  has the standing to establish a new global development agenda that is inclusive  effective and adaptable. The United Nations has adopted an inclusive multi-stakeholder approach to gather the views of Member States and harness the energy of civil society. Several mechanisms have been set up  including the High-level Political Forum  the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  in which Singapore is participating actively  and the Working Group on Sustainable Development Financing. We strongly encourage the United Nations to demonstrate leadership and weave those strands of discussion into a single  clear framework. That would allow Member States to focus their attention and prioritize their resources to meet critical challenges.Singapore understands very well the importance of poverty eradication and sustainable development in securing a country’s future. When we became independent  in 1965  we faced several challenges. To uplift our population  which had only a small number of skilled workers and graduates  the Government focused on education and skills development. To create jobs and alleviate poverty  we also gradually moved our industries up the value chain towards higher-skilled  innovation-focused sectors. Given Singapore’s land and resource constraints  sustainable development was a necessity  not just a slogan. At 700 square kilometres  Singapore is slightly bigger than Manhattan but smaller than the five boroughs of New York. To ensure that our city-State remained liveable  we had to ensure that our policies on housing  infrastructure  transport and the environment were well integrated in a long-term and holistic vision.Over several decades  we have managed to pursue growth while preserving a good living environment. For instance  despite the country’s being densely populated and highly urbanized  our greening efforts have resulted in more than 50 per cent of Singapore being covered by vegetation. The Singapore Botanic Gardens  founded in the nineteenth century  is the only city botanic garden in the world to include a tract of original  primary rainforest. And despite our rapid development  we have managed to preserve much of our biodiversity. One of our nature reserves  Bukit Timah  contains more plant species than the entire North American continent.We have also developed creative solutions to overcome some of our resource constraints. Take the example of water: Singapore now imports slightly more than 40 per cent of our water needs. To meet our drinking and industrial needs  we use a variety of methods  including collecting water through reservoirs  the desalination of seawater  and cutting-edge membrane technology to reclaim waste water into high-grade  ultra-clean water  which we call “NEWater”. When Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Singapore in March 2012  he was impressed enough by our water management to make a toast with NEWater  rather than wine  calling NEWater  “something far more valuable — the elixir of life”.Let me now turn to the post-2015 development agenda and suggest three priority areas. First  we should learn from the example of the Millennium Development Goals. We should avoid being prescriptive. As each country is unique  countries should be allowed to exercise flexibility as to which goals they choose to prioritize and how they will achieve them. The new global development road map should have poverty eradication and sustainable development at its centre and should converge around a single  clear set of practical and quantifiable goals. We should keep to that outcomes-based approach and not forget that the core purpose of the post-2015 development agenda is to improve the lives of people. Today  1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty. That is a staggering figure.Secondly  we should emphasize urban management and the intertwined issues of water and sanitation. According to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme  more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. By 2050  7 out of 10 people will live in urban areas. Many cities are already under strain. More than 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation  and another 800 million do not have safe drinking water. Some 2 000 children die every day from diarrhoea. The crisis will be exacerbated as more people move to crowded cities  where the infrastructure cannot grow fast enough to support them. Singapore introduced a draft resolution in July  which was adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 67/291)  to designate 19 November as World Toilet Day. We hope that will encourage countries to take a close look at how the nexus of urbanization  water and sanitation can be better managed.Thirdly  it is important for the views and concerns of small States to be incorporated into the post-2015 development agenda. Small States make up more than half of the United Nations membership; many  especially small island developing States (SIDS)  are among the more vulnerable Members of the United Nations family. Singapore identifies closely with the urgent concerns of our fellow SIDS. The third SIDS Conference  to be held in 2014  will be an important milestone  and Singapore has participated actively in all the preparatory meetings to date. At last year’s inaugural Conference on Small Island Developing States  which was organized by the Forum of Small States (FOSS)  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon agreed that small and vulnerable States deserved special attention. Singapore will continue to work with the members of FOSS to share the perspectives of small States and ensure that our views are factored into the evolution of the new global development road map.Although we are a small country  we will continue to play our part in assisting other countries in poverty eradication and furthering the sustainable development agenda. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme in 1992 to share our developmental experience with our friends — our successes and our failures alike. We believe that technical assistance and capacity-building are more effective in creating the right conditions for growth. More than 80 000 Government officials from 170 countries have received training under the Programme in areas as diverse as sustainable urban development  water management and human-resource development. To support our engagement in the post-2015 development agenda  we will develop and customize new programmes on sustainable development and climate change that meet the needs of SIDS and least developed countries.Singapore has also been working with other Governments to promote sustainable development internationally. In 2007  Singapore and China embarked on a joint project to develop the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city  which is envisioned as a city that will be socially harmonious  environmentally friendly and resource-efficient. That will become a model for sustainable urbanization in China. By 2020  the Eco-city is intended to be a low-carbon  green-living environment approximately half the size of Manhattan  housing around 350 000 people. Singapore will continue to share its experience in sustainable urbanization through Singapore-led events such as the biennial Singapore International Water Week and the World Cities Summit.The only way to secure our collective future is through poverty eradication and sustainable development. The next two years will be critical for the world as we embark on an ambitious journey to map out the post-2015 agenda. The United Nations must play a leading role  and we are fully committed to working closely with other Member States to achieve that."
"151",6231,"SLB",68,2013,"It is with much pride that the Government and the people of the Solomon Islands join me in congratulating a fellow islander  Ambassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. As one of his Vice-Presidents  we assure him of Solomon Islands’ support and cooperation during his tenure in office.I take this opportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia  whose leadership guided us through over 300 resolutions  the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and the convening of a number of high-level thematic debates. Solomon Islands also wishes to acknowledge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his service and commitment to our global world. I would also like to welcome Kiribati  whose permanent representation in New York completes the Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) presence in a single city.My delegation welcomes the sixty-eighth session’s theme  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The world has changed since the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were launched. Populations have grown  cities have expanded  and consumption and production patterns have pushed us to our planetary boundaries. Solomon Islands’ MDG national scorecard remains mixed. We have progressed on some fronts and remain off track on others.The post-2015 development agenda offers us an opportunity to change the way we do business. In that regard  Solomon Islands seeks a new spirit of partnership that will reform the global economic architecture. My subregion in the Pacific supplies 60 per cent of the world’s tuna. Over three decades  the Pacific Islands have developed fisheries institutions and legal and management frameworks. With international support  we can supply the world with fish. Solomon Islands  as Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency and of the parties to the Nauru Agreement  calls for a new mindset that would provide the Pacific Island States with the space and capacity to develop its domestic industries and restructure the fishing fleets of distant-water nations in the region.The Pacific Fisheries Vessel Day Scheme has allowed us to realize our development aspirations. Two new fishing industries have established themselves this year in Solomon Islands. We remain firm in our resolve that the Scheme shall remain the central pillar in all our fisheries negotiations.Solomon Islands welcomes the President’s proposal of convening a third thematic debate on sustainable energy during this session. We note that 1.3 billion people  half of whom live in least developed countries  have no access to electricity. The Istanbul Programme of Action recognizes that access to affordable  reliable  renewable energy is crucial to accelerating sustainable  inclusive economic growth  increased social equity and a sustainable and clean environment.Expanding energy access for our rural populations and reducing energy costs are national priorities for Solomon Islands. I am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands joined the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) last month. We hope to work with IRENA in unlocking some of our hydroenergy potential. I am pleased to say that we already have a working relationship with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank on hydro-projects. We are also in discussion with the Clinton Foundation on harvesting our geothermal potential. Once that gets off the ground  it will be a private-public sector partnership. Bilaterally a number of partners  including the Republic of China  Italy and Japan  have people-centred solar programmes in the country. Those programmes continue to light up our community schools and villages. Renewable energy also improves public service delivery to our rural populations and empowers Solomon Islanders to make sustainable choices in life.Globally  the Pacific SIDS are themselves helping to fill the information gaps in global renewable energy databases  in cases where information on the Pacific is lacking. A Pacific renewable energy database will be developed in cooperation with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. The vision is to focus on enhancing the Pacific region’s inclusion in the international energy dialogue and to provide sufficient data to inspire new global partners to concentrate more on on-the-ground investments  less on studies.Infrastructure development is critical in opening more opportunities for our rural populations. We acknowledge New Zealand for the construction of our second international airport and other partners  such as Australia and the European Union  for the wharves  airfields and roads they have helped to build. Those structural investments allow Solomon Islands to enhance its trade and strengthen the unity of the country.Climate change remains a global issue that needs a global solution. We join all small island developing States and least developed countries in conveying our concern about the slow progress of climate change negotiations. The alarming pace of climate change is posing unprecedented threats to humankind’s survival. In May  carbon dioxide concentration reached a new threshold of 400 parts per million. For Solomon Islands  this means that the livelihood and well-being of our people are now under threat. Corals stop growing at 500 parts per million.We are heartened by the Secretary-General’s proposal to convene a climate change summit next year. We hope that the summit will not be a talkfest  but that it will garner the necessary political will of Member States to increase their level of commitment to reducing and phasing down greenhouse-gas pollution commensurate with scientific guidelines. The summit remains our best hope for preventing the impact of climate change from reaching an irreversible level. We once again register our regret that certain countries have reneged on their historical responsibility and unilaterally decided to opt out of their multilateral obligations.The world will celebrate 2014 as the International Year of Small Island Developing States. The SIDS conference is scheduled to be held in Samoa next year. We count on the world to enable small island developing States to eradicate poverty  build resilience and unleash the potential of our youths. That will require the enhanced implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation towards an evidenced-based outcome.In seeking a sustainable future for our people  last year we announced that we would establish a national university. I am pleased to say that we launched Solomon Islands National University in April. A second university  the University of the South Pacific  has also completed all formalities and is expected to begin the construction of its fourth campus in one of our provinces. The development of human capital will allow Solomon Islands to build a knowledge-based society and have more job-ready nationals to meet our development needs.This week the international community convened the first inaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In preparation for the Forum  the Pacific small island developing States formed the Pacific Islands Development Forum this year. Solomon Islands is one of the founding members of the Forum  an alliance of States and non-State and private-sector actors that focus on the green economy in the context of sustainable development. The Pacific Islands Development Forum intends to speak with a united voice in the High-level Political Forum. Pacific SIDS look forward to working with the Forum.I am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands began a new journey two months ago. The 10-year-old Pacific Islands Forum Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) — led by Australia and supported by New Zealand and Pacific small island developing States — went through a transitional phase. RAMSI  provided for under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations  now provides only police assistance. The success of the transitional phase belongs to our people and our region. On that note  I take this opportunity  on behalf of the Government and the people of Solomon Islands  to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to all our regional neighbours. We thank them very much.Multilateralism remains a cornerstone of Solomon Islands’ foreign policy. Country ownership remains a foundation of any cooperation and programme. This year  under United Nations Development Programme leadership  the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the Pacific (2013-2017) was launched. The $292 million programme covers 14 Pacific countries and territories  all with the same priorities. We call on the United Nations to align itself with Solomon Islands national sustainable development strategy 2011–2020. It is for that reason that over the years we have called for an enhanced United Nations country presence. We renew the call to upgrade the United Nations Development Programme country office from the level of deputy resident representative to that of resident representative.A peaceful  just and stable democracy is critical for sustainable development. Solomon Islands continues to invest in strengthening its governance system. A political party integrity bill is being introduced in our national Parliament. The political party bill aims to give more power to our electoral commission to properly manage our national election process. We are also putting in place a sustainable  cost-effective and inclusive voting registration system. That is an expensive exercise; we have sought partnership with the United Nations  the European Union and Australia. We thank our partners for their ongoing support to our electoral reform programme. That assistance complements work done on e-governance. Solomon Islands this year established a metro area network as a single secure network connecting 85 Government offices. We hope that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government’s computer machinery.Solomon Islands would like to see a strong United Nations. We are encouraged by the Assembly’s commitment to achieving real progress on reforming and revitalizing two of our principal organs  the Security Council and the General Assembly. We assure the Assembly of our support on those two endeavours.My delegation also welcomes the modernization of the Secretariat Building and the conference rooms and the renovation of the General Assembly. We are also pleased to note that United Nations competitive exams will be held in my capital in the next two months. We are holding the exams for the third consecutive year. I thank the Secretariat  and in particular the United Nations human resources personnel  for their outreach  and sincerely hope the nationals selected will contribute to the diversity of the Secretariat.Changing global realities have seen the emergence and expansion of South-South cooperation. This year  Solomon Islands established two new diplomatic missions in Cuba and Malaysia  respectively. On 18 April  Solomon Islands raised its flag in Havana. We also welcomed Cuba as a Pacific Islands Forum post-forum dialogue partner three weeks ago. Similarly  in Malaysia last month the first resident Solomon Islands Ambassador presented his credentials. We intend to strengthen our ties with the wider Asian and Pacific region  including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India. We have some 100 medical students in Cuba; the first graduates are expected in 2014. We thank Cuba for its cooperation.For more than two decades  the General Assembly has called overwhelmingly for the lifting of the more than five-decades-old economic blockade imposed on Cuba by our friend and partner the United States of America. Confrontational lines will need to be replaced with dialogue and cooperation. We cannot look to the future if we cling to the past. We hope that a forward-looking policy will be embraced by the United States of America in easing the blockade.I turn now to bilateral cooperation with Papua New Guinea  my Melanesian neighbour. Papua New Guinea continues to provide opportunities for young Solomon Islanders in terms of employment and scholarships. Visa-free work schemes have been launched  and trade relations continue to grow to new heights.In my subregion  the Melanesian Spearhead Group — composed of Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Vanuatu and Solomon Islands — represents one of the most diverse regions of the world. A quarter of the world’s languages are spoken by the more than 8 million people of the subregion. Enhanced free trade has unified the culturally rich diverse populations. Today  the Group is exploring other economic  security and political cooperation.On Fiji  Solomon Islands welcomes the progress put in place by the Government of Fiji for the people to freely express themselves through the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2014. Solomon Islands notes the adoption of Fiji’s new Constitution and wishes the Government and people of Fiji every success in determining their own future.The inalienable right to self-determination is a key pillar of the United Nations. With respect to New Caledonia  members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group continue to support the Territory’s self-determination process in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  the relevant human rights instruments and the Noumea Accord. In regard to the Territory of French Polynesia  I take this opportunity to thank the General Assembly and all Pacific small island developing States for adopting by consensus resolution 67/265  on the self-determination of French Polynesia in May. The questions of the Territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia are scheduled to be discussed by the Fourth Committee next week.On human rights  Solomon Islands recognizes that all States bear the responsibility to protect their citizens. We believe that all States must take feasible steps to ensure that the rights of their people are protected. Solomon Islands  in that regard  condemns all human rights violations against civilians  wherever they may occur.On the Middle East  we continue to watch with horror the daily carnage and the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. We note with concern the preliminary findings of the United Nations investigation team confirming the use of chemical weapons. Solomon Islands welcomes the Russian and United States initiatives to destroy chemical weapons in Syria  and further supports all efforts to find a diplomatic and political solution to the civil war.On Israel and Palestine  we support all international efforts for the two States to resume negotiations and achieve a just  lasting and sustainable peace.Solomon Islands remains an arms-free State. We note that the use of conventional and unconventional arms in the wrong hands threatens international peace and stability. Solomon Islands welcomes the recently adopted Arms Trade Treaty and hopes that major players in the arms trade will sign that international framework. That will strengthen the Treaty. Solomon Islands continues to follow and assess the Treaty’s progress.On the question of the Republic of China  Solomon Islands call for the Republic’s meaningful participation at United Nations specialized organizations. We would like to acknowledge the Republic of China’s recent participation in the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a guest of the organization’s President. We recognize that as a first step. We continue to seek observer status for the Republic of China both at ICAO and at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Those requests mirror the observer status that the Republic of China currently enjoys at the World Health Assembly.Solomon Islands continues to serve on the United Nations Executive Board. We welcome the new Executive Director of UN-Women  Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka  and assure her of our cooperation. We note with concern that the UN-Women strategic plan for 2014-2017 is underfunded. We call for political and financial support for the plan. We support the Executive Director’s call that priority be given to the economic empowerment of women in rural areas. We hope the Executive Board can also address UN-Women’s representation vacuum in the Pacific. Gender violence remains an issue in Solomon Islands  and my country joins the international community in condemning sexual violence.We continue to seek an inclusive society. In partnership with an Australian entity  Solomon Islands organized national games for persons with disabilities in our country and other events. Although we still have a long way to go in creating a disability-friendly society  we remain determined to achieve that end.Let me close where I began. The post-2015 development agenda is our shared agenda. We must remain united and work as one  with one aim  to deliver one set of goals  under a single process with common but differentiated responsibilities. Present and future generations depend on what we do today."
"152",6277,"SLE",68,2013,"I bring you sincere greetings and very best wishes from His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone. President Koroma regrets that he is unable to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session due to unavoidable circumstances. He has  however  instructed me  as his Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation  to deliver to the Assembly this message of goodwill:“I congratulate Ambassador Ashe most warmly on his election to direct the affairs of the Assembly during this session and assure him of my country’s support and cooperation during his tenure. Let me avail myself of this opportunity to also express the appreciation of my delegation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia  for his able leadership in directing the work of the General Assembly during the past session. I wish him well in his future endeavours. Let me also express sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his constructive and fruitful leadership of the Organization. Sierra Leone will continue to support the progressive implementation of his five-year Global Action Agenda.“Over the past two decades  global peace  security and the economic environment have evidently been radically transformed  to the point where neither the problems nor their solutions are simple. The international security situation has become more complex. Regional hotspot issues keep flaring up  and turbulence continues in many parts of the world  in particular Asia and Africa. Human trafficking  in addition to other non-traditional security issues such as climate change  nuclear safety  energy  food and maritime security and financing for development are becoming more significant.“The use of chemical weapons in conflict poses a renewed global security threat. There is therefore a need for increased multilateral and collective engagement and responses to those complex challenges.“As we all are aware  the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is only two years away. While we take stock of what have been achieved and the challenges that continue to confront us  we should  in keeping with the principles set out in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development outcome document  entitled ‘The future we want’ (resolution 66/288  annex)  embark upon designing a post-2015 development goals agenda in which the specific needs and challenges of every Member States are recognized. There is no doubt that failure to capture those specific needs and commitments would compromise the credibility of such an agenda.“We also note that important progress has been made in many areas  such as reducing poverty globally  improving access to primary education for all children  reducing child and maternal mortality  increasing access to HIV treatment and reducing slum populations  to name a few. However  this has not been uniform  as inequalities among many populations are on the rise  particularly in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa  where food insecurity and malnutrition are still prevalent. While access to health and education may be expanding for us  the quality of those services in many regions remains a serious challenge.“That is why the theme of this session  ‘The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage’  is timely and appropriate. We are moving into the phase of mapping out another development framework that is expected to formulate universal goals and responsibilities encompassing the economic  social and environmental spheres. The post-2015 development agenda should have at its core the urgent need to address the causes and consequences of conflict  violence and disasters. These are universal issues of great concern to the global community. Resolving and preventing conflict and violence  creating jobs  providing further incentives for foreign direct investment  broadening human and financial resources  ensuring gender equality and promoting human rights and the rule of law are not only fundamental to human progress; they are integral to sustainable development.“Sierra Leone welcomes the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year. This is a significant and historic achievement in our collective efforts in pursuit of a safer and more secure world. We therefore hope that the illegal transfer of conventional weapons to the wrong hands — a major source of the escalation of conflicts in the developing world  particularly in Africa — can now be largely regulated and minimized. “In that regard  we remain committed to supporting international instruments aimed at establishing peace and security in the world and an economic order that is beneficial to the rich and the poor  the weak and the strong  as well as to nations big and small.“In recent years  and despite being under post-conflict rebuilding  Sierra Leone’s contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates our strong commitment to the purpose and principles of global peace and stability. We stand ready to increase our profile in the peacekeeping landscape so as to ensure the success of peacekeeping operations. To that end  we will continue to actively engage in all new initiatives for reform of the United Nations peacekeeping operations.“We applaud and acknowledge the human resources and financial support that the United Nations family and other development partners continue to provide  especially towards the successful conduct of our 17 November 2012 presidential  parliamentary and local government elections  all of which were held in one day  for the very first time. Those elections were widely considered to be a critical benchmark for us  signalling our preparedness to move into a more developmental phase of peacebuilding. It should come as little or no surprise that they were widely acclaimed to be peaceful  free  fair and transparent by the international community. Their successful conduct clearly demonstrates the level that Sierra Leone’s democratic process has attained  an experience we are willing to share with other countries in our subregion and beyond.“Today  Sierra Leone is on the threshold of transformation in its engagement with the Peacebuilding Commission as well as in its socioeconomic development. With support from the Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office as well as other international and local development partners  Sierra Leone continues to make significant gains in the areas of good governance  human rights  gender equality and the fight against corruption and transnational organized crime. A number of international treaties have been ratified and national legislations enacted to address these challenges  which have the potential to undermine ongoing peacebuilding and peace-consolidation efforts.“Sierra Leone’s vision for transformative and inclusive socioeconomic development was initially encapsulated in my Government’s poverty-reduction strategy  articulated in the ‘Agenda for Change’ that we rolled out in my first term of office. These have been encouraging achievements and with residual challenges as well. In my current  second term  we are poised to build on those successes with renewed determination. “With a sustained commitment to provide improved standards of living for our people and to raise the country to middle-income status  we have rolled those residual challenges over to our successor development programme  the ‘Agenda for Prosperity’  which I launched in July this year. This is Sierra Leone’s road map to our post-2015 development agenda. It aims to build a sustainable future for all Sierra Leoneans  requiring sound macroeconomic management and fiscal policies for a society with strong institutions to facilitate good governance  the social  economic and political empowerment of women and young people  the required social support for the disadvantaged  increased transparency and accountability  and justice for all.“In taking up this huge challenge  Sierra Leone will continue to welcome the strong partnership that exists with the various United Nations agencies and other international development partners for the achievement of a well-planned  seamless transition to a more developmental phase of peacebuilding and for scaling up support to Sierra Leone’s political and economic priorities  as outlined in our ‘Agenda for Prosperity’. Sierra Leone  a nation with good credentials as a post-conflict country  is a deserving candidate for continued international support.“Sierra Leone continues to uphold its national heritage of interreligious tolerance and peaceful coexistence  as well as the principle of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In that regard  we remain focused on  and committed to  our reporting obligations to international treaty bodies. “In line with the relevant provisions of the Disability Act 2011  we have established a National Commission for Persons with Disability. The current and first Chairman and Chief Commissioner is a person with impaired vision. We have also enacted the Sexual Offences Act 2012 to address the specific issue of sexual violence against women and girls. Sierra Leone will continue to collaborate with the United Nations and other interested partners in promoting the enactment of the Gender Equality Bill so as to enhance women’s participation in the decision-making process.“We commend the support of the United Nations and international partners for the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone  whereby it has made meaningful contributions to the advancement of the rule of law at both the national and international levels. With our continued support  the Special Court is expected to complete its mandate by the end of this year.“We are pleased to note that the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights entered into force in May 2013. Sierra Leone pledges its continued support to the work of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as we strive together to maintain universally accepted standards of human rights and democratic governance.“It is in that context that we have also embarked upon a constitutional review process to address major socioeconomic and political issues. A constitutional review committee has been established with a broad spectrum of membership  drawn from all political parties  civil society  women  youth  disabled persons and even the diaspora. The process will be inclusive and guided by a critical analysis in a broad national debate  with the aim of strengthening democratic institutions and promoting national unity. We expect the committee to submit a draft review within two years.“As the coordinator of the African Union committee of 10 Heads of State on Security Council reforms  let me once again emphasize the need for urgent reform of the Council. The role of the United Nations should be strengthened  not weakened. The need for equitable geographical representation  with all the privileges of membership in the Security Council  cannot be overemphasized. Africa will therefore continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders and Member States  particularly other non-permanent members of the Council  for an early and decisive reform of that organ.“Let me therefore reiterate that Africa’s participation in the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations is firmly rooted in our steadfast commitment to the African common position articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration on the reform of the United Nations.“The Millennium Development Goals remain a very lofty agenda in the history of our collective efforts for global socioeconomic development  although their full achievement has been thwarted by a multitude of factors. The year 2015 is a critical one for the United Nations as it marks the Organization’s seventieth anniversary. It is also the target date for the MDGs and the tenth year since the World Summit was held in 2005. “We are expected to agree on a post-2015 development framework. It is imperative that we follow a pragmatic approach with renewed vigour and commitment to providing our people with a future that guarantees justice  peace and security  accountable and democratic governance  a transparent and equitable distribution of wealth  a safe and sustainable environment and health and education for all. Those are all essential elements in setting the stage for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.“Let me join the family of the United Nations in expressing our condolences and solidarity with the people of Kenya  Pakistan and Nigeria for the irreparable loss of valuable lives during the recent terrorist attacks. Our thoughts and prayers are strongly and firmly with the families of the deceased.”"
"153",6324,"SLV",68,2013,"It is an honour to join other speakers in addressing the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. This year the Assembly has as its theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. These annual meetings are thus an opportunity to consider and reflect on the course that each of our countries is following to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).There can be no doubt that recent events have posed a major challenge to the achievement of prosperity  development and progress  especially in those regions of the world that have suffered most from the effects of the international economic crisis and of climate change. El Salvador has been no exception.When  on 1 June 2009  the Government that I head took power  the nation’s economic growth rate was at negative 3 per cent  with 40 000 jobs lost. There had been a considerable drop in exports  especially to the United States  our principal market. Income from taxes and family remittances had decreased  and broad sectors of the population were impoverished or excluded from the benefits of public policies.But that harsh reality was not just a product of the crisis. It was the result of decades of the implementation of economic and social models that excluded the great majority and promoted backwardness and injustice. As from June 2009  with the process of political alternation in El Salvador  that reality began to shift.As soon as our Government took power  we made a commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and to use them as a road map. The Government’s five-year plan states that our strategic plan is to have a healthy  educated and productive population with the capacity and appropriate opportunities to fully develop its potential to become the foundation of our development. The Government’s plan incorporates strategic instruments and policies aimed at achieving the MDGs over the short and medium term. We took the strategic decision not to shift the costs of the crisis onto the poorest segments of the population  as had been the habit in the past.For that reason  we devised and implemented policies aimed at combating poverty  reducing inequality  achieving a process of social inclusion and creating new institutional mechanisms that would make it possible to more equitably distribute wealth and the benefits of economic growth.Our Government put an end to the old concept of the patrimonial State  which defended only the interests of small political and economic groups. Now the Salvadoran State is at the service of the most underprivileged. That shift in public policy has translated into an increasingly modern and effective State that is fighting poverty  social exclusion  violence and corruption. Thus this new type of governance  which is based on the implementation of best practices  transparent and increasingly participatory  has already begun to have a positive impact on the achievement of the MDGs  as demonstrated by the following results.El Salvador has made great progress towards eliminating poverty and hunger. In the past year  we not only achieved but exceeded the goal of reducing the number of households living in extreme poverty. We also made major achievements when it comes to access to education. In 1991  the net coverage for primary education was 75 per cent of the population; last year it was 93 per cent. We have gained almost 20 percentage points in those years. Since the beginning of my Administration  all students in public schools — some 1.3 million children and young people — have received free shoes  uniforms and school supplies. The impact of this was immediately noticeable  as we increased enrolment while dramatically reducing the dropout rate. Twenty years ago  85 per cent of the population of working age was literate  but this rate has now reached almost 100 per cent. Over for the past four years alone  the Government has managed to reduce the illiteracy rate by 5 per cent. With the help of thousands of volunteers  we are teaching over 170 000 adults to read.In terms of health  one of the achievements we are most proud of is related to the significant reduction in maternal mortality  one of the two sections of Millennium Development Goal 5. With the health-care reform undertaken by my Administration  we have increased access to health services by hiring more doctors  nurses and specialists and establishing new women’s centres. Pursuant to the Millennium Development Goals  the objective is to achieve a maternal mortality rate that is equal to or below 52.8 maternal deaths per 100 000 inhabitants by 2015. We have reached that goal in El Salvador and even exceeded expectations by reducing the rate to 41.9 maternal deaths per 100 000  or 11 fewer than the target for this Goal.The comprehensive health-care reform initiative that we launched has been tasked with bringing health-care services to the most remote corners of our country that  historically  have been isolated from economic and social development. This firm commitment of our Government has led us to increase the health-care budget by 60 per cent over a period of four years. That has allowed us to increase the supply of medicines in hospitals and public health clinics by between 50 to 82 per cent in that time and to significantly expand the proportion of the population who are immunized. Similarly  free health consultations mandated by our Government have contributed to a 40 per cent increase in demand for such services  which represents a significant step in our goal to extend that service to the majority of the population. I cannot speak of advances in health care without talking about access to and improvement of basic services such as drinking water. Our efforts have gradually borne fruit in the areas under our responsibility in this respect. We have met the target of 71 per cent of households having treated water piped into their houses. In 2011  under our Government  this was already true of 72 per cent of households. Sanitation is covered by another Millennium Development Goal  which set the target of 89 per cent of households having this service by 2015. As of two years ago  96 per cent of Salvadoran households had access to sanitation.In summary  great efforts have been undertaken to achieve the best possible outcome on each of the indicators  leading to enhanced well-being for all Salvadorans. I believe that the time has come to conceive of social programmes for people as an investment and not as an expense  or even worse as a waste  as some leaders in the country mistakenly continue to believe  stuck as they are in their stingy and outdated ways of thinking.It is clear that the gains we have made in my country in recent years have not been the result of chance. El Salvador is going through a period of great change. This profound transformation has occurred first through a change in the economic model that has set a different course for our nation. We are working primarily on restoring the vitality of our countryside in order to make it once again a central engine for economic development. Thanks to our family agriculture plan  which provides small and medium-sized farms with free delivery of improved seed packets and fertilizer  training and access to technology and credit  last year we had record food-crop harvests and were still able to keep the price of basic grains within reach of the entire population of El Salvador. We have also successfully implemented school lunch programmes  so that children receive at school fresh  healthy food grown on Salvadoran farms. Today  more than 800 000 poor Salvadoran children receive two glasses of fresh milk a week in school as part of their diet. All these efforts have brought more prosperity to Salvadorans  especially the poorest. But in addition to poverty  there are other scourges such as violence  drug trafficking and organized crime that deprive our people of well-being and happiness. With this in mind  we have implemented public policies to reduce violence and fight crime.The Government has created new police units  overseen the graduation of 4 000 new agents and redoubled operational plans to curb crime. At the same time  a non-aggression pact between the two main youth gangs was agreed on two years ago. The Government was only a facilitator of that pact  which has established the minimal conditions to reduce gang violence levels in the areas most affected by that phenomenon. Thus  ongoing crime suppression and prevention efforts have resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in homicides. The Government’s security policy has also dealt a heavy blow to organized crime gangs  allowing for significant seizures of drug shipments. We know  however  that huge challenges remain. There are major obstacles to development that will not be overcome in my new Administration’s four years in power. I would highlight in particular the challenges represented by climate change and the resulting need to protect and safeguard the lives of tens of thousands of Salvadorans. We are a region exposed to extreme weather phenomena  at least five of which El Salvador has experienced in recent years. They have had the greatest impact on the most vulnerable parts of the population and the country’s infrastructure  causing losses in the billions of dollars.A major challenge is to build a sufficiently fair and democratic society that is respectful of those who make up the majority of the population — women. El Salvador has undertaken serious efforts to achieve goals derived from the Millennium Development Goals in the area of gender equality and the prevention  punishment and eradication of violence against women.In addition to establishing a confidential call centre for reporting gender violence  the Government has approved the first national policy against human trafficking and achieved a considerable decrease in women’s deaths by homicide. Without a doubt  the most valuable contribution in this area lies in the City of Women initiative  through which we have created four comprehensive care centres for women and are on track to create two more  scheduled to open later this year. This initiative is already considered by international organizations and world leaders a model of public management. It is a comprehensive and integrated system of specialized services for women in the areas of sexual and reproductive health  economic empowerment — through both formal employment and support for entrepreneurship — and prevention and treatment of gender-based violence. It also helps to focus the priorities and attention of my Government on women.Another tangible demonstration of the ongoing process is the dialogue undertaken to achieve reparations for victims of gross violations of human rights and the vindication of the rights of war veterans. With regard to the latter  we have succeeded in repaying a debt that adminstrations prior to ours had failed for years to recognize and to repay. Moreover  my Government has promoted a reconciliation process without precedent in the nation’s history and a recognition of the human rights atrocities committed in El Salvador. As Head of State  I asked forgiveness for the disappearances  murders and torture  and from all those who experienced the brunt of such abuses during our civil war. I ordered a dialogue with organizations representing the victims of serious human rights violations. As a result of this process  in the days to come I will announce a national reparations programme  which will include the ratification of various treaties human rights adopted by the General Assembly and a guarantee that such violations will never recur.The right to food  education and welfare must be ensured in order to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty. In that respect  all the efforts of national Governments must be complemented and strengthened with the support of the international community and the United Nations system.Radical change is needed in the global economic system  which is based on financial speculation and consumerism and not only has an impact on the most developed economies of the world  but also and especially makes the least developed countries even poorer. International cooperation must seek fundamentally to improve the productive capacities of our countries and to invest in people suffering from poverty and exclusion. My Government believes that the path to growth is investment in the poor and their transformation into a middle class with access to health care and education.I invoke international solidarity and the agenda of the General Assembly in which we are gathered here today in order to advocate once again for the lifting of the blockade against Cuba. I have made this same request in my previous statements before this forum  as I believe that Cuba is part of the American soul and that the blockade is a relic of the past. The brotherly people of Cuba  like all peoples of the world  have the right to seek development and well-being through comprehensive integration.Similarly  we support diplomatic efforts seeking a swift peaceful solution to the conflict in Syria. We condemn the use of chemical weapons  and we support the agreement between Russia and the United States whereby Syria’s chemical weapons would be destroyed under the supervision of the United Nations.Before I conclude  I should like to express my firm belief that the United Nations will take the necessary steps to guarantee the development and implementation of a comprehensive post-2015 agenda. In that context  I believe that we will realize a better and fairer world for all of humankind.In El Salvador  we are preparing to implement that agenda. We are happy to be among the few countries in Latin America working on multidimensional poverty measurement. Next year we hope to use these statistics to complement our income-based poverty measurement. We will thereby be in a better position to implement comprehensive policies that will allow us to eradicate poverty in a definitive and lasting way. I thank the United Nations for its invaluable cooperation in the pursuit of our major aspirations as a nation  and the Assembly for its attention."
"154",6349,"SMR",68,2013,"On behalf of the Government of San Marino  I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His long experience as Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda and his in-depth knowledge of the Organization are precious resources for the United Nations. The Republic of San Marino supports the essential elements of his programme  mentioned in his inaugural address (see A/68/PV.1)  and ensures its full cooperation in all work of the General Assembly. My country also wishes to express special thanks to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his energy  commitment and extraordinary determination to the benefit of the United Nations. We appreciate the sensitivity demonstrated by the Secretary-General towards all Member States  without distinction  and his constant presence in all international politically relevant and emergency situations. His visit this year to our Republic on the occasion of the Investiture Ceremony of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent marked a significant moment in the history and public life of our small State  and was an honour for the San Marino people.The theme chosen this year’s session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — places at the heart of our debate the need to pursue the Millennium Development Goals and to comply with the obligations undertaken. It also serves to reaffirm that it is only through the determined commitment of the Organization that those Goals can be effectively achieved.We believe that significant progress has been made in achieving many of the Goals  such as the eradication of extreme poverty  access to drinkable water  combatting HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  and the improvement of the health conditions of women and children. However  we are well aware that the full achievement of those objectives is still far off. Despite the progress made  we are deeply concerned for regions in the world  such as sub-Saharan Africa  that require urgent and effective action  as well as for those countries experiencing conflicts and post-conflict situations where the population lives in extreme conditions.San Marino  like many other countries  believes that in setting the fundamental objectives of the post-2015 agenda  due account must be taken of the challenges that in the course of the past years — that is  since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration — have become more urgent. Among the challenges  peace and security  the elimination of inequalities and environmental sustainability are  in our view  top priorities  not only among States but also within States  owing to their magnitude and urgent nature.Peace is the indispensable condition for building and fully implementing a development model centred on the human individual. Therefore  dialogue and negotiation  as tools to resolve conflicts  should be pursued with greater effort and determination by the entire international community  which considers this search to be a fundamental mission of the Organization.Similarly  when crimes against humanity are committed — crimes that the Secretary-General has recently denounced and documented  after a strong condemnation — united action to eliminate chemical and nuclear weapons is needed in order to avoid responding to violence with violence. Too many violent conflicts have recently defined the internal life of some States and the relations among them. There are far too many dead  in particular civilians  to talk of satisfactory conditions of peace. But peace can be founded only on respect for human rights  social justice and the emancipation of the weakest segments of society.The Republic of San Marino reasserts its own commitment to the goal of a world free of any form of racism and racial discrimination  where the freedom of expression and association  and above all the freedom of religion  are guaranteed and the personal fulfilment of individuals is ensured. To that end  we shall be guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Furthermore  San Marino praises the high-level meetings marking the first part of the session of the General Assembly  because the themes discussed are not only urgent but also extremely important.The Republic of San Marino has always paid special attention to the most vulnerable groups  such as women  children  the elderly and the disabled. Today  women are still the victims of discrimination and violence in many parts of the world  including in the most developed countries. In the poorest regions of our planet  maternal mortality remains a challenge. Moreover  women are the most vulnerable to HIV infection. Trafficking in women is far from being resolved. Women are often subject to abuse and to humiliating and degrading treatment  including polygamy  child marriage  kidnapping and sexual violence  including domestic violence. Women living in conflict and post-conflict situations are often subject to sexual violence  mass rape  torture  summary executions.The advancement of women’s rights and the elimination of all barriers to their full participation in political  economic and social life must be top priorities for the United Nations  along with the promotion of their economic opportunities and equality in all sectors.The United Nations has the duty to protect children  the most vulnerable victims of violence  abuse and exploitation. In the most poverty-stricken areas of the world  the infant mortality rate is still unacceptable and a very high number of children suffer from chronic malnutrition  which is the main cause of child mortality. My country hopes for the universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols and their full implementation.The international community must strive for the full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in the economic  social and cultural life of the community. Despite the significant steps forward taken over the last years in terms of equality and non-discrimination against disabled persons  much remains to be done for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  through the adoption of legislative measures and national and international policies. The Republic of San Marino welcomes the convening of the High-level Meeting on the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and Other Internationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities (see A/68/PV.3) and fully supports its outcome document (resolution 68/3).In particular  it must be stressed that the protection of disabled persons can be more easily achieved if the social and economic policies of individual States and international organizations pay due attention to the institution of the family as the natural environment in which human beings are born and develop their awareness of the rights and duties regulating coexistence among people.My country’s priorities include environmental sustainability and the prevention of and response to natural disasters. Over the last years  certain regions of the world have been shaken by unprecedented natural disasters. In Asia  Latin America and Africa  in particular in the Horn of Africa  local communities have suffered from extreme conditions  experiencing the tragic consequences of their vulnerability and of food and health uncertainty.Our thanks go to the Secretary-General  the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Central Emergency Response Fund for their prompt and crucial intervention in favour of populations affected by natural disasters. However  individual Member States must do more and give rapid and effective support to populations in emergency situations  both by investing in the most vulnerable regions so as to build the capacities necessary for preventive action and by providing them with the moral and financial support necessary to cope with disasters.The Republic of San Marino attaches great importance to the issue of preventing and responding to natural disasters. Despite its small size  it ranks fifty-first on the list of donors to the Central Emergency Response Fund.Lastly  the finalization of the post-2015 development agenda cannot be separated from a discussion on the strengthening of global governance mechanisms  since the achievement of the new development goals will be the result of cooperation among all Member States. San Marino believes that the United Nations has the duty to retain its leadership role in global governance management.My country is a traditional sponsor of the annual draft resolution entitled “The United Nations in global governance”  to be submitted in 2013 for the third time. It reiterates the need for a more inclusive  transparent and effective approach to solving the world’s problems and recognizes the central role to be played by the United Nations in global governance.Indeed  the highly democratic nature and the universal character of the United Nations grant it indisputable legitimacy and a patrimony deriving from the cultural diversities and the traditions it represents. This leads to an approach focusing on humankind and the promotion of human rights in which the needs of the entire international community are taken into account. Indeed  global problems require global solutions.Against that background  our Organization must adapt. The political role and authority of the General Assembly  and reform of the Security Council  are the core issues of such a reform process. The demands made today by the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East require a review of working methods and the decision-making process in order to ensure that solutions are reached in the context of which the interests and positions of all parties concerned are duly taken into account.The Republic of San Marino has always believed in the power of dialogue  democracy and respect for others. That is why  in its centuries-old history  it has never fought any war. Drawing on that experience  we believe that — and this is our contribution to the general debate — the Millennium Development Goals and the definition of the post-2015 development agenda need to be set within this perspective."
"155",6386,"SOM",68,2013,"It is an honour for me to be here today  as this it is my first time addressing this esteemed and respected body  the General Assembly  as President of Somalia. First  let me congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations for its unwavering support to Somalia. On 10 September 2012  when I was elected President of Somalia  it was the first time that we had had a permanent Government following 22 years without a functioning State. Somalia could not have completed the transition last year without the assistance of the United Nations and all the countries that stood with us during those difficult times.One of the main purposes of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. Therefore  it is imperative that we stand together to ensure that the world is peaceful and stable. Somalia and other countries are still suffering and need the support of friends  allies and all members of this body  who must come together to find ways to overcome all the challenges that exist in this universe. It is time to reflect on our collective progress and the challenges and opportunities before us in our efforts to ensure that the world is free from conflict. I have no doubt that if we collectively work hard and understand the issue  become self-critical with our strategies and provide all the necessary support and assistance to all countries that are struggling to bring peace and stability  we will prevail in achieving our main purpose in that universe. That struggle must be redoubled. We strongly condemn the cruel and terrible attack in Nairobi’s Westgate Mall and send our condolences to the Kenyan people and the Government. The Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi demonstrates to the world a number of important points.First  the battle against Al-Qaieda and its offshoots  such as Al-Shabaab in the Horn of Africa  is far from over. Al-Shabaab is indeed a national threat  but its consequences have negative impacts on the region and the entire world  not just for Somalia alone.Secondly  the fight against Al-Shabaab must be fought on many fronts — military  economic  political and ideological. Military  security and intelligence forces are crucial elements in the battle  but they are only one part of the solution.Thirdly  Al-Shabaab is down but it has not died. We now need the tools to finish the job  and we call on our friends to remain resolute and to help us end the situation. Our brave Somali forces  the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces need help in fighting our enemies inside Somalia  yet that is simply not enough. AMISOM must be reinforced and expanded. The small investment required for those enhancements is insignificant compared with the great expense that will be needed later if the international community does not help finish the job right now. Furthermore  we must not overreact but remain focused on weakening and uprooting the terrorist bases  militarily and ideologically. In doing so  we must not underestimate them  nor should we overestimate them and fall for their childish  irresponsible and useless propaganda.Those brutal terrorist organizations  wherever they may be — in Nairobi  Mogadishu or elsewhere in the world — have no mercy for humankind. But I reassure the Assembly that we will fight and defeat Al-Shabaab in the deserts and in the towns  on digital and on social media. We will fight them on the airwaves and in the newspapers. We challenge them in schools  colleges and universities  and we will overcome them. We have defeated them militarily on the battlefield  and we must now defeat their poisonous ideology with innovative strategies  cutting-edge technologies  comprehensive education and vigorous communication. That is the commitment that we will fulfil  and I call on our partners to remain strong and stand shoulder to shoulder with Kenya and with Somalia. Only if we remain resolute and together will we prevail.In just one year  the cornerstones of a new Somalia have been successfully and peacefully laid down. We have made milestone achievements in security  public finance management  reconciliation  political outreach and laying the foundations of good governance with appropriate legislation in place. The federal Government of Somalia has now established the basis of a new public finance management system  which we believe will enable our donors to agree to funding arrangements with the confidence that funds will reach their intended recipients.That is at the heart of the New Deal compact we signed in Brussels earlier this month. The compact represents a paradigm shift in how the international community engages with Somalia  and I welcome that transformation wholeheartedly. The New Deal will help Somalia preserve its unity and sovereignty and lay a strong foundation  22 years on  for building reliable  transparent and accountable functioning State institutions that are respectful of the fundamental rights and freedoms and equality of its citizens.To succeed  the New Deal must be more than words and frameworks. It must deliver on the ground. There are huge expectations that the compact will revolutionize the service-delivery efforts of the Government. We need to transform the lives of our people  connect with our citizens and enhance their well-being. In the meantime  we have started a campaign to revitalize service delivery in districts and regions throughout Somalia  to provide health care  and to enable access to clean water. We have launched  for the first time  an initiative called “Go to School”. Under its auspices  we are planning to enrol 100 000 students in the schools in the current academic year  and 1 million students will eventually be in school within the coming three years. That is not without challenges  but we commit ourselves and we will prevail.On the other hand  I would like to present to the Assembly the political progress that we are making in Somalia. We believe that a political solution is the first step in building a stable governance framework in our country. We have begun to lay the foundations for the return of effective  stable and representative governance in Somalia  the cornerstone of lasting peace.To that end  Somalia should possess a full-fledged constitution reflecting a broad national consensus on how we wish to govern ourselves. We must complete the establishment of our federal system and advance the process of democratization through the development of a multiparty electoral system. Accordingly  our Parliament has already passed legislation establishing an independent Constitutional Review and Implementation Commission  as required by the provisional Constitution. We must move quickly to put in place other critical statutory bodies  including a boundaries and federation commission and a national independent electoral commission  the tasks of which will be to guide our thinking and inform our actions and decisions in order to complete Somalia’s journey to unity  stability and democracy.In March  my Government signed an agreement with the authorities in Puntland  framing our shared commitment to implementing a federal system of governance  as agreed. On 27 August  we signed an accord that establishes an interim Juba Administration  which also aspires to become a federal member state in accordance with the Constitution. The agreement  achieved after long months of painstaking negotiations  demonstrates what can be achieved through the combination of Somali political leadership and the steadfast support of our close neighbours.We have begun similar processes elsewhere in Somalia  establishing interim administrations in the remaining regions to pursue the twin goals of peacebuilding and State-building across many regions in Somalia. Members of Parliament have also played a key role in all of those processes  working with their constituencies and serving as a critical channel of communication between the people of their constituencies and the federal Government.With the good offices of the Government of Turkey  we have continued our dialogue with the authorities in Somaliland  underscoring our determination to preserve the unity of the country  not by force and coercion  but through dialogue  mutual respect and understanding. Somali unity must be more than a rhetorical device; it must preserve and promote the dignity  equality and legitimate aspirations of all Somali citizens. By adhering to such principles  we are confident that our dialogue with Somaliland will not only continue  but will eventually bear fruit.Those are major milestones  but enormous challenges still lie ahead. These challenges were clearly articulated by the participants at the Vision 2016 Conference convened on 2 September in Mogadishu  where some of the best minds in the country and from Somali communities living abroad came together to offer their remarkable experience  insights and expertise in charting the way forward for the future of Somalia. At another major gathering just last week in Mogadishu  respected Somali religious leaders and elders from across the country announced their determination to have a future free from the intolerance and extremism that have taken root in recent years.We are committed to ensuring that  in the course of the daily struggle to rebuild our country  we do not lose sight of the longer-term challenges ahead. We are announcing the Vision 2016 initiative  which is a concerted effort under my leadership to complete the Constitution  organize the federal system and prepare the ground for elections in 2016. We will need direction  determination  discipline and human and financial resources if we are to succeed as we roll out the concrete objectives and benchmarks set forth in the initiative.Finally  people may ask why Somalia matters at this time  but there is a huge amount at stake right now — the future of our country  the security of the region and the wider world  in the light  in particular  of the war against Al-Qaida in Somalia and the removal of the piracy stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean  which are indeed challenges that we share with the world. The progress that has been made in Somalia on those critical issues over the past years would not have been possible without the courageous support of the member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  the African Union through its troop-contributing countries  and the ultimate sacrifice made by many brave African soldiers. We pay tribute to them  and we owe it to their memory to ensure that we do not take a single step backwards.I would equally like to thank the European Union for its leadership in organizing the recent conference in Brussels. I would also like to thank the Member States that not only made the commitment to take part in the meeting  but also showed great generosity in making pledges to help the development and reconstruction of Somalia. We hope that others will do as they have done.We welcome the new United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM)  with which we are now working to bring peace and stability to the country. UNSOM is doing a great job  and we look forward to addressing all outstanding issues together. UNSOM has shown a commitment to bringing its offices back to Somalia. Tragically  the extremists  who are terrified of progress  were able to kill innocent people in an attack against the United Nations compound in Mogadishu. I offer my sincere condolences to the United Nations and the families of the victims. The United Nations has reacted mindfully and reiterated its support for Somalia. I thank the Organization for that courage and commitment.War is something we Somalis have experienced too much of in recent years  and we feel particular sadness when we look at Syria and see our brothers embarking on a civil war that will only bring the ruin of the country. It is much easier to start a war than to end one. After two years  the conflict in Syria is already entrenched. Hatred has taken hold of the hearts of too many men and women  while a new generation of children has to endure a childhood full of suffering  with no education.As a Somali who has lived through the world’s longest  most devastating civil war  I can speak with bitter experience of the legacies of war. We must not allow the use of chemical weapons against human beings in war or otherwise  let alone against children  women and vulnerable people. The international community must assume its responsibility and send a powerful massage to those who are responsible for the continued conflict in Syria. We must continue to encourage all sides in Syria and their international allies to realize that the only way out of the tragedy is dialogue and negotiation.Before I conclude  let me reiterate that impunity has no place in the world  but selective justice and targeted trials are against the principles of peace  justice and reconciliation. Regrettably  the trials of African leaders at the International Criminal Court have become politically motivated  in contravention of agreed objectives and principles. As a result  the wounds of conflict remain unhealed and the national unity and cohesion of many African countries is jeopardized.I would like to conclude by thanking the General Assembly and paying tribute to the dedicated support of its members. Together we can make Somalia strong again. We have planted the seeds of a new Somalia. We wish to see it grow into a tree standing tall in the African bush  with deep roots binding it securely to its region and offering shade and protection to its people as they rebuild their lives."
"156",6392,"SSD",68,2013,"It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly for the first time as Vice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.First  I would like to express the heartfelt condolences of the Government and the people of South Sudan to the people and the Government of the Republic of Kenya  in particular the families of those affected by the brutal and inhuman act of terror in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi. We condemn all acts of terrorism and pledge our full cooperation and support to all efforts geared towards ridding the region and indeed the globe of terrorism.I convey sincere my gratitude  as well as that of President Kiir Mayardit and the people of South Sudan  to the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  the Troika  and all people of goodwill for diplomatically helping us to bring to an end to the conflict that had devastated our country for decades. We are grateful in particular to the international community for closely monitoring the difficult implementation of the peace accord. Given the complexity of the issues involved  the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has been relatively successful  although the protocols of the two states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile  the case of the contested area of Abyei  and the demarcation of the borders between South Sudan and the Sudan continue to impede the full implementation of the peace accord.Our country is well endowed with abundant natural resources. Our relations with the Sudan have recently involved unexpected tensions  with intermittent suspensions of oil flow through the Sudan. Inside the South itself  old quarrels dating back to time immemorial have re-emerged among certain communities over cattle-grazing and water points. This became complicated during the last war as guns of various calibre fell into the hands of unauthorized civilians. We are working hard as a Government to entrench peace in all corners of South Sudan. We have established programmes to rehabilitate and integrate former rebel groups into our armed forces and society at large.We have to build a country literally from scratch  with non-existent physical and social infrastructure. This has given us the worst human development indicators in the world  including high maternal and infant mortality rates and high illiteracy rates among a population of over 8 million.While we recognize that  as humans and as a Government  we must have made errors of judgment as we sought to fix a war-devastated country  successful steps have also been taken  and we appeal for the goodwill shown to us in those times of difficulty to continue. We are confronted with the test of adherence to human rights as a consequence of malicious action by external hands  rather than of our own making. We commend any objective criticism and we call on the experts on South Sudan also to appreciate the bigger picture of how well the country is run in our nine other states besides Jonglei.We are presently running a Government with acceptable standards of competence. A decentralized system of governance is the outcome of a conscious decision taken by South Sudan’s political leadership  as enshrined in the 2011 transitional Constitution  to build a broad-based democracy in the post-conflict setting. We set up the 10 states with popularly elected governors and democratic legislatures as a nucleus of good governance. In 2010  President Kiir Mayardit was democratically and overwhelmingly elected. Our noble struggle was to actualize the ideals and values of true democracy  so cherished by our people.According to our Constitution  the next elections will be held in 2015. Indeed  on 18 September  our President publicly confirmed the date. The governing party  the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) will hold another general convention in March 2014 to freely elect its structures in preparation for the 2015 national general elections.Let me turn to the issue of women. Women have suffered discrimination since 1956  with a literacy rate hardly reaching 18 per cent. The SPLM as a ruling party is now raising women’s political participation from the 25 per cent in the current Constitution to a minimum of 35 per cent in the proposed permanent constitution.In recent years  the National Legislative Assembly  of which I was twice elected Speaker and where I served a total of eight years  enacted a good number of laws  including the Petroleum Revenue Management Act and the Investment Act  among many others  setting out clear rules on how we can efficiently and prudently spend our oil revenues. With the support of our development partners in the region and internationally  we have now embarked on the development of our infrastructure. Numerous infrastructural projects are under way. In response to the oil shutdown last year  the Government implemented austerity measures. We reduced Government spending by 40 per cent  and at the moment we have considerably increased non-oil revenue collection. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that public funds are properly utilized and that our spending is rigorously monitored. We are thus determined to uncompromisingly fight practices of maladministration  including corruption.We deeply regret the loss of the lives of the Indian peacekeepers  the Russian helicopter crew and the Kenyan and South Sudanese relief workers in Pibor county. We express our condolences to the families and the Governments of those who lost their lives. We wish to assure the international community that such tragic incidents will not be repeated.Jonglei state  the most populous  with inaccessible terrain  has been of particular concern to us as a Government as well as to the international community. There is no doubt about that. It has serious security and infrastructural impediments. We regret the security impediments in Jonglei and assure the international community of our Government’s determination to transform our army  the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA)  into a professional national army that respects human rights and the rule of law and is committed to the protection of civilians. The President has declared a general amnesty for the rebel groups  and already two large groups  one under General Bapin and the second under General Johnson Oluny  have responded positively. The President has also ordered the mandatory disarmament of the civilian population and has taken legal steps to punish the perpetrators of human rights violations in Jonglei  including an SPLA Brigade Commander  who is now under arrest together with 13 soldiers who have been sentenced to prison terms that range from three to five years. To date 84 cases of human rights abuses have been tried in the courts of law. We are determined to see that the violations committed by some indisciplined SPLA elements do not go unpunished. Recently the Government formed a peace and reconciliation committee headed by top religious leaders to promote dialogue with all groups  including rebel groups in Pibor county.The Government has allowed the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS)  the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other humanitarian bodies unhindered access to all parts of the country  including  of course  Jonglei state. Regarding the situation in Pibor county  which has been of particular concern to all of us  we have determined  thanks to UNMISS and OCHA  the number of people who are currently registered for food distribution in various camps for internally displaced persons and villages. If that number is compared with the pre-conflict population of Pibor county  we could now be relatively relieved at the fact that most of those who had been unaccounted for are in fact alive and receiving much-needed humanitarian assistance from United Nations agencies and other organizations. Out of the total population of approximately 140 000 in Pibor  for instance  nearly 100 000 people have been identified in the Pibor bush alone  along with another 10 000 in Juba City and 26 000 registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. We appeal from this rostrum for expeditious relief assistance in various forms.Another urgent security demand is the training of a police force capable of eliminating the high rate of crime we are experiencing in Pibor county and  indeed  the entire country. UNMISS  to which we express our profound appreciation  has helped transform hundreds of former combatants into a police force conscious of the rule of law. UNMISS is doing a very commendable job under its able leadership. The rate of crime caused by the proliferation of small arms has been alarming. While our police force has managed to apprehend many criminals  others are still at large. The Government is committed to erasing this menace. We refute any allegation to the effect that such violations are deliberate and systematic orchestrations.Our relationship with the Sudan has been a mixture of cooperation and squabbles. Fundamentally  both sides acknowledge that there is no alternative to lasting peace other than harmony and cooperation  given our shared history. That is why President Kiir Mayardit  remarkably  visited Khartoum early this month and held amicable discussions with his counterpart  President Omer Hassan Al-Bashir of the Sudan. They agreed to enhance cooperation on all fronts  including allowing the unhindered flow of oil from South Sudan through the Sudan.We call on the parties at war in the Sudan to find a durable political solution to the conflict  a situation to which the CPA has provided a workable remedy. We urge the international community to play a positive  stepped-up role in narrowing the gap between both parties. The civil war currently taking place in the Nuba mountains and Blue Nile regions of the Sudan  as well as in Darfur  has created an influx of refugees to South Sudan  and that is a source of concern for us. We appeal for humanitarian access and supplies for those refugees. Given our unique knowledge  acquaintance and position as partners to Khartoum and former comrades-in-arms in the fighting forces in those two regions  in addition to our interest in realizing peace along our northern border  the Government of South Sudan can play a constructive mediation role if required.On Abyei  we will continue to cooperate with the Republic of the Sudan to implement the agreement on the final status of Abyei through a referendum  set for October 2013 by the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel. The African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council accepted the proposal as “representing a fair  equitable and workable solution”. The international community must therefore ensure that this proposal is implemented expeditiously.Our new Government in Juba  energetic and with new faces  is leaner  so as to reduce expenditure  but broader in terms of inclusiveness of other political parties and civil society  even those without party affiliation. The reshuffle has been highly supported and applauded countrywide  with a recent opinion poll carried out by two organizations — CRN and ST — showing 84.7 per cent for the new team and 92 per cent for the choice of the new Vice-President. While many  including our friends  had doubted our ability to peacefully manage as simple a political exercise as a cabinet reshuffle  the domestic backing is revealing. Our immediate agenda for the new phase  which we are calling phase two  is to improve health care  education  roads  electricity supply and the quality of life. We are determined to uproot impunity and corruption  phenomena which plague post-conflict States  wherever they may be  and which can derail all of our efforts and determination to succeed. Based on its resolve to combat corruption and set a new standard  our Government has erased 16 000 “ghost names” it found on the police payroll. We are carrying out a similar exercise in the military and other organized forces.In conclusion  I wish to repeat that we remain steadfast in our vision of a country at peace with itself and with its neighbours — a country which is growing in security  the rule of law and human rights and progressing towards justice and prosperity. I offer my sincere thanks to our many partners and friends for their continued support. We look towards the future confident of what we  a people emerging from marginalization and suffering civil strife  can accomplish together.The Organization has to redouble its efforts to nurture and reinforce its new Member  South Sudan  both economically and in its determination to put an end to human rights violations. It is important for the United Nations to monitor and promote the complete implementation of the cooperation agreements reached between South Sudan and Sudan to cement harmonious and peaceful coexistence."
"157",6424,"STP",68,2013,"On behalf of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  the country that I have the honour of representing in the highest forum of international diplomacy  where all States have an equal voice regardless of size or geographic location and which was created as a result of a pressing need for communication and dialogue among the peoples of the world  I would first like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Your experience as a diplomat gives us confidence that you will masterfully conduct the work of the General Assembly. In the Assembly we anticipate pertinent debates concerning issues of the greatest concern to the international community on which we hope to achieve consensus and identify the best paths to lasting solutions.We also wish to express our appreciation and esteem to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and his efforts in conducting the work of the Organization  and we thank His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his positive contribution as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.Today  unfortunately  we are forced to begin our statement by expressing the strongest condemnation of the bloody terrorist attack in Kenya. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe offers its most profound sentiments of sorrow and our solidarity with the people of Kenya  their Government and the bereaved families.The current international environment does not seem to have changed significantly since the previous session. Indeed  new bloody conflicts and violence seem to break out almost on a daily basis everywhere  revealing the deep disagreements and antagonisms that exist both within each State and among various States in the community of nations. The profound imbalance in international relations  the injustice of the trading system  the enormous divide in access to goods and in cultural values and the glaring disparities in information access and knowledge among the peoples of our planet do not contribute to improved living conditions for millions of human beings. Rather  they lead to increased conflict and threats to international peace and security.As it has done each year  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe reaffirms  in accordance with its principles  its desire to see the United Nations assume a more active role in righting the imbalances and in efforts to mediate and resolve international conflicts.The fight against poverty  the struggle against injustice and promoting greater dissemination of knowledge must  in our view  remain ongoing concerns of the Organization  so as to ensure that all peoples achieve satisfactory development and dignity  in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals  thereby reducing the level of conflict and hostility that is prevalent in the world today.Along those lines  my country has implemented extensive political and institutional reforms in various areas  in order to engage all of its citizens in building a more democratic and transparent Government and a more participatory society in the pursuit of solutions to help fight poverty. We have not forgotten the need to provide the entire population with easier access to education  basic health care and safe drinking water  as well as modern communications  as a means to increase knowledge and improve living conditions. That requires an enormous effort from a country with scant economic and financial resources; it therefore requires international aid to achieve sustainability and the established development goals.My country congratulates and commends you  Sir  for the relevance and timeliness of the theme proposed for the current session of the General Assembly — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — which remains relevant despite the ongoing financial and economic crisis the world is facing. My country remains firmly convinced that addressing that important theme in its various dimensions during the current session and through 2015 will encourage each and every State Member of the United Nations to contribute more effectively and dynamically towards the future we want.In addition to identifying the progress made in implementing the eight Millennium Development Goals  the debate and reflection on the post-2015 development agenda allows us to explore ways and means of building a more promising future for our nations and our peoples.The sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has completed two important phases of public consultation aimed at guiding the country in re-charting its course to achieveing the Millennium Development Goals and enabling our positive contribution to the new post-2015 development agenda.Good governance  economic development  developing human capital  food and nutritional security  as well as peace  tranquillity and security  are among the areas in which Sao Tome and Principe must improve its performance in the near future and represent the basic requirements to drive the country’s development.The citizens of Sao Tome and Principe are of the view that a new development agenda must offer a framework to consolidate the significant progress made in implementing the eight Millennium Development Goals — especially in the areas of education and health — as well as an opportunity to advance international political participation and exchange aimed at development in the context of a continuously evolving political and economic environment and increasing global challenges. We therefore thank the various development partners of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for their valuable contributions towards the achievement of our goals.Since its establishment  in 1945  in accordance with the principles and objectives enshrined in its Charter  the United Nations has been called on to play an important role in building and maintaining peace and security in the world as an essential condition for promoting development on a global scale. However  all agree that the Organization must adapt to the new challenges of the times. Its operational and functional structures must become more dynamic  with greater flexibility  so as to meet the increasing demands of the new era.The ongoing reform of the entire United Nations system must be completed  and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe urges acceleration of that process. We believe that a broad and consensual reform of the United Nations will provide the Organization with the greater flexibility  representation  effectiveness  capacity and legitimacy that it requires to continue to ensure peace  security and development for its Members.Unfortunately  the bloody conflicts that appear to proliferate almost everywhere and emerge where they are least expected are not decreasing in number. Whether caused by social antagonisms resulting from the poor distribution of wealth or from ethnic or religious intolerance  the fact is that they persist.There has been no significant progress in resolving the continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  despite the laudable efforts of the international community — namely  the United Nations and the African Union — towards finding a solution that leads to peace and stability in the region. Therefore  we cannot fail to appeal to the neighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for constructive forms of cooperation and trust in their relationships.We welcome the progress made in Guinea-Bissau following the many initiatives undertaken by the international community  namely  the United Nations  the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). We congratulate the United Nations and African Union representatives to Guinea-Bissau for their efforts as mediators in the country  in cooperation with other stakeholders. Those efforts created conditions conducive to promoting further progress in stabilizing and preparing the country for the general elections and in restoring it to constitutional and democratic normality — the profound aspiration of its people.My country is counting seriously on the stabilization process and encourages all parties involved to do their best to achieve the established goals. In coordination with the other States members of the CPLP  we will continue to exert every effort to contribute to the success of that process  so that peace and happiness may return to the people of our sister nation.Mali  another country tormented by a fratricidal war  seems to have finally reached an encouraging point  as it recently held presidential elections with results that have been peacefully and universally accepted. We congratulate the new President and hope that he may find the best path towards maintaining peace and inclusive dialogue among all Malians.The Central African Republic is today experiencing one of the worst moments in its history. Indeed  we have observed barbaric acts there  such as summary executions and widespread pillage. Public services are crumbling. The humanitarian situation has already been determined to be catastrophic by United Nations specialized agencies  thus requiring vigorous and urgent action. Therefore  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  out of concern for the suffering of the tormented people of our sister nation  appeals to the entire international community for a more vigorous intervention to mitigate their suffering  preserve national sovereignty and help national political actors to promote national unity and political stability.The longstanding issue of the Western Sahara calls for our attention and requires greater involvement from all in the search for a definitive solution to the protracted negotiation process. We therefore welcome with satisfaction the willingness expressed by the Moroccan Government to support the efforts of the international community to achieve a negotiated political and mutually acceptable solution  and encourage both parties to return to the negotiation process.Currently  our attention is focused on the issue of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea  which greatly affects the safety of navigation and may destabilize countries in the region. That would prevent them from taking advantage of their natural resources  causing great harm to their population. The territorial waters of Sao Tome and Principe are 150 times the size of our land mass. Therefore  we are extremely concerned about the risks of acts of piracy spreading in the Gulf of Guinea. Recently  the Heads of State and Government of countries that form the Commission of the Gulf of Guinea  which we seek to expand  held a summit to adopt measures aimed at combating that scourge. But our firm action in that regard will be successful only if we can also count on the efforts of the entire international community.The Gulf of Guinea is a point of reference in navigation routes that connect the northern and southern hemispheres  as well as other important economic regions of the world. Its protection deserves everyone’s attention. Combating piracy requires the establishment of an environment that is conducive to global security. Since piracy is normally associated with transnational crimes such as the trafficking of arms  drugs and persons  which Sao Tome and Principe condemns emphatically  my country has joined other States in the region to combat such activities and has taken steps at the national level that make it more difficult for our territory to be used for the purpose of money laundering or the financing of other illicit or criminal acts.With regard to the bloody conflict that is ravaging Syria and causing a humanitarian tragedy of great proportions  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe vehemently condemns the use of chemical weapons in violation of all international agreements. We also take this opportunity to welcome recent developments towards dismantling the Syrian arsenal of chemical weapons and urge both parties to the conflict and the international community to pursue a compromise that will lead to the cessation of hostilities  thereby paving the way for open dialogue and negotiations within a multilateral framework aimed at a political solution to establish lasting peace.As for the Israeli-Palestinian issue  we urgently appeal to both Israel and Palestine to move towards resolving their differences through dialogue  based on respect for the integrity of the State of Israel and the right of a Palestinian State to exist.The Republic of Cuba  whose internal reforms we welcome  has the right to choose its path freely  without any restrictions imposed by an embargo that penalizes its economic and social development  with grave consequences for the country’s population.We also acknowledge the climate of constructive dialogue between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China  which serves to send a positive signal that tensions are decreasing in the region  which we welcome and encourage. Both parties along the Formosa Strait must work peacefully towards reaching an agreement on the normalization of their relations. For our part  we continue to support the integration of Taiwan within international organizations.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm my country’s commitment to contributing  with the United Nations  towards a peaceful and negotiated solution to international conflicts  and hope that the post-2015 development agenda will translate into programmes that can help improve the living conditions of all people on our planet."
"158",6465,"SUR",68,2013,"Allow me at the outset  on behalf of the President of the Republic of Suriname  His Excellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse  and the people and the Government of Suriname  to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election. With your election you bring honour to your country  Antigua and Barbuda  and to the Caribbean. With your background in sustainable development  you are well prepared to lead us in our deliberations on this year’s theme  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. I assure you of the support and cooperation of Suriname during your presidency.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his leadership during the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Furthermore  I commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his management of the United Nations with regard to peace and security in various parts of the globe.Setting a new stage urgently requires much effort at the national as well as the international level to achieve the ultimate goal of improving the standard of living of our peoples and bringing about the sustainable development of our countries. The Millennium Development Goals are an important first step towards addressing some of the worst socioeconomic conditions facing approximately 40 per cent of humankind  targeted as they are at reducing the worst manifestations of underdevelopment.In our view  the success of the Millennium Development Goals depends on two sets of simultaneous actions: first  a reorientation of national responsibilities; and  second  of equal importance  the reorientation of the international community. Such reorientation will enable us to chart a more meaningful path towards meeting the targets of the Millennium Development Goals and moving towards the post-2015 Development agenda.That is particularly relevant if we take heed of the 2013 report on the Millennium Development Goals  which reveals some rather interesting facts  such as: most developing countries are performing well in meeting the targets; and developed countries  which have committed themselves to Goal 8 by making their aid pledges viable and effective  are nevertheless well behind in their general performance in meeting the targets.Official development assistance is in constant decline  and the agreements concluded in 2001 within the context of the World Trade Organization to improve access to international markets have been stalled during the Doha Round. That stalling has proved to be so harmful that dealing with market access on behalf of the poorest nations has been left out of subsequent agendas. Furthermore  as we all know  the ongoing financial and economic crisis is having a detrimental impact on developing nations because official development assistance is drastically declining.Clearly  a number of large developing countries  mainly in Asia  as well as some countries endowed with natural resources in Africa and South America  have made substantial economic progress. Their statistics  however  should not blind us to the fact that inequality is rampant and that almost 1.2 billion people are still living in extreme poverty and do not have access to affordable and adequate health services  while millions of children are still denied their right to primary education.We have learned the important lesson that developing countries are obliged to undertake adequate measures to strengthen economic interactions among themselves in addition to ties with their traditional trading partners in the North. We must give substance to South-South cooperation. That is an important consideration for setting a new stage for global sustainable development. In this context  foreign direct investment is considered to be a factor of vital importance.It is encouraging to note that a number of countries  including my own  Suriname  have been upgraded from low-income status to middle-income status by international financial institutions and United Nations agencies. Our efforts to develop prudent macroeconomic and appropriate fiscal policies  combined with our initiatives to diversify our economy  and the sacrifices borne by our people  have led to this improved status. Applying per capita income as the major indicator for determining our development status has  however  manoeuvred us into a position where we have lost access to the necessary concessional loans and grants. The conclusion can be drawn that our people are being punished for their ability to overcome some of the obstacles that have made them less fortunate in the past.Within this interdependent world  we will continue to build on our own strength as the main driving force for the achievement of our development agenda. Furthermore  we believe that building upon national strengths  within the context of participation in subregional and regional cooperation frameworks  is the right way forward to finding proper solutions for development. On the basis of what has been achieved at the regional level  a global approach might become more feasible.Suriname shares the view that we should base the post-2015 development agenda on a people-centred approach  with a specific focus on the most vulnerable in society  in particular  women  youth  the elderly and people with disabilities. In so doing — and this we emphasize — we should strike the right balance between our positive macroeconomic situation and a micro situation that is in dire need of improvement.We are in the course of developing policies and programmes to fight non-communicable diseases that have led to decreased productivity. Non-communicable diseases have now become the leading cause of death in Suriname and in other countries in our region. There is special emphasis on improving education and bringing it closer to our socioeconomic reality. We intend to work more closely with relevant international organizations such as the Pan American Health Organization  the World Health Organization  UNESCO  UNICEF and others.The Government also attaches great importance to issues involving young people. In this regard  a large-scale after-school programme with the aim of enhancing better learning for youth deserves mention. The successful experiences in regional cooperation mechanisms  such as the one in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  as well as the one that is being considered in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  are clear examples of how youth can contribute to the connectivity between peoples and the enhancement of unity.Taking into account global processes and cognizant of the opportunities and challenges from CARICOM and UNASUR  the post-2015 development agenda should emanate from an inclusive  intergovernmental process. That process should be directed towards: the continued eradication of poverty; a people-centred approach  combining economic activity with the social need for education and health care  thereby promoting the welfare and well-being of all; and the integration of economic and social action and strengthening of human capital.Global warming has a direct negative impact on the development of small island developing States and low-lying coastal States  including Suriname. Suriname shares its grave concern regarding the state of the global climate and the stalled United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process. The Government of Suriname strongly recommends that the General Assembly face these challenges by making them part of the post-2015 development agenda.In setting the stage for development goals beyond 2015  we cannot ignore the various threats to international peace. International peace  security and human rights are indispensable in creating an enabling environment for sustainable development. Suriname is well aware of the fact that national sovereignty and national security are seriously affected by the indiscriminate use of violence in fighting terrorism and other forms of transnational organized crime. Challenges related to armed conflicts  poverty  food  the environment  education  public health  migration and energy require increased collaboration. In this respect  partnership among Governments  international and regional organizations and civil society is a must. We applaud the South American and Caribbean nations for their efforts towards regional peace and stability. Their willingness and capacity for further dialogue and persuasion is a better way to achieve and maintain peace than the use of violence and military intervention.We are proud to belong to a region that has declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone.We express the hope that the two-State solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will gain more substance  allowing the peoples of both countries the prospect of peace and prosperity. Suriname maintains the position that the multilateral process within the United Nations should prevail in the search for a peaceful solution for the crisis in Syria.The Cuban people have the right to participate as full members in all regional organizations  and we strongly urge that all obstacles that have prevented their full participation so far be removed  including the outdated and inhuman unilateral economic  financial and commercial embargo.With regard to the Republic of Haiti  the international community tends to lose attention for the necessary follow-up activities to get Haiti back on its feet. Once again we call upon the international community to fulfil its commitments.In closing  I take advantage of this opportunity to inform the Assembly that  exactly 30 days ago  my country  Suriname  took over the pro tempore presidency of the Union of South American Nations  a young and vibrant regional body. We pledge that Suriname will  during its presidency  further the goals of UNASUR and contribute to international peace  security and sustainable development."
"159",6489,"SVK",68,2013,"To address the General Assembly on behalf of Slovak citizens is a great responsibility. It is a great responsibility for all of us who have been entrusted with such a mandate by our citizens. They rightly expect that this unique global Organization will seek and find effective solutions to bring greater peace  stability and prosperity to humankind.I believe that with President Ashe’s experience we will succeed in that task. I wish to thank his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for the vigour with which he presided over the General Assembly at its last session. I convey my deepest respect to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whose foresight and impartial service epitomize the values of the Organization.We have been going through a period of controversial changes and unperceived opportunities  as well as unprecedented challenges. The one thing that remains unchanged  however  is the power of our joint efforts and cooperation. Thrown off balance  the world expects that we will assume responsibility for taking resolute action together and on behalf of humanity  not governed solely by our narrow national or corporate interests. The time has come to learn to respect our diversity and become in truth the United Nations. Achieving the two primary goals of this Organization — peace and prosperity for all — remains our greatest challenge and our primary responsibility. Effective multilateralism is therefore in the national interest of us all.Our resolve and ability to respond effectively are being tested by the current Syrian crisis. The conflict threatens the entire region. It is frightening not only because of the number of casualties and refugees; what is equally alarming is the inability of the Security Council to take any effective action. Thoughtful reflection on all the possible consequences of a military intervention in Syria makes it clear that there is only one good solution to this conflict  the diplomatic one. We must not be afraid to choose compromise solutions that could serve as a basis for positive resolution of the problem in the future. The United Nations plays a key role in ensuring that civilians have access to humanitarian aid  and that those who commit crimes against humanity are punished and  above all  in enforcing a truce and launching talks on stable post-conflict arrangements under the “Geneva II” initiative. Slovakia condemns the use of chemical weapons on principle as a crime against humanity and requests urgently that the perpetrators be brought before the International Criminal Court. Continued engagement on the part of the United Nations is essential  since there is no functioning alternative to its role.Our recent experience in addressing international and national crises and conflicts in various regions of the world  including the so-called Arab spring  encourages us to be extremely cautious when considering action by the international community. The analysis of the consequences of such action must be at least as detailed and elaborate as that of how to conduct a potential intervention.Slovakia’s involvement in international crisis management and in building and maintaining peace  stability and prosperity has long focused on Afghanistan  where the Slovak Republic has provided military as well as civilian and humanitarian aid. We greatly appreciate the work done by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and its challenging role in assisting the Afghan Government with its security  political and economic transition. Indeed  security  economic development  good governance  the protection of human rights for all and  last but not least  the preparation and organization of free elections  must be the founding pillars in building a new Afghan State. The upcoming presidential election will be a milestone in Afghanistan’s history. The key to success of all these processes  even beyond 2014  is national reconciliation  based on the principles of constitutionality and respect for human rights. Afghanistan needs consistent  predictable and targeted support and assistance both from its neighbours and the entire international community. We consider cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations pivotal in that regard.Africa remains a vulnerable continent with a high concentration of conflicts. We believe that it will be able to make progress towards stability  prosperity and greater cooperation in a sustainable manner  with help from the United Nations and regional organizations such as the African Union. The 50 years of the African Union’s existence have contributed to increased cooperation and development throughout the continent  and I believe it will stay on that path. Preventing conflicts and resolving their primary causes are long and complex processes. Africa still needs attention and assistance from the international community  with a focus on preventive diplomacy and national ownership of all processes. The Slovak Republic supports more intensive cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union  as well as closer relations between the African Union and the European Union.We continue to pay close attention to the security situation in the Middle East. We are glad to see some positive signals among the worrying news from this part of the world. Slovakia welcomes and supports the renewal of talks between Israel and Palestine. It seems  however  that talks are not enough. A number of binding agreements and resolutions have been agreed on to date in order to resolve numerous issues  but they have not been sufficiently complied with. We therefore expect more in the way of implementation of agreed solutions. That is vital to peace  security  stability and further development in the entire region.Terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to peace and security. It plays a key role in many conflicts and most of its victims are civilians. We should keep our resolve to do everything to reach an agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We will find a solution only through joint efforts under the auspices of the United Nations.We cannot have a secure  safe and stable environment without effective arms control and disarmament procedures in place as the basic instrument for conflict prevention. The signing of the Arms Trade Treaty has shown that the United Nations has the potential to make history and contribute substantively to greater security in the world through its shared commitment to a responsible approach to arms trading. Slovakia believes that the collective efforts of the international community can ensure that the Treaty will soon enter into force  and we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to promote that. With regard to eliminating nuclear threats and their secondary consequences for health and the environment  Slovakia actively supports the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which we consider to be an important pillar of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.I wish to particularly stress — and I repeat this at every meeting here at the United Nations — that security sector reform is a key component of post-conflict development and effective reinforcement of the rule of law. In the context of the consolidation process  we therefore consider it an inseparable part of the security/rule of law/development structure. If we cannot give people security  safety  education and jobs  they will be quick to draw guns again in desperation. Unfortunately  experience offers proof of that. Slovakia closely cooperates with the United Nations in building the effective and adequate capacity essential to security sector reform and emphasizing national and local ownership of all processes. The United Nations is a guarantor of an impartial system of support to its members in that area.Enduring peace requires respect for freedom  democracy  the rule of law and human rights. The culture of impunity has no place in today’s world. The role of the International Criminal Court in the multilateral system is irreplaceable in that regard  as it focuses on preventing the perpetrators of the most serious crimes from going unpunished. But its decisions must be unquestionable. The Slovak Republic welcomed the adoption of amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in June 2010. Therefore  we call on all United Nations Members that have not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute and its amendments.This year  we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights and the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Those historic documents are still relevant and represent a priority objective that the activities of the international community should pursue. They confirm that the universal nature of all human rights and fundamental freedoms is beyond question. At the same time  they emphasize the interconnection between peace and security  economic and social development  and respect for human rights.There can be no peace without economic stability and prosperity. Ensuring sustainable development and social stability is beyond doubt the most effective way to prevent conflicts. That is an agenda in which the United Nations has enormous potential; however  it is one of the most fragmented within the United Nations system. We appreciate that this issue is among the key priorities of the current session.Its relevance is also evident in a series of important side events that focus on meeting the Millennium Development Goals and the development agenda in general. We particularly appreciate the initiative of the General Assembly in organizing the High-level Meeting on Disability and Development with the aim of ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities in the development agenda beyond 2015. There are some 1 billion people with disabilities worldwide  many of them living in poverty  who are still excluded from equitable access to education  health care  jobs  and social and legal support systems. This dialogue is another step forward towards the empowerment of people with disabilities. We want to stress the importance of including this issue in the development agenda beyond 2015. We are also paying increased attention to ensuring access to energy supply  water and safe food for all.Slovakia wants to actively participate in the preparation of the development goals beyond 2015 and is getting ready for a new stage in development cooperation. We have only recently become a member of the Development Assistance Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  reflecting our commitment to becoming a full-fledged member of the international community of donor countries. Slovakia has thoroughly studied the report of the High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  which sets out a global framework for development cooperation goals. The goals and measures must be coherent with and integrate development  social and environmental aspects in line with the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio. The new goals must ensure effective and measurable results. The crucial task will be identifying resources to meet the new sustainable development goals. Our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals have been hindered by the ongoing lack of public funds and resources. The economic and financial crisis has helped to reveal a number of systemic deficiencies in the distribution and control of resources  in particular public ones  as well as the need to draw on innovative resources  including private ones  in the process. Slovakia wants to contribute to the discussion through its work in the Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing.Until recently  Slovakia was a recipient of development assistance. Naturally  it now wants to give back by supporting countries dependent on assistance from the international community. This year  we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of a national system for official development assistance. The focus of the development assistance provided by Slovakia reflects the needs of countries that rely on such assistance and responds to the global challenges within the international community. Slovakia has experience in political and economic transition and integration into European and trans-Atlantic structures. Slovakia now primarily shares the lessons it has learned from building civil society and public governance reforms with the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the Western Balkans  as well as others  including Kenya and Afghanistan. Slovakia concentrates on poverty eradication by facilitating access to health care and education and by enhancing the status of women and young people in those countries.We are going through turbulent times. The United Nations has the potential to be a global leader in ensuring peace and prosperity for all. But if its effectiveness is not enhanced  the Organization’s relevance will be at risk. In order to perform all its tasks  the United Nations must be strong  inclusive and open. Global links require strengthening existing partnerships with regional organizations  partners from the private sector and  last but not least  civil society. We understand that the United Nations needs sufficient financial and human resources to effectively fulfil its mandates  but we call for their more efficient use.This year  Slovakia celebrates the twentieth anniversary of its sovereign existence. It was only natural that the first steps of Slovakia as a sovereign State led to the United Nations. The principles and objectives of the United Nations represent the firm cornerstone of Slovak foreign policy  based on the values of effective multilateralism. Over these 20 years  Slovakia’s cooperation with the United Nations has strengthened and intensified as Slovakia has grown and as its position as a stable democratic country and a reliable  proactive partner at the international level has been strengthened. Thanks to that development  in June I was able to host a summit of 20 Eastern and Central European presidents in Bratislava  where we discussed ways to address the current financial and economic crisis and on good regional cooperation.Slovakia has been contributing to a wide range of United Nations activities through its work in the Organization’s main bodies and its direct involvement in more than 17 peacekeeping operations  as well as by implementing over 400 humanitarian and development projects in more than 20 countries worldwide. Having won the trust of its partners  Slovakia has been elected to all relevant United Nations bodies  enabling it to promote and enforce even more effectively the values of the United Nations in all three main pillars of its work. I can assure the General Assembly that Slovakia will continue its tireless efforts to serve and assist in meeting the United Nations goals as a reliable partner."
"160",6514,"SVN",68,2013,"I would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election and wish him every success. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him for his tireless efforts and leadership in promoting the ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The ideal and principle to which we should aspire is creating a world in which everyone can live free from fear  free from want and in dignity. The United Nations has achieved many extraordinary successes in the past  but we also have to acknowledge some disappointing and frustrating setbacks and failures. I believe that now more than ever  the United Nations must play a major role in international relations. We live at a time when the balance of global power is changing in a rapid and dramatic way. Thus far in history  this kind of global change has never ended without a global conflict. We established the United Nations precisely in order to prevent such a conflict in future.Less than 20 years ago  we witnessed events that shocked our human conscience: genocide in Rwanda  followed by genocide in Srebrenica and Darfur. We should have learned lasting lessons from those horrific events. We vowed never to let that happen again. We collectively endorsed the responsibility to protect human beings from mass atrocities and gross and systematic violations of human rights  and yet we have failed again. We are faced with another human tragedy unfolding before our eyes in Syria. After more than two years of brutal violence against civilians  including women and children  we still have not found a political solution within the framework of the United Nations. Not only is the unconscionable use of chemical weapons in Syria considered a war crime  it is an assault against our common humanity. Sovereignty as responsibility implies that States are responsible for the well-being of their citizens. It does not give them a licence to kill their own citizens. If States manifestly fail to protect their populations  the international community has a duty to react. When faced with mass atrocities  indifference is not  and cannot represent  an option. The report of the United Nations inspectors was clear  credible and impartial. The United States-Russian agreement on the framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons must be implemented without delay. Syria’s accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction is a positive step. Syria should comply immediately and fully  or face the consequences. It is important that diplomacy prevailed and referred the issue back to the United Nations and the Security Council. The Security Council should live up to its responsibility and use all appropriate measures to comprehensively address the situation in Syria. Reaching a political settlement remains the only viable and lasting solution to the crisis and to ensuring stability in the region. We support the timely convening of the “Geneva II” conference.The Security Council has the primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations. It exercises that responsibility on behalf of all of us. It has an obligation to deliver and to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the international community. In this period of tensions and challenges  the responsibility of the major Member States is especially great. In recent years we have witnessed too many divisions in the Council  which have impeded its ability to act in a timely manner. Decisive progress in Security Council reform is required to improve the Council’s efficiency  transparency and accountability. As part of that effort  the permanent members should consider refraining from the use of the veto in situations of genocide  crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law.We call upon the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court is an essential pillar in the system of international justice and a powerful tool to ensure accountability and to fight against impunity for the most serious crimes. It deserves our full support.We must focus more closely on addressing the root causes of conflicts and expand our work on prevention. In particular  we must improve our ability to read the warning signs and trigger early action. The consequences of inaction far outweigh any risks that might arise from timely prevention and response  in terms both of money and — more important — human suffering and lives. That was a lesson learned in our neighbouring region  the Western Balkans. Enhancing mutual trust through open political dialogue is a prerequisite for peaceful coexistence and long-term stability there. Slovenia and Croatia have therefore launched the Brdo process as a forum for high-level dialogue intended to strengthen relations and reconciliation among the countries of the region.The past century was a very dark chapter in Europe and in human history. In August 2014  we will commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. It brought about mass destruction of human life and new methods of warfare that were subsequently condemned by the civilized world. It was followed by the Second World War  and the century ended with a decade of intra-State conflicts and genocides that caused untold human suffering. Let us use our conscience and humanity as the weapon of choice  for everyone deserves to live in dignity and peace  feeling safe  with access to food and drinking water and with a decent job and adequate pay for it. Yet something so obvious seems to be very far from reality. It is our task to bring reality closer to our dreams.Today’s world leaders have a unique opportunity  possibility and responsibility to influence our common future for many decades to come. That is why it is important not to lose focus on the successful implementation of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to agree on the post-2015 agenda. Let us transform our vision of saving future generations from the scourge of war into reality. We have no time to spare. We have no right to fail."
"161",6559,"SWE",68,2013,"The world is constantly changing and the pace of change is increasing every year. The world is a very different place today compared to 10 years ago when the Millennium Development Goals were set. But it is important to understand the nature of the changes and to draw the right conclusions  because only then will we be able to have an influence and shape our own future.We are seeing the fastest reduction in poverty in human history. Child death rates have fallen  meaning that 14 000 fewer children are dying every day. Deaths from malaria and tuberculosis are decreasing. New HIV infections are declining. People are living longer. One hundred years ago  the average life expectancy in Sweden was less than 60 years. Today  many children born in my country will live to celebrate their 100th birthday. Those are truly amazing developments.The world economy is growing. This year  developing and emerging countries’ share of the world economy will surpass the share of developed countries. In 10 years’ time  they will dominate the growing world economy.We see the same pattern in expanding global trade flows. The share of developing countries’ exports has grown substantially and now accounts for almost half of all exports in the world. That creates jobs and growth for everyone and increases global equality. Technological change is also rapid. Seeking information from the other side of the globe is now part of everyday life for many people  not only for the privileged few. As an example  the number of mobile phone users has risen from fewers than 1 billion to more than 6 billion. But challenges are still abundant  and it is crucial that we intensify our efforts to achieve the existing Millennium Development Goals.Sweden continues to contribute 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance. Sweden is a firm believer in multilateral organizations  in international cooperation and in the United Nations. The United Nations plays a key role in coordinating our efforts towards the Millennium Development Goals. We believe that together we can become hopeful instead of helpless. Therefore  Sweden contributes approximately $1.2 billion yearly to the United Nations system. That makes us the second biggest contributor per capita to the United Nations in the world — that is something we are very proud of.In addition to the existing Millennium Development Goals  we must also work to establish a strong post-2015 development agenda  with the objective of eradicating extreme poverty  raising standards of living for everyone and offering equal opportunities to everyone. In that regard  I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the three areas that I believe are central to human and economic development: gender equality  democracy and free trade. Those areas have the capacity to influence developments in many other areas at the same time. When I addressed the General Assembly two years ago (see A/66/PV.19)  I spoke about the most important human rights failure of all — the one that affects the largest number of human beings  namely gender inequality. I want to raise that issue once again  because that challenge is as present and as urgent today as before.Gender equality is first and foremost a question of ensuring the same human  economic and social rights for half of the world’s population  something that should be self-evident. Every year  1 billion women are still subject to sexual or physical violence. Women are still refused equal access to health services  including sexual and reproductive health and rights. Every day 800 women still die from preventable complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. Legal restrictions still exist preventing women from owning  inheriting and acquiring property in many countries. Many girls and women are still refused access to schools and education. For many women the idea that a Government would have more female than male ministers  like in Sweden  seems utopian. Many of those women are not even allowed to vote.Against that background  Sweden was one of the countries that gave strong support to creating the entity UN-Women and is today one of its biggest donors. It is our firm belief that by ensuring gender equality one also improves a country’s productivity and economy and the rule of law. Educating girls and women leads directly to an increase in a country’s economic output. Educated mothers place higher value on schooling for their children. Closing the gap between male and female employment rates increases a country’s gross domestic product substantially. Increased participation by women in politics and business leads to clear improvements for the public good and to less corruption. The inclusion of women in peace processes makes peace easier and more stable. Let me be very clear: it is simply neither acceptable nor very smart to discriminate against women and girls.To achieve sustainable development  we need a democratic governance that encompasses all individuals. We need a system that covers not only the State  but also the private sector and civil society organizations. We need a governing system that is accountable and transparent with regard to its actions. Nevertheless  nearly one third of the world’s population lives under authoritarian rule  a serious barrier to development. With the growing economic power in many developing countries comes an opportunity and a responsibility to use that power wisely and for the common good of everyone. Every person’s human rights must be respected  regardless of origin  religion  handicap  gender  sexual preference or transsexual identity. Only then will society reap the benefits of all human resources. Only when people can freely express their political opinions and freely participate in a thriving civil society can they truly participate in the lives of their communities. That also applies to freedom on the Internet. Only with functioning courts do people feel safe to make investments and develop their businesses. Only with respect for the rule of law can we tackle organized crime and corruption. Only with democratic principles can we ensure freedom from conflict and violence.Violence and oppression in all their forms are among the main threats to the development of people and the development of societies. We know that it takes  on average  seven years to fight a civil war  and 17 years to recover from a war. That is why conflict is sometimes called “development in reverse”. As we speak  there are several major ongoing conflicts  resulting in death and suffering  hunger and disease  and rape and sexual violence. Those conflicts are depriving men  women and children of their right to a prosperous life and a future of hope. A focus on fragile States will remain necessary.The civil war raging in Syria for more than two years must come to an end. Those responsible for systematic violations of human rights  including those responsible for the use of chemical weapons  must be held accountable. The conflict must  however  be handled within the United Nations system. There is an urgent need for a political solution to the conflict and a transition to a free and democratic Syria.It is time for a new era in which countries in conflict can join the rest of the world in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. For that  we need a strong United Nations and a well-functioning Security Council.I want to thank all peacekeepers and peacebuilders of the United Nations for their efforts and sacrifices. Sweden will further contribute to and participate in those efforts. We also give strong support to the areas of democracy  human rights and freedom from violence. Sweden is one of biggest donors to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We are trying to help out though humanitarian assistance for the crisis in Syria and by receiving refugees. This year alone we have welcomed 16 000 Syrians to Sweden.Let me mention a third area that we need to focus on in the post-2015 development agenda  namely  trade and competition. Protectionism is very expensive. It raises prices and lowers standards of living. Let me illustrate this by a striking example. According to the World Trade Organization  consumers and Governments in rich countries pay $350 billion per year supporting agriculture. That is enough to fly their 41 million dairy cows first class around the world.Allow me to mention some other  maybe more down-to-earth  examples. When competition was introduced for mobile phone companies in some countries  the cost of calls fell by 30 to 50 per cent. Studies show that lowering service barriers by one third under the Doha Development Agenda would raise developing countries’ incomes by approximately $60 billion. Unfortunately  progress in the Doha Development Round has been slow. But the good news is that many countries are doing what they can to liberalize trade through regional agreements instead  because they know that that will benefit their economies.The two free trade agreements now being negotiated — between the United States and the European Union and between the United States and a number of countries in Asia and Latin America — will cover two-thirds of world trade. That will create jobs and growth. Sweden is one of the countries within the European Union working the hardest to get the transatlantic deal in place. Freer trade and openness also mean that new impulses and trends affect a country faster. That puts pressure on reform in countries and companies to meet global competition. Sweden is an example of that.Trade has made it possible for us to double our economic output. Our companies have learned that they must consistently take on new trends and technology in order to stay competitive. If they did not  our gross domestic product and standard of living would fall significantly. Let us also remember how important trade is for peaceful relations. To put it very simply  no sales person wants to start a war against a country where he has customers. That would be a bad business strategy  so trade promotes peace.Climate change continues  leading to extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world and the loss of lives and very high costs for society. The European Union’s and the United States’ emissions are falling  but overall global emissions are increasing. That is why all countries need to contribute to the international efforts in the fight against climate change. The European Union and the United States cannot solve the problem of climate change on their own  when they only account for around 25 per cent of today’s emissions.The international structures we have to deal with climate change commitments are unfortunately obsolete. We need a new agreement that ensures that all major emitters make commitments that are sufficient so that we can reach the two-degree target.It is our duty to strive for a society and a world that gives everybody the possibility to create his or her own future. That is what every woman  every man  every girl and every boy deserves. Let me underline that it is in the very interests of every country  because people are the real wealth of a nation. The Millennium Development Goals have been very successful in coordinating and focusing our efforts on the areas where progress has been most urgent. Now we need to prepare for tomorrow. In doing that  Sweden is convinced  the United Nations will play a very important role. We will continue our strong support to the Organization."
"162",6597,"SWZ",68,2013,"It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity to join my fellow Heads of State and Government at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We wish to offer our profound congratulations and support to the President of the Assembly. We also wish to express the Kingdom’s sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his entire staff for their efforts and the role they continue to play in improving the working mechanisms of the United Nations and for being such a good host.The United Nations has brought hope to those who are suffering  which is one of the pillars of its Charter. The fundamental purpose of the United Nations is to promote tolerance among humankind so that nations can live together in peace with one another. We are pleased that the United Nations has always worked hard to promote and maintain international security  and it has further taken positive action to prevent and remove threats to the peace that humankind so desires. We are also cognizant of the fact that humankind is facing a test of unprecedented proportions in hotspots that continue to pose a huge challenge for the United Nations to address.We have been deeply saddened by the senseless killing of innocent people that took place this week in Nairobi. We condemn such acts of terrorism in the strongest terms. We send words of comfort to the Government and the families who lost loved ones through that tragic and senseless violence. The world needs to stand together and wipe terrorism from the face of the universe. We call upon those who support such activities to cease from doing so forthwith.We are also extremely disturbed by the deadly conflicts in countries such as Syria  where innocent people including women and children  are dying on both sides  with some displaced now living as refugees in other countries. We encourage all of the people of Syria to immediately cease fire and use dialogue as a means of solving their differences  because using the barrel of a gun to settle a score will not help them; instead  it will leave the Syrian people divided and not seeing eye to eye. Infrastructure and social services will be destroyed  leaving increased problems that will have devastating effects for a very long time to come. We trust they will soon find a peaceful resolution to their crisis. The findings of the United Nations mission on the use of chemical weapons in Syria should be used as a basis to chart a way forward in pursuit of the dismantling of these unconventional weapons of mass destruction  which pose a serious threat to humankind. As long as chemical weapons continue to exist in that country  it remains at risk of similar attacks  where nobody will own up to them. Therefore  it is only proper that the dismantling process begin with immediate effect to prevent a similar attack in the future.It is important that whatever action takes place in Syria  it must fall within the mandate of the United Nations. The United Nations must act quickly on those issues and take a leading role in making sure that those episodes where life is lost through the use of such weapons are prevented.It is important for leaders and Governments to maintain contact and be in constant consultation with their people at all times to avoid situations where leaders do not understand the aspirations of their people. It is imperative to create forums where people will have access to Government to express themselves  because a lack of such communication and detachment leads to either Governments or the people reacting in a violent manner towards the other.The domino effect of such situations can lead to an international crisis  as the problems of one country can easily spiral into problems for others  which may need to intervene. Such strife causes countries  as well as the United Nations  to divert resources from the objectives of socioeconomic development and channel them towards financing conflict situations instead of the welfare of the people.The Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to a process of consultation with the people at the People’s Parliament — Sibaya — and other dialogue forums. That practice is democratic and participatory in that everybody is involved in key decision-making processes.Before I came to attend the General Assembly  the Kingdom of eSwatini held a very successful and peaceful election  which proved to be one of the most successful we have had over the years. Some 40 per cent of the Swaziland population were eligible to vote  and 70 per cent of them registered to do so in the elections. The primary and secondary elections were also very peaceful  free and fair  without any undue influence.In the past  there had been only one day of voting  but this year we had to extend voting for two days during the primary and secondary elections. Our elections embrace our traditions and culture  whereby people from communities nominate people in their chiefdoms to compete at constituency level  which we call Tinkhundla. The winners then go straight to Parliament as a direct representation.As a result  the people are happy to be part of the Government formulation process  because they can claim ownership of the people who constitute the Government of the day. It is in that vein that we trust that the new parliamentarians will work very well with the people in shaping the future of the Kingdom of eSwatini  with a view to meeting their aspirations and attaining the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals.We also note with interest the increased number of observers in this year’s election. Regional and international observers were highly impressed with our elections. We therefore call upon the world to embrace our system.We are aware of the fact that many countries do not understand how our system of government works. We are happy to define our system as a monarchial democracy. Monarchial democracy is defined as a marriage between the monarchy and the ballot box. The ballot box represents the will of the people. The people provide advice and counsel to the King  and that ensures transparency and accountability. It is a combination of power and empowerment. It means that the monarchy of eSwatini guarantees the continuity of stability  and the democracy of eSwatini guarantees the shared power of the people.Therefore  the monarchy is married to the trust of the people  who believe that the King does everything in their best interests. It is home-grown; it easily accords with the norms and values of the Swazis and is therefore easily understood by all Swazis.To those who proclaim that democracy is the answer to all nations and their development  we present ourselves as testimony of a new democratic ideology that works. It has a place in modern-day democracy  and it complies with all structures of the United Nations family. The Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to the ideals of the United Nations just as much as it is dedicated to protecting its history  its legacy and its dignity  while at the same time embracing the opportunities and possibilities for cooperation within the community of nations.It is therefore the Kingdom of eSwatini’s position that it believes in democracy as an idea  but not as an ideal  because things that are ideal to some may not be ideal to others. The Kingdom of eSwatini will  however  continue to embrace the opportunities  the technologies and the mechanisms that create a modern society.Our ultimate goal is to have achieved first-world status by 2022  or at least visible signs that we are heading in that direction socially  economically and otherwise. In the past five years  significant progress has been made in the Kingdom towards poverty eradication  improving the health of our people  and infrastructure and agricultural development. We are confident that we will see much more progress in the next few years.The kingdom of eSwatini has been implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which became effective in 2000 and most of which have a target date of 2015. Good progress has been made in the areas of education  gender  the empowerment of women and malaria control. Although the country has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the other Millennium Goals  there is still a need to accelerate efforts to address the issues of poverty  HIV and AIDS  infant mortality and maternal health.In order to solicit views on the post-2015 development agenda  the Kingdom of eSwatini embarked on an intensive consultative process. It involved a cross- spectrum of stakeholders  including traditional leaders  young people  women  men  the business community  people with disabilities  faith-based organizations  civil society organizations and different regiments.On the goal of eradicating poverty  the nation agreed that poverty was still a challenge and that greater efforts were needed to address it. The poor performance of the economy in recent years due to the global financial crisis has contributed to the situation  and therefore a great deal still needs to be done in that regard.As to providing quality education and lifelong learning  the country has made significant progress towards achieving universal primary education. However  there is a need to focus  with the support of the private sector  on the quality of education and to introduce more vocational skills.The Government has invested significantly in the health sector. However  the burden of disease continues to exist; hence that goal remains very relevant for the people of eSwatini. The country is still faced with the problem of HIV/AIDS  and therefore  in the post-2015 development agenda  the pressure to address the scourge as well as other  non-communicable diseases should be maintained.Ensuring food security and good nutrition remains a priority and should feature prominently in the post-2015 development agenda. However  the issue of climate change continues to be a drawback to many of our developing countries. Our food production has been seriously affected by climate-change patterns and the related challenges.The provision of adequate financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and technical assistance to developing countries are critical if we are to achieve our global objectives. We therefore appeal to our developed partners to honour the pledges they have made to the Green Fund and the sustainable development programme as a matter of priority. We strongly believe that this could add the required impetus in the context of our objective of increasing food production.The goal of achieving universal access to water and sanitation is also important for the people of eSwatini  since water is a very basic requirement for agricultural and industrial production  as well as for domestic use. Remarkable progress has been made in the area of supplying potable water to households; coverage has reached 71 per cent nationally. The creation of jobs  sustainable livelihoods and equitable growth is critical for the development of any country and is linked to the goal of ending poverty. Emphasis should be put on value addition  technology transfer and the development of entrepreneurial skills  particularly for young people. As a country  Swaziland is fully behind the post-2015 agenda  because it remains a guideline for the international community in working together for the sustainable development of our respective countries.The issue of the reform of the Security Council remains a top priority for the African continent. We are calling for a Council that will give equal opportunities to all regions of the world to voice their opinions as an international family on issues regarding global conflict. We believe our proposal is just and fair so that as a region Africa can have a voice in the affairs of the Council as equal partners in this global Organization.The United Nations should continue to play its advocacy role to ensure humankind continues to live peacefully with each other. All nations around the world should be given equal opportunities to share their expertise and experiences with the Organization.The Kingdom of eSwatini is happy to note that  with solid international support and cross-Strait developments  the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will continue to encourage positive interaction in the international arena between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Finally  I hope that this session will come up with the desired results and tangible targets. We also look forward to a post-2015 agenda that will create a conducive landscape for all humankind to live in."
"163",6625,"SYC",68,2013,"It is with great honour that I address the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on behalf of the President of the Republic of Seychelles  Mr. James Alix Michel  and on behalf of the Seychellois people. I wish to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe on his election as President and on his guidance of the proceedings so far.In 2014  we will mark the United Nations International Year of Small Island Developing States. Mr. Ashe’s appointment during the sixty-eighth session is highly symbolic of the constructive role that small island developing States play within the United Nations  and we express our full support for his efforts to further promote inclusiveness and full participation.I would also like to join all those who preceded me in complimenting Mr. Vuk Jeremi. on his leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  during which he stressed the unifying elements of the Assembly. Allow me to also express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the determination and commitment he has shown since the beginning of his tenure of office to strengthening the role of the United Nations.For the Seychelles delegation  the General Assembly evokes the spirit of humanity’s common cause better than any other institution. Indeed  in this Hall  we are reminded that there are no large nations or small nations  rich nations or poor nations  powerful nations or weak nations — simply the United Nations.As a small island developing State  we are perhaps also more conscious than most countries that very little can be achieved through isolation. Our economy is built around its connectivity to the world economy. Our security is easily undermined by events beyond our control. Our environmental safety is also dependent on many factors that have an impact beyond our borders. Both our opportunities and our risks can be addressed only through international partnerships.As we have discussions and exchanges of ideas on the post-2015 development agenda  we believe that the experiences of our group of States provide contexts that can help us to design a better development model. As we aim to set sustainable development goals  we must keep in mind that  if we can sustain our island  then we will know that we can sustain our planet.In 2013 Seychelles was given the honour to host the Atlantic  Indian Ocean  Mediterranean and South China Seas Sub-Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held next year in Samoa. The participation in the preparatory event by both the Under-Secretary-General of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the President of the General Assembly was highly appreciated as a symbol of support for the concerns of islands. Our discussions there  and in the ongoing process  have highlighted the fact that there is an urgent need for the United Nations to adopt a “resilience” that takes into account the evolving developing needs of islands.In Rio last year  we identified the green economy and the blue economy as tools with which States may implement a more sustainable approach to development. We are convinced that the green economy cannot be properly addressed unless we also give more attention to what is termed the blue economy  which is based on harnessing the development potential of our oceans sustainably. Oceans make up 72 per cent of our planet and connect our nations in terms of geography  trade  transport and communications. We consider island nations such as ourselves as guardians of that space  even if in many cases we can but be witnesses to plunder  pillage and pollution.The status quo merely perpetuates a model where we will consume our planet’s resources with no long-term protection  while the menace of climate change continues to grow as a threat to our economies  our way of life and our existence.To further mobilize reflection and action on the concept of the blue economy  Seychelles is pleased to be able to organize  in partnership with the United Arab Emirates  a special high-level event to be held as part of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week on 21 January 2014. The blue economy also represents an unparalleled opportunity for Africa. As an African island nation  we have continued to call for more attention to be given to the sustainable development of Africa’s coastal areas and its oceans. We can transform Africa’s oceans from being sources of raw products for distant nations to a space where Africa’s trade needs are prioritized and where Africa can better protect its oceanic resources.As an African island State  Seychelles continues to prioritize the security of our maritime spaces. In terms of maritime security  Seychelles reiterates its desire to build partnerships to create better coordination and sharing of information in the immediate region and beyond.Seychelles has also set up a Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre  and it also hosts an anti-piracy cell of the Indian Ocean Commission to build the maritime security capacity of the island States. The tools we have developed through such initiatives have strengthened our ability as a region to deter other criminal activities  such as arms trafficking  drug trafficking  people trafficking and illegal fishing. We look forward to building on those successes with our partners in order to create an effective coordination mechanism for maritime security in our region.As we consider the security situation in East Africa  may I also take this opportunity to express our solidarity and our sympathy to the Government and the people of Kenya  as well as personally to President Uhuru Kenyatta  as Kenya recovers from the barbaric attacks in Nairobi on Saturday.Such acts of terrorism strengthen our resolve to ensure that we build a shared future free of the forces of division and hostility. We also salute the efforts of the Government of Somalia in its dedication to ensure that forces of extremism and intolerance have no place in our shared region.Similarly  we are encouraged by the positive developments in relation to the expected first round of presidential elections to be held in Madagascar in October. Elections represent the path towards resolving the crisis in that neighbouring island  and we are encouraged that the basis for the resolution of the crisis discussed during the Southern African Development Community mediation  with the support of the Indian Ocean Islands Commission  held in Seychelles in the year 2012  have come to fruition.During the sixty-eighth session  Seychelles will continue to be an advocate for peace and stability and will urge all nations to work through the mechanisms of the United Nations towards resolving existing crises. Seychelles condemns in the strongest terms any use of chemical weapons or any other weapon of mass destruction. As one of the first signatories of the Arms Trade Treaty  Seychelles also urges all nations to actively engage in that treaty process so as to reduce the risk of arms trades  which remains one of the biggest challenges for our region and the world.Finally  during the sixty-eighth session  Seychelles will continue to call for every effort to be made to reduce the marginalization of island States  and it is in that context that we reiterate the call for the removal of the embargo against our brotherly nation of Cuba.Seychelles is a nation that believes that all voices count. In speaking out on behalf of small islands that are often marginalized in international processes  we believe that we have a duty to ensure that all perspectives are considered. It is because of our commitment to that inclusive approach to the United Nations and to multilateralism that Seychelles has announced its intention to stand as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. As a nation that has never served before  we are actively engaged in discussions in our East African constituency  and we appreciate the opportunity to engage with all nations that wish to share their views. We look forward to many fruitful discussions.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize that our approach towards the sustainable development goals must be even broader and more inclusive than for the Millennium Development Goals. The challenges are obvious: poverty  climate change and energy  among others. The list can go on indefinitely  but we believe that there is also a shared opportunity in setting the sustainable development goals. There is an opportunity to reflect the true interconnectivity of our planet through the adoption of interconnected objectives. Shared objectives will lead to shared success. That is the conviction of Seychelles."
"164",6672,"SYR",68,2013,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Ashe  the President of the General Assembly  and his friendly country  Antigua and Barbuda  on his election as President at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in conducting our work through his major and neutral role as President of the Assembly  like that of his predecessor  who avoided engaging the presidency in special political agendas.Last year when I addressed the Assembly (see A/67/PV.19)  we were compelled to address many events that had ravaged our country and our world. We were full of hope that the scene would change for the better this year. Unfortunately  the situation remains the same  and in some parts of the world has even deteriorated. Many countries continue to face political  economic and financial crises that exceed their ability to tackle them on their own. While the international community looked forward to effective international efforts to overcome those crises  today we bear witness to exacerbated and intensified problems.That exacerbation is due to the hegemony and dominion that thwart peoples’ capabilities. Such domination has escalated in a way that blatantly contradicts the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law. Instead of settling regional and international conflicts by peaceful means  some well-known countries continue to pursue aggressive policies against certain nations. Political hypocrisy allows them to intervene in the domestic affairs of States under the pretext of humanitarian intervention or the responsibility to protect. When such aggressive policies do not prove beneficial for the countries subjected  including my own country  Syria  those well-known States reveal their true beliefs and threaten blatant military aggression outside the mandates of the Security Council and certainly well beyond any international consensus.Those same countries impose immoral  illegal and unilaterally coercive economic measures. In addition  they maintain paranoid policies aimed at spreading sedition and turmoil within pluralistic  harmonious national communities that had previously lived for hundreds of years in harmony  unity and understanding. Worst of all  those countries have launched major  destructive wars under the pretext of combating terrorism  even as they support terrorism in my country  in contravention of all United Nations resolutions and all human and moral values.I ask the same question I posed last year: Is the international consensus on combating terrorism a serious commitment undertaken by States Member of the Organization  or is it mere rhetoric  written down but not put into effect by certain countries?What is happening in my country has become clear to everyone. Yet some countries do not want to recognize that Al-Qaida  the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world  and its many offshoots — including Jabhat Al-Nusra  the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  the Islamic Brigade and many others — are fighting in Syria. While scenes of murder  manslaughter and even the eating of human hearts were seen on television screens worldwide  that did not affect the conscience of those who chose to turn a blind eye. In my country  the heads of innocent civilians have been grilled because they violated some extremist ideology and held views that deviate from those of Al-Qaida. In my country  murderers have dismembered human bodies while the victims were still alive and sent their limbs to their families because those citizens were defending a unified and secular Syria.In Syria — as in those countries that daily violate basic human rights to life  livelihood and their own religious beliefs and political affiliations — any Syrian citizen who does not belong to that obscurantist takfiri ideology is doomed to be killed or maimed or to witness female relatives taken as captives on the basis of perverted concepts of religion that have nothing to do with Islam.There is no civil war in Syria. It is a war against terror  which does not recognize values  justice or equality and disregards all human rights and laws. Therefore  confronting terrorism in my country requires the international community to act in accordance with the relevant resolutions on counter-terrorism  particularly Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). It must take all necessary and immediate measures to compel those countries that are known to finance  arm  train and provide safe haven and passage to terrorists from different countries to stop doing so.The city of New York and its people have witnessed the devastations of terrorism. They were burned by the fires of extremists and suffered bloodshed  just as we are suffering now in Syria. How can countries hit by the same terrorism that we now suffer in Syria claim to be fighting terrorism throughout the world while supporting it in my country? Claims of the existence of moderate militants and extremist militants have become a bad and senseless joke. Terrorism means only terrorism. It cannot be classified as moderate terrorism and extremist terrorism. What should we call those who kidnap children in order to sell their body organs outside the country? How should we describe those who recruit children and prevent them from going to school and instead train them to shoot and kill? How would one describe those who spread perverted fatwas concerning sexual or incest-related jihad?We were the ones targeted by poisonous gases in Khan al-Assal. We asked for an investigative mission and demanded that its mandate include the ability to determine who had used chemical weapons. However  the United States of America and its friends the United Kingdom and France prevented that and insisted that the mission be limited to deciding whether or not chemical weapons had been used. In Syria  we waited five months for the mission to come. When it arrived  it was withdrawn before the completion of its task as certain States had begun to beat the drums of war against Syria.My country has accepted the praiseworthy initiative launched by Mr. Vladimir Putin  President of the Russian Federation. By acceding to the Chemical Weapons Convention  Syria has proved its commitment against the use of such weapons. Syria also calls on the international community to shoulder its responsibility against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Syria is known for fulfilling its obligations and commitments. Therefore  I assure the Assembly of Syria’s commitment to fully implementing the provisions of the Convention and to cooperating with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as a State party to the Convention.One challenge that we all still face is not knowing whether those who are supplying terrorists with such weapons will abide by their legal commitments  since the terrorists who used poisonous gas in my country received chemical agents from countries of the region and the West that are well known to all of us. They are the ones using poisonous gas on our military and innocent civilians alike.Ending aggressive policies towards Syria is the first appropriate step on the road to a solution in my country. In the light of the continuing support being given to terrorism  whether in the form of arms  funding or training  any political solution will be misleading and a mere illusion. Syria has repeatedly stated that it is open to a political solution to its crisis. It is now up to those who claim to support a political solution for Syria to halt all practices and policies hostile to Syria and head to Geneva without preconditions.On the basis of their national right to self-determination  the Syrian people have the exclusive authority to choose their leadership  their representatives  their future and a political system that will accommodate every sector of Syrian society  including those who have been deceived and beguiled onto the wrong path. We in Syria place no bets on any party but the Syrian people  all of whom are determined to reject all foreign interference in their domestic affairs and to defeat the advocates of sectarianism  extremism and terrorism. In my country  State policies are firmly tied to the aspirations of the people. Ballot boxes for free and fair elections remain the only way for the Syrian people to determine their own future  free from the pressures of terrorism and foreign control.There remain those who do not want a political solution and always resort to aggression  either directly or through their agents on the ground. That is what is happening in Syria. As I mentioned  Syria is committed to a political solution  but that does not mean allowing terrorists to attack innocent civilians. It does not mean watching our mosques and churches be destroyed  as has happened in Homs and Aleppo and is happening now in the town of Malula  the only place in the world whose people still speak the language of Jesus Christ. What is happening to the churches and mosques is also affecting the entire historical and cultural heritage of Syria and humankind.Do those representing the Member States in the Assembly know that terrorists from more than 83 countries are engaged in killing our people and our army in the name of global takfiri jihad? Furthermore  are some Member States entitled to demand that the Syrian State ignore its constitutional responsibilities to protect its citizens and preserve its unity  sovereignty and independence? The war on terror is not only Syria’s war. One day  those terrorists will return to their countries  and then no country in the world will be safe from that terrorism that recognizes no borders or geography.The events in Syria have created humanitarian needs that continue to grow in several key sectors. The immoral  inhumane and unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union have worsened Syrian citizens’ living conditions at a time when my Government is working with the United Nations and international organizations within the framework of a response plan to meet the basic needs of citizens  particularly those who have been forced to leave their homes. It should be noted that many of our people have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries in great numbers owing to the activities of armed terrorist groups in border areas. Regrettably  in some of those countries displaced Syrians have been put in military training camps and places resembling detention centres.From this rostrum  I appeal to Syrian citizens to return to their towns and villages  where the State will guarantee their safe return and dignified livelihood  far from the inhumane conditions in such camps. I assure the Assembly of our readiness to make every effort to deliver aid from international organizations to all Syrian citizens without discrimination  wherever they are  in compliance with resolution 46/182  while respecting Syria’s sovereignty and independence.The developments in my country should not make us lose sight of Palestine and the Syrian Golan. The Syrian Arab Republic affirms its natural right to full sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan up to the line of 4 June 1967  and emphasizes its rejection of all measures taken by Israel  the occupying Power  to change its natural demographic and geographic features in clear violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions  particularly resolution 497 (1981). Syria also reaffirms its support for the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  particularly their rights of return and of self-determination  and to establish an independent State on their land  with Jerusalem as its capital.Now that Syria has acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction  my country renews its call on the international community to work to establish a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. In that regard  we would remind the international community of Syria’s initiative  taken at the end of its non-permanent membership of the Security Council in 2003  and call on the Security Council to adopt it.Syria stresses that establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East will be unachievable without the accession of Israel  the only nuclear Power in the region  to all treaties banning such weapons  and without its agreement to put its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time  we emphasize the right of all countries to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In that regard  Syria condemns the fact that the United States and Israel continue to block the holding of the international conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East that was scheduled to take place in 2012.My country calls on the United States  the countries of the European Union and others to refrain from taking immoral unilateral economic measures that contravene the rules of international law and the principles of free trade. We therefore call for the lifting of the blockade that has been imposed by the United States on Cuba for decades. We also renew our call for lifting and ending all unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syria and the peoples of countries such as Venezuela  Belarus  Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.We hope that the United Nations will lead the peoples of the world towards a better future  so that they may achieve their aspirations for prosperity  development and food self-sufficiency  free from all forms of tension  confrontation and war  thus fulfilling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which upholds the sovereignty and equality of all the rights and duties of all Member States. In that regard  my country welcomes the efforts of the United States and Iran to bridge the gap of mistrust between the two countries  and hopes that this will be reflected constructively and positively in the stability of international relations."
"165",6717,"TCD",68,2013,"Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate the new President of the General Assembly  Mr. John Ashe  his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the work they have carried out since the previous session. The theme of this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is very much at the heart of our concerns. The 2015 deadline we have set for ourselves will soon be upon us. The general impression is that a number of countries continue to fall short in terms of funding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  official development assistance and debt relief. It is unfortunate to note that all of the commitments made to boost economies and development efforts have not achieved the expected results  despite major international mobilization.There is a strong possibility that the 2015 deadline will fall well short of many countries’ expectations  especially in Africa — since poverty persists  despite the development and implementation of national poverty eradication strategies. That is why — drawing on lessons learned from the shortfalls in setting and implementing the MDGs — the African continent intends to establish a post-2015 development agenda that is capable of meeting its expectations and it calls upon the international community to support it.On top of the development challenges come other security challenges. New hotspots and wars are emerging all over the continent. Coupled with that  the terrorism phenomenon has taken a heavy toll  as was the case earlier in Mali and now in Kenya. Terrorism is a scourge that knows no borders. It feeds off of the blood of the poor  spreading its recruitment tools of ignorance  poverty and fanaticism. No good can ever come from violence carried out against peaceful populations while using supposed religious considerations or doctrines as a pretext. Such violence is totally contrary to the principles of international law  in terms of human rights and the right to freedom of religion and opinion. Our profound belief is that the fight against terrorism must continue to the last breath  in order to curb proliferation and eradicate it definitively.Chad  for its part  has made its strategic choice. It has decided to make its modest contribution to the establishment of peace  security and stability wherever necessary. That fundamental position is the key motivation of its candidature for non-permanent membership in the Security Council for the period 2014-2015. To that end  my country expects friendly  active and enthusiastic support from the Assembly  to encourage its valiant people to continue to provide their utmost effort in supporting the cause of international peace and security  which are indispensible to establishing a world based on stability  development and democracy.Since restoring its stability  Chad has remained mindful of all crisis situations in Africa and in the world. It intends to fully cooperate with the United Nations on all positive initiatives aimed at peace and security  wherever the need may arise. My country provided a clear indication of its unshakeable resolve through efforts with the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) in the eastern part of Chad  from 2008 to 2010 protecting Sudanese refugees from Darfur and Chadian internally displaced persons and ensuring the security of humanitarian personnel and associated United Nations personnel. True to its philosophy  Chad sent the largest armed contingent to Mali  with more than 2 000 men  and 900 to the Central African Republic. Some 1 800 Chadian soldiers will join the new United Nations force in Mali. Chadian peacekeepers are now present in Côte d’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions.We take this solemn opportunity to formally commend the successful completion of the transition process in Mali  with the holding of free  regular democratic elections unanimously hailed by the entire international community. Our wish is for that fraternal country to restore peace  unity and stability so that its sons and daughters can focus their energies and intelligence on progress and the well-being of the population.However  the situation in the Central African Republic remains alarming. The insecurity and the political  economic and financial difficulties that continue to face the transitional Government represent major challenges of concern to everyone. The countries of the region  through the Economic Community of Central African States  have made their utmost effort to mobilize military  financial and human resources to support peace and security in that country. I wish to welcome the establishment of the Mission internationale de soutien à la Centrafrique sous conduite africaine  of which the Central Africa Multinational Force comprises the core. Its troop level will increase from 2 000 to 3 600  thanks to the participation of Central African States and other friendly countries that have shown an interest in joining that noble cause. In spite of all those efforts  we must recognize that the needs on the ground clearly highlight the need for swift intervention  admittedly in the spirit of regional solidarity but also with the vital support of the international community. To that end  we expect the Security Council to adopt a firm resolution that provides for logistical and financial support modalities for the mission.Turning to the Sudan  as the Assembly knows  we signed a peace accord on 15 January 2010 and established a joint force that has allowed us to stabilize our common borders. As a result  my country will continue to actively strive for peace in the Sudan  as a member of the follow-up committee for the Darfur Peace Agreement.Nevertheless  I think it would be timely to draw the attention of the Assembly to the humanitarian situation in Darfur as a result of the new hotbeds of tension that are emerging and which lead to a constant flow of other refugees and internally displaced persons towards eastern Chad. Currently  there are more than 400 000 refugees and 200 000 internally displaced persons  compared to 290 000 and 180 000 in past years. All efforts made since the outbreak of that crisis to foster the return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their regions of origin have been in vain thus far. It is our duty to advocate from this rostrum for the energetic pursuit of assistance from the international community to all those people as political and ethnic tensions continue to divert them from their path to return.Chad condemns the rampant instability in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We urge the Government and the members of the rebellion to reach a negotiated solution to their dispute to allow that great African country to focus on its development.Our profound belief is that the solution to all the crises I have just listed cannot be military. A lasting  definitive solution to the ills that are hobbling the development of Africa requires a constant struggle against poverty  marginalization and youth unemployment. It also requires the establishment of constructive dialogue among the various sectors of a country  on the one hand  and permanent dialogue among different cultures and religions  on the other.Addressing the situation outside Africa  I must first mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which persists and for which the international community has not yet found the appropriate solutions. We urge and encourage the efforts made by the Organization and the United States Government to conclude a peace agreement that allows for the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign States.The situation in Syria troubles us all since it has reached a particularly grave stage. We have no right to allow a whole people to be cast adrift. The use of chemical weapons  which marks a dramatic escalation of the civil war in that country  is an affront to the human conscience and to the ideals present at the birth of the Organization. While welcoming the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation on the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons  my country wants to see the perpetrators of those crimes identified and brought to an international tribunal. However  we are greatly saddened to see Syria tear itself apart and Syrians killing each other. The international community must do its utmost to stop that tragedy.Allow me to turn to Cuba. The embargo against Cuba  which has been in place for decades  unjustly penalizes that country. We call for the lifting of the embargo in order to allow the country to resume the place it deserves in the comity of nations.At the national level  Chad  which has definitively turned the painful page of wars and divisions  is now fully devoted to its development by exploiting its mineral and energy resources through daring strategies. To do that  it has just adopted a national development plan that will soon be the subject of a round table on its funding and implementation. At the political level  we give pride of place to dialogue. We have established a permanent political dialogue framework that brings together the majority and the opposition and has the power  inter alia  to create structures for the organization of future elections. With the assistance of Chad’s partners  in particular the United Nations  we have taken all the necessary steps to prevent and put an end to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict.In conclusion  allow me to reiterate a major concern for my country. It is our ardent wish to finally see the long-awaited reform in the United Nations  particularly the Security Council. That reform  which has become an issue of justice and equity  is a top priority for Africa. Keeping Africa  as well as other key actors on the international scene  outside that universal forum appears shocking today to hundreds of millions of human beings throughout the world. The awakening of the peoples of Africa  the role of the continent in the world and its indispensable contribution to preventing and settling conflict means that our continent can no longer be sidelined from the prestigious institution that is the Security Council."
"166",6763,"TGO",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like  on behalf of the Head of State  the Head of Government and the people of Togo  to congratulate the General Assembly on the occasion of its sixty-eighth session. I wish to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your el..ti.n to the presidency of the General Assembly and to assure you of Togo’s full willingness to support your actions throughout your mandate. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who continues to take bold initiatives to enable the Organization to effectively fulfil its mandate in promoting peace and sustainable development.The theme that you have chosen for the sixty-eighth session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is indicative of the particular attention that the countries of the South give to development issues. At the same time  it is an invitation to the United Nations not only to keep sight of that concern  but also to implement a sustainable development programme for all countries. The Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) set forth specific Goals that each country should attain by 2015 in order to usher in a world in which every individual can live in dignity. On the eve of that deadline  it is appropriate to reflect on the progress made since the Millennium Summit and to discuss new prospects for shoring up the progress that has been achieved in combating hunger  malnutrition and disease.The United Nations has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. However  those objectives can be sustainably achieved only if abject poverty does not become a breeding ground for all sorts of societal ills. That is why  when we embark on a collective discussion of what should happen post-2015  we must think above all about ways to increase the economic and social development and prosperity of nations and to prevent conflicts before they even occur. That applies to all countries  but particularly to African nations that have been weakened by recurrent crises and are now facing various threats.More than a decade after the launch of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  when efforts have been made to achieve the Goals  it is clear  as the deadline of 2015 approaches  that many challenges remain  in particular for developing countries. For those countries continue to experience the impacts of the financial  energy and food crises of previous years  given their economies’ dependence on external sources — crises that unfortunately have been exacerbated by climate change. The net result is to reduce their chances of achieving the Millennium Development Goals within the set time frame.Moreover  the various initiatives and commitments undertaken by the leaders of this world in the context of the great international forums are far from achieving the desired results. The arrival of official development assistance in pledged proportions has been delayed. That is the reason why  at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  the international community was called upon to uphold its commitments  in particular those made in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the United Nations declarations on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.At the same time  the Heads of State and Government reiterated the need for their States to adjust their policies in order to further integrate economic  social and environmental factors at all levels and across all disciplines  to ensure sustainable development across the board. And indeed  to achieve sustainable development  there must be  at the national and international levels  conditions conducive to continuing and strengthening international cooperation in areas such as debt  trade  technology transfer  innovation and entrepreneurship and capacity-building .Achieving the MDGs is one of the Togolese Government’s priorities. Enormous efforts have been made to significantly reduce poverty in the country. In the field of education  the introduction of free primary education since 2008 has encouraged an increase in school enrolment  especially among young girls.With regard to health issues  the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate has been reduced by half. The care of infected people has improved considerably  and more than 26 000 patients are cared for by the State. The integrated programme providing vaccination  the distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and improved nutrition has yielded promising results in the area of maternal and child health.In addition  significant progress has been made in other areas of development  including agriculture  which  thanks to a far-reaching and ambitious national agricultural investment programme and food security  has contributed to reducing poverty  hunger and food insecurity.The progress achieved by Togo received recognition from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the form of an award made by that Organization during the thirty-eighth FAO Conference in June in Rome.On the social front  for some years now the Government of Togo has been taking proactive measures enabling us to tackle in a sustained way the problems of joblessness and underemployment among young people and their marginalization in decision-making. Among them I can point to a national youth council  a national volunteer programme  the creation of a support fund for youth economic initiatives and a support programme for the integration and development of employment opportunities.The Government of Togo  aware of the great challenges of the twenty-first century  is continuing to work with faith and determination to gradually build a democratic society capable of guaranteeing to every citizen  without exception  the peace  harmony  well-being  justice and freedom that are prerequisites for our society’s full flourishing and that must go hand in hand with our economic and social development goals.For nearly a decade  the Government of Togo has adopted a policy of dialogue and consensus in managing State affairs. It is in that context that it has continued to urge the country’s political class to engage in dialogue in order to ensure that election processes are definitively free of violence and that the new cycle of peaceful political life becomes more solidly entrenched. Thus  in addition to the reshuffling that has taken place since May 2012  following the recommendations of the electoral observation missions  particularly that of the European Union  new measures have been adopted. They have to do with the reorganization of the national independent electoral commission  the new electoral code and laws on electoral districting  the financing of political parties and the status of the opposition. Those measures enabled us to hold free  democratic  transparent and calm elections to the legislature on 25 July.This is the moment for me to thank all the partners who supported my country throughout the process  as well as the various observation missions  which  on the completion of their work  expressed their satisfaction with the good conduct of the elections. The new Parliament that emerged from the elections will continue with the institutional and constitutional reforms stipulated in the global political agreement signed in Lomé in August 2006 between the Government and the political parties  in order to ensure that Togo will finally possess an institutional framework that strengthens democracy and the rule of law and consolidates our economic and social gains. Similarly  the Government elected in the legislative elections of 25 July has been given the primary mandate of stepping up its work in priority social areas such as health  education  access to safe drinking water and sanitation  and youth employment.That road map keeps the 2015 deadline in view as it seeks first and foremost to continue Togo’s efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the established time frame. Our new frame of reference for development in the medium term  the strategy for accelerated growth and job promotion  reflects that determination to focus squarely on the MDGs. Togo is fully aware that effective achievement of the MDGs requires resources. That is why we are actively committed to promoting good governance.Under that heading fall our strategic plan for mobilizing the Togolese diaspora  our accession to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  the establishment of a regulatory authority for public contracts in order to improve the business climate  the restructuring of public enterprises and the finance sector and especially the establishment of a revenue office responsible for the collection of both customs and tax receipts. None of this progress and success would have been possible for Togo without the support of our development partners  whom we would like to thank once again  and to whom we turn for increased support within the framework of the partnerships that bind us together.Togo remains deeply convinced that our efforts to meet the targets we set ourselves through the MDGs cannot succeed in isolation. While every State has its own challenges  the international community must commit to working on them collectively  owing to the interdependence that is the hallmark of today’s world. In the face of accelerating global change  worsening insecurity and the urgency of finding a collective solution to the challenges our Organization is dealing with  I can assure the Assembly that Togo remains committed to seeking a vision of a united  integrated world where every State must cooperate to promote peaceful coexistence and good neighbourliness and to combat poverty and underdevelopment in all its forms  as well as political  ideological  ethnic and religious intolerance.Here I would like to touch on the case of Mali  where the danger represented by terrorist groups and extremist jihadists  coupled with a serious humanitarian crisis  prompted the United Nations to action with a speedy military intervention and peacekeeping operation. In that regard  the adoption of an integrated United Nations strategy for the Sahel  in the months after Security Council resolution 2100 (2013) established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)  has been crucial. The holding of the presidential elections on 28 July and 3 August was an unquestionable success not only for the Malian people and their leaders but also for the international community.Togo is pleased that regional and subregional organizations  along with the international community  were able to speak with one voice and coordinate their actions in order to achieve the results we welcome today. From this rostrum  Togo  which is currently chairing the West African Economic and Monetary Union  of which Mali is a member  would like to reiterate the community’s pleasure at this success of the highly diverse Malian people  who demonstrated their political maturity and the ability to overcome their differences in the national interest.In accordance with its ongoing commitment to peace  security and stability  internationally and in the West African subregion in particular  Togo continues to work within the entities and institutions of which it is a member and  through its MINUSMA contingent  to contribute to helping the Government of Mali. That is why my country invites the community of nations to continue to support Mali on the road to rebuilding both the infrastructure that was destroyed in the north of the country and its economic development  which was severely damaged in the crisis.There are other situations in Africa that deserve our close attention by reason of the degree to which they contribute to the continent’s insecurity and undermine our efforts to achieve the MDGs. The Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Libya and many other countries are currently sources of concern  since peace and security are still tenuous in those brotherly countries. While we commend the bold actions that have already been taken to halt those conflicts  we would like to urge the international community to continue to work to that end alongside the African Union  which has made extraordinary efforts to overcome all the obstacles to the continent’s economic rebirth.Among the scourges that have the potential to slow African States’ development is that of transnational organized crime  whose pernicious impact on our economies is clear. Where the States of the Gulf of Guinea are concerned  piracy and armed robbery on the high seas have recently become a new type of scourge that is more and more worrying and whose seriousness demands general involvement and a strong  firm and uncompromising response on the part of the international community as a whole  as well as the countries concerned.In that regard  my country  which is currently a member of the Security Council  welcomes the commitment whereby the Council has included the issue in its agenda  on the initiative of our States. The Council’s position has enabled the United Nations Office for Central Africa and the United Nations Office for West Africa to be a strong presence in the quest for solutions to the problem  through the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of Central African States and the Economic Community of West African States on maritime safety and security.The summit that was held in Yaoundé on 24 and 25 June led to the adoption of a code of conduct for the prevention and suppression of acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships and illegal maritime activities. The fight against those scourges calls for enhanced international cooperation  in particular among United Nations and regional and subregional organizations  in line with the Charter of the United Nations. However  regional and subregional organizations will not be able to effectively tackle those current major challenges if they are not granted substantial resources.The Syrian conflict continues with its atrocities and daily tragedies  which culminated in the use of chemical weapons on 21 August. The international community has long stood by  powerless  as the conflict has taken its gruesome toll. However  we express the hope that Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) will open up promising new prospects for peace and an inclusive political transition in Syria. That means that the international community must do more on the humanitarian front by providing aid to Syrians in need  both inside and outside the country. In that regard  we ardently hope that the holding of the “Geneva II” conference will provide an opportunity for ending the crisis through the establishment of a transitional Government based on consensus and an inclusive process.I cannot fail to mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by welcoming the resumption of direct negotiations between the two parties  thanks to the sustained efforts of President Barack Obama. Togo calls on the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to negotiate in good faith to reach  in the shortest possible time  an agreement that finally allows for the creation of two States living side by side in peace and security and within internationally recognized borders.The challenges facing our States are numerous and vast  but we believe in the ability of the United Nations to deal with them. It is therefore important that we re-establish the United Nations on the basis of the values that led to its creation  which are  essentially  the maintenance of international peace and security and the strengthening of international cooperation.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize  with regard to the MDGs  the need to stay the course  regardless of the results achieved by each individual State. Better yet  the international community must be more ambitious in the goals that it will establish for the post-2015 period  because  given the challenges of the contemporary world  it is no longer simply a matter of reducing the proportion of persons suffering from hunger  malnutrition and endemic diseases. Our aim must be to eradicate them. Only by mobilizing all our efforts in the pursuit of those very important goals will we increase our chances of actually achieving them."
"167",6808,"THA",68,2013,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  allow me to congratulate the Honourable Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. My delegation stands ready to render our full support and cooperation.I would also like to express our appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his exceptional leadership during the previous session. I am particularly grateful for his contributions to the second Asia-Pacific Water Summit  held in Chiang Mai  Thailand  earlier this year.Thailand is committed to the United Nations. Our faith in the principles and values it stands for has never wavered. The United Nations three pillars of security  development and human rights continue to inspire and motivate us. When the 50 founding States came together in San Francisco in 1945  the world had high hopes for the United Nations. The United Nations was created in response to the demands of a different time  after millions of lives had been lost in a conflict between States. Today  it is conflict within States that takes the heaviest human toll  as we have witnessed in the unfolding events in Syria.As we look ahead to the post-2015 future  we must not shy away from asking the hard questions. We must ask ourselves whether multilateralism has lived up to our expectations  be it in security  trade or the environment. We must ask how we Member States can do better in the face of critical challenges. That is because ultimately  the success of the United Nations depends on all of us. With such a diversity of viewpoints  it is all the more important for us to work together to find the unity and consensus we need. The challenges facing us are particularly clear in the case of Syria. On 21 August  we learned that chemical weapons had been used against innocent civilians in Syria. Despite widespread condemnation and outrage  the United Nations was initially unable to act and the Security Council was deadlocked. We therefore welcome resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria  adopted yesterday by the Security Council. We urge Syria to ensure the full and effective implementation of the resolution  and to allow monitoring and enforcement by the international community. It is our hope that the Security Council  especially its permanent members  will continue to work to find a durable political solution for the sake of the Syrian people.In setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  we must recognize that development cannot take root without peace  security  democracy and human rights. The three pillars of the United Nations must be developed together and nurtured together. To strengthen the United Nations  we need to seek ways to achieve unity and consensus on the issues that matter most. In the area of security  this means thinking of new  creative ways to respond to the changing threats. For instance  when States fail to protect their own populations  or even cause them harm  all our words will amount to little unless matched with action.But what kind of action would make the most difference on the ground? When and how is it most effective? There are no simple answers. It is on such issues that the world looks to the Security Council for leadership. Too often  however  the Council is paralysed just when action is most needed. Overcoming deadlock and achieving consensus must be a central objective of Security Council reform.The United Nations is  of course  much more than the Security Council. Unity and consensus are also needed on development. Thailand believes that sustainable development must be at the heart of the United Nations agenda. The world has made great strides in tackling poverty and hunger  thanks in no small part to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  but all of us still need to make a final push on the MDGs. That would enable us to tackle the deep-rooted poverty that still afflicts the so-called bottom billion.Following the MDGs  the post-2015 development agenda must provide both continuity and a new source of hope. To build on the MDGs  Thailand believes that we should place special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable countries. That includes conflict and post-conflict societies  as well as those of least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. If we fail to do so  millions will be left behind.The most pressing challenge to sustainable development that demands our concerted action is climate change. For a number of countries  particularly small island developing States  climate change strikes at the very heart of survival. For much of the world  climate change is also linked to another important challenge — food security. Extreme weather can cause great damage to agriculture. The impact will be felt not only in food-producing countries  but worldwide. That is why we need to work together to put in place systems — better weather prediction technology  better storage silos and more resilient strains of staple crops — that will mitigate the impact of climate change. Those are areas where countries should help one another by sharing their experiences and know-how. Thailand believes that  if development is to be sustainable  it must be people-centred. We welcome the Secretary-General’s report “A life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and advancing the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015” (A/68/202)  which puts people at the centre of the development agenda. People need to be given the chance and the tools to make the most of their potential. This can happen if we focus more on promoting human security  for instance through education and health care. On education  we believe that the Secretary-General’s Global Education First Initiative is an important contribution to the post-2015 development agenda and deserves the support of all stakeholders. Health is also very much a development issue. When people are unhealthy  it imposes a cost on State finances and can even undo development gains.As we look to the post-20l5 future  we must not limit our goals to specific health challenges. We should now set our sights on the more general objective of universal health care. Initiated by the administration of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 10 years ago  Thailand has been implementing a programme that charges only $1 per doctor’s visit. This universal health-care scheme is universal in its coverage of treatments  ranging from common illnesses and chronic diseases to lifesaving surgeries. Statistics have shown that through this programme  around 300 000 households have been saved from falling into poverty. Even non-Thai nationals  especially migrant workers from neighbouring countries are also benefiting from universal health care  making it truly universal. The socioeconomic impact of this programme has therefore been tremendous. Those who benefit most from our universal health care have been the poor and the vulnerable. By working to empower the most vulnerable among us  we ensure that development is more inclusive. We believe that the model could be adapted to other developing countries  and we are willing to share the lessons we have learned from our experience.We also believe that women  children  the elderly and persons with disabilities must be treated fairly and encouraged to participate fully in all aspects of life. Particularly in situations of conflict  vulnerable groups are often at the greatest risk of violence. We therefore support the United Nations initiative to end sexual violence in conflict. We also commend the United Kingdom for its leadership in realizing the Declaration of Commitment on this important issue.To provide an environment that facilitates unity and consensus  the international community must also forge a new global partnership. This new global partnership must rest on a common agenda for action. It will need to involve States — in particular like-minded States — the United Nations  regional organizations  civil society and other stakeholders. In South-East Asia  the process is well under way. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is strengthening its partnership to become a community of over 600 million people by the end of 2015. Regional discussions on the post-2015 agenda are also complementing ongoing global efforts. As a moderate  medium-sized country with an open society  Thailand is ready to work with all countries and partners. We want to do our part in helping bridge the gaps in communication  understanding and opportunity.That is why we have put forward our candidacies to the Security Council for the term 2017-2018 and to the Human Rights Council for the term 2015-2017. We are keen to help build bridges to connect all stakeholders in a more cohesive  action-oriented global partnership. Building a global partnership means forging a common agenda for action on our most important challenges. It means reaching out beyond our borders  beyond our region and beyond our comfort zone.Thailand has been building bridges not only within Asia  but also with Africa and Latin America. We believe that developing countries everywhere need to come together in a spirit of partnership to make their voices heard. What is more  that same sense of partnership must also cross the development divide  embracing developed and developing economies alike.Since the beginning  the United Nations has been a force for good. As its membership has grown and the issues have become more complex  we have now reached a crossroads. Whether the United Nations takes the right path rests on our ability to achieve consensus and to act together in a meaningful manner. Now is the time for us to set aside our outdated assumptions and our differences. Our common future depends on our ability to come together to forge consensus on the new realities before us. The way forward is not through politics as usual  but through constructive dialogue and mutual respect. With goodwill and common purpose  the international community can once again rise to the challenge. Together  we can fulfil the promise of the Organization and the loftiest goals toward which we  the Member States  have always aspired."
"168",6833,"TJK",68,2013,"At the outset  I would like to join with those expressing their cordial congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that his extensive professional experience will contribute to the efficient and successful work of this session. I would also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his efforts as President at the previous session.We fully share the commitment of this session to contributing to the development of a post-2015 global development agenda in order to enhance the progress already achieved towards the full implementation of the decisions taken at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).The modalities of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development were approved at the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and its first meeting took place some days ago here in New York. We expect the Forum  which replaces the Commission on Sustainable Development  to become a universal and effective platform for regular dialogue and for reviewing achievements and developing and coordinating the programme of actions aimed at promoting sustainable development.Further progress in achieving sustainable development depends in many respects on the adequate and timely financing of the planned programmes and projects. In that regard  the activities of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing  which is mandated to develop recommendations on effective strategies for financing sustainable development  are of key importance.We support efforts to develop a sustainable development goal for water resources. We believe that the following should be taken into consideration in that regard: ensuring universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation  introducing the integrated management of water resources at the national and regional levels  increasing the efficiency of water use and secondary use of water  adequately financing and investing in water-economy facilities and infrastructure  transferring and introducing advanced technologies  and setting up mutually acceptable mechanisms for the gathering and dissemination of information and data.As stated in the Rio+20 outcome document  “water is at the core of sustainable development as it is closely linked to a number of key global challenges” (resolution 66/288  annex  para. 119). The water-related resolutions of the General Assembly initiated by Tajikistan and co-sponsored by other Member States have made an invaluable contribution to the realization of the key role of water resources in the achievement of sustainable development. This year marked the tenth anniversary of our first global project  the International Year of Freshwater  in 2003. The General Assembly took another important decision when it proclaimed 2005-2015 the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life” (resolution 58/217). In 2010  Tajikistan initiated the General Assembly resolution that declared 2013 the International Year of Water Cooperation (resolution 65/154). When promoting that resolution in conjunction with other countries  we operated on the assumption that the events during that International Year would contribute to strengthening dialogue and mutual understanding and enhancing cooperation and partnership on the basis of multilevel and comprehensive approaches towards solving water problems. Most important of all  we expected that the International Year of Water Cooperation would become a major platform for consolidating efforts and improving our treatment of water resources. Today  it is still too early to draw conclusions regarding the outcome of the Year. However  I would like to note that the International Year of Water Cooperation has provided a truly unique opportunity to promote the dialogue on the search for and establishment of a just  mutually advantageous and effective water cooperation system. It is specifically that idea that was the focus of the statements and reports of the participants at the High-level International Conference on Water Cooperation  organized by the Government of Tajikistan in cooperation with the United Nations on 20 and 21 August in Dushanbe. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the President of the General Assembly  the Secretary-General and all our partners — Member States and international and regional organizations — for their active participation in the work of that successful Conference. Based on the outcomes of the Conference  the Dushanbe Declaration of the High-level International Conference on Water Cooperation and the Dushanbe framework for action on water cooperation were issued and circulated among Member States as documents of the General Assembly. In his statement at the opening ceremony of the Dushanbe Conference  the President of the Republic of Tajikistan  Mr. Emomali Rahmon  proposed the development of a post-2015 vision for global water  which could serve as the road map for the implementation of the water-related sustainable development goals. We would like to call upon all delegations to support that initiative.It is common knowledge that water resources are central to the achievement of the development goals set forth in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Our efforts at poverty eradication directly depend on the rational management of water resources. The efforts undertaken have not yet produced the large-scale effects that we all expected at the dawn of the Millennium. However  the progress is obvious. According to The Millennium Development Goals Report 2013  over the past two decades  more than 2.1 billion people have received access to improved drinking water supplies and 1.9 billion people improved their sanitation conditions. Despite those statistics  768 million people are still using water from unsafe sources and about 2.5 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation. Moreover  the level of progress differs  not only in regions and countries  but also in rural and urban areas within the same country.The special General Assembly event that took place recently in New York provided another opportunity for a sound assessment of progress and identification of ways to accelerate implementation of the MDGs and do so with maximum success. That is particularly important under current circumstances  when the financial  economic  food and energy crises and climate change undermine the current still unsustainable and uneven progress in the implementation of MDGs.Experience shows that it is impossible to achieve development goals without ensuring reliable and universal access to energy. The United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All (2014-2024) provides a unique opportunity for the practical implementation of that aim. We believe that  along with ensuring reliable and sustainable access to energy  it is essential to encourage and promote in every way possible increased use of renewable energy  the transfer of advanced technologies and a more efficient energy supply and energy saving. Tajikistan  which is experiencing economic and population growth  lacks large oil and gas deposits but has huge hydropower potential. It is making every effort to develop all aspects of power generation  on which the population’s well-being critically depends. Our Government is undertaking additional efforts to make full use of its own potential when it comes to addressing socioeconomic issues. On 2 March  Tajikistan successfully completed the negotiation process and joined the World Trade Organization as the one hundred and fifty-ninth member of that multilateral system for regulating world trade. We are interested in advancing the trade interests of developing countries  including those of landlocked countries. In that context  on 16 and 17 September in Dushanbe  the tenth annual meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission for the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia was held. That meeting was followed on 18 September by the High-level International Conference on Development of Road Transport and Transit Potential in Central Asia for the period up to 2023. Those events made an additional contribution to the process of preparing for the 10-year comprehensive review of the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.Effective regional cooperation can provide considerable support to the establishment of a new global partnership for achieving sustainable development. In our region  the development of multidimensional cooperation depends in many respects on strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to address the challenges of the transition period  reconciliation and post-conflict rehabilitation in Afghanistan. We believe that socioeconomic development is the key to achieving lasting peace in that country. International aid to Afghanistan should be  above all  aimed at promoting a full economic recovery  further strengthening the social sphere and generating new jobs. The borders with Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries should be considered the front line in combating drug-trafficking and  in that regard  efforts with respect to their logistical strengthening and the prompt creation of a modern and effective Afghan border police presence should be stepped up. There is an urgent need for Afghanistan to be fully included in the multidimensional regional cooperation process. Involving the neighbouring countries in the development of Afghanistan and giving due consideration to the regional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation of the country will guarantee success in the ongoing efforts undertaken by the world community.It is clear that illicit drug trafficking has become one of the major sources of financing of international terrorism. The urgency and magnitude of the problems associated with drugs and illicit drug trafficking are clear indications of the global danger threatening international stability and security as a whole. The international community must unify its efforts to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs and its efforts aimed at integrating national and regional efforts into the international drug-control strategy. During the period of its membership in the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs  2014 to 2017  Tajikistan will strengthen and expand its interaction with other Member States and international and regional organizations in practical implementation of the international conventions on drugs and the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Combating terrorism is a long-term and complicated joint task that will require strengthening by applying the entire spectrum of political  economic and financial measures. We deem it important to expedite the coordination and adoption of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention. Regional and subregional organizations capable of providing support to the global system for combating international terrorism must play an important role in combating terrorism and extremism.In recent years  Tajikistan has intensified its interaction with United Nations law enforcement mechanisms  including the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. The country’s main priorities in this field are the strengthening of international mechanisms for the protection of human rights  the bona fide implementation of the commitments assumed and the promotion of multilateral cooperation in the field of human rights protection. We view the Human Rights Council as an important forum for constructive dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights.Guided by the desire to make a contribution to an open and fair dialogue in the field of human rights  Tajikistan has for the first time decided to put forward its candidature for the Human Rights Council for the period 2015 to 2017. We hope that Tajikistan’s candidature for that period will receive support at the election to be held during the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly  in the fall of 2014.In conclusion  I would like to note that the entire range of long-term goals requires a clear and sound review of the actions under way towards a transition towards sustainable development. We are convinced that the United Nations  as the unique  universal mechanism for multilateral cooperation  must remain the centre of coordination of our collective efforts to ensure peace  security  development and human rights. Meanwhile  the role of the United Nations itself must be strengthened through comprehensive reform and by enhancing its ability to rapidly and adequately respond to problems  effectively meet the numerous global challenges and counter threats."
"169",6854,"TKM",68,2013,"At the outset  allow me to express our sincere gratitude for the honour of addressing the General Assembly from this rostrum. I bring greetings from His Excellency Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov  President of Turkmenistan  who wishes the General Assembly the best of luck at this session. I congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and wish him all the best in fulfilling his forthcoming tasks. I would also like to thank Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  for his skill and effectiveness in that post.Turkmenistan considers this session to be an important phase in the process of consolidating the efforts of the international community to strengthen universal peace  stability and security by adopting meaningful decisions on sustainable development and to counter emerging challenges and threats. We believe that strict adherence to the principles and norms of the Charter of the United Nations is the main prerequisite for ensuring long-term peace and strategic stability.In that belief  Turkmenistan adheres to a steady and resolute policy of peace  good-neighbourliness and the active promotion of peacebuilding processes. As a matter of principle  we reject the use of military force as a tool of foreign policy and international relations. Our country is convinced that solutions based on the use of force are doomed to fail. They neither eliminate the causes of conflicts nor create conditions for adequate responses to the many issues that arise from military action. Therefore  at the heart of Turkmenistan’s policies is the will to resolve any situation by peaceful  political and diplomatic ways and means  which it considers to be the main legitimate resources available within the United Nations. This approach is based on our common goal to establish a world without conflict.At the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly  Turkmenistan’s President launched an initiative aimed at the adoption of a United Nations declaration on prioritizing political and diplomatic ways and means for the resolution of international challenges. Today  the elaboration of such a document has become a top priority. Turkmenistan therefore reaffirms its firm desire to engage in a meaningful discussion on this initiative with all interested Member States. We are convinced that the adoption of such a declaration would help to expand and strengthen the legal basis for the work of the General Assembly  the Security Council and other United Nations entities dealing with issues relating to world peace  stability and security.The challenging processes unfolding in today’s world call for a responsible  thoughtful  effective and efficient approach on the part of the United Nations. That is also linked directly to the important challenges of disarmament. By playing an active role in the multilateral dialogue on disarmament issues  my Government is demonstrating its firm commitment to complying with the core international norms regulating the disarmament process and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through practical action. Following this course of action and taking into consideration the need to energize the discussion and meaningful consideration of disarmament issues  Turkmenistan proposes the convening in 2014 of a high-level international meeting on disarmament issues. We are prepared to create all the necessary conditions and to provide the appropriate infrastructure for this meeting in our capital city.Nowadays  problems related to strengthening peace and stability and to ensuring the stability of countries and nations are among the most important topics in global politics. Their resolution will depend primarily on the establishment and effective legal and organizational operationalization of international political cooperation. In this context  we advise the General Assembly at this session to embark on the consideration of issues relating to the improvement of various forms of multilateral interaction that could serve as a political platform for finding mutually acceptable decisions on urgent regional and international policy matters.It should be noted in that regard that the United Nations fulfils its purpose. For example  the establishment of United Nations preventive diplomacy centres in various regions of the world has become a highly effective form of joint work to strengthen security  prevent conflicts and eliminate their underlying causes. It is well known that the first such centre  the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia  based in Ashgabat  opened in December 2007. In our view  the experience of creating new mechanisms and institutions aimed at forming a system of international interaction at the global and regional levels must and should be replicated by States Members of the United Nations.Taking into account the need to enhance the effectiveness of inter-State contact at the regional level  Turkmenistan has launched a forum of peace and cooperation  aimed at establishing a standing mechanism for political dialogue in Central Asia. We believe that the forum will contribute to the elaboration of consensus-based approaches to finding solutions to the most important issues relating to the present and future development of Central Asia and its neighbouring regions. Moreover  the forum could become the basis for the establishment of a consultative council of the Heads of State of Central Asia. We are convinced that the development of new formats for political interaction among States within the region  coupled with the effective functioning of United Nations regional structures  will provide a reliable foundation and stability for the entire architecture of inter-State relations in Central Asia.To a great extent  attaining the goals of comprehensive and universal security will depend on ensuring security in the sphere of energy. Furthermore  the achievement of that goal is one of the most important components of a stable world economy and serves to protect it against distortions and disruptions. In that connection  the development of an international mechanism that provides for a set of guarantees for the global energy supply is a task of paramount importance. It is also necessary to underscore the importance of the joint work and coordinated efforts of all Member States aimed at developing and adopting consolidated approaches to the solution of energy security issues.The establishment by the United Nations of a new universal international legal tool kit is a key element of that process. It should  in our view  consist of the following three major elements: a multilateral United Nations document providing the legal basis for relations in the area of the global supply of energy resources; a corresponding United Nations structure that would ensure the implementation of the provisions of the aforementioned document; and an international database designed for the collection and analysis of data on the implementation of international obligations assumed by the participating States.It is common knowledge that on 17 May 2013 the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 67/263  submitted on the initiative of Turkmenistan’s President  entitled “Reliable and stable transit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable development and international cooperation”. The importance of that document lies primarily in the fact that it forms the basis for a global energy partnership that takes into account the interests of producer States  transit States and States that are consumers of energy resources.In accordance with the letter and the spirit of that resolution  our country proposes to Member States the establishment  during the current session of the Assembly  of an international group of experts for the development of a new mechanism for energy security. To that end  the Government of Turkmenistan proposes to convene an international meeting of experts on that topic in 2014. We are ready to engage in close cooperation with all Member States and the United Nations Secretariat with a view to organizing and holding such a forum.Currently the resolution of issues of security and sustainable development depends largely on the level of international cooperation in the important areas of transport and communications. The geo-economic potential of new transport and transit routes in the world is enormously significant. Such routes involve vast spaces and enormous human resources and attract considerable investments. All of that creates opportunities to transform the transport sector into one of the most important factors in sustainable development.Turkmenistan is convinced that the twenty-first-century transportation architecture provides the framework for a breakthrough in integration  in joining the common efforts of regions and in the pooling of resources and industrial and human potential. It is our firm conviction that the future belongs to such a combined system of transport communication  involving major international and regional maritime  road  railroad and air hubs  their optimal integration and the use of their specific advantages.The practical implementation of that idea became the subject of a high-level event on modality  interconnectivity and the post-2015 development programme  which was held in New York on 26 September. It was organized by the Government of Turkmenistan and the International Road Transport Union. The event focused on the search for effective solutions relating to the establishment of modern  diversified and safe transport infrastructure throughout the world.We consider it necessary to continue the multilateral dialogue on transport issues that was initiated during the current session of the General Assembly. In that connection  Turkmenistan would like to submit a proposal to host in 2014 in Ashgabat an international conference on the role of transport and transit corridors in ensuring international cooperation  stability and sustainable development.With regard to the achievement of the sustainable development goals  we believe that the greatest attention should be focused on promoting the economic interests of States  while maintaining an appropriate ecological balance and preventing harm to the environment. That  in turn  implies the use of cutting-edge environmental technologies and the development of innovative solutions for the preservation of nature. Preserving the significant environmental component of the global economic space has therefore become an integral part of its effectiveness.We highly value the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General  as well as the successive actions of the international community at the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in Copenhagen and Cancun and during the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  held in Durban  which have gradually laid the foundations for the development of comprehensive decisions at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.We look forward to the continuation of a constructive international dialogue on that topic during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. We are convinced that it is necessary to combine our efforts in that area at the international  regional and national levels  and to effectively coordinate the efforts of States with those of the United Nations.Taking into account the numerous aspects of the climate change issue  Turkmenistan wishes to state at the current session of the General Assembly that it stands ready to make its contribution to the strengthening of the role of multilateral international mechanisms aimed at preventing the negative consequences of global climate change. In particular  we refer to the need for enhancing the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. In that connection  we are prepared to host in Turkmenistan the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 2014.Furthermore  our country would like to launch an initiative aimed at the establishment of a specialized entity  a subregional centre on technologies relating to climate change in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea basin. We believe that such an entity would help the countries of our regions to substantially strengthen their interaction in the sphere of environmental security and would contribute to the effective coordination of interregional efforts in that field.The challenges confronting the community of nations in the area of security and sustainable development cannot be resolved unless we find a solution to the humanitarian issues at the international level. In particular  we are referring to the serious global problem of the fate of refugees and stateless persons. As a permanent member of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  Turkmenistan has accumulated valuable experience in resolving the issues facing people who were forced to leave their home countries. Together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  we propose that all interested parties become familiar with Turkmenistan’s practical work in granting citizenship to refugees and stateless persons.In that connection  it would be advisable to work jointly with United Nations humanitarian agencies to develop an appropriate social programme. Moreover  taking into account the outcomes of the International Ministerial Conference of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Refugees in the Muslim World  held in Ashgabat in May 2012  we consider it necessary to develop long-term solutions to such issues  on the basis of generally recognized norms of international law. With a view to discussing those issues  we are ready to host in Turkmenistan in 2014 a high-level event in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Today  as Member States actively discuss the role and place of the United Nations in international relations  Turkmenistan declares that constructive and multilateral cooperation with the United Nations is the top priority of its foreign policy strategy. In that connection  we believe that it is precisely the United Nations that is the main and universal international Organization  which adopts decisions concerning the most important issues of global development and comprehensive peace and security. Since its inception  the United Nations has demonstrated its role as the foundation of the entire system of international stability  through mechanisms to ensure justice and to resolve the most complex international problems.Similarly  we share the opinion of the Organization today that the issue of providing it with fresh impetus is increasingly relevant  in view of the rapidly changing realities of the modern world. Therefore  Turkmenistan supports a strengthened and expanded role for the United Nations at the global level.We are firmly convinced that international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations — based on peace  equal rights and respect for nations  their rights and sovereignty — must remain the foundation of the world order in the twenty-first century."
"170",6868,"TLS",68,2013,"Allow me to begin by conveying my vigorous condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks in Kenya  Pakistan and Iraq  which killed scores of innocent people. On behalf of the Government of Timor-Leste  I extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families in connection with the senseless loss of their loved ones. Terrorism is contrary to every civilized value we hold dear and for which we have fought. It must be condemned in all its manifestations  regardless of its motives.This is the first time that I am addressing this Assembly of representatives of the international community as a whole. I take this occasion to once again thank the United Nations for its contribution to the realization of the right of the people of Timor-Leste to decide on our own future. Timor-Leste’s experience shows the great value of the United Nations and the importance of negotiated solutions  dialogue and diplomacy to international disputes.This is the first year without a United Nations mission in the country since the restoration of Timor-Leste’s independence 11 years ago. Our partnership with the United Nations throughout the last decade achieved remarkable successes. The Timorese people’s yearning for stability and peace was decisive for the new circumstances  which allowed the Security Council to remove Timor-Leste from its agenda.The results obtained are shared jointly by the international community  through their solidarity and pioneering efforts in the nation-building processes made in Timor-Leste  and by the Timorese people  through their maturity and firm determination to live in peace  which has been repeatedly expressed in free elections with a high voter turnout.I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the attention given to my country  which was again underlined by his visit to Timor-Leste one year ago  which greatly honoured us.The Timorese people now hold in their own hands full responsibility for building their future. The country is facing the challenges with high hopes and optimism.One such challenge is to focus national development efforts on diversifying the economy  reducing our dependency on oil and promoting inclusive development for all Timorese people. Another is to consolidate our national institutions  strengthening their technical capacities and ensuring the participation of the younger generation in managing the country.The older generations have incumbency and have the duty to pass on to young people the wealth of values developed during the liberation struggle  such as respect for human dignity and dedication and service to the country. Those values are as necessary to building an equitable society and a unified country today as they were in the past to solidifying the unity of purpose of the nation. The development of the country must not exclude any Timorese.The relations between Timor-Leste and the United Nations will continue to strengthen and will increasingly focus on assistance in the area of human  social and economic development efforts and the strengthening of institutions.The international integration of the country continues to evolve at a good pace  guided by the goal of contributing to a peaceful and stable international system capable of promoting social and human opportunities for all peoples. We are participating actively in the development of new forms of dialogue among fragile States by establishing the Group of Seven Plus (g7+). That group  over which Timor-Leste currently has the honour of presiding  comprises 18 countries committed to promoting a new model of engagement between fragile States and other international stakeholders. The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States  promoted by the g7+  has been well received by the United Nations  development partners and international organizations. The initiatives of the g7+ and the dynamic relationship of the group with development partners contributes to the establishment of more innovative and effective international relations and cooperation.The latest report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) states that most countries will not achieve all the MDGs  and that is particularly true in the case of fragile and conflict-affected States. The international community as a whole must draw lessons from that as we plan for the future. Many of the world’s poorest have been left behind  including around 1.5 billion people across the globe who live in areas affected by fragility and conflict. That is why the g7+ countries came together with the following vital message: without peace there can be no development and without development there can be no peace. And to add a further dimension to that  there can be neither peace nor development without inclusive and responsive State institutions that are capable of being responsive and attending to people’s needs.At the regional level  we have established friendly relations with neighbouring countries in South-East Asia and the Pacific  in particular with Australia and Indonesia  our closest neighbours  with whom we maintain intense cooperation. The process of reconciliation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia and the excellent relations that our two countries have developed represent a model whose lessons are useful and relevant beyond our borders and outside our region.Timor-Leste has submitted its application for membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We have developed friendly relations with all member States of that organization  which makes relevant contributions to stability in our region. Our country is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and a special observer at the Pacific Islands Forum. We play an active role in and are committed to multilateral processes  which are important for regional stability and security.The unanimous election of Timor-Leste to chair the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific by the countries members of that United Nations body reflects my country’s harmonious international integration. As a member of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  we will have the honour of chairing that organization in the period 2014-2016. Timor-Leste believes in making its voice directly heard in every multilateral forum of relevance to our national interest and will submit an application for membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.Turning our attention to international matters whose urgency especially appeals to our conscience  my country has witnessed with horror the growing violence in Syria. We welcome the agreement that was reached to put Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons under United Nations control prior to its destruction. Timor-Leste rejects the use of chemical weapons in all circumstances. We are in favour of dialogue in the search for negotiated solutions  with the involvement of the United Nations. Only negotiation can help save lives and alleviate the high toll that the Syrian people are paying in human lives and social upheaval  which has resulted in millions of internally displaced persons and refugees.In Timor-Leste  we know only too well the losses and traumas of war. We are committed to preventing violence in all its forms. Earlier this month  our Prime Minister  Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão  joined the Champions initiative to end sexual violence in conflict  supporting the corresponding action launched by the United Nations.In a world undergoing a rapid transition towards globalization  the Security Council must upgrade its ability to effectively respond and must adjust its composition to better reflect the realities of the twenty-first century. New Powers  including India  Indonesia and Brazil  among others  must be granted permanent member status in the Security Council. At the same time  my country is aware of the need for a better representation of medium-sized and small countries with relevant contributions to stability and peace. In that spirit  Timor-Leste supports New Zealand’s candidacy for a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for the 2015-2016 term. New Zealand has actively worked with us for peace and security in Timor-Leste  and we believe it will both enhance the representation of small States and be a constructive bridge-builder at the Council.On 30 August  Timor-Leste celebrated the fourteenth anniversary of the referendum supervised by the United Nations that allowed the Timorese people to realize their right to self-determination and independence. In contrast  there are peoples who  after decades  continue to patiently wait for the realization of that right. Such is the case of the Sahrawi people. A stable and lasting solution for Western Sahara cannot exist without the democratic expression of the will of its people.We commend the decision of the leaders of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resume direct talks under the auspices of the United States Government. Timor-Leste supports the right of the peoples of Palestine and Israel to live side by side in peace  with dignity and in safety. We hope that the peace talks already initiated may at last lead to a solution with two sovereign States coexisting in an environment of mutual respect and rejecting extremism and violence. We condemn the building of settlements in the occupied territories and all unilateral initiatives contrary to resolutions of the United Nations.We believe in dialogue  openness and inclusion as a means of strengthening confidence in international relations. Therefore  we call for an end to the embargo against the Republic of Cuba  an embargo that does not take into account the reality of today  of the country or of the Cuban people. We also call on President Barack Obama to act in accordance with his powers and release the four Cuban citizens  from an initial group of five  who have been incarcerated for over a decade in North American prisons.Allow me now to address the situation in Guinea-Bissau  a sister nation to Timor-Leste in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries currently experiencing an easing of political and social tensions  which we hope will lead to the re-establishment of institutional normalcy and democracy. We welcome the efforts of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau  which were led by my predecessor as Head of State of Timor-Leste  Mr. José Manuel Ramos-Horta. His initiatives have helped to enhance the prestige of the United Nations among the people of Guinea-Bissau and to create an environment of greater trust and dialogue in the country. The problems of Guinea-Bissau can be solved. Timor-Leste will continue to support the patient efforts of the Guinean people and the international community aimed at intensifying dialogue and reconciliation among the people of Guinea-Bissau and promoting a democratic solution within an appropriate time frame. Among the critical global challenges facing humankind today  I want to highlight the severity of malnutrition  which affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The dual challenges of improving food security and reducing malnutrition on a global scale require a renewed boost from all of us  including development partner countries. Without new coordinated initiatives and greater investment to promote improving food security and the fight against malnutrition  it will not be possible to make rapid and sure progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. The new objectives are defined in the post-2015 development agenda  due to be launched by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Timor-Leste is following  with great interest  the post-2015 development agenda process and was honoured by the invitation to Dr. Emilia Pires  our Minister of Finance  to participate in the High-level Panel that drafted a proposal for the agenda  following a request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.The past experience of the Timorese people and the country’s liberation struggle  in which we were engaged for 24 years  have demonstrated that only tolerance  dialogue and mutual respect  which the Timorese resistance consistently showed and I have consistently supported — in short  veneration for the dignity of people — will allow us to reach durable solutions to disputes between countries.In a world where challenges are rapidly becoming globalized  requiring concerted and effective responses  the actions of the United Nations are more than ever essential for the stability of international relations. Timor-Leste will continue to show its commitment to the United Nations  so that the Organization may better respond to the desires of Member States and the challenges they face  and to unhesitatingly assert the values of peace and mutual respect. I wish the Assembly the best of luck in its work. "
"171",6884,"TON",68,2013,"As this is my first time addressing the General Assembly as Head of State  I wish to sincerely congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure him that the Tongan delegation will be fully supportive and cooperative under his very able leadership. I also wish to commend the stewardship of his predecessor  Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  during the sixty-seventh session. I express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persevering guidance and energetic leadership in further enhancing the profile and work of the United Nations in the face of unprecedented global challenges.Tonga welcomes the timely theme for the general debate  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  and the inclusion of a set of six thematic issues of focus for high-level events and thematic debates during the sixty-eighth session. Indeed  Tonga joins other small island developing States (SIDS) in affirming that priorities in the outline of the post-2015 development agenda should  with increased cooperation among Member States  reflect the outcome of the 2014 Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be convened in Samoa.Tonga supports the proposed high-level event that would address the needs of women  youth and civil society and contribute to development goals. It applauds the high-level event on the contribution of human rights and the rule of law to the post-2015 framework and hails the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Conference on Human Rights. Earlier this year  Tonga submitted its second universal periodic review  which was adopted by the Human Rights Council. The next review for Tonga is scheduled for 2017-2018.The high-level event  centring on South-South and triangular cooperation  including information and communication technology  is appreciated as adding value to the realization of development targets. Tonga hosted the annual Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Conference earlier this month to celebrate the emergence of high-speed Internet connectivity in Tonga. The Conference showcased the achievements of the Pacific region in accessing opportunities for Internet users and demonstrated how Tonga can best develop its own investment strategy for the new cable submarine Internet system.The thematic debate on partnership deserves high praise  in particular with the aforementioned Samoa Conference focusing on the overarching theme of the sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnership. The second thematic debate  on the establishment of stable and peaceful societies  is also welcome  given the current chaos we are experiencing in the international community. The third thematic debate  on the roles of water  sanitation and sustainable energy  is equally crucial to the development agenda for the post-2015 period.Energy is the golden thread that connects economic growth  increased social equity and an environment that allows the world to thrive. Sustainable energy is central in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  including many development goals that extend far beyond the energy sector — eradicating poverty; increasing food production; providing clean water; improving public health; enhancing education; creating economic opportunity; and empowering women — as well as an integral part of creating sustainable development  including environmental sustainability. A shift towards more sustainable energy sources is also essential in addressing environmental sustainability while tackling climate-change challenges.The concept of establishing a Pacific Regional Data Repository for Sustainable Energy for All is aimed at focusing on all energy-related projects to be sourced  including all projects implemented in the Pacific  reflecting best practices as well as those that have not been so successful.The lack of bankable data in the region causes a disconnect from the true value of assistance from our development partners  whereby 60 per cent of project financing is absorbed by technical assistance  pilot projects  pre-feasibility studies and only 40 per cent  and in some cases less  on hardware. The Pacific Regional Data Repository for Sustainable Energy for All has an ambitious goal of implementation whereby the Pacific small island developing States  with the assistance of their developing partners  will gift to the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in 2014 in Samoa  a documented process under which this has been achieved and which may be shared by all regional groups of the United Nations.I therefore urge all relevant stakeholders to work together to develop and establish a common global goal on sustainable energy for all as part of the post-2015 development agenda.A set of related targets and indicators supporting the goal should encompass all three dimensions of sustainable development. The three objectives of the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative — universal energy access  increased efficiency and renewable energy — can provide a solid framework to build on further  while keeping them fully adaptable to different circumstances and priorities at the regional  national and local levels.Tonga commends the Secretary-General for his laudable initiative to convene a high-level summit meeting on climate change in 2014 and joins other SIDS in urging the leaders of developed countries to enhance their mitigation ambition to bridge the pre-2020 gap in a timely and effective manner. Furthermore  Tonga joins other SIDS in calling for the inclusion of climate change as a cross-cutting issue in terms of sustainable development goals. Oceans are a thematic priority and should also be prominently featured in the context of sustainable development goals and the post-2015 agenda.The Government of Tonga has adopted the United Nations Development Programme Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Framework and has chosen to apply it to MDG 6  on combating non-communicable diseases  with applications to MDG 1  on poverty  and MDG 3  on gender equality.The following five key interventions have been prioritized in Tonga to combat non-communicable diseases: increase the local food supply and create income-generating opportunities for women and vulnerable groups; provide curative health services in hospital settings  screening for disease-specific risk factors; review legislation  subsidiary legislation and policies affecting food  tobacco  kava  alcohol and physical activity; advocate healthy lifestyles through churches and workplaces; and support resources.Tonga’s Millennium Accelerated Framework report is completed and ready for launching and  moreover  is aligned with the call of SIDS for non-communicable diseases and other emerging health issues to be highlighted in the post-2015 development agenda.Tonga joins other delegations of the international community in urging a swift and peaceful resolution to the situation in Syria.With respect to pertinent regional issues  Tonga endorses the views expressed in the Marshall Islands communiqué  that is  the outcome document of the annual meeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders  held earlier this month.May God continue to bless and guide the States Members of the United Nations as they take their crucial work forward."
"172",6924,"TTO",68,2013," This evening  as the Chairperson of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  I am very delighted and honoured to extend to President Ashe our congratulations on his assumption of the position of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His elevation to preside over this central organ of the United Nations is testimony to the contribution that CARICOM  as a grouping of small States  continues to make to the advancement of the global agenda for peace  security and development. Indeed  it is evidence of the principle of the sovereign equality of all States enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Nowhere else is that principle more recognizable than in the General Assembly. Trinidad and Tobago is confident that the President will discharge his mandate with distinction and in an impartial manner for the benefit of all States.In 2000  world leaders gathered at the General Assembly and launched the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which were aimed at achieving specific targets on poverty alleviation  universal education  gender equality  child and maternal health  combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  environmental sustainability  and partnership for development by 2015. At that time  there was renewed faith in the United Nations as the vehicle to assist developing countries  especially the most vulnerable  in their efforts to help reduce poverty and hunger and to provide an enabling environment to assist States  working as partners  to develop their economies so that their peoples may live in conditions free of persistent poverty  inadequate health care and other developmental ills. At that time  it was felt that a new chapter was beginning for the United Nations. It was now being seen as proactive and not reactive.When we look back on the period between 2000 and the present  what is the reality? What has the international community witnessed since the commitments were made at the Millennium Summit in 2000? The evidence shows that progress towards achieving the MDGs has been uneven. For us in Trinidad and Tobago  we have made some strides in achieving the Goals and  indeed  in some cases  we have surpassed them. For example  with respect to the MDG related to education  not only have we achieved universal primary education  we have also achieved universal secondary education  and we are working towards achieving universal early childhood education. We are well aware that a number of countries are not on track to realize any of the targets set. By 2005  and again in 2010  it was evident that greater efforts were needed if developing countries as a whole were to meet their MDG targets by the deadline. However  despite numerous constraints in the difficult international economic and financial environment  developing countries have done much to finance their own development. In contrast  many commentators have asserted that developed countries have not done enough to honour their commitments or to provide development assistance to their partners  consistent with the agreement reached at the Millennium Summit. Arguably  some developed countries have not done enough to reform their trade  tax and transparency policies. Moreover  insufficient attention has been paid to appropriate regulation of the global financial and commodity markets. What has happened is that those in turn have negatively impacted the ability of many developing countries to achieve the MDGs.Since the 2000 Summit  there has been some progress in the achievement of the internationally agreed goals including the MDGs  but there have also been many pitfalls. It has become apparent that business-as-usual approaches will not suffice to address and eradicate poverty on a global scale; to ensure food  nutrition and energy security; to reverse environmental degradation and to deal with climate change.Current approaches will not advance the MDG agenda by 2015 or ensure sustainable development in the post-2015 context  as agreed at the June 2012 Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Transformative change at the national  regional and international levels is what is required.In reflecting on the role of the United Nations in addressing the issue of development so that all peoples of the world may live in larger freedom  we welcome the outcome document adopted on 23 September for a renewed commitment to the MDG agenda and the intensification of the efforts towards its achievement by 2015. We also welcome the decision to launch the intergovernmental process that will lead to an agreement on the post-2015 development agenda  which should provide a new and more inclusive architecture to assist us in achieving our global sustainable development objectives.We therefore applaud the President for focusing on those efforts. We agree with him that it is an opportune moment to begin the discourse on setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. Some of the preparatory work has already been done. At the Rio+20 Conference  world leaders pledged action on sustainable development. We recognized the shortcomings of the MDG process and the need to embrace a new partnership involving Governments  the private sector  civil society and multilateral banks  inter alia  to advance action on sustainable development.As leaders  we agreed to an outcome document to chart “The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  that is  a more sustainable future for the benefit of present and future generations. “The future we want” addresses many facets of what is required to stimulate sustainable development for all countries. Trinidad and Tobago was an active partner at that Conference.Today we say we will continue to support the emphasis placed on poverty eradication as the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for the achievement of sustainable development. We are also committed to the work already under way on the establishment of the following sustainable development goals: first  the development of the green economy as a tool for achieving sustainable development; secondly  the development of measures that go beyond gross domestic product in assessing development; thirdly  the adoption of a framework for tackling sustainable consumption and production; and  fourthly  a focus on gender equality and the need for greater engagement by civil society in national efforts for sustainable development.Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon remarked that “The [Rio+20] outcome document provides a firm foundation for social  economic and environmental well-being. It is now our responsibility to build on it. Now the work begins.” Trinidad and Tobago and many developing countries also shared the sentiments of Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff  who said: “I am convinced that this Conference will have the effect of bringing about sweeping change.” Therefore  as we begin to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda  Trinidad and Tobago respectfully submits that the General Assembly must provide the platform for achieving that sweeping change  so as to ensure that we realize the objective of integrating sustainable development at all levels for a better world for all of humankind.In keeping with that renewed commitment  we applaud the launch of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development to provide an appropriate level of involvement and high-level political oversight for the implementation of our collective sustainable development aspirations. Trinidad and Tobago therefore also supports the President’s announcement to commence in a robust manner  during the current session of the General Assembly  deliberations aimed at arriving at a development agenda for the post-2015 period. We support his plans to convene high-level events aimed at addressing women  youth and civil society; human rights and the rule of law; South-South cooperation; and information and communication technology development. In our view  the topics he has selected to guide the three thematic debates scheduled for this session of the Assembly are well chosen  namely  the role of partnerships  how stable and peaceful societies can contribute to development  and the way water  sanitation and sustainable energy can contribute to the post-2015 development agenda.The areas to be tackled at those events demonstrate that the President has a clear vision of the elements needed to give effect to the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference  which embodies the hopes and dreams of the most vulnerable members of the international community. That grouping called for the new development agenda to embrace the spirit of the Millennium Declaration and to maintain the best of the MDGs  but also to go beyond them.In my view  it is imperative that those high-level meetings underscore that we must go beyond business as usual. There must a coordinated effort to use those events to formulate a development agenda that builds on and further accelerates the reduction of poverty levels  which  since the launch of the MDGs  has already been the fastest reduction in history.The discourse must also be people-centred or  as some commentators have postulated  it must be based on our common humanity. We also find merit in the comments of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda  appointed by the Secretary-General  which indicated that the targets to be agreed for the post-2015 development agenda should be monitored closely and “the indicators that track them should be disaggregated to ensure no one is left behind and targets should only be considered ‘achieved’ if they are met for all relevant income and social groups”.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the importance of having people at the centre of our development goals. Consequently  upon our election to office in 2010  we embarked on a national development policy which is built on the premise of prosperity for all. An examination of our national policy will show that in Trinidad and Tobago  we have also observed the importance of an integrated approach to not just development  but development that is sustainable  that integrates the social  economic and environment pillars and which is similar to the plan outlined by President Ashe  to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda.My Government has implemented  with varying measures of success  seven pillars that are intended to propel our country’s development in order to achieve prosperity for all. I will quickly itemize them: people-centred development  poverty eradication and social justice  national and personal security  information and communications technology  a more diversified  knowledge-intensive economy  good governance  and foreign policy.Trinidad and Tobago will continue to do its part in assisting the community of nations to craft a post-2015 development agenda to integrate the social  economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability.We join other small island developing States (SIDS) in outlining our many development successes  achieved through SIDS leadership  as well as with the assistance of the international community. In addition  and in keeping with the recognition of SIDS as a special case for sustainable development as a result of our unique characteristics  challenges and vulnerabilities  we must also highlight the fact that SIDS have made significantly less progress in the area of development than other vulnerable groups of countries.In some cases  SIDS are on the front lines of experiencing a reversal of many of the gains that have been achieved. In that regard  as Chair of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community  I wish to bring to the attention of this body a matter of significant concern to the States members of CARICOM: the situation of small  highly indebted middle-income countries. Almost as if we were being penalized for our relative success in getting ourselves out of the morass of poverty  the States members of CARICOM that are categorized as middle-income countries have been graduated out of the economic space where they were previously afforded access to concessional financing.The use of per capita income to determine a country’s level of development and its need for grant and concessional financing does not provide a true picture. Per capita income is  at best  an arithmetic ratio that does not address levels of poverty  distribution of income  levels of indebtedness  vulnerability and the capacity to self-generate sustainable economic and social development. If one were to add to that the impact of natural disasters and the effects of sea-level rise and climate change  the fallacy of the middle-income categorization would be wiped out in an instant.This issue must be considered within the context of SIDS and the post-2015 development agenda. Indeed  in the preparations for our participation in that upcoming discourse  the recognition of the vulnerabilities of small island developing States is one of the guidelines that CARICOM will apply when considering its commitments to the overall agenda.The economic vulnerability and ability of the States members of CARICOM to build resilience are exacerbated by a debilitating debt overhang  which continues to bedevil the region’s growth and development prospects. Similarly  CARICOM takes the view that the embargo applied to Cuba constitutes a drag on the sustainable development prospects of that country and  as such  should be lifted sooner rather than later.CARICOM’s debt stock currently stands at approximately $19 billion  while the debt-to-GDP ratio ranges from 60 to 144 per cent for many States. Many CARICOM States have been recording lower-than-satisfactory growth rates in comparison with other developing countries in Latin America and the world in general. In the aftermath of the global financial and economic crisis  CARICOM States continue to experience considerable difficulty in accessing reasonably priced development finance  as several of those States have been categorized at middle-income status and graduated away from access to concessional resources from the multilateral financial institutions.I would therefore respectfully say that it must be acknowledged that the debt overhang did not result from profligate spending by CARICOM Governments; instead  it resulted from the makeup of our countries  the geography and history of our countries; our proneness to natural catastrophes; and our very small physical size  which does not lessen the per capita cost of development expenditures for the necessary economic infrastructure and the necessary social development projects.CARICOM States therefore appeal to the international community to support our call for the immediate review of the very narrow criteria used by multilateral financial institutions and even some development partners  which graduate small highly indebted middle-income countries away from access to concessional resources; and for an early review of the economic and financial situation of graduated small highly indebted middle-income countries with a view to developing programmes for the orderly resolution of their debt overhang  without compromising the future prospects of those States.We look forward to our participation in the Third International Conference on Small island Developing States  to be held in Samoa in September 2014  and to the observance of the International Year of Small Island Developing States  also in 2014. I am of the view that both the Third SIDS Conference and the International Year of SIDS come at an opportune time and will ensure not only the full implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and its Mauritius Strategy for the sustainable development of SIDS but also that the concerns of SIDS are well articulated and adequately taken into account in the development of the post-2015 development agenda.The Assembly may recall that during the general debate in 2011  both The Honourable Winston Baldwin Spencer  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Antigua and Barbuda  and The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves  Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  put forward the case for reparations for the injustices suffered by African slaves and their descendants  stating that segregation and violence against people of African descent in the region had impaired their capacity for advancement as peoples and nations (see A/66/PV.22). They posited that former slave-owning States should begin a reconciliation process by formally acknowledging the cruelties committed over the 400 years of the African slave trade.At the Thirty-Fourth Regular Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM  held in Port of Spain in July this year  consideration was given to the issue of reparations for Caribbean slavery and native genocide. Heads of Government unanimously agreed to support action on this issue.CARICOM States therefore urge those Member States that have not yet done so to contribute to the United Nations trust fund to ensure the erection of a permanent memorial in honour of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade in a place of prominence at United Nations Headquarters. We were very heartened when the winning design for the memorial was unveiled Monday right here at the United Nations.We recognize that peace  security and stability provide an enabling environment for sustainable development. Indeed  national and personal security is one of the seven pillars of our own national sustainable development strategy. At the international level  we are stalwart supporters of the Arms Trade Treaty  agreed to in March of this year and which we have already signed. Today we deposited our instrument of ratification.In the light of our experiences and challenges in connection the impact of crime  violence and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons on our development efforts  we would encourage all States which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Arms Trade Treaty  so that it may come into force at the earliest opportunity.Indeed  I want to note with sadness an incident that occurred only recently. One of our brilliant young citizens  Mr. Ravindra Ramrattan  a former President’s gold medalist for academic excellence in Trinidad and Tobago  was killed last Saturday in the terrorist attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi. He no doubt fell victim to illegal guns and other weapons in the hands of murderous terrorists. His death is merely one more example of the consequences of illicit cross-border flows of arms. On the Syrian crisis  it must not be forgotten that good governance  respect for human rights and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for the achievement of sustainable development. In that context  we wish to underscore our grave concern about the escalating humanitarian crisis in Syria  and repeat our call for the situation to be resolved through dialogue and not the use of any measures that would violate international law. We submit that if there is prima facie evidence that individuals committed war crimes during this protracted conflict that fall within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court  steps should be taken to bring them to justice.As we move forward with the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals  of which Trinidad and Tobago is a member  we have already seen certain areas in which consensus is emerging. I wish to assure the Assembly that the Government of Trinidad and Tobago will continue to be actively engaged in advancing the President’s efforts to utilize the General Assembly as a primary vehicle for engaging in dialogue on the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda."
"173",6971,"TUN",68,2013,"On behalf of my country  Tunisia  and the Tunisian people  I greet the Assembly and all those around the world represented here.On 17 December 2010  Tunisia  as the Assembly knows  was the first country to experience the Arab Spring  the peaceful revolutions of Arab peoples aimed at ridding themselves of corrupt dictatorships hampering the economic  political and social progress of their countries. Such dictatorships had imposed with brutal force corrupt regimes that had swept away basic human civilization. What has now been seen in some Arab Spring countries may lead some to believe that those efforts at liberation have failed and that the dream has become a nightmare.What we must remember is that the Arab Spring is not a final stage  something that can be achieved overnight. It is  rather  just the beginning of a liberation journey and a future project leading towards further horizons. What we must take into consideration is the element of time. Nations require decades to gain control of their revolutions and achieve their success or failure. We must remember that the Arab Spring  like all human projects  may stumble or come to a standstill — indeed  may fail. Our duty — the duty of those here — is to persist in support of that journey and to begin afresh after each obstacle. We believe that the difficulties involved in building democracy in the Arab Spring countries are only natural and will be overcome. Our peoples will never accept regimes that shackle them. We want to fight extremism cloaked in religion  not replace it with dictatorship cloaked in nationalism or patriotism. Those difficulties do indeed reveal that political  social and ideological forces are pushing countries this way and that; building democracy and civil institutions is replete with difficulties in all Arab Spring countries.From this rostrum  I would like to speak to the current authorities in Egypt and call on them to release President Mohammed Morsi and all political detainees. Only a bold initiative such as that has the potential to end the political tensions  stop the violence and bring all the parties back to a dialogue as the only means to solve all the difficult problems caused by the current transitional phase.The restriction of movement of goods and persons is increasing the difficulties faced by the struggling people of Gaza under Israeli occupation and colonization.Tunisia is dealing with three challenges. That of terrorism  as exemplified by the killing of the two martyrs  Shukri Belaid on 6 February and Mohamed Brahimi on 25 July  is a major political challenge that has impeded the work on the Constitutional Council. The second is the fact of slowing domestic and foreign investment. The third is that we are having to learn democracy at the same time that we are building and defending it. It has not yet taken root in our political and social traditions or our general culture. In Tunisia we have many of the elements necessary for success — a responsible and conscious political class that has continued to pursue dialogue  a legitimate  disciplined and professional army and a people who are peaceful and politically aware and who understand what is in their own interests.I would like to assure the Assembly that the Arab Spring in Tunisia will continue and succeed. We will set a date for elections and will agree on a just Government. Those elections will be supervised by the United Nations  the League of Arab States  the African Union and all other relevant international and local organizations and civil society groups. God willing  they will be held next spring. We are aware that the forces of terrorism and chaos will try to destabilize them as much as possible. Tunisia is undertaking this experiment both for itself and for the rest of the world. We want our revolution to be peaceful. We want justice to play its role in the transitional period. We also want to expand the concept of democracy. It is not merely about the rights of those winning 51 per cent of the vote  and ignoring those who won 49 per cent. We want coalition Governments that take into consideration the fact that society is made up of many parts. We want to learn from one another. Our success or failure will have consequences that will reach far beyond our borders. Hence the importance of solidarity among peoples  so that we can ensure success for this unique experiment.Today the Arab Spring has encountered the ultimate expression of suffering in Syria. The violence that has faced peaceful demonstrations has shocked us from the beginning. It is escalating day after day  and is now brutal on a scale that history has seldom seen before. In Tunisia we have taken a strong position against the dictatorship in Syria. We supported the the struggle of the Syrian opposition and expelled the regime’s ambassador from our country. We have been warning for a long time now about the problems of the militarization of the events  of factionalism  sectarianism and outside intervention  whether by States or so-called jihadi groups  including some from Tunisia  which we know will be a danger to us when they return from that suffering country.We have always called for a peaceful solution and have gone so far as to say that life is more important than justice  and if it is necessary not to prosecute the Syrian dictators — and if they leave the scene — we should accept that situation  however bitter. Our fears have become reality  however  and we continue to live with this nightmare that is afflicting the valiant Syrian people  as well as our conscience. We have never seen such a pitch of brutality and barbarity. A political solution to end the nightmare is desperately needed. However  what we also need is the support of the General Assembly for prosecuting the case through the International Criminal Court (ICC). That would be a contribution to international law that could contribute to protecting people against dictatorships  particularly the Syrian dictatorship  which is an extreme example of how immorally a regime can behave.We are fully confident that had the Court been able to act  the Syrian regime would not have attempted to turn the presidency of the country into rule-by-heredity  limiting ruling to one party only. It would not have dared to convict members of opposition political parties and sentence them to death. Imagine if the Court had been able to act in such cases. What if the Court had been able to pursue a course in favour of human rights? Imagine how we could have avoided the nightmare that the Syrian people has been going through — 100 000 dead and 7 million displaced persons  with a regime killing men  women and children with all the weapons at its disposal  including chemical weapons. Have we ever seen such a brutal regime by an individual person who came to power through force and falsification and who is fighting a barbarous civil war that has set the stage for ugly scenes beyond any ever seen in the history of the region? The regime ought to be brought to the ICC. Justice delayed still cannot bring millions of dead back to life. There have to be preventive bodies that can take up such situations from their very beginning. Regimes like that of Syria cannot last long against internal democratic opposition and the lack of international recognition. Tunisia therefore calls on all democratic States that wish to build institutions that counter the rise of dictatorships to support our project. We believe that such a constitutional court would be the expression of a new spirit needed by the international community.We are meeting in this place with all the nations of the world to review the world’s problems  many of which are foreseeable and bring great pain to people. We would have been able to avoid such situations had we adopted the slogan “Think globally and act locally.” As a medical doctor  I would recall that we were able to conquer epidemics that raged against humankind through efforts at prevention. Dictatorships  climate change and poverty must be thwarted internally and among peoples. In facing such epidemics  we must have preventive policies that save humankind. We hope to God that there is enough time for us to quickly take such a direction before it is too late."
"174",7018,"TUR",68,2013,"I wish to start by extending our sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. At the dawn of the twenty-first century  we had every reason to be optimistic about the future. With the end of the Cold War  the moral balance of the world shifted towards the pursuit of peace. A lasting peace is far more than the mere absence of war. We  the international community  understood the imperative of working together for a stable world order. We maintain our strong commitment to the universal principles of the United Nations system and  in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation  we develop effective international responses to the scourge of terrorism. Yet the most profound crises of our times have been emerging from internal conflicts. Such conflicts have been increasing in both frequency and magnitude. They are largely driven by the problem of political legitimacy  which leads the governed to withhold their consent and limits the prospects for domestic order. Leaders without political legitimacy share a common delusion. Instead of reading the future and leading transformation  they believe that they can buy time with irresponsible actions against their own people. Eventually  those domestic conflicts escalate into civil wars  such as the tragedy we are witnessing in Syria. The actions of those leaders have implications for peace and security beyond their own borders. If some leaders insist on defining their security in a way that inflicts insecurity upon other nations there can be no collective security. Today regional and international peace and security depend upon the maintenance of domestic order in each individual nation. True domestic peace is the key to regional and international peace and stability That is a challenge that we will continue to face in the years ahead.We all know that no one holds a monopoly on righteousness  yet I would like to touch upon the function of the whole United Nations system. We all need a strong  efficient and credible United Nations. We need a United Nations fit for its purpose in confronting current global realities. The United Nations of which I speak should be a body capable of taking action to maintain international peace and security. It should be able to safeguard security  justice and the people’s fundamental rights and freedoms. It should never forfeit its prime responsibility for the sake of power politics.We must realize that inaction by the Security Council only emboldens aggressive regimes. We need a United Nations capable of forcing the perpetrators of brutal actions to submit to justice and the rule of law. Only through such a United Nations can we achieve the truly peaceful world envisioned by the Organization’s founders. Yet as much as that remains a noble goal  it is also an urgent necessity. Decisive action is the only way that the United Nations system will remain relevant and credible. To face that new reality  we need a Security Council that is truly democratic  representative  effective and accountable.No issue facing us is more pressing than the situation in Syria. Let me be clear. Turkey welcomes and firmly supports the United States-Russian agreement to eliminate Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons. That agreement has to be translated into a tangible Security Council resolution. When Syria comes clean about its arsenal  once and for all  it will be a relief for the Syrian people and the region. As Syria’s neighbour  Turkey will appreciate more than most the complete and verifiable destruction of those weapons.Nevertheless  we cannot forget that chemical weapons were used against Syrian civilians only a month ago. The perpetrators of that crime against humanity must be held accountable and be brought to justice. I also see the agreement on Syrian chemical weapons as an opportunity. I hope it will be a first step in the formation of a security architecture to ensure the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.Yet the recent approach to the situation in Syria also raises difficult questions. Were it not for the use of chemical weapons  would the international community have continued to turn a blind eye to the deaths of more than 100 000 people? For how long can we afford to evade our moral responsibility to the people being killed even as we speak here? The conflict neither began with the use of chemical weapons nor will it end with an agreement to eliminate them. We therefore bluntly reject any position that is not troubled by the killing of innocent people in itself  but only by the means of such killing. Such an approach is immoral and totally unacceptable. The agreement to destroy Syria’s chemical arsenal must not allow the regime to avoid responsibility for its other crimes.Syria  a great country and a great nation  is consuming itself. It is a disgrace that the Security Council has failed to uphold its primary responsibility in that case. It is deeply regrettable that political differences  balance-of-power politics and geopolitical considerations have prevailed over the imperative to end the tragedy. Staying on this course cannot be an option. When the tragedy began  we spoke of the killing of hundreds of people  then thousands  then tens of thousands  and now we speak of over a hundred thousand deaths. If we cannot stop the conflict now  rest assured that we will be talking about twice that number next year. I cannot emphasize this enough. Agreement on chemical weapons must not be allowed to substitute for a comprehensive political strategy to address the situation in Syria. The conflict has evolved into a real threat to regional peace and security. Any recurrence of the proxy wars of the Cold War era will plunge Syria into further chaos.The continuation of the refugee crisis will pose vital social  political and economic risks for the host nations  as we have learned bitterly on many occasions. We know that civil wars are among the most brutal. We also know how they foster radicalism and extremism. Once extremist groups take root in a State  they form autonomous structures and become a real threat to security  not only at home but also abroad. In the end  dissolving such organizations presents the greatest challenge to restoring security in a country.We must be aware of the threat and realize that with each day we lose in indecision  the more remote the prospects for a peaceful Syria become. After the Syrian people took to the streets against the regime  many international statements were made to support their cause  strong in their wording and promises. Those apparent commitments raised the hopes of the Syrian people. Yet many nations remained at a comfortable distance  disturbed only by the horrible images from Syria. Meanwhile  the Syrian people’s cries for help went unheeded. What could match the Syrian people’s disappointment as they suffered the worst massacre of the twenty-first century as the international community simply looked on.That brings me to the question of what needs to be done. There has to be a sound strategy with well-defined and well-calculated objectives for a peaceful solution. It has to aim to end Syria’s civil war  ensuring the immediate safety and security of the Syrian people and the country’s stable transition. The enforcement of such a strategy requires a fully determined  committed and robust international engagement — exactly what has been missing since the beginning of the conflict. In short  we cannot and shall not leave the Syrian people to their fate. The burden of ending Syria’s plight now rests on the shoulders of the international community. Strong words of support must now be matched by real deeds. We must be relentless in our search for a new  stable  intact and secure Syria  at peace with its people and its neighbours. To that end  we must devise and enforce a political strategy led by the Permanent Five and the neighbouring countries.For the last three years  the Middle East has been experiencing a remarkable era of social and political change. The process of transformation begun in 2010 marks the end of the century-old  region-wide status quo. Of course  there have been and will be waves of reaction against the changes. Nevertheless  the advances in the region  including in Tunisia  Libya and Egypt  are irreversible. Arab peoples are equally capable of building pluralistic societies. Yet we should not expect the newly emerging political systems to transform into mature democracies overnight. It is only through slow but steady democratic processes that societies will come to understand the value of conciliation. The noble cause of the Arab peoples deserves our full and unhesitating support.The continuation of the Palestinian question for more than half a century has inflicted colossal damage on the very concept of justice. The denial of the right of the Palestinians to have a State of their own has no justification on any moral  political or legal ground. Despite insistent calls of the international community  the continued expansion of the illegal settlements on Palestinian land undermines the prospects for a two-State solution. The case for peace is self-evident. We therefore welcome and strongly support the talks initiated between the parties under the auspices of the United States. The success of future efforts mainly depends on the Israeli Government’s acceptance of the establishment of a viable  contiguous Palestinian State. There is also a need for the presence of a reconciled and unified Palestinian front.That brings us to another issue upon which our credibility rests — the question of Cyprus. Repeated attempts towards a peaceful settlement have ended in failure  including the rejection of the Annan plan in 2004. Turkey  as a guarantor  is fully and sincerely committed to finding a just and negotiated settlement. We therefore expect the international community to urge the Greek Cypriots to reciprocate by engaging in result-oriented  time-framed negotiations in good faith. Those who must solve this question are the Turks and Greeks of Cyprus. They must start negotiating as soon as next month  with no ifs or buts. The settlement of the Cyprus question is essential to a stable and peaceful eastern Mediterranean.Frozen conflicts hinder effective regional cooperation. We strongly urge peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and achieving sustainable peace in the Caucasus  based on territorial integrity. We have proposed a comprehensive strategy for regional economic cooperation and development  combined with gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories. We believe that can serve as a solid basis for regional peace.Another area where regional cooperation is in high demand is the Balkans. In the last few years  Turkey has bolstered its efforts to build strong ties with all Balkan nations. Our objective is to create an atmosphere of dialogue  trust  mutual understanding and conciliation. We also have a dependable interest in a secure  prosperous and peaceful Afghanistan. Here  too  regional cooperation and ownership is a must. For that reason  I have personally initiated and led the efforts to establish the Trilateral Summit process among Afghanistan  Pakistan and Turkey. Since 2007  it has proven a real success  and I am confident that more success will follow.Another important issue that affects us all is terrorism. It is real  extremely dangerous  and a crime against humanity  and it must be defeated. We can defeat it only when we get rid of “my terrorist/your terrorist” distinctions. Effective international partnership against terrorism remains a key priority for Turkey.There is yet another issue that needs our attention. Unfortunately  Islamophobia has become a new form of racism. It aims to create an abstract  imaginary enemy from the millions of peace-loving Muslims all over the world. It is essential to strike a balance between protecting freedom of expression and preserving respect for faiths.The current challenges of development are matters of global concern. Turkey is now runing a comprehensive assistance and direct investment package for the world’s least developed countries. Humanitarian diplomacy is a key objective of Turkish foreign policy. In fact  Turkey became the fourth-largest donor last year. Including the contributions of Turkish non-governmental organizations in the fields of health  education  and capacity-building  Turkey’s humanitarian assistance totals $2 billion per year. Our engagement in Somalia is an exemplary case. We have allocated $300 million so far.Our approach to Africa is one of equal partnership and is best captured in the African proverb which states  “If you want to go fast  go alone. But if you want to go far  go together.” For Turkey  relations with Africa remain a key priority.Turkey is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2015-2016. If elected  Turkey will bring an independent voice to the Security Council  one that listens to all and tries to find comprehensive and lasting solutions through dialogue. We expect the support of all Members for our candidacy. I believe that the new millennium is one in which democracy  rule of law  respect for human rights and global welfare will continue to expand. I believe that an international peace shaped by freedom  justice  dignity  social progress and economic welfare is within our reach. We must join our strength to build an enduring international order that is worthy of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. A stable  secure  and prosperous world is the best way to secure and advance all of our interests. Achieving such a world remains our fundamental responsibility to our nations."
"175",7034,"TUV",68,2013,"It is a great honour and pleasure to participate in the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the people and the Government of Tuvalu. At the outset  I would like to congratulate the President on his new leadership responsibilities; he has all the blessings and support of Tuvalu. I also wish to thank and acknowledge with profound appreciation the outgoing President and the continued assistance and support given by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  the specialized organizations and their respective heads and staff. We are particularly grateful for our membership in the United Nations following a successful sixty-seventh session.The new Government of Tuvalu  of which I am honoured to be Deputy Prime Minister  was elected two months ago. Just last week  the Government  in cooperation with development partners  launched a road map committing to mutual partnerships that will deliver and make a difference for the people of Tuvalu. The road map focuses on improving the delivery of vital basic services  strengthening good governance and enhancing local capacity to address Tuvalu’s unique vulnerabilities and respond effectively to the impacts of climate change.It is visionary and timely to focus our debate on the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as we approach the end of a journey called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are now ready to chart a new path  which we are calling the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the post-2015 agenda. And as we do every fall  we have gathered to reaffirm our spirit for and commitment to a renewed multilateralism and genuine collective action and to reflect  assess  address and plan for how to realize the Charter’s principles of peace  justice  human rights  social progress and equal opportunity for all.However  our global efforts cannot be fully universal until the United Nations pragmatically recognizes the international contribution that the Republic of China on Taiwan has made and the responsibility it has undertaken to achieve the noble goals of the United Nations  as well as the MDGs and SDGs  thus improving the standards of living of millions all over the world. The Republic of China’s significant international participation in United Nations specialized agencies  including in the World Health Organization  UNESCO  UNICEF  the International Civil Aviation Organization  the International Maritime Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  is critical as we collectively advance towards the post-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable development goals. Tuvalu also fully supports the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. That will allow the Republic of Cuba to further consolidate and enhance its cooperation with small island developing States (SIDS) like Tuvalu.Looking back at our MDG journey  we have come across a myriad of crises and challenges  both natural and man-made. We know where we have come from  we know our capacities and constraints in facing those crises and challenges  and we know the direction we are heading in. We give great attention to how to address the many persistent and ongoing issues in their entirety and in their many forms  as we approach the finish line for the MDGs.As we make the transition to the SDG stage and the post-2015 agenda  we take heed of the intrinsic lessons from the MDGs. First  the United Nations continues to be a beacon of hope and  through strategic advocacy and awareness campaigns  the Organization brings the real issues and current events into the consciousness of both the public and the membership in order to propel action and redress. Secondly  partnership is key to the success of this truly universal Organization. Working together cooperatively delivers much more that we can make happen on our own. Cooperation and collaboration with communities  businesses  think tanks  churches  philanthropists  regional groupings and not least each United Nations Member  reaffirms a true and sustainable union that should constitute the way forward for the SDGs.The United Nations Charter should be mirrored in our national goals and priorities. Our vision for the new SDGs and post-2015 agenda must reflect a membership that is striving for the same goals — a world that embodies peace  not conflicts and terrorism; hope  not despair; opportunities  jobs and prospects for a decent life  not unemployment and welfare dependence; security and freedom  not insecurity and totalitarianism; equality  not autocracy; unity  not divisiveness; good governance and leadership  not tyranny; sufficiency  not poverty; progress  not setbacks and regression; and empowerment  not constraint.Let me reflect on Tuvalu’s performance with respect to the MDGs as the deadline 2015 draws near. I am pleased to report that Tuvalu has made significant progress towards the achievement of its MDGs  despite the impact of the various global financial and economic crises on its small  vulnerable economy. In the 2012 MDG progress report  Tuvalu was assessed as being on track with respect to four of the MDGs: primary education  child mortality  maternal health and global partnership; as having the potential to achieve three MDG targets: gender equality  combating HIV/AIDS  and environmental sustainability; and as being unlikely to achieve the MDG on poverty.The attainment of the MDG on poverty is a formidable challenge for the fourth-smallest country in the world. Tuvalu is poorly endowed in terms of natural resources and has almost no productive capacity. Tuvalu is highly dependent on aid  leasing gratuities and rental incomes derived from its national assets — air  sea and its domain — and remittances. We will continue to seek the invaluable support and cooperation of the United Nations and the donor community in our pursuit of attaining the MDG on poverty as we approach 2015.Gender equality and the empowerment of women and youth is pursued at all levels of decision-making. In 2012  Tuvalu adopted a family protection bill that aims at safeguarding our women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence  domestic violence and rape. The bill has facilitated access to justice and improved the provision of services to women and girls who have been subject to discrimination and violence  whether in the public or the private sphere.Tuvalu is also fully committed to the strategic implementation of the outcomes of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. As we approach the International Year of Small Island Developing States  in 2014  and the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in Apia  Samoa  we urge the United Nations to ensure that SIDS status and SIDS-specific recognition are truly sanctioned in the Organization’s bureaucracy. We have seen enough General Assembly resolutions that address SIDS issues in a vague and abstract way  and yet the entire United Nations development agenda includes no specific treatment of SIDS. The 2014 SIDS Conference must be decisive on establishing special windows for partnerships on SIDS that are designed to ensure not only their sustainable development but also their long-term security and survival.Tuvalu appreciates the decision of the Economic and Social Council to defer consideration of Tuvalu’s graduation from the least developed country (LDC) category under the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020. That said  however  Tuvalu humbly submits that while the threshold criteria of LDC graduation — the human development index  per capita gross national income and the economic vulnerability index — are well established  it would simply be irrational and irresponsible if application of any two of the three criteria was the only measure of consideration for graduation. Given Tuvalu’s extreme vulnerability as a SIDS  we believe that our failure to achieve a satisfactory EVI level carries more weight for us in considering our possible graduation from the LDC list.Climate change and sea-level rise have had dire consequences for Tuvalu’s situation. Our survival and security  and our children’s future livelihood  have been seriously compromised by the international community’s inaction on climate change. The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis  has further confirmed to the world the stark predictions for SIDS like Tuvalu in the wake of climate change and sea-level rise. The challenge we put to the Assembly is  What else are we waiting for? What is the relevance of talking about post-MDGs and SDGs when the world continues to fail in its duty and obligations to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and provide genuine adaptation? Ensuring Tuvalu’s long-term security means saving the whole world.Climate change is no longer an environmental or political issue. It is a borderless security issue for humankind. Everyone must act to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and provide adaptation. Among the papers distributed to the Assembly is the 2013 Pacific Islands Forum Communiqué  which contains the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  which Tuvalu strongly supports. Through the Majuro Declaration  the Pacific island leaders commit their full responsibility and leadership to making their own contribution  however minuscule  to global efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. If we SIDS in the Pacific can do it  surely others can  too. The world must save Tuvalu and the SIDS in order to save the whole planet. We urge perseverance  with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol as the primary international and intergovernmental instruments for negotiating the global response to climate change. We call on all parties to work diligently to reach a legally binding framework for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions at the upcoming nineteenth session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference  in Warsaw. The framework should also include mechanisms dealing with climate-change-related loss  damages and insurance for SIDS  and should provide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation support to SIDS such as Tuvalu. Tuvalu also applauds and fully supports the leadership of the Secretary-General and his commitment to hosting a climate change summit next year.For Tuvalu  the climate change issue is predominantly linked to the oceans. For a nation surrounded by seas  an ocean SDG is pertinent  for obvious reasons. Seventy per cent of the planet’s surface is covered by oceans  which are the cornerstone of Earth’s life support system. The uncontrolled and increasing carbonization of our oceans and their biodiversity are genuine issues of concern and must be urgently addressed. At the same time  radioactive spillovers of land-based nuclear wastes into the oceans  especially those that have followed recent incidents  must be dealt with properly and prevented from happening again. Here  the principle that the polluter pays should be the basis for efforts to clean  mitigate and prevent contamination of the oceans.Tuvalu is currently heavily dependent on imported fuel and petroleum products for electricity generation and transportation requirements. That will continue in both the short and medium term. Many recommendations for alternative energy sources and technologies  whether solar  wind or wave  have been proposed but not fully implemented. Our energy sector has set itself the challenge of becoming 100 per cent renewable by 2020. We appreciate the support of the many donors we have had for alternative renewable sources of energy  assistance with formulating energy policy and promoting efficient energy sources. Science and technological capacity in Tuvalu also remain underdeveloped  and we need relevant and simple technologies that can be made readily available and priced effectively  especially for LDCs and SIDS. The facilitative role of the United Nations as a repository of such technologies and practices within the Organization’s networks and websites will prove highly beneficial.Finally  as we approach the end of the MDGs and embrace the SDGs  we must pay attention to the nations with special needs  the poorest and most vulnerable  in making every effort to meet the MDGs and achieve a smooth transition to the SDGs. The scale of the challenges can be addressed only by reforming ourselves — the United Nations and each Member country. Delivering on the future we need and on our sustainable goals  delivering more and delivering better  will require increasing doses of great effort and discipline  perseverance and courage  tolerance and harmonious coexistence  multilateralism and interdependence on the part of us  the peoples of the United Nations.In a couple of days  Tuvalu will celebrate its thirty-fifth year of independence. Can we tell our children and grandchildren a story of continued survival on our God-given peaceful islands? Or do we have to tell them that the world  under the United Nations  that noble body  can no longer save their future because of climate change and sea-level rise? As with great pride we celebrate the continuing vibrancy of democracy and the rule of law  and our political independence in Tuvalu  we also appeal to the world. Please save Tuvalu from climate change. Let the world save Tuvalu in order to save itself."
"176",7080,"TZA",68,2013,"Allow me to begin by congratulating you  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election to steer the affairs of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. As I congratulate you  I would like to assure you of Tanzania’s support and cooperation as you discharge of your responsibilities. I also wish to acknowledge and commend your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  for his outstanding leadership during the sixty-seventh session. A great deal was achieved because of his visionary and wise leadership. In the same vein  I would like to pay glowing tribute to our the Secretary-General for the excellent work he is doing for the United Nations and humankind at large.My delegation and I find the theme of this year’s General Assembly to be timely and very opportune. We should start now to set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. Hence I find the theme  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  to be a wise choice: it affords us an opportunity to know where we are with regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to decide what needs to be done to complete the unfinished business and enable us to make informed decisions beyond 2015.The Millennium Development Goals framework is the best development framework ever produced to address global and national development challenges. The world has never witnessed such a coalescence of concerted efforts into a unified framework. It is heart-warming to note that progress towards attaining MDGs has been made over the past 13 years. However  that progress varies from one Goal to another  and is highly uneven across nations and continents.Although extreme poverty has been halved at the global level  more than 1.2 billion people are still trapped in extreme poverty  which is a saddening fact. An estimated 19 000 children under the age of five and approximately 800 women die every day mostly from preventable and curable diseases. That is totally unacceptable in a world of unprecedented advances in science and technology  which could be leveraged to solve almost all the development challenges facing humankind. In a world that has enough food to feed everybody  nobody should go hungry or be undernourished. In a world with so much wealth  there is no reason that poverty  hunger and deprivation should ever continue to inflict pain and cause misery to many people. It is incomprehensible  therefore  that the MDGs could not be fully attained.Tanzania has made significant progress in implementing the MDGs. We have already achieved the targets in four of the eight MDGs  well before the deadline set of 2015. In MDG 2  we have achieved the target on universal primary education enrolment. On MDG 3  we have achieved the target of gender parity in both primary and secondary school enrolment. That is a change from the past  when there were more boys than girls in schools. As a matter of fact  the trend is now tilting towards more girls than boys in school. We are yet to meet targets with regard to the ratio of females to males in tertiary education and in decision-making positions  in particular Parliament. However  it is possible to achieve the target for parliamentarians by 2015 because we are now in the process of reviewing our Constitution.We are on target with regard to reducing HIV/AIDS infections  which is the requirement of MDG 6. Similarly  we have attained MDG 4  on child mortality  which is a major achievement as compared to where we were in 2000. But it is depressing that we are not on track with regard to MDG 5  with regard to maternal health. We are intensifying efforts to do better in order to improve the health of women in Tanzania.With regard to MDG 7  on environmental sustainability  we are on target with regard to drinking water for the urban population  but we are lagging behind when it comes to rural water supply and access to improved sanitation  both in rural and urban areas.We have not relented in our pursuit of the MDG targets that we are not likely to achieve by 2015. That will be the unfinished business on which we will probably need to take action over and above what we are doing. We are lagging far behind with regard to MDG 1 in its four main indicators. There is not much chance of meeting those targets by 2015 despite the efforts we have been making.However  we have been intensifying actions to transform and modernize our agriculture. Our aim is to increase productivity and farmers’ incomes  as well as to ensure food and nutrition security for them and the nation. Agriculture employs 75 per cent of the Tanzanian population  and it is in that sector where the majority of poor are concentrated. Therefore  improved agriculture will mean fewer poor people and fewer hungry people. Plans are also under way to expand the conditional cash-transfer programme under the Tanzania Aocial Action Fund supported by the World Bank. We want to increase the size of investment to benefit more vulnerable people  so as to accelerate the implementation of MDG 1 in the shortest possible time.Generally  it remains my firm belief that despite some failures  the MDGs have been nothing short of a remarkable success. If developed countries provided financing as envisaged under MDG 8 and in keeping with the Monterrey Consensus and their own commitments in different forums of the Group of Eight and Group of 20  we would have implemented all of the MDGs to the letter and spirit. We find unrealistic any post-2015 development agenda that does not address the critical issue of ensuring adequate financing. That is also true with regard to accelerating the implementation of the MDGs in the period remaining. We will continue to look to the United Nations for guidance and leadership in steering both processes to a successful conclusion. The fact that the United Nations needs reform is a matter of little disagreement. Our collective failure to respond to that reality creates scepticism about our common resolve to strengthen the Organization  which is meant to serve all nations and peoples. The reform we demand is long overdue. While we welcome discussions on the reform of the Economic and Social Council  Africa will not relent in demanding reform of the Security Council so that the continent with the largest membership in the United Nations has a permanent voice.Regrettably  conflicts have continued to interfere in our development endeavours  as they linger in different parts of the world — from the Sahel to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and from Syria to Afghanistan and other places. Conflicts have caused an enormous loss of innocent lives  as populations continue to endure suffering. The recent use of chemical weapons in Syria  as confirmed by United Nations inspectors  is rather distressing. We condemn that flagrant and senseless killing of innocent people  including children  in Syria. We commend the Secretary-General and the Security Council for way they have handled the matter. I believe the doors for a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis are not closed and that a military solution should be the last resort.The United Republic of Tanzania regrets to see the suffering of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a consequence of a conflict that has continued for far too long. We hope that this time around  the initiative of the Secretary-General that resulted in the establishment of the Peace  Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region  which was signed in February  will deliver lasting peace  security and development for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region as a whole. We highly commend the Secretary-General for his vision and leadership in that regard. We welcome the choice of Her Excellency Ms. Mary Robinson  former President of Ireland  as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region. She will surely help advance the cause of peace in the region  if supported by all of us in the region and the international community. Tanzania commits its support in that respect.Among the enduring problems facing the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the proliferation of armed groups with varied interests. Bolder action is required to uproot those negative elements. Those groups should be neutralized and disarmed. It is in that context that we welcomed an expanded mandate for the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as per Security Council resolution 2098 (2013)  which  among other things  established the Intervention Brigade. Tanzania agreed to contribute troops to the Brigade because we believe it will help to deter belligerence and create a conducive environment for a political process to take effect. Of course  any panacea for the Democratic Republic of the Congo problem will be political rather than military.Since 2007  Tanzania has been a proactive contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. With more than 2 500 peacekeepers — in Lebanon  Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo — we are the sixth-largest contributor of military and police peacekeepers in Africa  and twelfth globally. We are partaking in that noble endeavour as a faithful Member of the United Nations  ready to perform the duty of advancing and upholding the ideals of the Organization. We are satisfied that our contribution  albeit modest  is having a broader impact on those who have experienced the horrors of conflict. In discharging that historic mission  however  our peacekeepers  and therefore Tanzania  have sometimes paid the ultimate price  as was the case recently with the loss of seven brave soldiers in Darfur and two in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those soldiers are our national heroes  and their sacrifice is not in vain. We hold them in very high regard.The death of our peacekeepers was a grim reminder of the dangers facing peacekeepers around the world. It is disturbing that armed groups and peace spoilers are increasingly attacking such servants of peace. We must unreservedly condemn all such attacks  as there is no cause or justification for such barbaric attacks. They constitute a crime under international law. The Security Council  whose primary role is the maintenance of international peace and security  should be in the forefront in terms of condemning such barbaric acts in good time.At this juncture  I wish to reiterate our call for an end to the unilateral economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba  which has lasted for more than 50 years. Our call to end that unilateral embargo is predicated upon not only its legality but also upon humanitarian concerns  in particular the negative effects it has on the quality of life of many innocent Cubans. We are deeply encouraged by recent developments  especially the removal of restrictions on family travel  cash remittances and telecommunication services. We hope that spirit will culminate in a total cessation of the embargo in the not-too-distant future so that Cubans will be relieved of the enormous economic  social and financial hardships they have endured for far too long.A solution to the dispute over the sovereignty of Western Sahara is also long overdue. It is high time that the United Nations took bold action to give the Saharawi people an opportunity to decide their fate. It is incomprehensible that the Security Council  which has been able to handle bigger security challenges  including in similar circumstances  has not been able to resolve the matter for nearly 40 years now. Justice delayed is justice denied. Members will agree that the Rome Statute  which established the International Criminal Court  was a major milestone for the international criminal justice system. The Court’s establishment as a mechanism for fighting impunity was possible only with the support of Africa. However  a decade after its entry into force  a rift has grown between the Court and our continent. The Court is perceived as unresponsive to what are  in our view  the legitimate concerns of African leaders and the peoples of Africa. It continues to ignore repeated requests and appeals by the African Union. It was sad to note that legitimate requests regarding the timing of the trials of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto went unanswered. That attitude has become a major handicap in terms of reconciling the Court’s secondary and complementary role in fighting impunity. The Court’s rigidity has proved counterproductive and threatens to undermine the support it enjoys in Africa. We demand a change in that perception.Tanzania condemns in the strongest terms possible the cowardly attack that happened last week at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi  which left more than 60 innocent people dead and hundreds more injured. I spoke and wrote to President Kenyatta to express our sadness and dismay. Yesterday  I signed the book of condolences at the Kenyan Mission to the United Nations here in New York. I reaffirmed our solidarity with President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya during these difficult moments  as well as our solidarity in the fight against terrorism. That heinous attack is a heartbreaking reminder of the threat that terrorism poses to humankind. None of us is completely safe from terrorism  as it can happen anywhere  anytime and to anyone. We must therefore increase our vigilance  enhance regional and global cooperation and scale up the fight against terrorism. The challenge ahead of us can be neither underestimated nor understated. Success will depend upon our unity of purpose and determination. At this juncture  I would like to commend His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta for his exemplary leadership in the wake of the attack and his unshaken resolve and firm commitment to continue to support the peacebuilding efforts in Somalia and elsewhere. We are with the Kenyan people in this time of distress and grief.In conclusion  I would like to stress once more that we are passing through a time of great opportunity despite the many challenges. We must take advantage of the current scientific and technological innovations  the current advances in information and communication technologies and the knowledge and lessons learned from the implementation of development programmes  including the MDGs  to build a world without poverty  hunger  disease and deprivation. We must build a world that protects its environment and nature  a world without wars  conflicts or acts of terrorism  a world where human rights are respected  the rule of law is observed  democracy reigns and civil society is regarded as an integral part of the development endeavour. With stronger multilateralism and the United Nations leading the way  and with strong political will on the part of national leaders and the people of our nations  everything is possible. We can make our world a better place for everyone to live."
"177",7123,"UGA",68,2013," In the year 2000  we met here and agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015. They are: Goal 1  the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; Goal 2  achieving universal primary education; Goal 3  promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women; Goal 4  reducing child mortality; Goal 5  improving maternal health; Goal 6  combatting HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases; Goal 7  ensuring environmental sustainability; and Goal 8  developing a global partnership for development. As we can see  they cannot be sustainably achieved unless we achieve socioeconomic transformation. That means building a new society comprised of the middle class and the skilled working class out of the pre-capitalist societies that characterize underdeveloped countries. Our old society of traditional Africa had and has to undergo socioeconomic metamorphosis  just like the insects do  taking on new forms of life — egg  caterpillar  pupa  adult butterfly or other insect  and so on — of the same organism. That means fewer people in agriculture than in industry and services  more people in urban centres than in rural areas  no illiteracy  and modern agriculture rather than subsistence traditional agriculture or uneconomic colonial cash crops that bring in little for the affected families. I hope that no one had imagined that we could sustainably attain the MDGs while maintaining a backward economy. We in Uganda discovered the following bottlenecks to socioeconomic transformation. The first is ideological disorientation. The second is a weak State — no army and a weak police  judiciary and civil service. The third is inadequate infrastructure  including inadequate electricity  lack of roads  lack of a railway system  lack of information and communications technology infrastructure  and so on. All of this means high costs for doing business in a given country. That scares away business  and without business there can be no employment  no production of goods and services and no expansion of the tax base. It is a vicious circle.The fourth bottleneck relates to human resources that are undeveloped on account of lack of education and poor health. An illiterate and unhealthy population cannot be the agent of socioeconomic transformation. The fifth is the issue of small internal markets resulting from the colonial balkanization of Africa. Those had to be worked on through regional market integration. One cannot sustainably produce if sufficient numbers of people do not buy one’s goods.Sixth  a lack of industrialization and a failure to modernize services meant that we continued to export raw materials at 10 per cent or less of the final value of the final product  thereby losing money and jobs to the outside world. The lack of modern services meant that we could not attract tourists and had to import services from outside in the form of professional and medical services  inter alia  in addition to jobs not being created.Seventh  the failure to modernize agriculture inhibits the earning capacity of the affected portions of the population and the country  stunts job creation and affects food security.Eighth  the additional mistake was made of interfering with the private sector  influenced by an incorrect analysis of the national interest. Was the private sector causing the national economy to haemorrhage by repatriating dividends  or was it creating an infusion of fresh money and knowledge and expanding the size of the economy? Fortunately  that mistake has been corrected in Uganda and in much of Africa.Those are the bottlenecks that directly affected the rate of socioeconomic transformation. I do not wish to go into the political bottlenecks here.In Uganda  therefore  we were clear about all of those from the very beginning. It was not possible to talk of the MDGs sustainably without talking about those strategic bottlenecks. You could not sustainably base yourself on donor support to achieve the MDGs.In spite of the fact that a number of mistakes were made by some of our actors  Uganda will have achieved the following MDGs by 2015.First  eradicate extreme poverty and hunger — already achieved; second  achieve universal primary education — already achieved; third  promote gender equality — already achieved; fourth  reduce child mortality — already achieved; fifth  improve maternal health — achieving this one has been slow to be achieved because of mistakes on our side; sixth  combat HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases — we are on track to achieve this  except as concerns new AIDS infections  which have increased slightly; seventh  ensure environmental sustainability by increasing the electrification of the economy  so as to stop the cutting of forests for firewood and for primitive agriculture by modernizing agriculture and shifting a greater portion of the population towards industry  away from agriculture.We have been working on Goal 8  developing a global partnership for development  first and foremost by working for economic and political integration in Africa and for market access to the rest of the world on the basis of mutual advantage. The process of market integration in Africa has already started in the form of the East African Community  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  the Southern African Development Community  the Economic Community of West African States and the Economic Community of Central African States.As part of the global partnership  we should be very careful not to lose the easing in global tensions that came with the end of the Cold War. In the Book of Matthew  Jesus says : “ By their their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes  or figs from thistles? Likewise  every good tree bears good fruit  but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit  and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus  by their fruit you will recognize them.” (The Holy Bible  Matthew 7:16-20)A good system will prove its superiority by example. The Book of Matthew also states: “In the same way  let your light shine before others  that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” (ibid.  Matthew 5:16)We do not have to create new global tensions in order to deal with criminals. Where there is a need for international action  regional and global consensus should be sought so that we unite the many to defeat the few and isolate the enemy to the maximum  as the late Chairman Mao Zedong used to say. Where there is a need to fight for freedom  oppressed people can fight for themselves. They do not have to be sponsored by external forces. Those who seek external sponsorship as their primary aim are suspect  to say the least. Still on the issue of global partnership  I cannot fail to stress our anger vis-à-vis actors who are beginning to make it a habit to ignore African Union positions on African matters. One of our slogans in the decolonization struggle was “Africa for the Africans”. Some people seem to think that that was an empty slogan. They are wrong. Although the patriotic forces have been taken by surprise by this renewed arrogance by the old mistake-makers  they will react appropriately to protect Africa from hegemony. The latest manifestation of arrogance is from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in relation to the elected leaders of Kenya. Many African countries supported the establishment of the Court because we abhor impunity. However  in a shallow  biased way  the ICC has continued to mishandle complex African issues. That is not acceptable. The ICC should stop. Our advice to it is from very capable actors who know what they are doing and who know what they are saying. Kenya is recovering. Let it recover. We know the origin of the mistakes of the past. The ICC way is not the right one for handling those mistakes.In our struggle for socioeconomic transformation  our biggest problem has been funding. The small modern colonial economy of Uganda was destroyed by Idi Amin. Initially  as we struggled for minimal economic recovery  we had to depend on external funding. Although useful  that funding was limited  slow in coming  not always focused  and erratic. Although our economy succeeded in achieving an average annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent per annum over the past 20 years  we could have achieved much higher rates of growth  especially if we had had reliable funding for infrastructure  Now that we have a little bit of our own money  we are able to implement infrastructure projects much faster. Even without oil and gas  we were able to move much faster in terms of infrastructure development by relying on ourselves. Of course  additional external funding  if it is focused  sizeable and on time  can be very useful. Without a doubt  Uganda and much of Africa are moving forward robustly. With the resources from the oil and gas we discovered a few years ago  we will be able to fund all our infrastructure needs. The future is bright and our forward movement is irreversible."
"178",7170,"UKR",68,2013,"First of all  on behalf of Ukraine  I sincerely congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I wish him success and fruitful work as he discharges this important role.The theme of the present session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is undoubtedly important for every Member State. The deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals is fast approaching  and the task of producing the ambitious post-2015 action plan is becoming ever more urgent for the international community. I am glad that practical work on implementing that task has already been launched. Its current intensity is confirmed by two important events: the General Assembly special event to follow up efforts made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the inaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.I am convinced that the actions planned by the President of the General Assembly will allow for substantial acceleration during the sixty-eighth session of the work on elaboration of development goals for the upcoming period. We consider the innovative national consultations mechanisms  which are being successfully applied in the case of Ukraine  an important element of this work. Ukraine stands ready to be engaged fully and with maximum efficiency in these developments  which are extremely important for the international community.The topic of sustainable energy as an item of the post-2015 agenda is of particular significance to us. A new  inclusive approach to that issue must ensure the comprehensive consideration of security  social and environmental aspects. Only such an approach will facilitate sustainable development of energy  especially as regards the efficiency and safety of the nuclear sector. That objective would be favoured by the further development of and joint action on the implementation of the outcomes of Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy  which was held in April 2011.Ukraine  which experienced the worst nuclear accident in the history of humankind  is well aware of the priority importance of issues of ecological safety  the comprehensive conservation of the environment and prudent management of water resources. We encourage Member States to intensify international interaction in this field as part of their observation of the International Year of Water Cooperation and the twentieth anniversary of World Water Day.Ukraine will continue to diligently do its part to achieve the Millennium Development Goals at the national level. We are eager to establish positive momentum on many key national development indicators. These indicators include poverty alleviation  quality education  environmental conservation  maternal health improvement and child mortality reduction  among others. The leading catalyst for Ukraine’s progress towards the Goals is the reform programme  which is the largest such programme in the recent history of our country  aimed at both social and economic transformations as well as the further strengthening of the democratic system and the rule of law. The fundamental basis for internal transformation in Ukraine will continue to be supremacy of the principle of social justice.We also view Ukraine’s European integration aspirations in the light of sustainable development. These aspirations are a determining vector for the country’s development. Ukraine makes its contribution to the greater European project  which unites the interests and development goals of the countries of the West to those of the East of our continent. I strongly believe that the signing in November of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union  including the creation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area  will be an important tool in raising the welfare of Ukrainian citizens and will duly assist our country in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.It has long been broadly agreed that sustainable development is impossible without efficient international security. Conversely  lasting peace is impossible without sustainable development. Events since last year’s debate have clearly shown the inconsistency and instability of the world today. It is a world that  despite our common efforts  has not embarked on a more even and reliable trajectory of universal peace. On the contrary  according to the Global Peace Index  our world has become less safe than it was five years ago.One of the most painful security problems of today is the civil conflict in Syria  which  unfortunately  is increasingly crossing borders and becoming the source of threats on a regional scale. There is no justification for bloodshed and suffering of the civilian population  including women and children  more than 1.5 million refugees and internally displaced persons  and tens of thousands of foreign citizens who have found themselves in danger. We must do everything in our power to allay the pain and to contain and heal the open wound of his conflict as soon as possible.In our joint actions to settle the conflict  we have to rely on humanistic values  sobriety  competence and mutual responsibility. Ukraine has extended its helping hand to the Syrian population by rendering assistance through United Nations mechanisms. Today  we urge the entire international community to take part in that humanitarian mission.We welcome the plan produced by Russia and the United States to place the Syrian stockpiles of chemical weapons under the control of the international community for their subsequent destruction. At the same time  Ukraine is convinced that the successful implementation of that plan would give hope for that conflict to be brought under control and leave space for a political and diplomatic settlement. It is time to promote the establishment of as wide a platform as possible so as to reach  through multilateral negotiations  a political solution that will make it possible to restore peace and stability in Syria.With respect to pressing problems in the context of contemporary international security  I would like to draw attention to the issue of cybersecurity  which is becoming increasingly important given the development of the information society. Ukraine attaches great significance to that issue as well as to the development of up-to-date mechanisms to combat cybercrimes.We believe that we should focus on strengthening control over the use of the Internet and cyberspace for criminal purposes and for other dangerous  primarily military ends. I am convinced that this process should be led by the United Nations. The United Nations is the best instrument for transforming the Internet into a space of freedom that works in the interests and to the benefit of all nations throughout the world.I believe that it is within our power to make the world safer. The ideals of peace and the peaceful coexistence of nations are not hollow words for Ukraine but a clear guideline that has informed all of our actions on the international stage since we became independent. That imperative is at the heart of every step and initiative taken by our country in the world arena. The fact that this year Ukraine holds the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — the largest international regional forum — is a vivid example of that commitment. It is an honour for us  and we view our responsible mission primarily as a mechanism for the consolidation of security and stability in Europe. The Ukrainian chairmanship focuses in particular on the settlement of protracted conflicts and the resumption of control over conventional weapons within the OSCE area  the combat against trafficking in human beings and other very pressing issues on the Organization’s agenda. I wish to underline that in every sector I have mentioned  some limited but practically meaningful progress has been achieved.Ukraine has also been able to give added urgency to the issues of energy security and environmental safety issues for the OSCE and take the issue of energy efficiency to a new level. I am confident that the successful realization of the priorities of the Ukrainian chairmanship will allow for the intensifying of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.The year 2014 will mark the twentieth anniversary of Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon State. By ridding the world of its third-largest nuclear arsenal  our country made an unprecedented contribution to global nuclear disarmament. It was at that time that Ukraine  the Russian Federation  Great Britain and the United States concluded the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances  joined later by France and China.In view of the historical significance of those events and considering the recent alarming trends in nuclear proliferation  Ukraine will initiate the holding  at the current session of the General Assembly  of a thematic conference. We expect that guarantor States  countries that followed Ukraine’s example and other interested parties will participate. I hope that this international event will be a good opportunity to come back to the issue of negative security assurances and give it thorough consideration.We stress that security assurances for those States that gave up their nuclear arsenals and countries that are not part of military unions must be reflected in a legally binding international document.We look forward to the holding of a successful Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague next year. Ukraine looks to that global forum to produce new qualitative outcomes and encourages all other countries to make appropriate contributions to that cause.Ukraine  as a maritime State  deploys continuing efforts to secure maritime navigation safety and to combat piracy at sea. The primary task in that field is to reinforce the efficacy of mechanisms for the prosecution of those guilty of perpetrating and financing piracy. We will further contribute to the strengthening of peace through our active participation in United Nations missions in hotspots throughout the world. In its more than 20 years of participation in peacekeeping activities under the auspices of the United Nations  Ukraine has contributed to more than 20 such operations. Today its agenda includes the consolidation and expansion of that experience in the context of the United Nations missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Côte d’Ivoire.At the same time  we cannot but take note of the existing problems with respect to the current peacekeeping activities of our Organization. Along with other countries that are contributors of Blue Helmets  we will continue to work to solve them  particularly as regards ensuring the mobility and safety of air operations as well as the legal protection of peacekeepers and the investigation of crimes committed against them.Ukraine will make further significant practical contributions aimed at making the world safer. To that end  we will use all available instruments  especially non-permanent membership in the Security Council if our country is elected to that body for the period 2016-2017. I count on support for the candidacy of Ukraine in those elections.Our country is fully committed to the collective security system enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The system  which has proved indispensable  will remain the foundation of the world order.Ukraine upholds President Ashe’s decisive determination to achieve long-expected practical advances in the reform of the United Nations. We believe that it is critically important to achieve early progress in the modernization of the Security Council. We have great concern about the present stagnancy of the process.I would like to confirm once again the readiness of Ukraine to discuss all progressive concepts related to Security Council reform that could accelerate the implementation of the long-overdue changes. We consider that such reform must take into account the legitimate interests of all regional groups  including the Eastern European group. The countries of our region should be allocated one additional non-permanent seat in an enlarged Security Council.All preconditions have been met for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly to go down in history as one of the most fruitful in terms of the work of the United Nations  a key political body that is the most representative of all world organizations. I am firmly convinced that the community of nations is up to the task. "
"179",7217,"URY",68,2013,"I come from the South. At the conjunction of the Atlantic and the River Plate  my country is a gentle  temperate plain where livestock graze. Its history is one of ports  leather  salted beef  wool and meat. There were dark decades of lances and horses until finally  with the outset of the twentieth century  we were at the forefront of social  education and governmental affairs. I would say that social democracy was invented in Uruguay. For nearly 50 years  the world saw us as a kind of Switzerland  but in reality in economic matters we were the bastard children of the British Empire. When the empire ended  we experienced the bitter and terrible terms of trade and we yearned for the past for almost 50 years  remembering Maracaná. Today  we have re-emerged in a globalized world  having learned from our pain. My personal story is that of a boy — because I once was a boy — who like others wanted to change his times and his world and dreamed of a free and classless society. My mistakes were in part the results of my era. Obviously I take responsibility for them  but sometimes I cry: “If only I had the strength that I had when we enjoyed such utopia!”However  I do not look towards the past because what we have today was created from the fertile ashes of yesterday. On the contrary  I am not on this planet to settle scores or to reminisce. I am greatly anguished by the future that I will not see  and to which I have committed myself. Yes  it is possible to have a world with more humanity  but perhaps today the main task is to save life.I am from the South and I have come from the South to this Assembly. I share with the thousands of poor compatriots in cities  in the jungles  in the plains  in the pampas and the canyons of Latin America the common fatherland that we are creating. I bear upon my shoulders the indigenous cultures  the remains of colonialism in the Malvinas  and the futile and regrettable blockades of Cuba under the Caribbean sun. I also bear the consequences of the electronic surveillance  which does nothing but create the distrust that poisons us needlessly. I also come with a huge social debt and with the need to defend the Amazon  the seas  and our great rivers of America. I also have the duty to fight for all on behalf of my fatherland and so that Colombia can finally regain peace. I have the duty to fight for tolerance for those who are different and with whom we have differences and disagreements. We do not need tolerance for those with whom we agree. Tolerance is the foundation of peaceful coexistence  understanding that we are all different in this world. I fight against the illicit economy  drug trafficking  theft  fraud  corruption — the contemporary scourges unleashed by an opposite set of values and by those who maintain that we are happier when we are richer  no matter by what means. We have sacrificed the old  immaterial gods and we are now occupying the temple of the Market God. This god organizes our economy  our politics  our habits and our lives  and even provides us with rates and credit cards and the illusion of happiness. It seems that we have been born only to consume  and when we can no longer consume we are overcome by frustration  poverty and self-loathing.It is true that today  in order to spend and to bury our garbage in what science calls the carbon footprint  if in this world we aspired to consume like the average American  we would need three planets in order to be able to live. In other words  our civilization has mounted a deceitful challenge  and as we go on it is not possible for everyone to achieve that goal. Indeed  our culture is increasinglt driven by accumulation and market forces. We are promised a life of spending and squandering; in fact  it is a countdown against nature and against future humankind. It is a civilization against simplicity  against sobriety  against all natural cycles; worse yet  it is a civilization against freedom  which requires time to experience human relationships and the most important things: love  friendship  adventure  solidarity and family. It is a civilization against free time that does not pay  that cannot be bought and that allows us to contemplate the beauty of nature.We have destroyed the real jungles and sown anonymous cement jungles. We have tackled a sedentary lifestyle with walking  insomnia with pills  solitude with electronics. Can we be happy when we are so far from the human essence? We have to ask ourselves this question. Stupefied  we have rejected our own biological imperative  which defends life for life’s sake as a superior cause  and we have replaced it by functional consumerism and accumulation.Politics  the eternal mother of all human endeavours  has remained shackled to the economy and to the marketplace.Going from one adventure to another  politics achieves little more than perpetuating itself  and as such it delegates its power and spends its time bewildered  fighting for the Government. Out of control  human history marches forward  buying and selling everything and innovating in order to negotiate what is  in a way  non-negotiable. Marketing exists for everything: cemeteries and funeral services  maternity wards  fathers  mothers  grandparents  uncles  secretaries  cars and vacations. Everything is business. Marketing campaigns deliberately target children and psychologically influence older children to reserve safe territory for the future. Abundant evidence exists of such abominable uses of technology that sometimes induce mass frustration.The average city dweller wanders between financial institutions and tedious office routines  sometimes moderated by air conditioning. He often dreams about vacations and freedom. He dreams about having the ability to pay his bills until one day his heart stops and he is gone. Other such soldiers will fall prey to the jaws of the marketplace  sharing in material accumulation.The crisis really rests in the powerlessness of politics  which is incapable of understanding that humankind cannot and will not escape nationalism  which is practically etched into our DNA. Today  it is time to fight to prepare a world without borders.The globalized economy has no other driving force except that of the private interests of the very few  and each nation State seeks only to maintain its own stability. Today  the great task for our peoples and our humble way of seeing things becomes the be-all and end-all. As if that were not enough  truly productive capitalism is a prisoner of the banks  which are at the summit of global power. More clearly  the world is clamouring for global regulations that respect scientific achievements  which abound  but it is not science that governs the world.Today  we need a lengthy agenda of definitions. We must define working hours throughout the world. We need to have convergence among currencies. We need to finance the global struggle for water and against desertification. We have to figure out how to recycle more and how to counter global warming. What are the limits of each human task?We must achieve a broad planetary consensus to unleash solidarity among the most oppressed and to punish and tax waste and speculation by mobilizing the large economies not to produce disposable goods  but rather useful goods without planned obsolescence or excess  which would help the world’s poorest peoples. Useful goods could stand against world poverty. Turning to a useful neo-Keynesianism on a global scale in order to abolish the world’s most flagrant embarrassments would be a thousand times more profitable than making war.Perhaps our world needs fewer global organizations  organized forums and conferences  which serve only to aid hotel chains and airlines; perhaps no one really benefits from their decisions anyway. We must return to what is old and eternal in human life  along with science that strives to serve humankind  and not only the rich. With scientists  the counsellors of humankind  we can create agreements for the entire world. Neither the large nation States nor transnational companies  not to mention the financial system  ought to govern the world of humanity. Yes  lofty politics combined with scientific wisdom — it must come from science  which is not attracted by material gain but looks towards the future and tells us about things we may not foresee. How many years ago did they tell us in Kyoto about certain facts linked to climate change?We have finally learned that intelligence must be at the helm  guiding the ship to port. Actions of this nature and others that we cannot name  yet which we believe to be crucial  require life and not acquired wealth. Obviously  we are not so naïve; these and other things like that will not come to pass. Many pointless sacrifices still lie ahead of us. We still must deal with the consequences and not tackle the causes. Today  the world is incapable of establishing global regulations for the planet  due to the failure of lofty global politics  which meddles with everything.For a time  we were protected by more or less regional agreements  established to create a deceitful so-called free trade that in the end constructed protectionist  supranational barriers in some regions of the globe. In turn  important branches of industry and services dedicated to saving and improving the environment will arise. We will be comforted by that for a while. We will be distracted. But of course  the accumulation will continue unabated  to the delight of the financial system. Wars and fanaticism will continue until nature calls us to account and makes our civilization non-viable. Perhaps our vision is too crude  not compassionate enough  and we view man as a unique creature  the only one on Earth capable of acting against his own species.I reiterate that what some call our planet’s ecological crisis is the result of the overwhelming triumph of human ambition. This is our triumph and our defeat  given our political impotence to fit into the new era that we have helped to build without realizing it.Why do I say this? The numbers tell the story. The truth is that the global population quadrupled and gross domestic product grew by a factor of at least 20 over the past century. World trade has doubled approximately every six years since 1990. We could continue to list numbers that clearly establish the march of globalization. What is happening to us? We are entering a new era  and rapidly  but with our political bodies  cultural accessories  parties and young people all reduced to old age before the horrific and accelerating changes that we cannot even grasp. We cannot manage globalization because we do not think globally. We do not know if this is a cultural limitation or we are reaching biological limits. The portents of revolution are present in our age as in no other in the history of humankind  yet our age does not have a conscious direction or even a basic instinctive direction  and still less organized political direction  because we do not have even the beginnings of a philosophy with which to face the speed of oncoming changes. The greed that has been such a negative force and such a driver of history has also pushed forward the material  scientific and technical progress that has made our era and our time what it is and has enabled a phenomenal leap forward on many different fronts. At the same time  this very tool — the greed that pushed us to domesticate science and transform technology — is paradoxically pushing us over the edge into a shadowy abyss  towards an unknown fate  an era without history  and we are left without eyes to see or the collective intelligence to continue to colonize and transform ourselves. If there is one thing that defines this tiny little human creature  it is that it is an anthropocentric conqueror. It seems that things come alive and submit to men. Glimpses of these things abound everywhere  glimmers that should allow us to discern these things  or at least make out the direction in which things are headed  but it is clearly impossible to make collective  global decisions about the big picture. Individual greed easily triumphs over our species’ greed. Let us be clear. What is the big picture of which we speak? It is the system of global life on Earth  including human life  with all the fragile balances that make it impossible for us to continue as we are.On the other hand — and this is less contentious and more obvious — in the West in particular  because we are indeed from the West  though we are also from the South  the republics arose to make the claim that men are equal  that no one is better than anyone else  and that Governments should represent the common good  justice and equity. Often  these republics become warped and fall into the habit of ignoring ordinary people  the man on the street  the common people. Republics were not created to outgrow their constituents  but instead are historical phenomena designed to function for their own people. They must therefore answer to majority and must fight for its interests.As for the traces of feudalism that persist in our societies  or the domineering classicism  or the consumer culture that surrounds us all  in the course of their existence republics often adopt a way of daily life that excludes and holds at arm’s length the common man. In fact  that common man should be the central cause of the republic’s political struggle. Republican Governments should increasingly look like their respective peoples in the way they live and the way they deal with life. The fact is that we tend to cultivate feudal anachronisms  spoiled affectations and hierarchical distinctions that undermine the best feature of republics — the fact that no one is better than anyone else. The interaction of those factors and others keeps us living in prehistory  and today it is impossible to renounce war when politics fails. Thus  economies are strangled and resources wasted. Every minute in the life of our planet  we spend $2 million on military budgets around the world — $2 million a minute. Medical research on all manner of diseases  which has made huge advances and is a blessing that promises longer life  receives barely a fifth of what is budgeted for the military. That process  from which we cannot escape  perpetuates hatred  fanaticism and distrust  fuels new wars and wastes fortunes.I know that it is very easy politically to criticize ourselves at the national level  and I think it naive in this world to propose that resources that could be saved and spent on other  useful things. Again  that would be possible if we were capable of making global agreements and working on global prevention and world policies aimed at ensuring peace and offering the weakest among us guarantees that do not exist. Enormous resources would have to be cut to address the most shameful things on Earth  but one question suffices. Where can humankind as it is today go without those guarantees? Thus  each wields arms commensurate with his size. And that is where we are today  because we can barely reason as individuals  let alone as a species. Global institutions  especially today  languish in the shadow of the dissenting great nations. Clearly  such nations wish to hold on to power. They block action by the United Nations  which was created in the hope and with a dream of peace for humankind. But what is even worse is that they have cut it off from global democracy. We are not all equal. We cannot be equal in a world where some are strong and others weak. As a result  our world democracy is wounded  and we face the historical impossibility of reaching a global peace agreement. We patch up diseases when an outbreak occurs as one or other of the great Powers wishes  while we look on from afar.It would be difficult to invent a force that is worse than the chauvinistic nationalism of the great Powers. Nationalism  a force that liberates the weak through the process of decolonization  has become a tool of oppression in the hands of the strong. The past two centuries are full of examples. The United Nations is languishing and becoming increasingly bureaucratic from lack of power and autonomy  above all of recognition of democracy for the weak of the world  who are the majority. By way of a very small example  our little country is in absolute terms the largest Latin American contributor of soldiers to peacebuilding missions  and we go wherever we are asked to go. But we are small and weak  and in the places where resources are distributed and decisions made  we cannot go even to serve coffee. In our heart of hearts we long to help humankind emerge from prehistory — and people who live with war are still living in prehistory  despite the many artifacts they can build — but as long as we do not emerge from prehistory and retire war as a resort when politics fails  that is the long march and challenge we have ahead of us. We say that in full awareness; we are familiar with the loneliness of war.Such dreams  however  require us to fight for an agenda of world agreements that can begin to steer our history and overcome life’s threats  step by step. Our species should have a Government for all humankind that supersedes individualism and creates political leaders who follow the path of science and not merely the immediate interests of those governing and suffocating us. At the same time  we must understand that the world’s poor are not from Africa or Latin America; they are all part of humankind  and that means that we must help them to develop so they can lead decent lives. The necessary resources exist. They can be found in the waste of our predatory civilization. A few days ago a tribute was delivered in a fire station in California. An electric bulb had been turned on for 100 years. It had been on for 100 years! How many millions of dollars have they taken from our pockets deliberately creating junk so that people will buy and buy and buy? But globalization means a brutal cultural change for our planet and for our life. That is what history demands from us. The entire material basis has changed and it has changed man. In our culture  we act as if nothing had happened. Instead of us controlling globalization  it controls us. Almost 20 years ago  we discussed the humble Tobin tax  which could not be applied at a global level. All of the banks with financial power rose up against it. Their private property and who knows how many other things would be harmed. However  that is the paradox. With talent and collective work  with science  step by step humankind can make deserts green; humankind can bring agriculture to the seas; humankind can develop agriculture that lives with salt water. If the power of humankind is focused on what is essential  it is infinite. Here we see the greatest sources of energy. What do we know about photosynthesis? Almost nothing. There is a great deal of energy in the world  if we work together to use it properly. It is possible to eliminate poverty from the planet. It is possible to create stability. It will be possible for future generations  if they begin to reason as a species and not just as individuals  to bring life to the galaxies and pursue this dream of conquest that we  human beings  have in our genes. But if those dreams are to come true  we will have to control ourselves or we will die. We will die because we are not capable of being at the level of the civilization that we have been developing with our efforts. That is our dilemma. We should not spend our time merely correcting the consequences. Let us consider the deep-rooted causes  the civilization of waste  the present civilization that is stealing time from human life and wasting it on pointless matters. Let us remember that human life is a miracle. Consider that human life is a miracle  that we are alive as a result of a miracle  and that nothing is more important than life. Our biological duty is  above all  to respect life  promote it  take care of it  reproduce it and understand that the species is our being."
"180",7264,"USA",68,2013,"Each year we come together to reaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most of recorded history  individual aspirations were subject to the whims of tyrants and empires  and divisions of race  religion and tribe were settled through the sword and the clash of armies. The idea that nations and peoples could come together in peace to solve their disputes and advance a common prosperity seemed unimaginable. It took the awful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. The leaders who built the United Nations were not naive. They did not think that this body could eradicate all wars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents in rubble and with the development of nuclear weapons that could annihilate a planet  they understood that humanity could not survive the course it was on. They gave us this institution  believing that it could allow us to resolve conflicts  enforce rules of behaviour and build habits of cooperation that would grow stronger over time.For decades  the United Nations has in fact made a difference  from helping to eradicate disease to educating children and brokering peace. But like every generation of leaders  we face new and profound challenges  and this body continues to be tested. The question is whether we possess the wisdom and the courage as nation States and members of an international community to squarely meet those challenges. Can the United Nations meet the test of our time?And for much of my tenure as President  some of our most urgent challenges have revolved around an increasingly integrated global economy and our efforts to recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. Now  five years after the global economy collapsed and thanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here today  jobs are being created  global financial systems have stabilized and people are once again being lifted out of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal  and we still have work to do together to assure that our citizens can access the opportunities that they need in order to thrive in the twenty-first century.Together  we have also worked to end a decade of war. Five years ago nearly 180 000 Americans were serving in harm’s way  and the war in Iraq was the dominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the world. Today  all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year an international coalition will end its war in Afghanistan  having achieved its mission of dismantling the core of Al Qaida that attacked us on 9/11.For the United States  those new circumstances have also meant shifting away from a perpetual war footing. Beyond bringing our troops home we have limited the use of drones so that they target only those who pose a continuing imminent threat to the United States  when capture is not feasible and when there is a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We are transferring detainees to other countries and trying terrorists in courts of law  while working diligently to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Just as we have reviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military capabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals  we have begun to review the way that we gather intelligence  so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.As a result of such work and cooperation with allies and partners  the world is more stable than it was five years ago. But even a glance at today’s headlines indicates that dangers remain. In Kenya  we have seen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded shopping mall. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have been affected. In Pakistan  nearly 100 people were recently killed by suicide bombers outside a church. In Iraq  killings and car bombs continue to be a terrible part of life.Meanwhile  Al-Qaida has splintered into regional networks and militias  which does not give them the capacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11 but does pose serious threats to Governments and diplomats  businesses and civilians all across the globe. Just as significantly  the convulsions in the Middle East and North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within societies  as an old order is upended and people grapple with what is coming next. Peaceful movements have too often been answered by violence from those resisting change and from extremists trying to hijack change. Sectarian conflict has re-emerged  and the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast a shadow over the pursuit of peace.Nowhere have we seen those trends converge more powerfully than in Syria. There  peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met with repression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage  many retreated to their sectarian identities — Alawite and Sunni  Christian and Kurd — and the situation spiralled into civil war.The international community recognized the stakes early on  but our response has not matched the scale of the challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering of the wounded and displaced. A peace process is stillborn. America and others have worked to bolster the moderate opposition  but extremist groups have still taken root to exploit the crisis.Al-Assad’s traditional allies have propped him up  citing principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. On 21 August  the regime used chemical weapons in an attack that killed more than 1 000 people  including hundreds of children. Today  the crisis in Syria and the destabilization of the region goes to the heart of broader challenges that the international community must now confront. How should we respond to conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa — conflicts between countries  but also conflicts within them? How do we address the choice between standing callously by while children are subjected to nerve gas and embroiling ourselves in someone else’s civil war? What is the role of force in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of a region and undermine all basic standards of civilized conduct? And what is the role of the United Nations and international law in meeting cries for justice?Today  I want to outline where the United States of America stands on those issues.With respect to Syria  we believe that  as a starting point  the international community must enforce the ban on chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to order a limited strike against the Al-Assad regime in response to its brazen use of chemical weapons  I did not do so lightly. I did so because I believe that it is in the national security interests of the United States and in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce a prohibition whose origins are older than the United Nations itself. The ban against the use of chemical weapons  even in war  has been agreed to by 98 percent of humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories of soldiers suffocated in the trenches  Jews slaughtered in gas chambers  Iranians poisoned in the many tens of thousands.The evidence is overwhelming that the Al-Assad regime used such weapons on 21 August. United Nations inspectors gave a clear accounting of their findings that advanced rockets had fired large quantities of sarin gas at civilians. Those rockets were fired from a regime-controlled neighbourhood and landed in opposition neighbourhoods. It is an insult to human reason and to the legitimacy of this institution to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack.I know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack there were those who questioned the legitimacy of even a limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from the Security Council. But without a credible military threat  the Security Council had demonstrated no inclination to act at all. However  as I have discussed with President Putin for over a year  most recently in St. Petersburg  my preference has always been to work for a diplomatic resolution to this issue  and in the past several weeks  the United States  Russia and our allies have reached an agreement to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control and then destroy them.The Syrian Government took a first step by giving an accounting of its stockpiles. Now  there must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Al-Assad regime is keeping its commitments  and there must be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot agree even on that  then that will show that the United Nations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws. On the other hand  if we succeed  it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the twenty-first century and that this Organization means what it says.Our agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political settlement within Syria. I do not believe that military action by those within Syria or by external Powers can achieve a lasting peace  nor do I believe that America or any nation should determine who will lead Syria. That is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless  a leader who has slaughtered his own citizens and gassed children to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead a badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can return to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy. It is time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting on Al-Assad’s rule will lead directly to the outcome that they fear — an increasingly violent space for extremists to operate in. In turn  those of us who continue to support the moderate opposition must persuade them that the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of State institutions and that a political settlement cannot be reached without addressing the legitimate fears and concerns of Alawites and other minorities. We are committed to working this political track  and as we pursue a settlement  let us remember that this is not a zero-sum endeavour. We are no longer in a cold war. There is no great game to be won  nor does America have any interest in Syria beyond the well-being of its people  the stability of its neighbours  the elimination of chemical weapons and ensuring that it does not become a safe haven for terrorists. I welcome the influence of all nations that can help bring about a peaceful resolution of Syria’s civil war. As we move the Geneva process forward  I urge all nations represented here to step up to meet the humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries. America has committed over a billion dollars to that effort  and today I can announce that we will be providing an additional $340 million. No aid can take the place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian people the chance to begin rebuilding their country  but it can help desperate people survive.What broader conclusions can be drawn from America’s policy towards Syria? I know that there are those who have been frustrated by our unwillingness to use our military might to depose Al-Assad and believe that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of America’s resolve in the region. Others have suggested that my willingness to direct even limited military strikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons shows that we have learned nothing from Iraq  and that America continues to seek control over the Middle East for our own purposes. The situation in Syria mirrors a contradiction that has persisted in the region for decades. The United States is chastised for meddling in the region and accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracies. At the same time  the United States is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region’s problems and for showing indifference toward suffering Muslim populations.I realize that some of that is inevitable  given America’s role in the world  but such contradictory attitudes have a practical impact on the American people’s support for our involvement in the region and allow leaders in the region  and the international community sometimes  to avoid addressing difficult problems themselves. So let me take this opportunity to outline what has been United States policy towards the Middle East and North Africa and what will be my policy during the remainder of my presidency.The United States of America is prepared to use all elements of our power  including military force  to secure these core interests in the region. We will confront external aggression against our allies and partners  as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure the free flow of energy from the region to the world. Although America is steadily reducing its own dependence on imported oil  the world still depends upon the region’s energy supply  and a severe disruption could destabilize the entire global economy. We will dismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. Wherever possible  we will build the capacity of our partners  respect the sovereignty of nations and work to address the root causes of terror  but when it is necessary to defend the United States against terrorist attack  we will take direct action. Finally  we will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical weapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national security  we reject the development of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and undermine the global non-proliferation regime.Now  to say that those are America’s core interests is not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply believe that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and North Africa that are peaceful and prosperous  and we will continue to promote democracy  human rights and open markets  because we believe that those practices help achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe that we can rarely achieve those objectives through unilateral American action  particularly military action. Iraq has shown us that democracy cannot simply be imposed by force. Rather  such objectives are best achieved when we partner with the international community and with the countries and peoples of the region.So what does that mean going forward? In the near term  America’s diplomatic efforts will focus on two particular issues: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and the Arab-Israeli conflict. While those issues are not the cause of all of the region’s problems  they have been a major source of instability for far too long  and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace.The United States and Iran have been isolated from one another since the Islamic revolution of 1979. That mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long complained of a history of United States interference in their affairs and of America’s role in overthrowing an Iranian Government during the cold war. On the other hand  Americans see an Iranian Government that has declared the United States an enemy and directly or through proxies has taken Americans hostage  killed United States troops and civilians and threatened our ally Israel with destruction.I do not believe such a difficult history can be overcome overnight. The suspicion runs too deep. But I do believe that  if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme  that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship  one based on mutual interests and mutual respect.Since I took office  I have made it clear  in letters to the Supreme Leader in Iran and  more recently  to President Rouhani  that America prefers to resolve its concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme peacefully  although we are determined to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime change  and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead  we insist that the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile  the Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons  and President Rouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon.Those statements made by our respective Governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people while giving the world confidence that the Iranian programme is peaceful. But to succeed  conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable. After all  it is the Iranian Government’s choices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions that are currently in place. That is not simply an issue between the United States and Iran. The world has seen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has an abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its obligations in future.But I want to be clear. We are encouraged by the fact that President Rouhani received from the Iranian people a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. Given President Rouhani’s stated commitment to reach an agreement  I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian Government  in close cooperation with the European Union  the United Kingdom  France  Germany  Russia and China.The roadblocks may prove to be too great  but I firmly believe that the diplomatic path must be tested. For while the status quo will only deepen Iran’s isolation  Iran’s genuine commitment to go down a different path will be good for the region and the world  and will help the Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential in commerce and culture  in science and education.We are also determined to resolve a conflict that goes back even further than our differences with Iran: the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. I have made it clear that the United States will never compromise our commitment to Israel’s security  nor our support for its existence as a Jewish State. Earlier this year  in Jerusalem  I was inspired by young Israelis who stood up for the belief that peace was necessary  just and possible  and I believe that there is a growing recognition within Israel that the occupation of the West Bank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish State. But the children of Israel have the right to live in a world where the nations assembled in this body fully recognize their country and where we unequivocally reject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite others to hate them.Likewise  the United States remains committed to the belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live in security and dignity in their own sovereign State. On the same trip  I had the opportunity to meet with young Palestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible potential are matched only by the pain they feel in having no firm place in the community of nations. They are understandably cynical as to whether real progress will ever be made  and they are frustrated by their families enduring the daily indignity of occupation. But they  too  recognize that two States is the only real path to peace  because  just as the Palestinian people must not be displaced  the State of Israel is here to stay.The time is now ripe for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already Israeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks. President Abbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit of peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime Minister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian State. Current talks are focused on final status issues of borders and security  refugees and Jerusalem.So now the rest of us must be willing to take risks as well. Friends of Israel  including the United States  must recognize that Israel’s security as a Jewish and democratic State depends upon the realization of a Palestinian State  and we should say so clearly. Arab States  and those who have supported the Palestinians  must recognize that stability will be served only through a two-State solution and a secure Israel. All of us must recognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat extremists throughout the region and embolden those who are prepared to build a better future. Moreover  ties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs could be an engine of growth and opportunity at a time when too many young people in the region are languishing without work. So let us emerge from the familiar corners of blame and prejudice. Let us support Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk the difficult road to peace.Real breakthroughs on these two issues — Iran’s nuclear programme and Israeli-Palestinian peace — would have a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle East and North Africa. But the current convulsions arising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and lasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements between nations. It must also be measured by our ability to resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. And by that measure  it is clear that all of us have a lot more work to do. When peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and Egypt  the entire world was filled with hope. And although the United States  like others  was struck by the speed of transition  and although we did not — and in fact could not — dictate events  we chose to support those who called for change. We did so based on the belief that while these transitions will be hard and take time  societies based upon democracy and openness and the dignity of the individual will ultimately be more stable  more prosperous and more peaceful. Over the last few years  particularly in Egypt  we have seen just how hard this transition will be. Mohammed Morsi was democratically elected  but proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was fully inclusive. The interim Government that replaced him responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians who believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn  but it  too  has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive democracy  through an emergency law and restrictions on the press  civil society and opposition parties.Of course  America has been attacked by all sides of this internal conflict  simultaneously accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering its removal from power. In fact  the United States has purposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding interest throughout these past few years has been to encourage a Government that legitimately reflects the will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true democracy as requiring a respect for minority rights  the rule of law  freedom of speech and assembly  and a strong civil society.That remains our interest today. And so  going forward  the United States will maintain a constructive relationship with the interim Government that promotes core interests like the Camp David Accords and counter-terrorism. We will continue support in areas such as education that directly benefit the Egyptian people. But we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain military systems  and our support will depend upon Egypt’s progress in pursuing a more democratic path. Our approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: the United States will at times work with Governments that do not meet — at least in our view — the highest international expectations  but who work with us on our core interests. Nevertheless  we will not stop asserting principles that are consistent with our ideals  whether that means opposing the use of violence as a means of suppressing dissent or supporting the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We will reject the notion that those principles are simply Western exports  incompatible with Islam or the Arab world. We believe that they are the birthright of every person. And while we recognize that our influence will at times be limited  although we will be wary of efforts to impose democracy through military force  and although we will at times be accused of hypocrisy and inconsistency  we will be engaged in the region for the long haul. For the hard work of forging freedom and democracy is the task of a generation. That includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that continue to surface in places like Iraq  Bahrain and Syria. We understand that such long-standing issues cannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed by Muslim communities themselves. But we have seen grinding conflicts come to an end before  most recently in Northern Ireland  where Catholics and Protestants finally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was causing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving world. And so we believe that those same sectarian conflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North Africa. To summarize  the United States has a hard-earned humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other countries. The notion of American empire may be useful propaganda  but it is not borne out by America’s current policy or public opinion. Indeed  as recent debates within the United States over Syria clearly showed  the danger for the world is not an America that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs of other countries or to take on every problem in the region as its own. The danger for the world is that the United States  after a decade of war  rightly concerned about issues back home and aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the Muslim world  may disengage  creating a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to fill.I believe that such disengagement would be a mistake. I believe that America must remain engaged for our own security  but I also believe that the world is better for it. Some may disagree  but I believe that America is exceptional  in part because we have shown a willingness  through the sacrifice of blood and treasure  to stand up not only for our own narrow self-interest  but for the interests of all. I must be honest  though; we are far more likely to invest our energy in those countries that want to work with us  that invest in their people instead of in a corrupt few  and that embrace a vision of society where everyone can contribute — men and women  Shia or Sunni  Muslim  Christian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia  from Africa to the Americas  nations that have persevered on a democratic path have emerged more prosperous  more peaceful and more invested in upholding our common security and our common humanity. And I believe that the same will hold true for the Arab world.That leads me to a final point. There will be times when the breakdown of societies is so great and the violence against civilians so substantial  that the international community will be called upon to act. That will require new thinking and some very tough choices. While the United Nations was designed to prevent wars between States  increasingly we face the challenge of preventing slaughter within States. And those challenges will grow more pronounced as we are confronted with States that are fragile or failing — places where horrendous violence can put innocent men  women and children at risk with no hope of protection from their national institutions.I have made it clear that even when America’s core interests are not directly threatened  we stand ready to do our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic human rights. But we cannot and should not bear that burden alone. In Mali  we supported both the French intervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida and the African forces who are keeping the peace. In East Africa  we are working with partners to bring the Lord’s Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya  when the Security Council provided a mandate to protect civilians  America joined a coalition that took action. Because of what we did there  countless lives were saved and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power.I know that some now criticize the action in Libya as an object lesson. They point to the problems that the country now confronts — a democratically elected Government struggling to provide security; armed groups  in some places extremists  ruling parts of a fractured land — and these critics argue that any intervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail. Look at Libya. No one is more mindful of those problems than I am  for they resulted in the death of four outstanding United States citizens who were committed to the Libyan people  including Ambassador Chris Stevens — a man whose courageous efforts helped save the city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that the situation in Libya would be better if Al-Qadhafi had been allowed to kill  imprison or brutalize his people into submission? It is far more likely that without international action  Libya would now be engulfed in civil war and bloodshed.We live in a world of imperfect choices. Different nations will not agree on the need for action in every instance  and the principle of sovereignty is at the centre of our international order. But sovereignty cannot be a shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an excuse for the international community to turn a blind eye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we can remedy every evil  and while we need to be mindful that the world is full of unintended consequences  should we really accept the notion that the world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda or a Srebrenica? If that is the world that people want to live in  they should say so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.I believe that we can embrace a different future. If we do not want to choose between inaction and war  we must get better — all of us — at the policies that prevent the breakdown of basic order through respect for the responsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals  through meaningful sanctions for those who break the rules  through dogged diplomacy that resolves the root causes of conflict and not merely its aftermath  and through development assistance that brings hope to the marginalized. And yes sometimes  all this will not be enough and there will be moments when the international community will need to acknowledge that the multilateral use of military force may be required to prevent the very worst from occurring. Ultimately  that is the international community that America seeks — one where nations do not covet the land or resources of other nations  but one in which we carry out the founding purpose of this institution and where we all take responsibility; a world in which the rules established out of the horrors of war can help us resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kind of wars that our forefathers fought; a world where human beings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs  whether they live in New York or Nairobi  in Peshawar or Damascus.These are extraordinary times with extraordinary opportunities. Thanks to human progress  a child born anywhere on Earth today can do things that 60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass of humankind. I saw this in Africa  where nations moving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. America is with them: partnering to feed the hungry and to care for the sick and to bring power to places off the grid. I see it across the Pacific region  where hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in a single generation. I see it in the faces of young people everywhere who can access the entire world with the click of a button and who are eager to join the cause of eradicating extreme poverty  combating climate change  starting businesses  expanding freedom  and leaving behind the old ideological battles of the past. That is what is happening in Asia and Africa  it is happening in Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the people of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as well  one where they can focus on opportunity  instead of on whether they will be killed or repressed because of who they are or what they believe. Time and again  nations and people have shown a capacity to change  to live up to humanity’s highest ideals  to choose a better history. Last month  I stood where 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America about his dream  at a time when many people of my race could not even vote for President. Earlier this year  I stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured for decades  cut off from his own people and the world. Who are we to believe that today’s challenges cannot be overcome  when we have seen what changes the human spirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the future belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit  rather than to those who seek to liberate it? I know what side of history I want the United States of America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrow’s challenges with you  firm in the belief that all men and women are in fact created equal  each individual possessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that cannot be denied. That is why we look to the future not with fear  but with hope. That is why we remain convinced that this community of nations can deliver a more peaceful  prosperous  and just world to the next generation. "
"181",7286,"UZB",68,2013,"The rapidly changing situation  growing tensions  radicalization  security challenges and threats in various regions of the world today cannot but raise serious alarm and concerns around the world. In this regard  needless to say  those problems enjoy special priority on the agenda of the General Assembly at this session.The war in Afghanistan  which has been ongoing for more than 30 years  remains a serious source of threats to regional and global security. The situation unfolding in Afghanistan  according to experts  is generally uncertain and unpredictable overall. In these conditions  the drawdown of the International Security Assistance Force troops in 2014 may lead to an escalation of confrontation in the country  stir up terrorism  extremism and drug trafficking  and aggravate the interregional standoff. Undoubtedly  it will have a negative impact on the situation in the wider region of Central Asia and contiguous regions.It should be recognized that the world has adopted the unambiguous view that there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem. The only way out of the Afghan crisis is a political process through negotiations among the main parties involved  the achievement of consensus regardless of how difficult it might be  and active assistance provided by the international community and the United Nations.Uzbekistan adheres to an open and clear policy with respect to Afghanistan on the basis of the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the country’s internal affairs. Uzbekistan shall further develop mutually beneficial and friendly ties with Afghanistan on a bilateral basis  and support the Government elected by the Afghan people themselves. We shall also continue to render practical assistance in restoring the economy of Afghanistan  taking into account the fact that economic well-being is an indispensable condition for ensuring peace and prosperity in that country. These principles and approaches towards Afghanistan are enshrined in Uzbekistan’s foreign policy concept  which has the status of law.Secondly  today a new global development agenda is under consideration at the United Nations. It must reflect the interconnection of human beings with the environment and contribute to supporting economic and social development while maintaining ecological sustainability. Uzbekistan attaches priority to sustainable development and ecological safety. We have recently adopted an action programme on environmental protection for 2013-2017  which serves as confirmation of that priority. The Government of Uzbekistan will allocate approximately $2 billion for implementation of the programme aimed at further maintaining decent conditions in the environment  the reasonable use of natural resources  and the introduction of the ecological basics of sustainable development in the economic sectors.The loss of the Aral Sea is one of the largest global ecological catastrophes in contemporary history. Each year  it becomes more evident that the problem of the drying up of the Aral Sea and  above all  its impact on the environmental  social and humanitarian situation  gene pool and human health are assuming an increasingly baneful and irreversible nature. We are grateful to the United Nations  and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in particular  for the keen attention paid to the problem of the Aral Sea. That enormous support gives us the confidence that the countries of the region will not be left alone in the struggle against that planetary catastrophe.I would like to draw public attention today  first  to the issue of preventing the complete destruction and protecting the remaining environmental system of the Aral Sea region  ensuring minimum living conditions for the people  and preserving the existing flora and fauna. Those key issues are the focus of the message of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan  Chair of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea  and created as an official document of the General Assembly (A/67/884  annex).Secondly  we take this opportunity to call upon international donors to extend assistance in implementing the programme of measures on eliminating the consequences of the drying up of the Aral Sea and averting a catastrophe in the ecological systems in the Aral Sea region (A/68/383  annex)  which is fully consonant with the Millennium Development Goals  particularly  in achieving ecological sustainability  combating diseases and improving motherhood and childhood protections.Thirdly  ensuring the reasonable use of water resources is an acute problem leading to a worsening ecological situation and shortage of potable water in our region and on a global scale. It is an open secret that the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers  the two major transboundary rivers of Central Asia  have historically been a common good and a source of life for the nations of the region. The Aral Sea basin is supplied with water from the flow of those rivers.In that regard  we cannot but be concerned about the plans of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to construct new large hydropower stations with gigantic  global-scale dams: the Rogun hydropower station with a 350-metre-high dam upstream in the Amu Darya River  and the Kambarata-1 hydropower station  with a 275-metre-high dam upstream in the Syr Darya River. The implementation of such plans  according to many competent specialists  would lead to the disruption of the natural flow of the rivers  which is fraught with most dangerous ecological and socioeconomic consequences. The already fragile water and ecological balance in Central Asia will be radically disrupted. Moreover  the construction of these facilities is planned in areas where there is a tectonic fracture with a potential seismicity of not less than 9-10 points on the Richter scale  which carries a high risk of man-made catastrophes.Taking that into consideration  we firmly adhere to our principled position of the unacceptability of constructing hydropower facilities on international watercourses without the preliminary endorsement of all interested countries. It is necessary  in line with international legal practice  to conduct a mandatory  fair international expert examination of the Rogun and Kambarata-1 projects  under the auspices of the United Nations  to assess the possible impact of new hydropower facilities on the natural water regime  the environment  flora and fauna.Uzbekistan’s position is based on the norms of international law  in particular the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes of 1992 and the Convention on the Law of Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of 1997.The year 2015 — the deadline for implementing the Millennium Development Goals set in 2000 — is approaching. In that regard  it should be underscored that the achievements of the Republic of Uzbekistan during its years of independence in the economic sphere  social policy  addressing specific issues related to improving the well-being of the population  the quality of education  health-care services and ecological sustainability have allowed our country to ensure priority implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. I can offer figures and facts that reflect the current potential and development rates of our country.In comparison with the year 2000  the gross domestic product (GDP) of Uzbekistan grew by a factor of 3.1 and the GDP per capita by a factor of 2.6. The nominal salary grew by a factor of 22  the average amount of pensions by a factor of 12.7  and real income per capita by a factor of 8.4. During the past six years  the economic growth of Uzbekistan has steadily exceeded 8 per cent. The State expenditures for the social sphere and civil protection in Uzbekistan grew more than fivefold. About 60 per cent of all State expenditures go towards funding social development  including more than 34 per cent for education  and over 15 per cent is spent on public health care.I am confident that Uzbekistan’s continued participation in United Nations efforts in the sphere of sustainable development shall contribute to further raising the living standards of the people  achieving the high goals of ensuring security and stability in the entire region."
"182",7299,"VAT",68,2013,"At the outset  on behalf of the Holy See  I have the honour to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am also pleased to convey to the President and to other participating delegations the warmest greetings from His Holiness Pope Francis  who assures the Assembly of his kind thoughts and prayers that the session will be crowned with success.In the first days of his pontificate  Pope Francis inspired enthusiasm and hope for a new horizon based on a culture of togetherness that should form the basis of all personal  societal and international relations. That culture specifically recognizes the value of others: the individual  social groups and States. It is founded on human dignity and transcendence. It acts to reaffirm faith  which is perceived with fear in certain segments of contemporary society and wrongly accused of leading to intolerance — when in fact it promotes understanding and unity among peoples and peace.It is my hope that this session of the General Assembly will be inspired by the same spirit of universal solidarity that was demonstrated during the international day for prayer convened by the Pope on 7 September  which brought together religious leaders of all faiths. May the session follow that path and inspire a new dynamism such that all nations will take action to resolve the ongoing conflicts and heal the wounds of humankind.The choice of the theme for this session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is a timely one. The process of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  including the progress made and the limitations and difficulties encountered  has demonstrated the importance of establishing common goals for all members of the international community that will bring them together  galvanize them and assess their efforts — including the United Nations and its specialized entities  regional organizations and States. In that regard  it is important that at this session the Assembly revisit the fundamental concepts that make up the heart of the United Nations  as they remain relevant to setting new goals for the post-2015 agenda.In the context of comprehensive human development  the foregoing should be guided by promoting the family  based on the union of a man and a woman and the protection of the rights of the family as the basic social nucleus and the foundation of all stable and sustainable development. Those goals should also promote a dignified life for all humankind  from the oldest to the youngest child still at home  as well as those living in the most difficult social situations or most isolated areas.As the deadline set to achieve the Millennium Development Goals approaches  it is easy to see that they have not been universally achieved. That is due  in part  to limitations and lack of clarity  including along ethical lines  and especially due to the difficulty in creating an efficient consensus on the implementation of Goal 8  in view of the resources necessary to achieve the seven others.In terms of that Goal  the decisions made following the 2008 crisis aimed to find an equitable way to manage the international financial sector and reform the international financial institutions. Nevertheless  it is regrettable to note that discussions on measures to control the global economy took place among small  limited groups of States  such as the Group of 20(G-20); they did not include the poorest or least populated States. While that was justified from a practical point of view  such an approach does not legitimize its decisions  which could have important consequences for other States Members of the United Nations that are neither direct nor indirect participants in the G-20.In order to guarantee the future implementation of common goals for the post-2015 agenda  international legal mechanisms must urgently be devised to ensure the participation of all States in drafting and implementing sweeping shared economic decisions. At the same time  it will be insufficient to create financial or business structures that are recognized as fair and equitable by all States if we do not assess the results of the goals in the long term  with the aim of guaranteeing that the lives of those in need are clearly improving.The future development goals of the post-2015 agenda should therefore identify monitoring and adjustment mechanisms to deal with economic trends and promote the elimination of hunger worldwide  the gradual disappearance of slums  universal access to drinking water and improved sanitation for all  among other things.That framework would be incomplete without considering an external development factor that is essential to the implementation of the MDGs  namely  peace. While it is true that injustice and excessive social and economic inequalities among peoples and nations represent a constant threat to peace and lead to war  it is also true that war  terrorism  organized crime and other forms of armed violence at the national and international levels represent the most significant obstacles to development. Therefore  the matter of the post-2015 development agenda should today be viewed in the context of the serious conflicts under way — first and foremost the conflict in Syria.In facing such wars and massacres  it is crucial that the international community choose the path of development  with greater determination and courage. If peace is considered the sine qua non of comprehensive human development  it is important to return to certain basic principles that the international community solemnly swore to follow nearly 70 years ago.The United Nations was created  at that time  “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and “to ensure  by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods  that armed force shall not be used  save in the common interest”. The right to wage war  which authorized the political and autonomous use of military force  was replaced by providing the Security Council with the power to authorize the use of force which  under the Charter of the United Nations  includes only one exception  namely  legitimate self-defence  the conditions and limitations of which are described in Article 51 of the Charter.In that context  it is possible to consider that following the tragedies of the First World War and the Second World War  States created an international set of norms that provide legal instruments that establish the law based on the highest sense of justice. Indeed  international law is no longer synonymous with the laws of the international community  that is  laws based on the traditions and customs of various States. Based on the Charter of the United Nations  States sought to reaffirm that international law was a legal system whose fundamental objective  even if it is not the only one  was to control the use of violence between States  and in which the limitation of the use of force to cases and under the conditions stipulated in the Charter itself represents a fundamental constitutional norm. Therefore  the limitation of the use of force is the primary and essential principle in terms of the ultimate goal of any legal system aimed at the protection of individuals and their fundamental rights.It is tragic that today  in spite of the valuable United Nations legal principles  the implementation mechanisms and procedures have not managed to prevent serious civil and regional conflicts or protect people. The African continent has many real or potential situations of conflict  with dozens of armed groups that sow death and suffering throughout the population. In that regard  I would particularly like to refer to the situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic.The Middle East continues to be a subject of great concern  and in some countries of the American continent drug trafficking has reached the level where traffickers can wage war against States. There are also significant hotbeds of tension in many regions of Asia. In many of those conflicts  there have been or are still United Nations peacekeeping operations working in coordination with regional organizations. In that regard  a tradition of great merit has been established  which dates back to the origins of the Organization itself. However  history has also shown that  when the necessary means are insufficient or the prevailing national and international interests weigh too heavily  United Nations intervention cannot be realized or  if it is undertaken  has only limited success.Despite those difficulties  the whole experience of peacekeeping and peacebuilding developed by the United Nations should be seen as positive  including those operations that have had weak immediate results  because it is itself a concrete expression of the two key principles of natural law  namely  the rights intrinsically linked to human dignity. The first requires that we do everything reasonably possible to avoid war  given the evils and injustice that war leads to; and the second affirms the permanent validity of moral law during armed conflict. In that regard  acts deliberately contrary to individual’s rights and those universal principles are crimes  which in the most serious cases can be described as crimes against humanity.It is clear that  in the lives of people  armed conflicts have led to deep divisions and serious harm that require many years to heal. Today the example of greatest concern to the entire world is the serious conflict that has developed in Syria  which has already led to 110 000 dead  4 million internally displaced persons and more than 2 million refugees in neighbouring countries  including in Lebanon and Jordan. It risks becoming an international conflict at any moment. In addition to the terrible loss of life  the conflict is destroying some of the richest heritage of history  culture and human coexistence  strongly linked to the three monotheistic religions and the whole European culture heritage. In recalling the long history during which  together  the different parts of society built that heritage and sewed the fabric of human relationships  I would like to note the deep concern of the Holy See for the fate of the Christian communities and other minorities  who should not be forced in any way into exile  but rather should be given a leading role in the future configuration of their country  given their contribution to the common good.The most recent report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry  established by the Human Rights Council  demonstrates that massacres and other serious violations of human rights have been committed by the parties to the conflict. The same experts vehemently affirmed that there was no possible military solution. In that context  the Holy See would like to reaffirm that any action that might aggravate or even extend the conflict and increase the unspeakable suffering of innocent people should be avoided.In his recent letter to the Group of 20 leaders meeting in Saint Petersburg  the Holy Father  recalling the responsibility of the international community with regard to Syria  described as regrettable the fact that too many partisan interests had prevailed since the Syrian conflict began and had prevented the finding of a solution to the pointless massacre we are witnessing. In recalling his words  I would like to urge the leaders of States not to remain indifferent in the face of the tragedies that have been afflicting the Syrian people for far too long. To each and every one of the leaders  in repeating the Pope’s words  I would like to make a heartfelt appeal that they find ways to overcome their differences and give up any useless attempt at a military solution. On the contrary  there should be a new commitment to seek  with courage and determination  a peaceful solution through dialogue and negotiation between the interested parties with the firm support of the international community. Moreover  all the Governments of the world have the moral duty to give priority to any initiative that would promote the provision of humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering on account of the conflict within and outside the country.We would also note that  during the Syrian crisis  the bodies and agencies of the United Nations system have sought to deploy all available means to protect civilians. Member States have  for far too long  shown a lack of the courage needed to give priority to the international resolution of the conflict. The Secretary-General recently spoke of the collective failure of the international community’s ability to prevent and avoid the atrocities committed in Syria. Along those lines  I would like to recall the concept of the responsibility to protect  which the Secretary-General also referred to  and I would also like to underscore the importance of that responsibility for the Holy See. The adoption of a political and legal concept of the responsibility to protect during the 2005 World Summit  held from 14 to 16 September 2005  was a great step forward by the international community. Unfortunately  the responsibility to protect has sometimes been erroneously understood to be a justification for the use of arms  but in reality it means something quite different. It is a profound and urgent spirit of solidarity that calls upon everyone  starting with heads of State  to understand their responsibilities with regard to serious humanitarian crises wherever they occur and to commit to ensuring that all emergency measures are put in place — diplomatic and economic measures and those related to public opinion  as well as the mechanisms stipulated by the Charter of the United Nations — to arrive at an effective solution. To provide continuity to the ongoing debate on the responsibility to protect  it would be a good idea to consider ways to explicitly include that concept in the mandate of the Security Council  under Article 24 of the Charter  and possibly under Article 39.In that context  the Syrian tragedy is both a challenge and an opportunity for the United Nations to breathe new life into all its bodies  mechanisms and procedures in a specific  creative and positive manner. In that regard  we must welcome the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2118 (2013)  on 27 September. My delegation hopes that the agreement that was reached on that document will provide a definite impetus to the Geneva process  so as to make it finally possible to restore stability and bring about reconciliation in the country.A peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Syria would set a significant precedent for the upcoming century and would indicate the path to be taken in addressing other conflicts that the international community has not yet been able to resolve. It would greatly facilitate the inclusion of the principle of the responsibility to protect in the Charter of the United Nations. And  more generally from the point of view of economic and social development  it would be the most clear demonstration of the will to undertake  with honesty and effectiveness  a path of sustainable development post-2015.Pope Francis  through his prophetic words and actions on 7 September  launched a huge global movement of prayer for peace  the results of which were immediately clear in the public’s spontaneous and sincere support for that goal. The scope of that effort went beyond differences of religion  culture  nationality or geographical origin  and exerted a strong influence on world leaders. Accompanying the Holy Father and under his leadership  the competent authorities of the Holy See also took diplomatic action aimed at stopping the violence and promoting dialogue between the parties involved in the conflict  thereby putting into practice one of the main goals of their international presence. Along with the Pope and in line with the theme for this session  we would like to reiterate here at the general debate that war is the specific refusal to commit to the achievement of the major social and economic goals that the international community has set for itself. Indeed  there can be no economic development without peace. Armed conflict never leads to peace  which is crucial for that development.The Holy See believes  in line with the theological and ethical teaching of the Catholic Church  that because of the evils and injustices that any war entails  we must do everything possible to avoid it. This is also why the Church strongly urges everyone to pray and act so that divine goodness frees us from the ancient bondage of war.My delegation  recalling those ethical principles that inspire and animate the international activity of the Holy See  has no ambition other than to make a contribution of a moral nature to this session of the General Assembly  while at the same time expressing its recognition for the work done by various bodies and United Nations agencies to relieve the suffering caused by the Syrian crisis and other conflict situations. We encourage them to continue their humanitarian work.My delegation also strongly appeals to all Member States to exercise responsibility. Peace will come about  and the objectives of comprehensive human development for each inhabitant of the Earth  especially for the weakest and those who have no voice or representation  will be achieved if  and only if  every State is capable of fully assuming its own responsibilities for the common good of all."
"183",7334,"VCT",68,2013,"For the second time in my tenure as Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I have the pleasure and honour to welcome a distinguished son of our Caribbean civilization to the presidency of the General Assembly. Even as we thank your immediate predecessor for his service as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  we look forward to your tenure  President Ashe  with boundless pride and unbridled optimism.Mr. President  for this year’s general debate  you have chosen the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. This is also the year in which you will lay the groundwork for the United Nations International Conference on Small Island Developing States  which will take place in Samoa next September. Your dual focus on the international development agenda and the peculiarities of small island States make this sixty-eighth session one of the most important in my country’s 33 years of membership in the United Nations.Let me first say that the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are deeply pained at the horrendous acts of terrorism recently committed in Kenya. I reaffirm yet again our solidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya.William Shakespeare cautioned that what is past  is prologue. Similarly  Mr. President  your invitation to consider the future of the international development agenda requires us to first consider the ways in which our recent and long-ago steps and missteps shape our future developmental challenges and opportunities.I begin with an unfortunate  inconvenient truth: our collective failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is largely rooted not in the shortcomings of earnest and hardworking developing countries  but in developed countries’ abject abandonment of Goal 8  “Develop a global partnership for development”. The Organization’s own MDG Gap Task Force noted in its report entitled “The Global Partnership for Development: The Challenge We Face” that the quest for such a global partnership experienced significant backsliding in 2013 and that “the political momentum for advancing international development cooperation seems to have waned”.Sixteen of 25 developed countries decreased their aid budgets last year  and official development assistance (ODA) contracted for the second consecutive year  the first such contraction since the creation of the MDGs. In a time of crisis  when assistance is most needed  ODA is itself in a deep and prolonged recession. The twists and turns by so many developed countries on this issue have been most disappointing. Without predictable flows of meaningful  non-discretionary assistance  the post-2015 development programme will remain  substantially  a fleeting illusion to be pursued but rarely  if ever  attained.At the same time  I applaud the efforts of those developed nations that take their ODA commitments seriously. I hail  too  a raft of other countries that are in a genuine developmental and functional partnership with us. These include Trinidad and Tobago  Cuba  Venezuela and Taiwan. Indeed  Taiwan  a country not washed by our Caribbean Sea  has been remarkable in its principled and practical conduct of intergovernmental relations. Surely the time has now come for this exemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be permitted to participate fully in the work of the various agencies of this world body.Our debate on the future developmental agenda of the international community is taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing global economic and financial crisis. The global economy remains precariously poised  and for every nation that seems to have turned the corner  another plunges back into recession. The impact of the crisis on development has been palpable and has rendered the MDGs unattainable in many countries. Therefore  if we are to discuss the post-2015 development agenda  we must also discuss the reform agenda of our outmoded international financial architecture  whose failings contributed to the current crisis  and whose continued stasis is a reckless invitation to future economic turmoil.Despite the challenges of the ongoing exogenous shocks  including natural disasters  and the encumbrances imposed by an insufficiently flexible international financial architecture  my country continues to make significant strides in our people-centred approach to development and poverty alleviation. This past June  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was one of 18 countries recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for having achieved the part of Millennium Development Goal 1 on halving the proportion of hungry people by 2015 — and we have reduced it to below 5 per cent — and the more stringent World Food Summit goal of halving the absolute number of hungry people by 2015.For a small  vulnerable country to achieve this task ahead of schedule and in the midst of this debilitating global economic and financial crisis is truly outstanding. We have done so while maintaining and advancing good governance  individual liberties and democracy in accordance with global best practices.But the ambitions of my Government are far greater than Goal 1 of the MDGs. Having more than halved hunger  we have now set our sights on the elimination of hunger altogether: to achieve zero hunger. We hope that the United Nations and the international community can partner with us effectively in fulfilling that historic ambition. Our policy goal of ensuring that no man  woman or child goes to bed hungry will have its own positive knock-on effects on poverty reduction  health and arresting the spread of chronic non-communicable diseases — which itself should also be of central importance to our post-2015 development agenda.As the Assembly is well aware  the roots of underdevelopment and exploitation extend much deeper than the recent abandonment of MDG Goal 8 by the bulk of developed countries. I arrived at this year’s general debate from the Caribbean’s first-ever regional conference on reparations for native genocide and slavery  which was held in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. That stirring and uplifting regional conference was the first step in the Caribbean’s quest to address and redress a psychic  historical  socioeconomic and developmental wound that is  for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  14 nations wide and 400 years deep.The genocidal oppression and suffering of my country’s indigenous Callinago  the Garifuna and enchained Africans have been rightly adjudged to have been a horrendous crime against humanity. Accordingly  the collective voice of our Caribbean civilization ought justly to ring out for reparations for native genocide and African slavery from the successor States of the European countries that committed organized State-sponsored native genocide and African enslavement. The awful legacy of those crimes against humanity — a legacy that exists today in the Caribbean — ought to be repaired for the developmental benefit of our Caribbean societies and all our peoples. The historic wrongs of native genocide and African slavery and their continuing contemporary consequences must be righted and repaired  in the interests of our people’s humanity. European nations must partner in a focused  special way with us to execute that repairing. The demand for reparations is therefore the responsibility not only of the descendants  in today’s Caribbean  of the Callinago  the Garifuna  the Amerindian and the African. It is undoubtedly an agenda for all of us to advance  promote  concretize and execute. The European nations that engaged in conquest  settlement  genocide and slavery in our Caribbean must provide the resources required to repair the contemporary legacy of those historic wrongs. That is undoubtedly a special pillar in the post-2015 development agenda.That repairing of the mind  of collective memory  of our economies and of our societies is part and parcel of the rebirth  the redemption and the further ennoblement of our Caribbean  our indigenous populations  our African descendants and  indeed  of Africa. I say to the Assembly that the struggle for reparations represents  immediately  a defining issue for our Caribbean in the twenty-first century. It promises to make both Europe and the Caribbean more free  more human and more good-neighbourly. CARICOM recently decided  quite rightly  to place the quest for reparations at the centre of its development agenda.I am also compelled to speak today on a contemporary injustice that is entirely within the capacity of the Assembly to address. In 2010  negligent  or even reckless  United Nations peacekeepers contaminated a Haitian drinking water supply  which led to an outbreak of cholera that killed 8 000 innocent Haitians and infected 600 000 others. There is no longer any scientific dispute that the United Nations is responsible for the outbreak  as has been conclusively established in the relevant reports. Prior to the United Nations negligence  Haiti had not seen a single case of cholera in 150 years. There are more cholera-infected persons in Haiti today than in the rest of the world.I continue to be deeply disturbed by the callous disregard of the United Nations of the suffering it has wrought in a fellow CARICOM country  and by the shameful and legalistic avoidance of what is a clear moral responsibility on the part of the United Nations. Accordingly  I call on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to acknowledge unambiguously  and apologize for  the Organization’s role in that tragedy and to take immediate steps to compensate the victims and their families. Anything less will further undermine the moral authority and credibility of this institution.Sixty-eight years ago  our predecessors conceived of a grand experiment  a commitment to bind the world together in a collective quest for peace  justice and development. Over time  we have established a body of rules  laws and expectations that add flesh to the principles that undergird the Charter of the United Nations. Now  we are engaged — explicitly and indirectly  willingly and reluctantly — in a reassessment of that grand commitment. Today  the actions of a small subset of powerful nations shake the very foundations upon which the Assembly was built and threaten to bring the temple down upon the heads of those of us who still subscribe to the original tenets of our institution.Properly conceived and universally adhered to  international law is the bulwark against impunity  unilateralism  and Great Power triumphalism. Today  there are those in the Assembly who hold a curious view of international law  as something that must be imposed against others but which has limited applicability to themselves. To some in the Assembly it seems appropriate to disregard international law in the very enforcement of their distorted view of international law. Clearly  such conduct is unacceptable  for the simple reason that it threatens the continued legitimacy of our entire multilateral system.Small  vulnerable States  by definition and necessity  are those most reliant upon an enforceable body of equitable international law within an effective system of multilateral diplomacy. It is no surprise  therefore  that small States like my own have emerged as some of the strongest defenders of multilateralism  sovereignty  diplomacy and the rule of law. We view it as our responsibility to sound the alarm when this institution threatens to depart from the founding principles that bind us together.According to basic reason and historical experience  no nation is intrinsically superior to another and no people are innately better than nothers. To be sure  there are cultural and social differences  but being different does not imply a condition of being better or worse. One nation may be more powerful than another  but that circumstance should never permit the powerful to ascribe arrogantly to themselves  in laughable vanity  the doctrine of exceptionalism. Inevitably  that vain ascription swiftly degenerates into an embrace of the damning path of the rightness of unilateral force  rather than an uplifting multilateral force of rightness.Flagrant examples of a continuing disregard for international law abound. Surely  it diminishes a great nation such as the United States of America to continue with what I consider to be a myopic vendetta against Cuba by way of an illegal  outdated and hurtful economic blockade and the absurd declaration that Cuba is a sponsor of terrorism. All right-thinking persons across the world justly demand that the United States end the economic blockade against Cuba and remove its name from the unilaterally drawn up list of States that allegedly sponsor terrorism. It makes no sense whatsoever for international law to become a prisoner of domestic politics and the vain glories of a Great Power. Similarly  the plight of the Palestinian people is being sacrificed on the altar of political expediency  with a disregard for the opinions of almost all of humankind. The issue certainly entails enormous complexities but  unless it is resolved satisfactorily  sustainable peace in the Middle East will remain unattainable. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines hopes that current moves towards serious negotiations will bear fruit in line with the principles and mandates that have been spelled out repeatedly in various United Nations resolutions.At the same time  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is very impressed by the efforts of the President of the United States to embrace diplomacy rather than military intervention in pursuit of a political settlement in Syria. The Syrian community in my country  rightly and anxiously  looks forward to peace in its troubled homeland. Only the extremists will benefit from a prolonged civil war. Still  peace cannot be sought reasonably when a precondition of regime change is advanced. All sides in the conflict must make real compromises in the interests of the Syrian people as a whole.There is one emerging issue of consequence that needs to be addressed. It concerns the deeply disturbing recent reports of the widespread and unrestrained spying that has allegedly been conducted by the United States of America against a number of countries  including its staunchest allies. Indeed  there are reports that the practice of such electronic espionage is rife  even within the halls and offices of the United Nations. We strongly reject such activity as illegal  a violation of diplomatic conventions and an affront to the comity of nations. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believes the agenda for appropriate corrective action in that regard  as outlined earlier this week by the President of Brazil  to be fair  reasonable and achievable by the international community.As we continue our collective journey in the quest for greater and lasting global peace  we are reminded that wars do not erupt only between countries  but also within them. We also know that some of the highest numbers of violent deaths occur in countries that are apparently at peace. This year  the international community has recognized that genuine and lasting peace between and within nations  cities and villages cannot occur in an environment that allows an unregulated trade in small arms and light weapons. The Arms Trade Treaty  which Saint Vincent and the Grenadines signed on the very first day that it opened for signature  is far weaker than we would have liked. Nonetheless  we consider it to be an important first step in regulating the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons worldwide  particularly into the Caribbean region  where the tide of guns is often accompanied by torrents of narcotics as they make their way to markets in other countries.I am deeply disappointed at the international community’s endless  rudderless and seemingly vacuous negotiations on climate change. Our failure to achieve meaningful progress on this matter of existential urgency is inexcusable. Vulnerable countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are on the front line of climate change and are already bearing the brunt of the increasing fallout of global warming. Meanwhile  the major emitters and historical polluters pay callously insincere lip service to our plight. For them  combating climate change is a question of dollars and cents  not life and death. They are only too happy to see the multilateral process fail  so that they can retreat into ineffectual and painless national commitments. But those stubborn obstacles to progress must no longer be allowed to stand in the way of the survival and development of vast swaths of our planet.I applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General to convene a high-level event on climate change in the hope that such a meeting will give our meandering negotiations impetus and direction. The post-2015 development agenda will not survive global warming if it goes unchecked. It is also high time for genuine negotiations in good faith and for meaningful resources to assist in mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.In conclusion  I would like to recall that the Charter of the United Nations begins with the phrase “We the peoples of the United Nations.” It is not “We the rich peoples”  nor “We the militarily powerful peoples” nor “We the peoples of large countries”; but “We the peoples” — of the entire world  the whole membership of this institution. The United Nations does not exist to confer benefits to select groups  but to secure peace and development for all. If we are to set the stage for the future of development  that stage must be inclusive so that all nations and peoples have a significant part to play and a stake in the outcomes. Let us make ourselves worthy successors of the ennobling  humanizing vision of our venerated founding fathers and mothers. I shall be saying this ages and ages hence: two roads diverge in the woods  and I have chosen the one less travelled by  and that has made all the difference. "
"184",7381,"VEN",68,2013,"At the outset  on behalf of the people and the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros  I would like to convey to General Assembly President John Ashe our congratulations on his recent election to lead this organ of the United Nations. As is known  President Maduro Moros is not here at this session of the General Assembly because of a whole range of delays  obstacles  conditions imposed and lack of guarantees for him and members of his delegation  imposed by the Government of the United States in flagrant violation of the obligations incumbent upon it under the Headquarters Agreement. Despite that  we have come here on behalf of the people of the liberator  Simón Bolívar  to speak the truth and to ask some questions  firmly but respectfully  as we learned from our leader  Hugo Chávez Frías  who passed away in March. In that regard  on behalf of my people  I should like to express our gratitude for the heartfelt tribute paid to President Chávez Frías last March (see A/67/PV.67).How happy we would be to be here if we were really in a place where we realized the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter talks about saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war  but the truth is that various military interventions have been decided upon or have been allowed here that have engulfed countries and whole regions of the world in long wars and instability. The Security Council has been taken hostage by the hawks of war  and when they can  they justify their attacks from there; when they cannot  they simply bang on the table and still do whatever they want  which is what they are doing when they declare that there will be future bombings in the Syrian Arab Republic.The Charter also states that the purpose of the Organization is to preserve international peace and security. But let me ask: How do some members of the Security Council think we can achieve that purpose by arming and protecting terrorist groups such as Jabhat Al-Nusra and Al-Qaida  which are obscurantist forces? Many of those groups are linked to horrible acts such as the destruction of the Twin Towers in this very city. They deny the existence of anybody who thinks differently from them — whether they be Christians  Muslims or Jews — and profess special hatred and rejection of women. Why are such groups supported? Why do some members of the Security Council sponsor such terrorist groups  window-dressing them as political opposition and even allowing them to give press conferences at this venue? What would representatives of Governments with ongoing internal armed conflicts say if the violent groups they faced were to be given space and a voice here at Headquarters to justify their downfall?The Preamble of the Charter also sets out another noble goal: to promote social progress and raise the standard of living in a broader concept of freedom. In reality  however  poverty  hunger and injustice are continuing to grow and the standard of living and the standard of freedoms are falling lower and lower. That is because what is imposed on us is a model of excluding others — a neo-fascist model — a neo-liberal model.In the meantime  countries such as Venezuela have chosen the path to consolidate real democracy with a socialist system  including the people  and that has enabled us to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Yet we are constantly attacked and demonized and our political and social stability is being disrupted. That is what is happening at this very moment with the anti-democratic opposition in our country  which is being supported by media corporations in the region and from the whole world.Paragraph 4  Article 2  of the Charter of the United Nations emphatically states that “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Yet the President of the United States — and there is the additional irritant that he is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate — is threatening to bomb this or that country if it does not comply with his country’s unilateral demands  which can even include removing a Government that the United States Government does not like. Perhaps that could explain why  despite the fact that the Charter talks about the equality of large and small nations  the President of the United States said just a couple of days ago that the United States was “exceptional”. Does that mean that they are not equal with the other 192 States Member States represented here?The gap today between the noble ideals of the Charter and what is happening by act or omission here in the Organization is truly alarming. Why does nobody in the General Assembly venture to propose that sanctions be imposed for open violations of the Charter on the Government that has an illegal detention centre in the military base at Guantánamo  in occupied Cuban territory  where torture and cruel and degrading and inhuman treatment is being meted out to persons? Why does nobody discuss sanctions against the President who has admitted to illegal espionage activities against Heads of State and Government represented here? That was a point courageously made by the President of Brazil  Dilma Rousseff (see A/68/PV.5).Why do we not consider the use of unpiloted planes — so-called drones — which have taken the lives of tens of thousands of innocent victims  including children and old people  in North Africa  the Middle East and parts of Asia to be crimes against humanity? Why do we not impose sanctions against a Government that for more than 50 years has maintained an illegal and criminal economic blockade against the worthy Cuban people  and flouted decisions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the Assembly in favour of ending the embargo?Why do we not implement the resolutions adopted by the plenary so that the State of Palestine can be established as a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict? Why does the United Kingdom not agree to start negotiations with Argentina to resolve in a peaceful way demands over the Malvinas Islands? Might it perchance be because the elite of the United States and some of its allies are exceptional?We raise those questions for consideration when it comes to the future of humankind  on behalf of the people of Simón Bolívar — the people of Venezuela — who love peace  equality and freedom. Venezuela has come before the General Assembly today to condemn a kidnapping. The Organization has been kidnapped. The peace and dignity of the world are being held hostage in New York. The kidnapper has many faces. It changes names and sometimes even flags  but it continues to be the same old imperalism. Eight years ago  Commander Hugo Chávez Frías — a tireless defender of genuine peace  not the peace imposed by bombs  and of participatory democracy and a leader for unity among peoples — called here for a genuine transformation of the United Nations. Seven years ago  he said that there was a whiff of sulphur here (see A/61/PV.12). Today  alas  I have to say once again that there is still a whiff of sulphur coming from those who consider themselves exceptional.Those words are truer now than ever before. The courageous revelations of one young man offered a great service to humankind — let us call it a wake-up call. As a result  he is now being persecuted politically and cannot walk freely in the streets of Manhattan. We hope that Edward Snowden will one day be able to walk freely among a future generation of Americans who have taken back their civil rights and helped to ensure peace in the world. That young man has shown us how the privacy of every human being has been violated by the most complex and sophisticated spying system that humankind has ever been able to come up with.Thanks to those revelations this year  we have woken up to discover that George Orwell’s 1984 is now here. And what is the United Nations doing about that? Who is setting limits on so much arbitrariness and running roughshod? Those are yet more questions that find no answers from the General Assembly or the Security Council of the Organization  which is now almost 68 years old.We would like to suggest that the Secretary-General set up a body within the United Nations to ensure for every inhabitant in the world the right to privacy and the right to communicate without interception. Much has been said here calling for peace  but that has often fallen on deaf ears. Let us hope that we will all learn how important it is to listen to the calls of the people for peace  and employ that in tirelessly seeking to elevate human dignity as our guiding star.President John Kennedy spoke from this rostrum 50 years ago  the last time he would do so at the United Nations before being assassinated. How good it would be if his current successor  and many people here  were to re-read just some of what he said. Whatever differences we may have had with that historic figure  ensuring peace requires that we seek out areas of agreement such as this:“For the value of this body’s work is not dependent on the existence of emergencies — nor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victories. Peace is a daily  a weekly  a monthly process  gradually changing opinions  slowly eroding old barriers  quietly building new structures. And  however undramatic the pursuit of peace  that pursuit must go on.” (A/PV.1209  p. 5)Let us hope that the leaders of the United States and those that follow them blindly will think deeply about the meaning of what Kennedy said and realize that if they really want to be exceptional  they have to find exceptional ways of bringing about lasting peace in the world.In Latin America and the Caribbean we are showing that with exceptional decisions and actions we can build a world of peace. Unity in diversity is what we have in our regional organizations: the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America  the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  the Union of South American Nations  the Common Market of the South and Petrocaribe. All those are tools for democratizing our societies that promote socially inclusive economic development and ensure political stability. Despite various internal disputes and conflicts between fraternal countries  we have been able to find mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflict. We have demonstrated that without military intervention  drones or economic blockades  we can build and preserve genuine democracy and move forward in combating hunger  poverty and inequality.The Venezuelan nation is proud of being part of a region that is free of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirm our commitment to encouraging the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and chemical and bacteriological weapons as a way of ensuring that life can continue on planet Earth.In his various statements before the Assembly  Commander Chávez Frías called for improving the means for addressing problems and resolving conflicts in a transparent manner. He also pointed out that  in the face of today’s reality  there was a crucial need to consider whether the Headquarters of the United Nations should be here in this country where the Government does not respect the Organization  much less the sovereignty of each and every State Member. The United Nations should be in a place where there is respect for all Members; where the political will flourishes  without pressure or fear  to end conflict in the world through dialogue; where the path forward is genuine social development and the elimination of hunger and poverty; and where what matters is how to stop war  not how to justify it.Let us take the United Nations to the South  where the antithesis to exclusion — solidarity — has often taught us that we are in fact all equal. For now  we welcome the proposal of President Evo Morales Ayma that we should meet in the Organization’s various other headquarters in different parts of the world. Beyond the shadows that seem to darken the future of the human race  from Latin America and the Caribbean we are saying and showing that another world is possible where all of us can  in peace and dignity and with justice  enjoy lives worth living."
"185",7420,"VNM",68,2013,"It is a distinct honour for me to address this forum. I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am certain that under his leadership  the Assembly will successfully define the post-2015 development agenda at this session. I would also like to express my deepest respect to the Secretary-General for his significant contributions to the continuing work of the United Nations.Over the past 100 years  the miraculous advances of science and technology have changed our world profoundly  making it appear smaller. People’s lives have improved. Yet along with those accomplishments have come latent dangers. The long-standing dream shared by people across the world of living a safe  peaceful  prosperous and happy life free from hunger remains far from achieved.Humankind yearns for peace  so why is it that many regions remain under the constant threat of disputes  conflicts and wars? The global economy is growing  so how is it that billions of people still live in abject poverty? Science and technology have brought about outstanding advancement  so why have natural disasters  epidemics and pollution become increasingly severe and unpredictable? Those questions impose an enormous responsibility on all of us  as the community of nations.Throughout history  wars have destroyed many civilizations. In only the past 100 years  two world wars and many others — including that in Viet Nam — have cost millions of lives and produced devastating consequences over generations. While peace  cooperation and development are the dominant trend  the threat of war is ever present. Violence in the Middle East and North Africa is of grave concern. The latest instance in Syria  involving the use of chemical weapons  needs to be strongly condemned. We must give peace every possible chance and find solutions to eliminate chemical weapons  in accordance with international law and United Nations resolutions. Unpredictable developments in the Korean peninsula persist. Territorial disputes still rage in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Just one single incident or ill-conceived act could trigger conflict  or even war.In the East China Sea  through which over half of the world’s shipping passes  maintaining maritime security and freedom of navigation is critical  not only to the region but to the world. Viet Nam consistently pursues a policy of peaceful resolution of disputes to defend its legitimate interests and fully respect those of the global community  in accordance with international law  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea  other regional agreements  and efforts to elaborate a code of conduct.Ho Chi Minh used the words of Thomas Jefferson in Viet Nam’s Declaration of Independence:“All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. All human life is precious  irrespective of race  religion or gender. Taking a single life causes heart-breaking pain to any family  be it here in Manhattan or far away in a remote corner of the Earth. Therefore  any effort to prevent conflict must be valued and supported. Any effort to preserve peace must be fully exhausted. Any act to provoke war must be condemned and stopped. A physician must do whatever is possible to cure a patient if there is but a glimpse of life left. And we must devote all of our efforts to preserving peace if there is but a feeble sign that war can be averted  for war will take the life of not only one  but many people  including many women and children.Peace can be built and preserved only when all countries respect each other’s independence  sovereignty and cultural traditions  without imposing one’s own morality on another. Conflict and war can be averted only if we eliminate actions that run counter to the Charter of the United Nations and international law  dominance and power politics. Strategic trust among nations must be constantly nurtured with honesty  sincerity and concrete actions. In the lifting of the embargo against Cuba or the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  for example  the role of the United Nations and the Security Council should be promoted. The international community expects the major Powers to set an example for others in peacebuilding. The Security Council should be the fulcrum in building consensus for driving all nations to join hands in preserving peace. The deadly hand of war  conflict  terrorism and violence lies in wait to take the lives of hundreds  thousands or even millions of innocent people. Let us not offer war a hand or look away. Let us stop it.I share the Secretary-General’s view that the Millennium Development Goals are our most successful endeavour against hunger and poverty to date  but let us not forget that close to 40 per cent of global wealth rests in the hands of no more than 1 per cent of the world’s population. The gap between rich and poor continues to widen. Over 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty. Hundreds of millions of people  especially children  continue to be hungry and food insecure  ill and without basic medicines  and they face a grim future due to the lack of educational opportunities.At the same time  deforestation  exhaustive exploitation of natural resources  pollution and other factors have led to global warming  rising sea levels  unpredictable weather  natural disasters and new epidemics. Those grave dangers are driving poorer nations into deeper destitution.We must rally together to escape poverty  fight disease  protect the environment  respond to natural disasters and build a greener and more just world. Poor countries and peoples need to lift themselves out of poverty with the help of wealthier people and more developed countries. That help must arise not only from a sense of philanthropy — as we say in Viet Nam  whole leaves wrap torn ones — but above all from a sense of responsibility and understanding of our joint destiny. After all  poorer people and nations have contributed to the wealth of richer nations and people  and they deserve a more prosperous future.I urge the global community to craft  with a sense of responsibility and humanity  an ambitious post-2015 development agenda and to redouble our efforts to promote peace  to end hunger and poverty and to protect our planet. Together we can develop a road map of actions for poorer nations to effectively participate in international agreements and institutions and to face and overcome global challenges and dangers in the spirit of the motto adopted by Alexandre Dumas’s musketeers — “One for all and all for one”.As a Vietnamese  what I have shared with the Assembly comes from experiences soaked in sweat and blood. Just a few decades ago  the very name “Viet Nam” was synonymous with war  division  blood and tears. A remote country called Viet Nam suffered 15 million tons of bombs — four times the amount used in the Second World War. Each Vietnamese bore nearly 10 times his or her weight in bombs  not to mention our population’s suffering from over 70 million litres of the silent but deadly Agent Orange/dioxin compound.According to a traditional Vietnamese expression  benevolence triumphs over brutality and virtue drives out tyranny. With courageous sacrifice and creativity and with the support of peace-loving people  nations and international organizations  Viet Nam has defended its independence  united and rebuilt from the ashes of war  and left the past behind to become an active and responsible member of the international community.Viet Nam has integrated the Millennium Development Goals into the formulation and implementation of our development strategy  and it has balanced economic development and social security. We have received a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization award for our outstanding achievements in poverty reduction  Because we consider people the goal and centre of development  Viet Nam pays special attention to providing health care  education and the means of communication even for people in remote  underdeveloped areas and among our ethnic minorities.Viet Nam is working actively with other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations community to build it into a common house for all South-East Asian nations that were once deeply divided by war. That work vividly embodies our aspirations to a bright future of peace  cooperation and prosperity  to unity in diversity  and to the accomplishment of the Millennium Development Goals.Having survived devastating wars of aggression and extreme poverty  our aspirations to peace and prosperity burn ever more brightly. We are committed to doing more to participate in peacebuilding  poverty reduction  environmental protection and other efforts. We stand ready to join United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are willing to share our resources and experience as a tribute to the international friends who have supported us in our struggle for independence  unification and poverty reduction. Viet Nam remains and always will be a reliable partner and responsible member of the international community. In the area of food  for example  Viet Nam  a country that has traditionally suffered from hunger  has become a leading rice exporter. We have achieved national food security but consider it our responsibility to help maintain global food security. We not only export  but also help countries to become self-reliant in food production  as we have done in Cuba  Mozambique  Angola  Mali  Madagascar  Myanmar and elsewhere. We hope developed countries and international organizations will participate in supporting similar programmes as a meaningful and substantive multiparty model of cooperation.I am deeply convinced that the post-2015 development agenda will be created and finalized for a world free from war and hunger and devoted to peace and cooperation  for sustainable development and prosperity for humankind  and for our evergreen planet. Viet Nam commits itself to that purpose."
"186",7451,"VUT",68,2013,"The Republic of Vanuatu is honoured to participate in this debate under your presidency  Sir  and we wish to associate ourselves with all other delegations in congratulating you and the members of your Bureau on your election to lead us through this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.On Syria  we have seen internal conflicts transformed into international disputes that require solutions from this body. During this session  there has been intensive debate on the protracted conflict affecting the Syrian people and undermining regional and international peace. We join many other peace-loving nations to call for an end to the conflict and for the United Nations to do more strongly to enforce the international ban on the use of chemical weapons. We also urge the United States of America and the Russian Federation to take a strong leading role in the issue of Syria and in addressing the chemical-weapons issue there.We are concerned at the fact that that such conflicts have often diverted the international focus from addressing much more important issues  such as our common aspirations for the Millennium Development Goals. It is unfair that countries resorting to such illegitimate acts can trigger wars that cost a great deal of money  whereas the rest of the peace-loving countries and their peoples suffer the consequences  as the monies spent could be diverted to better and effective use.It is here  from this rostrum  that the leaders of our nations have spoken out freely  from their hearts  in an endeavour to find common solutions so as to inspire the community of nations committed to international peace and security. Our main objectives are to take collective decisions so as to address a spectrum of international issues  some of which require urgent action  such as the issue of climate change. It is here that we have called for the recognition of the rights of women  children and persons with disabilities who are caught up in conflicts and violence. It is here that we have called for help for those who have been discriminated against because of their colour  their religion or their political convictions.For the Republic of Vanuatu  this rostrum is the only international platform from which  year after year since 1981  we have spoken out against colonialism and neo-imperialism in all its forms. Today once again  I speak on behalf of the entire population of our archipelago to be the voice of those who still live in colonized territories. We know that decolonization is still incomplete. However  we have seen the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) take more and more positive steps during its 2013 sessions  recognizing the inalienable right of French Polynesia to self-determination. We also applaud the work of the Committee in continuing discussions and dialogue on the question of New Caledonia. Allow me at this juncture to thank the Government of France for its cooperation in moving the decolonization process forward. It is important to maintain this dialogue with the specific goal of helping the Kanak people to attain their independence. With the greatest possible respect  I encourage all parties to ensure that the process of achieving freedom remains on track. We in the Melanesian Spearhead Group are appreciative of the work of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front as chair of the Group.The Republic of Vanuatu has just emerged from colonialism  having achieved its political independence from the Powers of the British-French condominium 33 years ago. Based on our struggle for independence  we share the journey and the litany of heartaches and dreams of many of our brothers and sisters whose rights to political and civil freedom are still held back by the tentacles of imperialism and colonialism.I would like to reiterate today our appeal launched last year from this rostrum that the Secretariat should always remain impartial and avoid any selective implementation of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the rights of all people who desire to be free from colonialism or any form of imperialism.We can debate issues of terrorism  financial and economic crises and climate change and reach some level of understanding of the seriousness of those challenges and the measures that must be taken to address them. We can talk of good governance and the rule of law and respect for human rights. But when it comes to the issue of the rights of the people of West Papua  our voices fall silent  even from this rostrum. I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who  when he visited Asia in 2012  emphasized that the United Nations would do everything possible to ensure that human rights are respected in West Papua  saying “whether you are an independent State or a non-self-governing territory or whatever  [that] human right is inalienable and a fundamental principle of the United Nations”. Now  as Members of the United Nations  we must call for those words to be translated into action. My Government calls upon the United Nations to appoint a special representative to investigate alleged human rights violations in West Papua and its political status in the light of the controversies surrounding the administration established in the 1960s  the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority. Ever since the controversial Act of Free Choice  the West Papuans have always been consistently denied any sort of recognition by the United Nations. It is clear from many historical records that the Melanesian people of West Papua were the scapegoats of Cold War politics and were sacrificed to gratify the appetite for the natural resources that the country possesses. Today  they are still victims of the ignorance of the United Nations.If the United Nations representative at the time  Mr. Fernando Ortiz-Sanz  described the West Papuan issue as a cancer growing on the side of the United Nations and that it was his job to remove it  it is very clear today from what we have observed that that cancer has never been removed  but merely concealed. One day it will have to be treated. We must not be afraid. The United Nations has made mistakes in the past. We must admit our mistakes and see that we are the stronger for that  because when we are weak  admit our mistakes and take corrective action  we become stronger and more alive. As Members of the United Nations  we all subscribe to the principles of democracy  good governance  human rights  accountability and the rule of law enshrined in the United Nations Charter. In this age of technology  when nothing can escape the attention of civil society and Governments  I ask how then can we ignore the hundreds of thousands of West Papuans who have been brutally beaten and murdered?The people of West Papua are looking to the United Nations as a beacon of hope. We are now deliberating on the issue of Syria. In that same spirit  I would ask that my fellow leaders express support for West Papua. It is time for the United Nations to move beyond its limits and take action to rectify the errors of the past. Since our independence 33 years ago  the indigenous peoples of my country have remained concerned that a part of our maritime and cultural jurisdiction  including the islands of Umaepnune and Leka  situated south of Vanuatu  are still occupied by France. Thus  the people of our country are denied the right to the exercise of full political freedom and their inherent cultural rights. The indigenous peoples of the southern province of our country cannot  therefore  fulfil their obligations to protect their culture and traditions that bind them to the sovereign land that has been theirs since time immemorial.Those two islands are of paramount importance  because they form the basis for the establishment of our unique cultural framework  which brings together our cultural island group known as the Tafea Islands. It is that cultural framework that governed us and defined our identity and our way of life long before administrative colonial Powers began to explore and govern our shores. Unfortunately  today  our indigenous peoples continue to be denied access to those sacred and cultural islands. My Government therefore calls on the community of nations meeting in the Assembly to uphold the principles of the respect of the rights of our indigenous peoples and their way of life. Further  we call upon the French Government to allow our indigenous people of Tafea to have access to the land of their forefathers  the islands Umaenupne and Leka in the south of the Republic of Vanuatu. The call by the United Nations to review the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to strategize a post-2015 development agenda compels us to rethink our global partnership structures and our national priorities in order to better achieve our goals in the period after 2015. My country has made some progress in achieving some of the MDG targets. However  the appropriate conditions for economic growth and development must be created. An integrated and balanced approach is required to deal adequately with the social  economic and environmental dimensions. To that end  my Government has placed emphasis on climate change  renewable energy and the sustainable use of the environment. We have now created a separate Ministry focusing on adaptation to climate change  energy and the environment so that the Government can address issues in that area. We would therefore welcome opportunities for unconditional partnerships in order to better address those issues. It is clear that there has been much debate on the issue of climate change. However  the level to which final pledges have been met has been unsatisfactory  considering the fast pace at which climate change is having an impact on small island developing States. We call for more urgent action and decisions on that front.While Vanuatu supports the shift in the development paradigm  we also recognize that the new development agenda might harbour its own shortcomings and must therefore be given careful consideration when it comes to its final design. It is evident that the new approach must take heed of  first  the complexity that still exists within international aid programmes for development  coupled with the risk of unpredictable financial crises that can affect the delivery of aid; secondly  the challenges faced by countries at present in attaining the MDGs; thirdly  the ambiguities and difficulties involved in setting the priority of goals within an expanded list of priorities; fourthly  the imminent graduation of my country from least developed country status and the benefits accompanying that change; and fifthly  the risk of a reduced level of real aid spending per capita affected partly by a failure to increase global aid for development.Aware of those issues  Vanuatu has taken measures  partly on its own and with the assistance of its partners  to ensure greater resilience to its own vulnerabilities. Our plan involves taking decisions that lead to quantum leaps in the development of our country’s infrastructure in which ports  roads and airports will be built and upgraded to facilitate  inter alia  the large-scale integration of the rural population into the national economy. I would like to thank the Governments of China  Australia and New Zealand and the Asian Development Bank for their assistance  as well as the Government of the United States for its enormous investment in the two major national highways in Vanuatu. We see that as an investment in the future of my country  where 60 per cent of the population is aged 25 years or under  whereby most of the rural population will gain greater access to markets and economic opportunities throughout the archipelago’s islands.All our development initiatives must be inclusive and not ignore the poor and the marginalized. My country has taken the measures necessary to ensure gender equality and the empowerment of women. The Government’s measures include legislation amending laws on sexual discrimination  addressing issues of domestic violence and the submission of universal periodic reports to ensure compliance with the reporting framework of the Human Rights Council. In conclusion  I wish to thank you once again  Mr. President  for giving me the opportunity to express my views in this forum. We have spoken a great deal about many things  and we now must translate our words into action. Long live our aspirations for a better and more secure world for everyone!"
"187",7483,"WSM",68,2013,"I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also wish also to thank you for your continued strong support for small island developing States (SIDS) issues  which you have championed for many years and have once again demonstrated  this week  in the process and lead-up to the United Nations Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to be held in the Pacific next year.From economic woes to outright poverty  from social instability to acts of violence and ethnic or religious conflict  and from the devastation of natural disasters to deadly acts of terrorism  no country is spared or completely shielded. The events in Kenya  Iraq  Pakistan and here in the United States over the past week demonstrate the multiple risks we face in today’s world. Our sympathies go to the Governments and people of those countries  and our deepest condolences to the people who lost family and friends in those tragic events.While the Organization continues to grapple with various serious problems that require collective  United Nations-led action for their resolution  perhaps the greatest threat we face today is climate change. Climate change is a security risk of far greater proportions than many people are prepared to admit. For some low-lying Pacific island countries  climate change may well lead to their eventual extinction as sovereign States. The singular importance and urgency of climate change to our region was given added prominence today when Pacific Forum leaders met with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Our Chair  the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  presented to the Secretary-General the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership  which is an effort by our region — the most likely to be first and worst affected by climate change — to launch a new wave of more determined leadership across the globe  aimed at accelerating the reduction and phasing down of the world’s greenhouse-gas pollution before it is too late.The root causes of climate change and the means for addressing them are widely known. We in the Pacific know already from bitter and harsh experience  as will many other parts of the world  what the consequences of climate change are  and they will only become more severe if not enough is done. Sadly  what is evident to us in the climate change negotiations is the continued triumph of vested interests in preventing and delaying the action that should be taken. In a diverse world of different capacities and capabilities  those least able to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change look to Member States in leadership roles to rise to the challenge and lead by example  to ensure that the post-2020 climate change convention currently being negotiated will effectively address the mounting fears of countries like mine of the catastrophic effects of climate change if it is not tackled collectively and with determination. As world leaders  we have the responsibility for fashioning a new agreement that will reassure low-lying islands that we have their interests and priorities at heart. Let us rise to the occasion and be part of the solution.In June  during the historic event of the signing of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)  Samoa announced that it would sign the Treaty at the highest political level during the Treaty event at the General Assembly’s current session. We kept that promise  and I signed for Samoa in a special ceremony two days ago. We welcome the fact that more than 100 nations  including the United States  have now signed the Treaty. For small island countries like Samoa  it takes only a few small arms and light weapons in the wrong hands to cause instability. Indeed  within our own Pacific region  such so-called small arms have fuelled conflicts  disrupted the lives of communities and impeded countries’ development. The Arms Trade Treaty  when fully implemented  will greatly help small island States like mine in their efforts to sustain our communities’ security and stability. Our signing of the ATT is also further testimony to our firm commitment to general and complete disarmament  since it will contribute significantly to saving lives  stopping human rights abuses and avoiding crises  and is an important step in reducing and eventually eliminating altogether the human cost of conventional arms.Samoa remains fully committed to the peacekeeping work of the United Nations  one of the Organization’s most effective and successful mandates. For more than 10 years  Samoa has been contributing civilian police officers to peacekeeping operations in countries such as South Sudan  Timor-Leste  Liberia  the Sudan and  in the Pacific  the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We will be in a better position to increase our contribution to peacekeeping missions after a United Nations selection  assistance and assessment team has completed its evaluation  which is planned to take place before the end of 2013  of eligible officers from our police force.Samoa looks forward to next week’s High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. International migration poses both challenges and opportunities for countries of origin  transit and destination. Its contribution to sustainable development will therefore ultimately depend upon the willingness of source and destination countries to work out imaginative and humane arrangements that benefit both those countries and migrants. Samoa is working closely with New Zealand and Australia  through their seasonal-worker schemes  to ensure that those important initiatives result in mutual benefit for both the sending and receiving parties in the arrangements.Yesterday’s High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament (A/68/PV.11) highlighted yet again the urgent need for a treaty banning nuclear weapons  given the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of such weapons. Such weapons represent the great paradox of our time. While nations desire peace and talk of peace  far more of the national wealth goes towards the development and acquisition of ever more sophisticated and destructive weapons of mass destruction. Our Pacific region was the scene of a great deal of nuclear testing  with some islands still bearing the scars of those tests. Our regional response was the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty  the Rarotonga Treaty  to ensure that nuclear testing in the Pacific would be a thing of the past.Samoa reaffirms its continued support for a nuclear-test-free world. Early agreement must be reached to ban nuclear testing and to cease the creation and manufacture of more nuclear weapons.We place great faith in the rule of law and the vital protection it offers to all States  especially to weak and small countries such as mine  with no armed force and not affiliated with any military grouping. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is an important part of the architecture of world peace based on the rule of law  and we are pleased to have been the second State party to ratify the two Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute last year. With the deposit yesterday of the ninth instrument of ratification  we hope that the Kampala amendments will come into force soon and that the ICC will become the first court since the international military tribunals in Nuremburg and Tokyo to hold individuals responsible for crimes of aggression.The United Nations needs to adapt to the changing contemporary international environment or risk being bypassed in favour of institutions and groupings that are more responsive to the needs of Member States. The High-level Political Forum is one such welcome reform  and Samoa is very pleased to have participated in its inaugural meeting this week.Still more fundamental reform is required to address the existing imbalances in the current power structure of the Security Council through the enlargement of both categories of membership and improvements to its working methods  so as to reflect the realities of the present time and to enhance the Council’s role and effectiveness.The renewed efforts made and great courage shown in the process of restarting the stalled Middle East peace plan for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples has our strongest endorsement. It gives rise to hope that the two-State solution  which is the only option with realistic prospects for lasting peace  can still be achieved.The number of areas of tension and trouble spots around the globe is increasing  and they are getting deadlier. The availability of weapons of mass destruction and  now  their use in Syria is unnerving. The untold suffering brought about by the Syrian crisis has touched many hearts  and the latest episode  where we watched in utter disbelief the use of chemical weapons to kill indiscriminately defenceless victims and even children  is incomprehensible.We therefore welcome the joint proposal by the United States and Russia and the willingness of Syria to have its chemical weapons destroyed under the competent United Nations authority. We expect total compliance  which is required for this initiative to succeed. As long as weapons of mass destruction such as chemical weapons continue to exist  some megalomaniac will sooner or later resort to their use  with deadly consequences for the world. The ultimate safeguard is  of course  the destruction of all such weapons  whether chemical  biological or nuclear.The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development called for the convening in 2014 of a Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States  to remind the international community that small island developing States (SIDS) face unique challenges and vulnerabilities requiring dedicated support and to help build their resilience.Samoa is honoured to host that Conference in September 2014  on behalf of the Pacific small island developing countries. The Barbados interregional meeting endorsed “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships” as the overarching theme of the Conference. A renewed global partnership will help SIDS to manage a multitude of risks  so that they can pursue inclusive economic growth  social development and environmental sustainability.Samoa has also proposed to utilize the Conference as a platform to launch specific  concrete SIDS partnerships as the most effective means to implement some of the group’s challenges and as a legacy of the Conference.In advancing the SIDS development agenda  the Samoa Conference strategically provides a window for SIDS as a group to agree on their priorities and to consolidate their positions ahead of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s leaders’ summit on climate change in 2014  the post-2015 United Nations development agenda now under discussion  and the negotiations for a successor climate-change treaty post-2020  which are in progress.Let me conclude by conveying our gratitude to all our partners — developed and developing  big and small  Governments and non-governmental organizations  civil society and the private sector — for their dedicated support  which has helped my country to reach a new threshold in its journey as a State Member of the United Nations. Our new status as a non-least developed country beyond January 2014 can be sustained only with the support of Samoa’s truly genuine and durable partners."
"188",7529,"YEM",68,2013,"Allow me  at the outset to extend sincere my congratulations to Ambassador John Ashe  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are confident that he will ably guide the work of the Assembly during this session. I also extend my thanks and gratitude to Mr. Vuk Jeremi.  President of the Assembly at the previous session  for his efforts. We wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise leadership of the Organization and for his interest in the developments taking place in the world and in my country. It is a felicitous coincidence that the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly coincides with the celebrations in my country in honour of the September and October revolutions. Allow me  from this important international rostrum  to congratulate the great and valiant people of Yemen on this important occasion and to commend the country and people of Yemen for their resilience and their sacrifices in emancipating themselves from the yoke of colonization  injustice  oppression and despotism. I also wish to congratulate the people of Yemen for wisely and patiently forging ahead on the path of change and modernization for more than 50 years and for their determination to rid themselves of all the remnants of the past. I commend them on their stewardship of the historic political change  chief among them the implementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative  with the support of international and regional communities. From this rostrum  I wish to commend my country’s youth for its leadership throughout the transition process in building institutions  enhancing and promoting freedom and democracy  and building a new Yemen where justice  liberty and good governance prevail. The values of justice  freedom and equality  respect for human rights and the maintenance of international peace and security are the main pillars and principles on which the United Nations was established. Because of our firm belief in those values and principles  we have always sought to implement and promote United Nations instruments and to support peaceful coexistence among nations. Perhaps the lofty and noble purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and all its instruments served as inspiration in the political settlement and the comprehensive national dialogue that we have been pursuing for more than six months.Those purposes and principles are also reflected in two aspects of the current situation. First is our desire for coexistence and consensus  our rejection of violence and our preference for the language of dialogue and logic and reason. The second aspect is the fact that Yemen is considered a unique model that should be followed  given the tremendous change being witnessed in our region. The acute crisis that befell Yemen in 2011 reflected internal understanding and tolerance and a desire for coordination with regional and international partners. In that context  we wish to reiterate our thanks and appreciation to all those who stood by the people of Yemen and by the political settlement embodied in the Gulf initiative  chief among them the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud; the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the GCC Secretary General  Mr. Abdul Latif bin Rashid Al Zayani. I also extend my thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to Security Council members for visiting Yemen on two occasions. As my country is a unique model among the countries in which the Arab Spring is unfolding  those visits have enhanced the new approach  which is based on the GCC initiative and Security Council resolutions on Yemen. We thank the five permanent members of the Security Council for their unified vision with regard to Yemen  which made it possible for us to forge ahead with the political process and crown it with success. We also extend our appreciation to the League of Arab States  the European Union  Germany and all the relevant international organizations and institutions  as well as to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen  Mr. Jamal Benomar  for his efforts to achieve reconciliation between the parties in Yemen. As the Assembly is aware  my country has made great strides in the implementation of the GCC initiative and its mechanisms. We are now turning to the second phase  that of concluding the work of the comprehensive National Dialogue and forging ahead with our plan to shape our future. The results of this endeavour will lay the foundations for the establishment of a new  modern Yemen where democracy  the peaceful transfer of power  the promotion of freedom  justice  partnership  equality and equal opportunities for all citizens prevail. Those foundations will enhance the authority of the State  the rule of law  security  stability and the unity of Yemen. We are also forging ahead with strengthening security and stability in our country and restructuring the military and security institutions  so as to bolster their main national task — to be loyal to the State rather than to parties or individuals. We are certain that our brethren and our friends will assist us in our new endeavour  namely  the drafting of the new constitution and the holding of a referendum on it  as well as in our preparations for the next presidential and parliamentary elections. The achievements being made and that will be made  in the ongoing political process depend heavily on the support of the international community and on enhanced partnership and cooperation between the international community and Yemen  especially as there are internal and external parties that continue to attack the will of the Yemeni people. Those parties are making every effort to obstruct the achievement of political settlements and to target all the factors of stability and the foundations of development in my country. Such acts require the appropriate international measures so as to deter and punish all those who are trying to defeat this unique model in the region. There are a multitude of factors at play  particularly the increasing unemployment rate  growing levels of poverty  and poor social services in general. All those factors exacerbate instability and create a fertile environment for the actions of extremist groups such as Al-Qaida. However  eliminating them effectively requires all kinds of logistical  financial and technical support through practical programmes and plans that do address not only the symptoms  but also the root causes of those phenomena. We need the international community’s support in implementing our national counter-terrorism strategy. That is why the fulfilment of pledges by donor countries and the Friends of Yemen must be accelerated  particularly since the Government of Yemen has been working in partnership with donors to earmark and allocate all those funds to various development areas. I wish to take this opportunity to thank all our donors  especially those who have already made good on their pledges and financial commitments to Yemen. That is particularly important in view of the fact that Yemen  owing to its geographic location  social composition and economic status  has been plagued by various problems and challenges. They include the activities of Al-Qaida and of cross-border organized crime and national and international criminal groups trafficking in drugs  weapons and people  as well as the piracy off Yemen’s coasts. Addressing all those problems requires international cooperation for the security of the country and the region as a whole.We would also like to bring up the issue of refugees in Yemen  especially from the Horn of Africa. We have been hosting more one million of them  with all the economic  social and security difficulties that such a situation entails. We are therefore calling on the international community and relevant organizations to help us to deal with the issue and mitigate its negative impact on Yemen. We must find new ways and means to help the Government care for the refugees and help them to return to their homes  especially since those countries have lately seen their stability restored to some degree.Conflicts and bloody events  especially in the Middle East  are contrary to the lofty goals of the United Nations  which is why the international community must revisit the structure and working methods of the Organization and make the reforms necessary to enable it to effectively discharge its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security and to revitalize its role. In that regard  we should mention the despair and frustration of many Arab and Muslim nations over the failure to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine  arrive at a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and put a stop to all the occupying Power’s oppressive measures and practices and attempts to Judaize the holy city of Jerusalem  expand settlement activities  detain Palestinian citizens and excavate illegally around the Al-Aqsa Mosque.We also wish to denounce the use of chemical weapons  especially in Syria  by any party. We call on all the parties in the Syrian conflict to stop the bloodshed  agree to a dialogue and to work towards a political settlement and reconciliation and reconstruction. We call on the international and regional parties concerned to intensify their efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis. A “Geneva II” conference should be convened as soon as possible in order to put an end to the violence  killings and bloodshed in Syria. Recent events have demonstrated the challenges facing the United Nations in this area  particularly regarding the disagreement between permanent members of the Security Council  which was a pretext for certain groups to opt for unilateral action outside the international legitimacy represented by the United Nations. The Council needs thorough reform for it to be able to carry out its primary task  which is the maintenance of international peace and security and the peaceful settlement of conflicts.Concerning the brotherly country of Somalia and our support for it  we call on the international community to continue to stand by it in order to enable it to overcome its long legacy of conflict and suffering.Finally  I would like to thank the President and the Secretary-General once again."
"189",7567,"YUG",68,2013,"It is my great honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Republic of Serbia and inform members about the positions held by my country on some important global issues  developments in and around Serbia and the efforts that Belgrade has made with a view to reaching a just solution to problems facing the country and its neighbourhood.First of all  I would like to thank the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session for his excellent stewardship and organization of this debate and the leadership he has demonstrated in his high-level post. I wish him every success in the performance of his duties as President of the General Assembly. I assure him that he will enjoy the support of the Republic of Serbia in the discharge of his mandate. He can count on our assistance in bringing his ideas to fruition.At the same time  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic  former President of the General Assembly  on his courage and impeccable work in presiding over the Assembly for the past year and on the understanding he has demonstrated of the problems encountered all over the world. He represented Serbia in a dignified manner while being an impartial professional of high standing.The Republic of Serbia attaches great importance to the United Nations and the activities and cooperation carried out within its framework. We remain true to the Charter of the United Nations and the purposes and principles enshrined therein. We will endeavour  to the extent of our ability  to make a contribution to their implementation.We are also determined to participate in the new initiatives being taken within the United Nations. I welcome the well-chosen theme for this year’s session. The post-2015 development agenda and the preparations to be made in order to define a future global development framework are important issues  and the General Assembly is the right forum in which to hold these discussions and  more important  come to agreement on them. I am confident that the current Assembly session will be successful in the consideration of the agenda items highlighted by its President  namely  the contribution of women  youth and civil society to the post-2015 development agenda and human rights and the rule of law in that agenda.The deadline for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  to which the Republic of Serbia fully subscribes  is fast approaching  and the United Nations and today’s world are at a crossroads. The process that has been initiated is an ambitious and complicated one. Even the outcome document of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288  annex)  entitled “The future we want”  makes it incumbent upon us to take action.I hope that the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals will be a success. The Republic of Serbia appreciates the opportunity given to it  as a member of the Group  to help in the drafting process aimed at establishing sustainable development goals. For our part  we will do our utmost to contribute to defining sustainable development goals in clear terms. We believe that the sustainable development goals should be global in nature but  at the same time  have the capacity to be implemented in all countries  as countries differ so much in their capacity  level of development  priorities and policies.It goes without saying that  in identifying the sustainable development goals  priority should be accorded to energy efficiency  renewable resources and climate change. Key development goals should deal with sustainable economic development because  without it  it will be impossible to achieve social development  reduce hunger  poverty  unemployment and inequality  prevent further wage level disparities or protect the environment.I expect that attention will also be focused on implementing a global mechanism to prevent economic shocks from developed countries from spilling over to developing countries and destabilizing international financial markets. As part of the process  voices from both “have” and “have-not” countries should be equally valued. Developing countries should highlight the problems  and developed countries should act as partners in resolving them. As a new member of the Economic and Social Council for the period 2014 to 2016  the Republic of Serbia will participate in all Council activities related to the MDGs and setting the stage of the post-2015 development agenda. However  there can be no development — sustainable  unsustainable  economic or social — in war-torn areas. Even today  at the outset of the twenty-first century  it is unfortunate that many war zones exist throughout the world. My country has participated in United Nations-led peacekeeping operations for decades. In many continents  memories of Serbia’s contributions to peace efforts remain very much alive. We will continue to apply lessons learned to find solutions to specific problems in the field and to improve our peacekeepers’ response capacities in terms of the challenges they will face in carrying out their mandates and with a view to achieving maximum performance. Serbian service and police personnel are engaged in multinational operations in the Congo  Côte d’Ivoire  Cyprus  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Haiti  Lebanon  Liberia  Uganda  the Middle East and Somali waters and soon in Mali as well. They all serve as proper representatives of their country through actions in favour of peace. We are prepared to increase  in the coming period  the size of our contribution and equipment in terms of national contingents and to make use of the available United Nations standby arrangements. In line with our policies based on Security Council resolutions  we will also promote the participation of our servicewomen in peace missions.Serbia’s engagement in United Nations missions and other multinational operations represents our firm contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Republic of Serbia has no ulterior motive behind sending its troops to other countries  other than to provide assistance. For that reason  we would like to see the personnel of the Serbian armed forces and the Ministry of the Interior welcomed and accepted both by the Governments of the friendly countries to which they are deployed and the local populations and that they would be seen as supportive partners  rather than as foreign troops and occupying forces.When seconding its personnel to multinational operations  Serbia has no interest — military  political or economic — but to help a friend in need and show the other contingents contributing to the operation that our troops may be counted upon to help.Apart from wars  there is another omnipresent global danger looming large over the core values of the United Nations. That danger is terrorism  which poses a threat to fundamental human rights and creates an obstacle to business  thus undermining development as well.As a State party to most international counter-terrorism conventions  the Republic of Serbia attaches great significance to international activities aimed at suppressing terrorism. And we are adapting our domestic legislation to stem the scourge. We unequivocally support the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and all of the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council. Serbia  as a victim of terrorist attacks that have even taken the lives of children — the most innocent segment of its population — understands well the need for regional and broader counter-terrorism cooperation. Because terrorism knows no boundaries  States Members of the United Nations must be ready to cooperate without compromise  prejudice  or limitations and without any exceptions or special cases allowing terrorist actions against one’s own people under the pretext of so-called “freedom fighting”. In that context  it is of the utmost importance to make progress on the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Serbia strongly condemns terrorism in any shape or form  without regard to who the perpetrators may be  wherever such acts may be committed or for whatever purpose.On the other hand  no one has the right  Serbia included  to limit itself to statements made in condemnation. Victims of terrorist acts worldwide  those injured in attacks or the families of victims have the right to demand that persons responsible for such acts be brought to justice and that any further recruitment of terrorists or financing of their organizations end.The Republic of Serbia attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and is striving to fully comply with the internationally recognized standards in that area. Serbia has taken a step forward regarding the enjoyment of human rights by minority groups  particularly national minorities  women and children and persons with special needs. Serbia’s law on the protection of the rights and freedoms of national minorities surpasses international conventions in many aspects. The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia unambiguously prohibits the assimilation of national minorities and the undertaking of measures designed to artificially alter the ethnic structure of populations in areas where national minorities traditionally reside in large numbers. The Republic of Serbia is a multi-ethnic  multireligious and multicultural country. Dozens of ethnic groups and several religious communities live there peacefully  and its tradition of living side by side based on tolerance and respect of others has been long  genuine and deep-rooted. Drawing upon our own experience  we have wholeheartedly embraced the Alliance of Civilizations initiative. We have actively promoted intercultural and interfaith dialogue in all domains and at all levels  as that is the best way to overcome divisions caused by cultural  linguistic  religious or any other diversity. Generally  in the period under review  Serbia has achieved considerable progress in the protection of human rights  as noted in the presentation of the second universal periodic review  in Geneva in January  and during the visit to Belgrade by Ms. Navanethem Pillay  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. We are ready to share our expertise and experience in the human rights field with our friends around the world. The Republic of Serbia considers such cooperation a friendly exchange  not interference in the internal affairs of other countries or as one-sided and irresponsible preaching and tutelage accompanied by conditions or blackmail.The Republic of Serbia is a party to nearly all international instruments and initiatives in the field of disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control. It fully complies with the obligations it has undertaken. Serbia’s commitment to the Arms Trade Treaty  which we recently signed  is based on the belief that the establishment of legally binding international standards in that field is a significant contribution to eliminating the illegal arms trade  fighting international terrorism and organized crime and promoting peace  security and stability — in other words  the alleviation of human suffering. In accordance with its agreed commitments  my country has counted and inventoried all weapons in its possession and has made the information available. It has also allowed the inspection of its arsenals. Our partners know where each piece of Serbian weaponry is located. Nothing is kept secret. We have done so not only because we were bound to do so  but to show and prove that Serbia is truly committed to peace and cooperation with its neighbours. Contributions to peace can also be made through disarmament. Never in its history has Serbia fought a war of aggression  and the weapons now in its possession are only meant for its defence. Furthermore  Serbia has never posed a threat to any country. It has never possessed weapons of mass destruction and has no intention of including weapons of mass destruction in its visible  quantifiable and verifiable arsenal.We are aware that progress on disarmament and arms control hinges not only on us. Success is related to developments carried out on a wider political and strategic stage. In the little more than one year since I took office  I have visited almost all of the countries with borders in common with Serbia. I have spoken with the leaders of all of the neighbouring countries  including at international events. In that manner  I wanted to convey the message that Serbia has opted for regional cooperation and working together with its neighbours to address the problems we share in common.On behalf of Serbia  I have made symbolic gestures to effectively demonstrate that we wish to reconcile with the peoples living side by side with us. I am confident that those gestures will significantly contribute to reconciliation and help to right the wrongs of the past.We are now looking forward to the future. It is our desire to foster good relations with all neighbouring countries by building a network of roads  railway lines and bridges; to try to make our mark on the international market; to promote our energy systems; to protect the environment; to cooperate in disaster relief; to develop cross-border projects; to have trade links and; to expand our cultural  scientific  educational  technological and sports cooperation. Our common goal is to improve the living standards of everyone living in the countries of the region.In comparison with our neighbours  we can compete only in terms of seeking to attain more human rights protection  whereas in all other respects  we will cooperate and help encourage one another to perform better. Serbia’s message to its European partners is that the time for conflicts  distrust and disputes is now behind us. Our country is looking forward to the future and to becoming a member of the European Union. It has been decided  and we trust that Serbia will start negotiations with the European Union no later than January 2014. I hope that Serbia will be able to inform the next General Assembly session about the outcome of those talks  which we believe will not last long or continue indefinitely  as well as about Serbia’s ongoing progress towards becoming a fully fledged member of the European Union. At the same time  Serbia has revived old alliances and forged new ones throughout the world  creating strategic partnerships with countries in the East  West  North and South.Serbia has been active in all regional initiatives and organizations  and has recently chaired some of them  making a remarkable impression on other members. As a result  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has entrusted Serbia with its chairmanship for 2015. The OSCE chairmanship  to be held by Switzerland in 2014 and then by Serbia in 2015  serves as a good example of how to cooperate within international organizations. It will give Serbia an opportunity to make a constructive contribution to the enhancement of the OSCE  especially since 2015 will mark the fortieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act  one of the most important OSCE instruments. We are confident that our activities on regional initiatives and our forthcoming chairmanship of the OSCE will make Serbia an ideal candidate for taking on greater responsibility within the United Nations system  consequently making it possible for it to be entrusted with even more responsibilities and duties  when the time comes.The unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo  in 2008  has been creating problems and undermining a system established by the United Nations at its start. The United Nations has never recognized an illegal secession attempt by Kosovo’s provisional institutions of self-governance  but a number of countries  irrespective of the norms of international law  have recognized Kosovo as an independent State. Under constant pressure and through blackmail on the part of large and powerful States  some other countries  including Serbia’s traditional allies  have unfortunately recognized Kosovo as an independent State. Serbia has responded to such acts in a measured  diplomatic and political manner  refraining from any use of force  to safeguard its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. Faced with a situation where its vital national interests were at stake  a country would rarely demonstrate such a degree of level-headedness.We are convinced that such problems  including the status of Kosovo and Metohija  should be resolved peacefully. For that reason  we take heed of calls by the General Assembly in 2010 to start negotiations with representatives of the authorities in Pristina. Following the efforts of Lady Catherine Ashton  European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  we have made arrangements with the Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija. Serbia has thus shown that its intention was to protect the Serb community in Kosovo and Metohija as far as possible  to ensure that all its inhabitants in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo could also lead normal lives on a day-to-day basis. Let us underscore that Belgrade and Pristina have only reached agreement over clearly defined matters  such as local elections and the establishment of a community of Serbian boroughs in Kosovo and Metohija  and that the Republic of Serbia has not recognized the independence of Kosovo in any shape or form. The first agreement  which we promised to respect fully  does not mean in any way that the Republic of Serbia intends to approve Kosovo’s entry into the United Nations and other international organizations  where membership is the sole prerogative of sovereign States. The United Nations has been present in Kosovo and Metohija for more than 14 years. We believe in the United Nations  which was entrusted with administering this part of Serbia in 1999. Therefore  we ask that the mandate of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) remain unchanged  that its staff not be downsized and that its activities be reinforced. UNMIK plays an indispensable role. It should coordinate the work of all international forces present in Kosovo and Metohija within a neutral framework  as stated in Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). That resolution defined the tasks of the United Nations and reaffirmed that Kosovo and Metohija is a province forming an integral part of the Republic of Serbia.We also support the work of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX). We request that the European Union respect its own principles as far as the province of Kosovo and Metohija is concerned. We expect EULEX  by maintaining a neutral approach  to continue assisting in the development of democratic institutions within the province and in monitoring the human rights of Serbs and other non-Albanians  since only their fundamental human rights are under threat.As far as Serbia is concerned  there is yet another pending task before the United Nations weighing on the conscience of its Member States  one which must not remain unaddressed  so that neither we nor future Presidents have to seek justice by repeating that a crime remains to be resolved. We wish to recall that special rapporteur Dick Marty  a Swiss senator  has shown  and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has confirmed  that some Albanian leaders in Kosovo and Metohija organized the kidnapping and killing of Serbs whose organs were then harvested and sold illegally. We were not in a position to initiate legal proceedings for those crimes  which were committed towards the beginning of the twenty-first century  crimes that have so far not occurred anywhere else in the world. We still believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to be included in investigating those crimes  based on a report by the Council of Europe. Serbia appeals for the support of friends in its efforts to shed light on the truth behind those and other crimes so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. In April  I spoke before the Assembly in the thematic debate on the role of the international criminal justice system in reconciliation and about the work of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY). We said then that the ICTY had abused the mandate given to it by the Security Council; that it had not helped the reconciliation process in the territory of the former Yugoslavia; that it had compromised the idea behind the international criminal justice system; that it had acted under political pressure; that it was not independent; that it had acted differently in similar circumstances; that it had acquitted some war criminals  in some instances even failing to indict them; that it had humiliated Serb victims of the secession wars of the former Yugoslavia; and that it had attempted to paint a revisionist picture of history. We continue to hold the same points of view. By accepting the integrity of the Tribunal  we have not only earned the right to criticize its work but also to propose a solution. Nevertheless  while its intention was not just to criticize this institution  Serbia suggested certain measures that might  to some extent  help redress the wrongdoings of the Tribunal. We request the United Nations and the ICTY to find a legal solution that ensures that Serb convicts are sent to serve their prison sentence in Serbia  so that justice may be done more effectively  primarily as a way of helping them reintegrate into society. That does not mean that we challenge the verdicts reached or that we are minimizing the crimes committed by those persons. We simply want to help those concerned return to normal life  once they come out of prison  as part of the Serbian community.Serbia respects every State Member of the United Nations and offers each and every one of them its friendship and trust. We expect that to be reciprocated in equal measure. The Serbia of today and tomorrow deserves to be trusted. "
"190",7595,"ZAF",68,2013,"It is an honour and a privilege for me to once again address this body. South Africa attaches the utmost importance to the General Assembly as the most representative and democratic organ of the United Nations serving the international community.We congratulate President Ashe and the Republic of Antigua and Barbuda on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We also thank Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the splendid way in which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.Let me begin by reiterating our condemnation of the horrific terrorist attack over the weekend in Kenya  in which a number of civilians  including a South African national  were killed. We express our deepest condolences to the Government and people of Kenya and to all those families who lost loved ones  and wish the wounded survivors a speedy recovery. We continue to support the efforts of Kenya and the international community aimed at peacekeeping  stability  democracy and nation-building in Somalia.The theme for our debate this year  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is most appropriate. In the year 2000  the commitment was made by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration to eradicate extreme poverty and adopt the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are measurable and achievable targets that were specifically crafted to address the most pressing development needs of the most vulnerable countries. The full implementation of the MDGs remains the key priority on the development agenda for the next two years.A development agenda for beyond 2015 should allow individual regions and States the space to address the development needs peculiar to their circumstances and priorities. For Africa in particular  the future development agenda should address poverty eradication  income inequality and job creation. We furthermore believe that the new development agenda can be effective only if it is focused on all three dimensions of sustainable development  namely  the eradication of poverty through economic development  social development and environmental sustainability.We also wish to emphasize that any development agenda beyond 2015 must be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in order to equalize the international playing field. We raise this point out of our concern that the global economic meltdown seems to have brought about new developments that are detrimental to the developing world  especially Africa. Some of the new developments include the tendency to renegotiate the rules of the game. New issues are being introduced as prerequisites for development and partnerships and have  in fact  become huge non-tariff barriers. They include the green economy and clean technology. While those issues are important for Africa and developing countries and need to be attended to  the manner in which they have been crafted restrains economic development  as they are used as obstacles.We also wish to emphasize our expectations that the developed North and developing South will continue to engage in a genuine partnership. In that regard  the developed North countries should stand ready to meet their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance.We are aware of the challenges in the North caused by the economic meltdown  but we are of the view that investing in development in the South  especially in Africa  is of primary importance as a source of much-needed sustainable development and stability in the world. Attempts to delegate some of those historical responsibilities to new emerging economies in the South are unacceptable and unworkable  as such emerging nations have their own historical challenges and backlogs to deal with. Furthermore  any commitment we make to the future beyond 2015 must build on existing agreements  which include Agenda 21  the MDGs  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the outcome document of the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development. In the case of Africa  they must build on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.Development and security are two sides of the same coin. The best way to ensure both is through good governance and the promotion of democratic values in all societies. Allow me  therefore  to register once again our serious concern that the Security Council  almost 70 years since its establishment  remains undemocratic  unrepresentative and unfair to developing nations and small States  and disenfranchises the majority of the States Members of the United Nations  which form the majority in the General Assembly. We cannot remain beholden indefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative minority on the most important issues of international peace and security.There has been too much talk about the need for reform  with too little action. We would like to challenge the Assembly today by saying “Let us set ourselves the target to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations in 2015 with a reformed  more inclusive  democratic and representative Security Council!”.When discussing the Security Council  the matter of the Syrian Arab Republic comes into focus. We have expressed our dismay at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. There is no cause that could justify the use of weapons of mass destruction by anyone under any circumstances. It is  however  our strongly held view that any political transition in Syria must come about as a result of the will of the Syrian people and not through the force of arms.We welcome the recent positive developments  such as the decision by Syria to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the ongoing bilateral consultations between the Russian Federation and the United States. We support all of the diplomatic efforts aimed at finding a solution to this matter. The international community has an opportunity to use the Syrian experience to ensure that matters of this nature are handled correctly going forward  using existing instruments within the multilateral system of global governance.Next year South Africa will celebrate its twentieth anniversary of freedom and democracy. We will forever be grateful to those in the international community  including the United Nations  who stood beside us in our long struggle for liberation. We look forward to celebrating our anniversary of freedom with the United Nations and to strengthening our partnership. A strong partnership with the United Nations is critical for the future we want for the people of South Africa. We also take this opportunity to thank the United Nations and the international community for their support during the recent hospitalization of our beloved founding President of the free and democratic South Africa  His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela. We thank them for all for their support and good wishes. The United Nations declared 18 July  his birthday  as Nelson Mandela International Day. That has become a catalyst promoting service to humankind worldwide. We thank the United Nations for that gesture. Our revered former President continues to respond to treatment at his home. His family and our people have warmly welcomed the support he continues to receive from the global community. We are humbled and very grateful for that support.As we celebrate our freedom and democracy  we remain mindful that our struggle is not complete until the people of Palestine and Western Sahara enjoy their rights to self-determination. Just as the United Nations stood by South Africa  we would like to see the Organization be at the forefront of efforts towards self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara.We are deeply concerned about continued illegal settlement activities in the West Bank in violation of international law. Such illegal settlement activities jeopardize the realization of the two-State solution.The Cuban people also hold a special place in our hearts because of that country’s sacrifice for African peoples in their quest for freedom. We will therefore continue to struggle with them for their economic liberation.At its sixty-eighth session the General Assembly will undertake critical work for the future of our people. Let us tackle the work ahead in such a manner that when future generations look back on this moment  they will be able to say that the leaders of this generation laid the foundation for the eradication of poverty  for building a global society of equality  and for world peace.Let me borrow from the words of our former President Nelson Mandela on his inauguration day in 1994 when he said:“We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. We must therefore act together as a united people  for national reconciliation  for nation-building  for the birth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all. Let there be work  bread  water and salt for all. Let each know that for each the body  the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfil themselves.”"
"191",7637,"ZMB",68,2013,"At the outset  I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John. Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am confident that his wisdom and skill will be brought to bear as he steers the Assembly through a year of progressive dialogue and challenging negotiations. The theme of this year’s session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is timely  as it presents an opportunity for us to discuss the future of global development. To that end  I wish to assure the President of our delegation’s support as he discharges the function of President at this session. The African continent has this year also reached a significant milestone. In May  together with the rest of the continent  we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African Unity  the forerunner to the African Union. The African Union is a symbol of the collective hopes and aspirations of our resilient continent. As expected  that occasion formed the basis for mutual reflection on the future direction of a young and versatile Africa. Furthermore  next year  our country will commemorate 50 years of its independence. We approach that milestone proud that Zambia continues to enjoy political stability and has embraced democratic principles that have formed the basis for social and economic transformation for improving the lives of the Zambian people.Our country is also honoured to have played a significant role in peacebuilding initiatives within the subregion and the continent at large and continues to participate in them. Zambia will therefore remain committed to the ideals for which she has stood and is prepared to contribute to global efforts aimed at uplifting humanity.To address the aspirations of our peoples  in particular those of the most vulnerable nations  we as a global community meeting in this Assembly set ourselves the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) — eight clear targets that resonate with our populations’ aspirations. In less than two years  we will have reached the deadline for the attainment of the MDGs  and Governments will have an opportunity to take stock of the achievements made in efforts to attain the development targets set at the turn of the century.We are all champions of the MDGs. We have run the race  and we continue to run the race  albeit at different paces and on different terrains. What remains critical  therefore  is what we do between now and the deadline  as well as how we will move beyond 2015.Amid much anxiety  the 2013 progress report for my country was released in May. On a positive note  the report indicated the tremendous progress made by Zambia on MDGs 4 and 5  regarding reducing the under-five mortality rate by two thirds and the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by 2015. I emphasize here that maternal mortality is rooted in gender inequality  which manifests itself as poor education for girls  early marriage  adolescent pregnancies and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health care. The results therefore tell us that with more effort  gender inequality can be redressed.Zambia’s MDG report further indicates that we have made great strides in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The challenges are still immense  and we have to ensure that those living with HIV and AIDS are receiving the best care and access to social protection services. All efforts must be made to reach zero infection and zero deaths by building on what has been achieved so far. International support is equally critical for a sustained and enhanced response.The Zambian economy is presently enjoying macroeconomic stability and has experienced appreciable economic growth over the recent past. However  our Government still has the huge task of ensuring that the basic needs of Zambians are met  as poverty levels and unemployment remain a challenge. It is not surprising  therefore  that we have made marginal progress in reducing the prevalence of hunger. In order to accelerate Zambia’s efforts to achieve MDG 1  our Government has taken an unprecedented and painful step in curtailing subsidies on fuel and maize. That has enabled us to release much-needed resources for programmes that are deliberately targeted at poverty alleviation. We have also transformed and repositioned social protection services to optimize efficiency.The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank estimate that economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa can be expected to be higher than the global average — around 5.5 per cent in 2013 and 6.1 per cent next year. However  in the absence of inclusive social development and without food security  that growth risks being undermined by social exclusion  particularly for the youth. For instance  while our Government recorded a growth in gross domestic product of 7.3 per cent in 2012  we recognize the fact that it is equally important to ensure that we put in place specific measures that will promote equality and social justice in the labour market. It is for this reason that we are strongly advocating for investment that creates real and sustainable employment prospects for our people  while at the same time making our economy more labour-absorbent.In turning to the post-2015 agenda  our Government believes that the importance of the intergovernmental processes on sustainable development goals is critical and cannot be overemphasized. I wish to reiterate the need to have a single set of universally agreed sustainable development goals reflecting sustainable development priorities that are actionable and concise and whose implementation will resonate with the different development and economic levels of Member States. Furthermore  the goals will need to be prudently balanced and to effectively integrate the economic  social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. To that end  it is necessary to build global partnerships that are supported by commitments to regional and international cooperation  anchored with mutual accountability  enhanced local private sectors and public-private partnerships.Our Government believes that addressing issues of poverty is important for the achievement of sustainable and inclusive development in the future we want for Zambia. Our country attaches importance to improving the welfare of our people  especially women  children and young people  through wealth and employment creation  the provision of quality education and of quality health care  and industrialization  among other things.In particular  our Government wishes to emphasize the need to mainstream children’s issues  including access to quality education and quality health care services  provided at the right time. Social protection and upholding the rights of all children is critical and should transcend the global desire for a better future. It is therefore imperative that the post-2015 agenda take into account the momentum that has been attained in the realization of the MDGs in order to ensure continuity and sustainability.My address to the Assembly would be incomplete if I did not underscore Zambia’s  and indeed Africa’s  desire to realize a more democratic and representative Security Council. As a continent  our voice could not be clearer. We continue to call for greater progress in those negotiations  whose conclusion is long overdue. I wish to reiterate our position  as defined in the Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations boasts of an all-inclusive multilateral process  but that is obviously lacking when it comes to the Security Council. The effectiveness of that organ should be enhanced by adapting it to the prevailing global realities of international peace and security and the legitimacy realized through an all-inclusive process.In conclusion  allow me to express Zambia’s gratitude for the support received in the recent hosting of two important United Nations conferences  namely  the twentieth session of the General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization and the fourth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. I therefore take this opportunity  on behalf of my Government and the Zambian people  to thank all those who participated and contributed to the success of those meetings. We look forward to the opportunity to host again in the near future."
"192",7673,"ZWE",68,2013,"Let me begin by extending my warmest congratulations to Mr. John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His election to that esteemed office is a fitting tribute to the personal and diplomatic qualities that he has exhibited over the years.Throughout the world  peace and development have remained dominant themes of our times. People all over the world have been raising their voices in favour of peace  development and cooperation  and against war  poverty and confrontation. Here at the United Nations we all acknowledge that peace  security  development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the cornerstones of our collective well-being.In that regard  the theme for this session  “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”  is quite pertinent and timely  as it gives fresh impetus to our understanding that achieving the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and mapping the way forward beyond 2015 requires our collective efforts. The United Nations  as the centre for international cooperation  should lead in promoting the envisaged development.Thirteen years ago  our global efforts were mobilized behind the Millennium Development Goals. We now have less than 1 000 days in which to meet those targets. Our review and stocktaking exercise reveals that  while there have been some significant achievements  there are still gaps and unevenness in the attainment of the Goals. In the case of Zimbabwe  we have made progress towards achieving universal access to primary education and combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. However  some of the Goals are off track owing to lack of capacity — mainly financial capacity — and in some areas progress has stalled  including in those areas relating to the eradication of poverty and hunger  child mortality  universal access to maternal and reproductive health  environmental sustainability and access to potable water and sanitation. As a country  we are committed to undertaking coordinated efforts to accelerate progress to complete the unfinished business of the MDGs in the remaining period leading up to 2015. Any goals that have not been achieved by then should be integrated into the post-2015 development agenda.Zimbabwe fully shares and supports the emerging consensus that eradicating poverty in all its dimensions should be the overarching goal of our post-2015 agenda. Eradicating poverty by 2030 may be an ambitious goal  but it is attainable if we mobilize our collective efforts. Building on the foundation of the MDGs  the post-2015 agenda should go beyond the social development agenda of the MDGs and achieve structural transformation in our economies that delivers inclusive and sustainable growth. We expect a shift that will bring about industrialization  decent jobs and qualitative change to the lives of our citizens. We are determined to modernize our infrastructure and ensure access to sustainable energy for all  food security and nutrition. However  we recognize that we cannot do that in isolation from other partners.In the same vein  we also support calls to prioritize gender equality  the health-related MDGs  education and environmental sustainability in the post-2015 development agenda  among other issues. Those are critical matters in our quest to achieve sustainable development for all our people.The lofty objectives of the Charter of the United Nations in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled unless all Member States join in efforts  genuinely and seriously  to address challenges that developing countries face in their pursuit of development  including meeting the MDGs. It is therefore imperative that our discussions address what has so far been the weakest link  namely  the means of implementation. It must be understood that  in addition to national efforts  substantial international support and an enabling international economic environment are essential if the MDGs are to be achieved by 2015  especially in Africa. It is therefore important to fulfil the commitments made to support Africa in various international forums. The United Nations should track the fulfilment of those commitments.Zimbabwe supports the reform of the United Nations to strengthen its central role in promoting multilateralism and to be effective in tackling current and future global challenges. We are convinced that reform would strengthen the Organization’s capacity to fully promote and implement the purposes and principles of the Charter and improve its democratic decision-making.In that regard  the reforms in the economic and social actions of the United Nations remain of fundamental importance to us. Our firm belief in multilateral cooperation means that we place a premium in the ability of the United Nations system to deliver efficient development cooperation. The democratic transformation of the architecture of the international financial system is essential  as is a root-and-branch reform of the international trading system. The terms of trade have hugely burdened developing countries for too long.Zimbabwe supports the ongoing efforts to revitalize the General Assembly  which is the most representative organ of the United Nations. We believe that the Assembly should take the lead in setting the global agenda and restore its primacy  which has over the years been encroached upon by other organs. We cannot accept situations whereby the Security Council is increasingly encroaching upon issues that traditionally fall within the General Assembly’s purview and competence  including in the area of norm-setting. Recent events have revealed that the formal decisions of the Security Council have provided camouflage to neo-imperialist forces of aggression seeking to militarily intervene in smaller countries in order to effect regime change and acquire complete control of their wealth. That was the case in Libya  where  in the name of protecting civilians  NATO forces were deployed with an undeclared mission to eliminate Al-Qadhafi and his family. A similar campaign was undertaken in Iraq by the Bush and Blair forces under the guise of eradicating weapons of mass destruction  which Saddam Hussein never possessed.We appreciate the central role that the United Nations should play in furthering multilateralism in preference to unilateralism. In that regard  we applaud the consultations and negotiations on the eventual destruction of the chemical weapons in Syria. My country expresses its gratitude and appreciation to Russia and China for their principled stand on Syria. We hope and trust that the Syrian people will soon sit in dialogue to discuss peace and desirable political reforms. Those Western countries in pursuit of hegemony as they pretend to be advocates of democracy must be resisted.For Africa  the reform of the Security Council is especially long overdue. The anachronistic and unrepresentative character of the Council must be redressed. For how long should Africa continue to be denied the right to play a pivotal role in the Security Council as it decides measures on conflicts within the borders of that very continent? The Security Council needs to be more representative  democratic  transparent  accountable and accessible to the wider membership for its decisions to have greater legitimacy. Africa’s case for the correction of the glaring historical injustice of being unrepresented in the permanent category and underrepresented in the non-permanent category has been made through the clear  fair and well articulated Ezulwini Consensus. Zimbabwe remains steadfast in its support of the Ezulwini Consensus  which is  in fact  a demand.Zimbabwe strongly condemns the use of unilateral economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool to effect regime change. The illegal economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the United States and the European Union violate fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations on State sovereignty and the non-interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign State. Moreover  those illegal sanctions continue to inflict economic deprivation and human suffering on all Zimbabweans. In the eyes of our people  the sanctions constitute a form of hostility and violence against them for the simple crime of undertaking the land reform programme by which land was put in the hands of the then majority landless Zimbabweans. Our small and peaceful country is threatened daily by covetous and bigoted big Powers whose hunger for domination and control over other nations and their resources knows no bounds.Shame  shame  shame  we say to the United States of America. Shame  shame  shame  we say to Britain and its allies  who have continued to impose illegal sanctions on our people. Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans; so are its ample resources. I ask those countries to please remove their illegal and iniquitous sanctions from my peaceful nation. If those sanctions were intended to effect regime change  well  the results of the recent national elections have clearly shown them that they cannot achieve their agenda.We are preached to daily by the West on the virtues of democracy and freedom  which they do not entirely espouse. Zimbabwe took up arms precisely to achieve freedom and democracy. There was none during colonialism  and it was British colonialism  for that matter. Yet we have been punished by the United States through the odious Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act  which it enacted in 2001 to effect regime change in our country. Now that malicious intent to continue with the relentless persecution of our small  peaceful country has shown itself again  through the rejection by the United States of the recent and absolutely democratic and fair results of our general elections of 31 July  even as they were applauded by the African Union and all our regional organizations. It appears that when the United States and its allies speak of democracy and freedom they do so in relative terms. Zimbabwe  however  refuses to accept that those Western detractors have the right to define democracy and freedom for it. We made the greatest sacrifice and paid the ultimate price for freedom and independence in Zimbabwe  and we remain determined never to relinquish our sovereignty  as at the same time we remain masters of our destiny. As we have repeatedly and loudly said and asserted  Zimbabwe will never be a colony again."
