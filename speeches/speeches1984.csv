"1",14,"AFG",39,1984,"ï»¿I shall begin my statement by offering you  Sir  the cordial congratulations of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are certain that as a person with outstanding qualities and vast experience  and as a representative of a fellow non-aligned country  you will be able to fulfil your duties with distinction and success. You can fully rely on my delegation's cooperation in the attainment of positive results from the work of this session.28.	We pay a tribute to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for his responsible and devoted service as President of the thirty-eighth session.29.	May I also extend our gratitude to the energetic Secretary-General for his selfless and untiring endeavours during the past year on behalf of the international community.30.	Next year we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. This  in our view  provides an appropriate occasion to review the performance of the United Nations system over the past four decades in order to draw necessary lessons for the enhancement of its role and effectiveness in the achievement of peace  security  justice and development. This should also be an occasion for a determined rededication by Member States to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to their effective implementation.31.	We fully share the Secretary-General's thoughts in his report on the work of the Organization that ""Without the safety net which multilateral organization provides  the world would certainly be a much more dangerous and disorderly place   and that ""an extended and tolerable future for all humanity ultimately depends upon our success in making the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations the basis of the day-to-day relations of Governments and peoples"". These views are more accurate now than ever before  since the circumstances under which our world is evolving today are far more fraught with a threat to its very existence than they have ever been in the entire history of mankind.32.	The tremendously huge quantities of destructive war potential accumulated in the aggressive centres of power haunt millions of people all over the world with their unthinkable possibility. Legitimate fear of a complete annihilation of life on earth as a result of an all-out nuclear war has put the struggle for peace and the prevention of such a war at the top of the list of priorities on the human agenda. To be sure  the mere existence of quantitatively and qualitatively large amounts of nuclear weapons is a cause for concern.33.	The main cause for serious concern  however  is the horrendous policies that advocate the probability of the use of such armaments. The main source of this threat lies in the aggressive and militaristic circles of the imperialist camp  first and foremost the United States  which are willing to use these weapons at their own discretion.34.	We remain gravely alarmed by such pronouncements as ""negotiating from strength""  ""security through force"" and ""limited or protracted nuclear war"". One would have wished that these doctrines were advanced merely as part of the imperialists' warmongering rhetoric. But the hard facts which have found reflection in the actions and deeds of the imperialist Powers leave virtually no room for wishful thinking.35.	The regenerated capitalist war industries fed by extra hundreds of billions of dollars have already passed their monstrous products through the assembly lines. The unprecedented build-up of United States interventionist forces in every corner of the world  together with the unleashing of hounds of war in so-called covert operations against innumerable Governments and peoples  has caused immense concern over the not-so-secret intentions harboured by the White House. Despite hapless and futile attempts at adopting peaceable postures  those hidden evil designs found their way out in the form of a gaffe not meant for broadcast. Indeed  we have to worry about our fate and that of the whole world when the buttons of the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons are under the command of those who find it amusing to joke about nuclear warfare.36.	At a time when the destiny of our planet is toyed with by those who are madly seeking United States unquestionable superiority  hundreds of people in various centres of the world arc sent every day to the valley of death as mere cannon fodder for United States foreign policy.37.	Thanks to such policies and actions  vitally important bilateral negotiations on strategic arms limitations and disarmament have either been suspended or rendered completely fruitless. The deployment by the United States of large numbers of its first-strike cruise and Pershing H nuclear missiles in several countries of Europe aimed at the Soviet Union and other socialist countries resulted in the suspension of bilateral talks at Geneva.38.	As if this planet were not enough for the warmongering circles in the United States  a disproportionately extensive plan for the militarization of outer space and introduction of highly sophisticated weapons there has been launched by them.39.	Here we would like to express our full support for the timely and very important proposals of the Soviet Union  both on the peaceful uses of outer space and on the inadmissibility of State terrorism  put forward by its Foreign Minister  Mr. Gromyko40.	To avert the danger of a nuclear holocaust and save the earth and the space surrounding it for peaceful uses by this and future generations  all nuclear Powers should in our view positively and effectively respond to the Soviet Union's peaceful demarche  which constitutes yet another valuable step in line with other innumerable important Soviet proposals aimed at the achievement of general and complete disarmament and the strengthening of international security.41.	The wars of aggression  direct military occupation  undeclared mercenary wars and proxy wars waged by surrogate regimes on behalf of imperialism are taking a heavy toll on peoples who are determined to defend their independence  territorial integrity and national sovereignty. The roars of United States aeroplanes and other military machinery makes the atmosphere of peace tremble on the borders first of one country and then of another.42.	Repeated attempts are being made further to suffocate the process of detente through a deliberate escalation of tension in Europe and elsewhere.43.	Accompanying all these are the greedy economic policies applied by the capitalist financial monopolies  which have for many years banked upon the natural and human resources of colonial or newly independent nations and are now out to rob them of whatever has remained in their possession. The unjust burden of debt now weighing on the shoulders of the developing countries is becoming disproportionate as a result of high interest rates and the continuing multifaceted crisis in the world capitalist system.44.	The irrational squandering of billions of dollars on militarization and the arms race imposed by imperialism takes place while hundreds of millions of people around the world are suffering from poverty  hunger  disease and unemployment.45.	The gap in the living standards and rates of development between the developed and developing countries has further widened. The imperialist policy of using economic assistance as a means of exerting political pressure on the developing countries is no longer confined to the bilateral co-operation or the capitalist financial institutions  but has been extensively employed to curtail or completely stop the flow of international development assistance to those countries which dare to refuse to submit to their diktat.46.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  as one such country  has become a victim of these acts of economic pressure and blackmail. This was starkly manifested in the course of the consideration of Afghanistan's country programme by the Governing Council of UNDP.47.	We would like to warn the developing countries  in particular the least developed and low-income countries  to be vigilant against such policies and urge them to unite for the safeguarding of the rights and interests of all developing nations on the basis of internationally established criteria.48.	Few other actions could be more inhuman than the denial of the right of a least developed and landlocked nation to development.49.	Asia  at the heart of which Afghanistan is located  has undergone a period of increased hostilities and confrontation. The traditional hotbeds of tension have been further inflamed while attempts at the creation of new ones have continued unabated.50.	The Indian Ocean  whose littoral and hinterland States have long striven to turn it into a zone of peace  have witnessed a drastic increase in the naval presence of the United States and expansion of its military bases  particularly on the Mauritian island of Diego Garcia. The efforts which the Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean made on behalf of the United Nations  aimed at convening the international Conference on the Indian Ocean  were frustrated once again by the arrogant and stubborn refusal of the United States to heed the aspirations of all nations concerned. The United States and its allies should not be allowed to delay further the holding of the Conference  which is now proposed by the non- aligned countries of the Ad hoc Committee to be held in the first half of 1985 at Colombo.51.	Here we should like to reiterate our support for the initiative of Mr. Didier Ratsiraka  President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  on the convening of a summit conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.52.	The proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic on the signing of a convention on mutual non- aggression and non-use of force in Asia and the Pacific  which enjoys our full support  has not been given  in some quarters  the serious attention this important initiative deserves.53.	Similar negative responses have been accorded to the repeated peaceful proposals of the three Indo- Chinese countries for the cessation of regional hostilities and the normalization of the situation in the region of South-East Asia. This cool reaction is demonstrated at a time when the imperialist  hegemonist and reactionary designs to topple the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea have met with complete defeat.54.	We vigorously condemn the indiscriminate shelling of Vietnamese towns and villages by expansionist Chinese circles.55.	Having been unable to intimidate the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and to crush the will of the Kampuchean people  these forces are now out to create and provoke new hostilities on the borders of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  by invading its territory and occupying three of its villages.56.	The Middle East has continued to remain fraught with the danger of major armed conflict. The continued denial of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine and other occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon  by the Zionist expansionist forces has reduced to naught the possibility of a successful attempt at finding a peaceful solution to the Middle East problem.57.	The proliferation of Zionist colonial settlements and the increasing violation of the elementary rights of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples of the occupied territories  in complete violation of the Geneva conventions  have continued to be a major source of concern to the international community. The presence of Zionist occupation troops in vast territories of Lebanon not only infringes on the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Lebanon but also has brought about agony and suffering to the Lebanese and Palestinian civilian populations as never experienced in the past.58.	The failure of the international community to bring peace to this war-torn region of the world does not simply lie in the intransigent  aggressive and expansionist policies of the Zionist regime but is mainly due to the unconditional political  economic and military support given to the Zionist war machine by United States imperialism. Only such assistance has enabled Israel to defy United Nations resolutions and virtually every other rule of international law. No settlement would be either just or lasting unless it took full account of the attainment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  including their right to establish a national State in Palestine. That constitutes the crux of the Israeli- Arab conflict.59.	In this context we reiterate our full support for the recent realistic proposals of the Soviet Union aimed at finding a just  comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East problem.60.	It is high time for every measure to be taken to facilitate the holding of an International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all concerned parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as called for by the General Assembly in resolution 38/58 C of 13 December 1983. The bitter tragedy which has befallen the Palestinian people and the populations of other occupied Arab territories should not be allowed to continue. We are confident that the valiant Palestinian people and the peoples of Syria and Lebanon will ultimately foil the imperialist Zionist designs and liberate their lands.61.	In our neighbourhood  the senseless bloodshed that continues between the two Islamic neighbours  Iran and Iraq  has brought about the consequences feared when this fratricidal war started almost five years ago. Availing itself of the pretext resulting from the turmoil in the Gulf region  United States imperialism and its local lackeys have embarked on the path of drastically increasing military and naval activities and intimidating the countries of the area into military alliances subservient to imperialist countries.62.	We strongly support the call of a number of independent Arab countries of the area for strict non-interference in the affairs of the region by outside forces.63.	Another issue of major concern has been the situation in Cyprus  which acquired ominous dimensions in the course of last year. The proclamation of the northern part of Cyprus  which is still under military occupation  as the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has been condemned by the Security Council and  indeed  by the international community at large and has been declared illegal  null and void. We urge the Secretary-General to multiply his efforts towards achieving a solution that would guarantee the independence  territorial integrity  non-alignment and unity of the Republic of Cyprus.64.	In another country of the Mediterranean region  the fraternal Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  secret plots of imperialism aimed at the destabilization of that country's popular Government have been accompanied by open acts of aggression and provocation from the air  sea and land.65.	While commending the sober-minded attitude of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula  we consider the recent proposals of that country for the launching of tripartite negotiations on the problem as a major stride towards the attainment of an early solution of the problem.66.	Next year we shall be celebrating the twenty- fifth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This major achievement of the United Nations has brought about the anticipated results that have drastically changed the shape of international relations and world politics.67.	Of disappointment to conscious humanity  however  is the failure of the United Nations to implement that Declaration with regard to Namibia and certain other Territories. The heroic struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization with the full sup-port of the overwhelming majority of nations  has been rendered ineffective due to the intransigent colonialist policies of the South African racists  relying on the all-sided support of United States imperialism. This problem  which falls within the purview of United Nations direct responsibility  has defied solution to this day  in spite of the diplomatic maturity and flexibility displayed by the SWAPO leadership.68.	The situation within South Africa has also deteriorated very sharply. The sham elections conducted with the blessing of the United States met their deserved fate of the total failure of this propaganda ploy. The barbarity and savagery with which the rulers of the abhorrent apartheid system are suppressing the recently escalated struggle of the people of South Africa against the inhuman and unbearable conditions of the vast majority of the people once again put at the forefront of international attention the urgent need for complete eradication of the abominable phenomenon of from our planet. Nothing can justify any further delay in taking effective action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to do away with one of the most horrendous features of the history of mankind. We hail the people of South Africa and their vanguard  the African National Congress of South Africa  for their heroism in fighting against the greatest odds. 69.	Acts of aggression and intimidation still continue against the front-line States  particularly Angola  Mozambique and Lesotho.70.	In conformity with the principles of our foreign policy  we call for recognition of the right of the people of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic to self-determination  the exercise by the people of Puerto Rico of their right to self-determination and independence  and the restitution of the three Malagasy Islands to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar.71.	Turning to Central America and the Caribbean  we cannot but vividly express deep wrath and indignation at the piratic aggression of the United States against the Government and people of Grenada and the continued occupation of their territory. To allow the United States to get away with such manifestations of gunboat diplomacy is to expose other independent and nationalist Governments of the region to the threat of similar actions by the United States. We demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all occupation forces from Grenada.72.	We also demand the cessation of the imperialist blockade of Cuba and the return to it of its territory occupied by United States naval facilities at Guantanamo.73.	The undeclared war fought against revolutionary Nicaragua by the paid mercenaries of the United States continues to bear grave consequences for the prospects of peace in Central America.74.	The flexibility and co-operation demonstrated by the Government of Nicaragua  both within the process of negotiations initiated by the Contadora Group and in bilateral discussions with the United States  are worthy of praise. We hold the rigid and obstinate position adopted by the United States and some other countries at its urging responsible for the continuation of hostilities in the area.75.	We are firmly of the opinion that the present situations prevailing in some of the countries neighbouring Nicaragua have their roots in imperialist interference and the deplorable socio-economic and political conditions existing in those countries. Any attempt at improving that situation should be aimed at the cessation of imperialist interference and the introduction of necessary and fundamental changes on the basis of the interests and aspirations of the vast majority of the people of those countries.76.	Our strong solidarity with all national liberation movements representing such interests and aspirations in this region or other parts of the world is based on our respect for the right of nations to self- determination.77.	It is a regrettable fact that despite our hopes to the contrary the period since the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has not witnessed a decrease in the tension in the region of South-West Asia. This has hampered our sincere efforts to create an atmosphere of trust and confidence conducive to constructive negotiations between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and two of its neighbouring countries. The undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which is master-minded by those in aggressive circles in the United States and their hegemonist and reactionary accomplices as a regional extension of the global imperialist design to destabilize and subdue independent and sovereign nations with the aim of forcing those nations into the militarist imperialist orbit  is continuing unabated. Ever-increasing evidence is accumulating which testifies to the fact that State terrorism has become instrumental in carrying out United States policy against my country. This unholy war  which is acquiring ever-greater dimensions  constitutes an obstacle to the conclusion of an agreement which will serve as a solid basis for the strengthening of peace and stability in our region.78.	As a result of this destructive  inhuman and medieval aggression  which is anti-civilization  carried out from the territories of Pakistan and Iran  the people of Afghanistan have suffered losses of enormous proportions. Thousands of innocent people  including children  women and the elderly  among them 200 clergymen  have been murdered  and public and private property  including scores of mosques and holy places  more than half of the schools of the country  half of the Government- owned trucks  and 104 hospitals and medical centres  as well as communication lines  bridges  highways and hydroelectric and thermal power installations of the country  have been destroyed. The total cost to the national economy of our country of this destruction is almost 34 billion Afghanis  which is equal to three fourths of the total development investment made during the 20 years before the 27 April 1978 revolution.79.	Psychological warfare constitutes an important  integral part of the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The huge propaganda machinery of imperialism  hegemonism and reaction  in its drive to distort the realities in and around Afghanistan  resorts to slander and outright fabrications which have by now acquired fantastic dimensions. For example  if the lies spread by this propaganda machinery are to be believed  most of the leaders of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan must be deadâkilled not just once but many times over. In the same vein the greater part of the territory of the country must be under the control of the counter-revolution  the armed forces of the country must have been annihilated five times over and all the population of Afghanistan must have been eliminated not once but twice.80.	Having realized the absurdity of such fabrications  the propaganda machinery of imperialism  hegemonism and reaction has recently resorted to other forms of naked lies  among them the hullabaloo about the alleged shortage of foodstuff in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. It is possible that such propaganda efforts may have given a distorted image of the situation in my country. Therefore  I should like to point out briefly some of the achievements of our people since the national democratic April revolution.81.	As a result of the revolution  the social and class configuration of Afghan society has been transformed and a new socio-political system based on the democratic nature of the revolution has been created. The National Fatherland Front  of which the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan is also a member  has mobilized well over half a million militant Afghans in the form of collective and individual members to spearhead the work and struggle to build a new society in Afghanistan.82.	State power has been consolidated all over the country and the Law of Local Organs of State Power and Administration  providing &r direct participation by the people in the affairs of their locality and the country as a whole  is being successfully implemented. In addition to the heroic armed forces  revolution defence groups  self-defence groups  soldiers of the revolution  tribal regiments  people's militia groups and social-order brigades are victoriously safeguarding the gains of the revolution. As a result  during this year large formations of the counter-revolution have been annihilated  but different forms of subversive and terroristic activities are still continuing by some remnants of criminal bandits.83.	Despite the continuation of the undeclared war  achievements in the socio-economic development of the country have been significant. During the year that ended on 20 March 1984  the gross national product and the national income of the country increased by 6 per cent and 4.5 per cent  respectively  over the previous year. This means that during this year more goods were produced and services rendered than during the years before the revolution.84.	Since the victory of the revolution  1 274 agricultural co-operatives and thousands of peasants' committees have been established. Different stages of democratic land and water reforms are being success-fully implemented  agricultural production has in-creased and the volume of industrial output is greater than in previous years. Education and public health services are expanding and the campaign against illiteracy is gaining momentum. Already more than a million people have become literate  and it is planned to eradicate illiteracy by the year 1986 in the cities  and by the year 1990 throughout the country. Right now  233 300 persons are enrolled in 11 107 literacy courses throughout the country.85.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is a peaceful  non-aligned country and is determined to remain so. Our uncompromising love for the independence and territorial integrity of our country is a matter of record in the history of the struggle of our people to preserve its freedom and dignity and safeguard and defend its frontiers. Many great challenges have been posed to our liberty and sovereignty  but they have been dealt fatal blows by our unfailing determination to safeguard what we consider not only our birth right but also an indivisible part of our tradition  culture and religion.86.	Pages of our proud 5 000-year history document this brilliant aspect of Afghan patriotism. It is in this context that the strong will of our people to rebuff the imperialistic  hegemonistic and reactionary undeclared war can be explained. Over six years of subversion  coercion  attempts at destabilization  outright aggression and total economic blockade have failed to give any effect to the illusions harboured by our enemies.87.	The people of Afghanistan are already reaping the fruits of their revolution and are prepared to make further sacrifices to safeguard their socio-political system. Let me state once again before this international gathering that the people of Afghanistan will never be deterred from the principled path they have chosen. No one should doubt our unswerving resolve to stand firm in the face of outside pressure and intimidation.88.	Notwithstanding this  the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has  with revolutionary sincerity  conducted earnest and serious negotiations with Pakistan  through the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General  with a view to finding a negotiated settlement to the outstanding problems between the two countries. I should like to recall the two well- known proposals  dated 15 May 1980 and 24 August 1981  put forward by my Government to that end. We have given full proof of our flexibility and political will to achieve an early solution of the present appalling situation around my country. We are for concrete actions. We believe that if words are not followed by deeds they have no value at all. If one speaks of peace and is engaged in aggression in its various forms that can only be a manifestation of hypocrisy and demagoguery.89.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  in line with its foreign policy  is honestly and sincerely for the peaceful solution of the situation around Afghanistan. Should the other countries involved so desire  they will find us prepared to meet them halfway. This course  we believe  corresponds exactly with the aspirations and interests of our peoples and certainly serves the cause of peace in our region.90.	Thanks to our co-operation and understanding  the Secretary-General has been able to pursue his good offices  which in our view have thus far yielded positive results. We are confident that  with the good will and sincerity of the States concerned  we shall be able to achieve further progress. We deem it appropriate to place on record our gratitude and thanks to the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative for their commendable endeavours in this regard.91.	To conclude my statement  I should like to quote the following words of Babrak Karmal  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and President of the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan:""Elimination of poverty  disease and economic backwardness  ignorance and illiteracy  unemployment and inequality  national and social oppression in Afghanistan; creation of an independent national economy; acceleration of the pace of economic growth on the basis of scientific socioeconomic development plans  including the establishment of an independent national industry and the industrialization of the country; and raising the living standard of the masses of the people are general goals of the April Revolution."""
"2",53,"AGO",39,1984,"ï»¿A few days ago  we had the legitimate satisfaction of learning that the international community had elected to the presidency of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly a remarkable African diplomat and worthy representative of Zambia. Mr. President  while this choice testifies to the recognition of your merits and is a just reward for the untiring efforts you have made  in particular in defence of the right of peoples to liberty and independence  it also constitutes a tribute to your country  which is known for its commitment to noble ideals and causes and with which the People's Republic of Angola has excellent relations of friendship  solidarity and co-operation. Hence  on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola  we are very pleased to join in the warm congratulations addressed to you  Sir  and to wish you the greatest success in carrying out such lofty responsibilities.2.	Allow us to take this opportunity to express to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  our deep appreciation and admiration for the worthy and far-sighted way in which he carried out his mandate and our best wishes for success in his presidential functions and for the prosperity of the Panamanian people.3.	We should also like to repeat to the Secretary- General our deepest gratitude for his clarity and exemplary seriousness in the defence of the fundamental principles of the United Nations  as well as the laudable action he has undertaken for lessening tensions and settling numerous conflicts  in spite of the glaring lack of resources made available to him.4.	The United Nations family has just admitted a new Member  Brunei Darussalam. The Angolan Government joins ail those who have welcomed that country and wished it a prosperous future.5.	In the hope that sooner or later a growing number of States Members of the United Nations  and not just some  will equally and duly be taken seriously when they address the General Assembly  we are obliged to repeat what we have already said  to the extent that no significant or positive change has taken place which would counteract the progressive deterioration in the international situation during these last four years.6.	At each session of the General Assembly  all of us come to reaffirm our adherence to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to repeat our commitment to the cause of freedom  peace  justice  democracy  solidarity  development and co-operation.7.	At the beginning of each statement  almost invariably it is emphasized that the session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very critical moment  even as the international situation has worsened to the point where it seriously threatens the survival of mankind.8.	But between the fine words or the best of intentions and respecting them or carrying them out  it cannot be denied that there is a gap which becomes wider at each session. And all we do each year is repeat ourselves  thus testing the spirit of tolerance or resistance of those who have to do the listening and the credibility of those who are addressing the Assembly.9.	Several times from this very rostrum we have expressed the deep concern of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola over the impotence  the resignation or the abdication of the competent inter-national bodies with regard to facing up to the proliferation of hotbeds of tension  fomented directly or indirectly by the imperialist Powers.10.	No one here should be unaware of the causes and agents responsible for such a dark international picture. We repeat the question: how long will the peoples and Governments that cherish peace and justice have to wait for the adequate bodies existing within the United Nations truly to meet their responsibilities and firmly take the most effective measuresâwhich  by the way  are available to themâ with regard to those who violate the fundamental principles of the Charter; carry out colonial wars and foment aggression of every kind  directly or indirectly  against States which take independent and progressive positions; practise economic plundering in the underdeveloped countries and persist in preventing the gradual bridging of the gap between the wealthy or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; deliberately hinder the serious efforts made by the socialist countries and the progressive and democratic forces to achieve detente  general and complete disarmament  a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction  especially nuclear weapons; encourage the arms race  thus assuring fantastic profits for their military consortia and leading to growing increases in military budgets and expenditures; multiply the carrying out of huge military manoeuvres intended to intimidate or even to commit aggression against certain peoples or States; do not respect the relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] undermine the authority and the efforts of the Secretary-General in carrying out his lofty responsibilities by failing to provide him with the necessary means; threaten international peace and security by military intervention and illegal occupation of territories  by interference in the internal affairs of other States and by not respecting the principle of non-recourse to force and of the settlement of disputes by negotiations?11.	All these aspects  but especially the unbridled arms race with its spectre of a nuclear war  involve a phenomenal increase in expenditures  which in turn increases inflation  causing huge budgetary deficits and further reducing the already shrinking volume of economic assistance provided to the underdeveloped countries  a factor which in itself has greatly contributed to the present economic crisis  one which can be solved only by taking measures to establish a new international economic order  a measure already advocated several years ago by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.12.	Given this alarming situation  which clearly endangers the future of peoples  and faced with the growing tragedy that is being experienced by millions of human beings who are still deprived of their freedom and their right to choose their own destiny and who do not possess the ways and means to counteract slavery and humiliation  tyranny and poverty  famine  ignorance and disease  it is imperative that at this session the General Assembly commit itself to the search for effective ways and means to solve the problems which afflict mankind.13.	In looking at the problems that face the African continent  we feel once again that the current situation in southern Africa must be given very special attention at this session of the General Assembly  since we are confronted by a type of deadlock in the development of the independence process for Namibia. No one is unaware that the Namibian question was broadly discussed last year in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  in the Security Council and in the General Assembly and that  subsequently  diplomatic efforts were undertaken by the interested parties in order to secure  in accordance with the Lusaka understanding of 16 February 1984  the unilateral disengagement of South African troops from Angolan territory and to create adequate conditions for negotiations between the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the Pretoria regime  under the auspices of the United Nations  in order to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).14.	In spite of the serious commitment by the Angolan side and SWAPO  the South African military disengagement  which was planned to take place within 30 days  has not been completed. A series of pretexts have systematically been presented by the Pretoria regime during the seven months that have already passed. It is becoming clear that there is a lack of seriousness on the part of South Africa  which is deliberately trying to delay or prevent the independence process of Namibia by attempting now to establish a double linkage  that is to say  to subordinate the completion of the withdrawal of its troops to the results of the negotiations under way with SWAPO  on the one hand  and to make the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) conditional upon the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces from the People's Republic of Angola  on the other.15.	In this regard  we feel that it would be useful to recall a passage from the joint declaration of the Angolan and Cuban Governments made on 19 March 1984:""In the context of this peace effort on the part of Angola  the joint declaration of 4 February [1982] remains in full force and constitutes a basis of principle for any negotiated situation that will eliminate the current tension and ensure peace and full independence for the nations of this region.""Having strict regard to what is laid down in the above-mentioned joint declaration  the Governments of Cuba and Angola reiterate that they will reinitiate  by their own decision and in exercise of their sovereignty  the execution of the gradual withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist military contingent as soon as the following requirements are met:""1. Unilateral withdrawal of the racist troops of South Africa from Angolan territory;""2. Strict implementation of resolution 435 (1978) of the United Nations Security Council  the accession of Namibia to true independence and the total withdrawal of the South African troops which are illegally occupying that country;""3. Cessation of any act of direct aggression or threat of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola on the part of South Africa  the United States of America and their allies.""""4. Cessation of all aid to the counter-revolutionary organization UNITA and any other puppet group from South Africa  the United States of America and their allies . . .""Satisfaction of these demands would mean respect for the rules of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations and observance of the many resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity.""16.	It is therefore clear that the Angolan and Cuban Governments have never questioned the principle  as such  of the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces. It is also clear that the Angolan Government has always taken a flexible attitude as long as doing so does not call into question the guiding principles of its foreign policy and its national interests. Angola has put forward constructive proposals on several occasions. We therefore reject any responsibility for the present deadlock which we find in the independence process for Namibia. Such responsibility lies fully with South Africa and the United States.17.	It seems useful for us to emphasize once again that Namibia is a trust territory of the United Nations and has been one for more than 30 years. This means that every State Member of the United Nations has direct responsibilities with regard to the independence process of that Territory. Unfortunately  it seems that a large number of States Members of the United Nations have forgotten those responsibilities  for when they leave this heavy burden on the shoulders of the Angolan Government they do not act in accordance with the mandate.18.	Furthermore  in 1967 the General Assembly adopted a resolution by which it decided to establish or constitute the United Nations Council for Namibia and to define its mandate.19.	Thus  the following questions arise. Who has prevented the United Nations Council for Namibia from fulfilling its mandate and for what reason? Since 1967  numerous resolutions have been adopted with regard to Namibia's accession to independence and the illegality of its occupation by South Africa. Why did Namibia not accede to independence before November 1975? Was it the fault of the Angolans  who were not even independent  or of the Cubans  who were not even in Angola? How can the responsibility for the delay in the Namibian independence process now be put on the Angolan Government by evoking its alleged intransigence? Has the Security Council nothing to say about the failure to ensure the implementation of its own resolution 435 (1978)?20.	As has been emphasized by the President of the People's Republic of Angola ""This process  which is unfolding very slowly  is linked to the recent failure of the negotiations on the cease-fire between SWAPO and the Pretoria regime and this makes it difficult to preserve the present atmosphere of detente on the border between Angola and Namibia. It is therefore essential to increase the pressure of international public opinion on South Africa to respect its commitments  establish a cease-fire agreement with SWAPO and announce the date for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978).""Nevertheless  as also stated by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos ""In the southern part of our continent  the People's Republic of Angola continues to be the main target of the global strategy of the imperialist Powers  which are trying to destabilize and paralyse the legitimate nationalist Governments of African countries which are fighting to affirm their identity  independence and national sovereignty.""21.	On the other hand  everyone is aware of the progressive deterioration of the internal situation in South Africa  as the contradictions within the hateful apartheid regime increase. The valiant fighters of the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] persist heroically in their political and military actions  the fundamental rights of the overwhelming majority of the South African people continue to be trampled upon and the brutality and arbitrary detentions escalate. All this could be seen just before and after the adoption of the so-called constitutional reforms.22.	Thus  the time is now propitious for each State Member of the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities and its commitmentsâif only in the interest of the credibility of this international bodyâand consequently for each State Member that is able to do so to give assistance of various kinds to SWAPO and the ANC; to provide  individually or collectively  as a matter of urgency  all possible material and financial assistance to the People's Republic of Angola; to begin  at the international and national levels  an intensive  permanent campaign demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory; and to exert every form of pressure on the Pretoria regime and also on its ""friends and allies""  including comprehensive mandatory sanctionsâso often advocated but so far prevented by certain Western Powers from being appliedâwith the object of bringing to an end the illegal occupation of Namibia and ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any further delay and without any absurd pre-conditions.23.	We should like now to state or reiterate the position of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola on a number of specific political questions which continue to disturb international relations and threaten world peace and security.24.	With regard to the situation prevailing in Chad  we feel that it is for the Chadian people to resolve their own problems without any foreign military interference or intervention. We believe that the representatives of that country should be able to decide their own future through negotiations  seated around a table  without constraint or hindrance  in conformity with the efforts and resolutions of the OAU.25.	We reiterate our conviction that the resolution of the conflict between the Frente POLISARIO1 and the Kingdom of Morocco is to be found in the implementation of resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX) on Western Sahara  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983. It is to be regretted that the Kingdom of Morocco obstinately refuses to embark upon direct negotiations  which indicates insolent disdain for the sovereign decision of the Heads of State and Government of independent Africa. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the heroic people of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and particularly with the valiant fighters of the Frente POLISARIO.26.	We reaffirm our unshakeable solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and their legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  in their continuing struggle to regain their homeland  usurped by the Zionist entity  and to establish an independent State. Furthermore  we reaffirm our dedication to the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights  adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  which was held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. We demand once again the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and we salute the efforts of the Lebanese people to ensure their unity  their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. In this context  we are in favour of a Middle East peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation  on a basis of equality  of all the parties concerned or interested.27.	With regard to the tragedy which has befallen the people of East Timor because of the occupation by Indonesian armed forces  it is time for the international community seriously and unambiguously to commit itself to a search for a lasting solution to the problem  which has been dragging on for nine years.28.	Thousands of patriots have been and continue to be imprisoned and tortured. Others have died in armed confrontations or been summarily shot. Yet others die of hunger. The International Committee of the Red Cross is forbidden from entering East Timor in spite of its purely humanitarian mission. As part of the framework of the solution of the conflict through negotiations and in keeping with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV)  the leaders of the Democratic Republic of East Timor have proposed a peace plan  including direct or indirect talks between Portugal  Indonesia and FRETILIN  under the auspices of the United Nations  in order to debate the establishment of a multinational United Nations force to ensure the operation of a transitional administration  the implementation of adequate provisions for the stationing of belligerent forces  the organization of free and democratic consultations of the Maubere people and the setting of a date for the transfer of sovereignty.29.	It is regrettable that the Portuguese Government is not clearly and firmly meeting its historical  political and legal responsibilities for East Timor and that the Indonesian Government is turning a deaf ear to the peace proposals already presented by FRETILIN  which deserve the unreserved support of the international community.30.	None the less  it is comforting to note the concerns expressed by United States congressmen and senators and also by Pope John Paul II over the genocide of the Maubere people  as well as the positions taken by the workers' parties of Australia and New Zealand.31.	We urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts until a definitive solution to this situation is found  and we appeal to the member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to identify themselves with and support the struggle of the valiant people of East Timor.32.	Central America has been undergoing extremely alarming developments as a result of the threats and military intervention of the United States Administration  notably in Nicaragua and El Salvador  What is needed in this region is a search for peace through a negotiated political solution. For this purpose  we support the courageous positions taken by the Government of Nicaragua as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group  reflected in the contents of the revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.33.	In order for peace to prevail in Central America  there must be peace in El Salvador and an end to the aggression committed against Nicaragua and El Salvador. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberation Nacional and the Frente Democratico Revolucionario  which are the only legitimate representatives of the Salvadorian people.34.	We renew our unfailing support for the Cuban revolution and denounce the aggressions and threats against the Cuban people. We reiterate our feelings of solidarity with the peoples of Panama  Grenada  Chile  Uruguay  Bolivia and Puerto Rico in their just struggles for their national interests  their independence and their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.35.	We reaffirm our support for the efforts to have the dispute over the borderlines between Guyana and Venezuela resolved through bilateral negotiations. On the other hand  and in keeping with General Assembly resolutions  we register our hope that there be  in the immediate future  a start of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina with a view to restoring to Argentina the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.36.	We also reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Indo-Chinese countries to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia without any foreign intervention  and for a constructive dialogue among the parties to the conflict. None the less  we regret and consider it inconceivable that the Kampuchean people are still not represented in the United Nations by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. This is an injustice that must be remedied.37.	We reiterate our solidarity with the just cause of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country without any foreign interference and with the call for the withdrawal of the American troops from the southern part of Korean territory. To this end  we support the proposal concerning the holding of tripartite negotiations and the adoption of a peace agreement as a substitute for the Armistice Agreement.38.	We also reaffirm our support for the position and efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in the search for the normalization  through negotiations  of the situation in that country.39.	We reiterate also our full solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus and support their efforts to maintain their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment.40.	Once again we make an urgent appeal to the Governments of Iraq and Iran to put an end to the war and find a negotiated solution to the dispute that separates them.41.	It is unpleasant to note that the Angolan Government once again finds itself forced to devote the greatest part of its human and material resources to the defence of its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. The undeclared war that has been opposed upon us by the racist and Fascist South African regime must stop.42.	It Angolan people dearly wish for peace. They have never committed aggression nor do they wish to commit aggression against anyone. They want only to live in peace and work to build a future of progress and happiness in a just society that they have freely chosen.43.	The struggle continues! Victory is certain!"
"3",100,"ALB",39,1984,"ï»¿It is with particular pleasure  Sir  that on behalf of the Albanian delegation  I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly.127.	The Albanian delegation also wishes to congratulate Brunei Darussalam on its admission as a Member of the United Nations.128.	The development of political events in the world since the last session of the General Assembly shows that the international situation remains grave and fraught with tension and dangers that threaten peace and security. Our whole planet is racked by contradictions and confrontations.129.	This situation becomes even more precarious as it develops against the background of a profound and all-round economic crisis which has the capitalist and revisionist world in its grip and which manifests itself in high levels of inflation and unemployment  in stagnation of production  or in recession. At a time when expenditure in many fields affecting the social condition and the standard of living of working people has sunk to an all-time low  unproductive expenditureâon armaments  for exampleâhas reached astronomical figures.130.	The further concentration and internationalization of capital  the extension of the network of multinationals to every corner of the world  high interest rates and the domination of the United States dollar in the international monetary and financial system have created serious situations and brought about great tension even in the economies of the powerful industrial countries  not to mention the small countries and the developing countries.131.	The picture is gloomier still in the developing countries  which are staggering under the burden of a colossal debt amounting to almost $900 billion  and many of those countries are not in a position to pay even the interest rates on these enslaving credits. 132.	For more than two years there has been much talkâand not without purposeâabout the supposed recovery of the world economy. Experience  however  has shown that in many countries the economic situation has only worsened.133.	We are particularly struck by the attempts by United States imperialism to create the impression that the world economy will come out of this deadlock because of the recovery of the United States economy. However  people cannot fail to see that the so-called recovery which the United States publicizes means only an increase in the value of the dollar  an increase in interest rates and a proliferation of protectionist measures which have an asphyxiating effect on the economies of other countries  particularly the developing countries. So the crisis has not been overcome but has only subsided  and there are signs that it may burst forth more fiercely and with still more destructive consequences.134.	Furthermore  even the most recent international conferences  such as the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  and the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August  have shown that the overwhelming majority of Member States continue to suffer from the destructive consequences of the crisis. R became clear at those conferences that the imperialist Powers use their promises of aid to the developing countries to create illusions among them and thus preserve their unequal and discriminatory relations with them in order to continue their neo-colonialist exploitation. This situation makes it even clearer to the developing countries that their best course of action is to continue their resolute struggle to establish complete sovereignty over their national assets and to oppose all practices that prolong neo-colonialist exploitation.135.	The more convulsive the fever of the crisis and the fiercer the rivalry between the super-Powers and the greater its dangers  the more they try to saddle others with the consequences of the crisis and to blackmail the peoples with their weapons and their economic might.136.	We are witness today to the fact that the super-Powers  finding no more room for expansion  are acting in such a way as to increase daily the threat of armed confrontation. It is their fierce rivalry for domination and hegemony in the world and their aggressive and militaristic course of action that pose a serious threat to the freedom and independence of peoples.137.	Hardly a day goes by without Soviet-United States rivalry and the tense East-West relations being mentioned in one way or the other  even here at the United Nations. Moreover  the propaganda of the super-Powers is designed in such a way as to create the impression that the world cannot cope with any problem except within the axis of those relations. This is not unintentional. The United States and the Soviet Union are using the tense situation that exists in their relations as a convenient justification for the intensification of their arms race and their war preparations. As they see it  the peoples must accept as inevitable that the future of mankind depends on the future of those relations. Moreover  they attempt to create a psychosis of capitulation  according to which no country  no State  no people could live outside their atomic umbrellas.138.	The deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe  which has virtually dominated European and world politics during this period  is intended  among other things  to inculcate this psychosis of capitulation in the European countries and peoples. It is intended to numb and paralyse their resolve to defend their independence and national dignity and to reinforce the control and the diktat of the superpowers over their allies. The demagogic fuss of the super-Powers about the deployment in Europe of their missiles  and their mutual accusations to ""justify"" upsetting or restoring balance  serve simply as a smoke-screen to cover up the implementation of their plans and to justify Soviet-United States monopoly of nuclear weapons and missiles  and to maintain constant pressure by means of their weapons  even without using those weapons.139.	It is clear that the deployment of medium- range missiles marks a new escalation of the arms race  which is assuming unprecedented proportions and dimensions  even extending into outer space.140.	The peoples of Europe have not failed to show by concrete actions their true feelings about the game that is being played at the expense of European security. They have come out in the streets to oppose the deployment of missiles and nuclear weapons on their continent  to oppose the military presence of the United States and the Soviet Union  and to oppose NATO and the Warsaw Treaty.141.	This proves that the countries of Europe cannot and must not seek a way out of this situation in the offers made to them by the imperialist superpowers. It is not by maintaining the factors that generate war but by destroying and eliminating them that the European peoples can assure their own defence and their free and independent development.142.	It is necessary to avoid falling into the trap set by the super-Powers  which  on the one hand  makes the deployment of new nuclear missiles in Europe and  on the other  organizes  for purely demagogic purposes  meetings and conferences which are allegedly for the purpose of taking measures for ""strengthening mutual confidence"" regarding European security.143.	The Albanian Government has expressed itself resolutely against the deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles by either the United States or the Soviet Union on the European continent. We have also strongly supported the efforts of the peoples of Europe to oppose the transformation of the old continent into an arena of rivalry and armed conflict.144.	The Albanian delegation considers it necessary to emphasize that the nuclear threat must not prevent the peoples from seeing the danger of conventional weapons which is just as serious. The more than 100 local and regional wars and conflicts which have occurred since the Second World War have been fought with conventional weapons. The sale and supply of arms have become today a most profitable business  particularly for the United States and the Soviet Union.145.	It would be extremely dangerous for the peace- loving countries and peoples to disregard the unrestrained arms race in conventional weapons being carried on by the imperialist Powers. Hence  the struggle for the defence of peace and against nuclear armament cannot be separated from the strong opposition to the arms race in general.146.	The exacerbation of the situation in Europe is directly felt in the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean  which are not free from the interference of the super-Powers.147.	A problem worrying the Mediterranean countries is the constantly increasing presence of the naval fleets of the two super-Powers in the Mediterranean. Those fleets are arrogantly and brazenly criss-crossing the Mediterranean  from the Bosporus to Gibraltar  as if it were a United States or Soviet lake. By their policy and their military means  the superpowers are trying to transform that region  which has seen the flourishing of outstanding civilizations throughout its history  into a theatre for their destructive war operations.148.	The interests of peace demand that the Mediterranean countries act resolutely and energetically so as to dispel the fleets of the super-Powers from that region  and that they take concrete measures which would make the presence of those fleets there difficult and even impossible.149.	In the Balkan Peninsula  the super-Powers are trying to stir up those elements and factors which add to the insecurity of the region. The Albanian Government upholds the view that the freedom and the independence of the Balkan States can be guaranteed neither by NATO nor by the Warsaw Pact.150.	For peace to be safeguarded in that region  concrete steps must be taken to bring about the departure of foreign troops and the dismantling of foreign bases in the Balkan countries. No facilities should be given to the naval fleets of the superpowers  and their interference in the internal affairs of the States of the region should be resolutely opposed.151.	With its policy  socialist Albania has proved that it has been and is a factor of peace and stability in the Balkans. For its part  it has made any interference in its internal affairs by the super-Powers impossible and has shown by its deeds that it follows a policy of good-neighbourliness with the countries of the region  as can be seen from the positive developments in its relations with Turkey  Italy and Greece.152.	An intensification of the military activity of the aggressive imperialist blocs has recently been observed not only in the southern part of Europe but also in the north. The overt and covert exercises of their warships  submarines and aeroplanes from the Baltic to the North Sea  the large-scale manoeuvres of their naval and air forces in that region and the surrounding area are not gestures of friendship towards the Nordic peoples  who value peace and freedom equally and cannot accept this show of strength that seriously threatens their own future and that of the continent.153.	The Middle East remains one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension in the world. There the enslaving and predatory interests of United States imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism  of the Israeli Zionists and of other imperialist Powers clash fiercely with each other. The policy of the superpowers in the Middle East has kept that zone in a permanently explosive state.154.	Experience has clearly shown that the United States Marines and the multinational force were not sent to Lebanon to bring Israeli aggression to a halt or to establish calm in that country but rather to make possible the implementation of the Zionist and imperialist plans to expel the Palestinians from Lebanon by violence and terror and deal the death blow to the Palestinian liberation movement. For the achievement of those aims  they brought into action not only armed force but also all types of plots and intrigues to divide the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and to engage them in a fratricidal war.155.	Israel  with the support of United States imperialism  has robbed the Palestinian people of its land  homes and country  perpetrated monstrous crimes against it and turned it into a refugee people  dispersed by the force of arms into many other countries. However  in spite of the numerous difficulties faced and superhuman sacrifices made  the heroic Palestinian people have never laid down its weapons in the struggle to win its legitimate rights.156.	For years now  a succession of plans for the alleged solution of the Middle East crisis has been presented by the imperialist Powers. Of late  the Soviet Union has seen fit to come up again with its old proposal for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. This is obviously a diplomatic ploy to make the most of the failure of the United States plan and to be an equal participant in the game that is being played out to the detriment of the Arab peoples. But all these proposals and plans of the super-Powers are directed against the interests of the Arab peoples in general and the Palestinian people in particular. In one way or another  they favour Israel and the continued presence and interests of the super-Powers in that region.157.	In his recently published book  Reflections on the Middle East  the leader of the Albanian people Comrade Enver Hoxha wrote:""the crisis in the Middle East can never be solved until the martyred Palestinian people regain their homeland stolen from them by the Israeli aggressors  and this will be achieved only when the political  economic and military influence of the super-Powers and the other imperialist Powers has been dealt powerful blows ... by all the Arab peoples .... Only resolute  uncompromising struggle  based on genuine Arab unity  will lead them to victory  to true independence and freedom158.	The war between Iraq and Iran  which has been continuing for nearly four years now  has caused the peoples of those two countries incalculable human and material losses. We hold that that war must be brought to an end. The settlement of disagreements between Iran and Iraq through negotiations would deal a powerful blow to the superpowers and to all those who want to warm their hands in the fires kindled in the Middle East. The super-Powers want the war to continue  because it serves their plans for military intervention in the Persian Gulf countries and for a worsening of the Middle East crisis. We hope that these two friendly peoples and countries will soon find a common language to put an end to bloodshed  as that is in their own interest and in that of the struggle of the peoples of the region.159.	The laying of mines in the Red Sea and the haste of the super-Powers and certain other countries to dispatch their warships and helicopters there in order allegedly to clear the mines are part of the pretext they have long sought to build up their military presence there and to maintain a permanently tense situation in that region. The present scenario in the Red Sea greatly resembles and  indeed  appears to be a variation of the scenario prefacing the intervention of the multinational force in Lebanon  and there must be a connection between them.160.	The Soviet social-imperialist aggressors have kept Afghanistan occupied for nearly five years now but have not managed to subdue the struggle of the freedom-loving Afghan people. That struggle demonstrates once again that a people  however small in number  is invincible when fighting for a just cause.161.	The African continent remains the object of imperialist ambitions  especially of the two superpowers  which  in order to attain their strategic objectives  continue to hatch plots against the African peoples  stir up old quarrels and feuds which they themselves have left among those peoples like unexploded mines  kindle local conflagrations and conflicts in order to facilitate their penetration still deeper into the continent and continue their neo- colonialist exploitation of those peoples.162.	While the Fascist regime of South Africa continues to promote racial violence and maintain the abhorrent system of apartheid to occupy Namibia and to threaten the freedom and independence of neighbouring countries  the United States and other imperialist Powers strive to rehabilitate that regime in Africa and in the international community  which long ago branded it as unlawful.163.	The African peoples  especially those of southern Africa  should have no illusions about the ambitions and policy of the Pretoria regime  that bulwark of racism and colonialism on the African continent. They will not yield before the force of arms  pressures and diabolical tactics. For its part  the Albanian people has always firmly supported and will continue to support the struggle of the Namibian and other African peoples to liquidate the remnants of colonialism and racism and the intrigues and interference of the imperialist Powers  especially the super-Powers  in their continent.164.	The situation in Central America continues to be tense and fraught with serious threats to the freedom and independence of the peoples of that region and of Latin America. The invasion of Grenada and the pressures  threats and acts of direct provocation against Nicaragua clearly attest to the intensification of interference and the unchanging aggressive policy of United States imperialism on that continent.165.	The situation in that unstable region is made even more complex because Soviet social-imperialism is very cunningly trying to exploit the struggle of those peoples against United States oppression and domination in order to increase its influence in that region.166.	This is a living expression of the policy that the two super-Powers pursue in order to challenge one another in the regions that they consider to be their spheres of influence. This is the aim of the ""differentiated policy"" of the United States towards Eastern Europe and the attempts of the Soviet Union to arrive at a separate ""detente"" with Western Europe.167.	The United States talks more and more about the so-called ""Pacific initiative""  under which the attention of United States policy would be focused more on that region. It is quite clear that  apart from the pressure it seeks to put on its European allies  that ""initiative"" does not go beyond the limits of the military and economic rivalry between the superpowers that has caused them to put their battle fleets in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and thus to create political and military groupings in Asia and the Pacific in order to further their regional and worldwide strategic aims.168.	The Albanian people and Government support the just demand of the Korean people for the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the independent reunification of their country.169.	The peoples of South-East Asia  who have for decades fought for freedom and national independence  continue to be the object of intrigues  interference and pressures on the part of the imperialist Powers  which are trying to prevent them from deciding their own destiny.170.	The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea must occupy its rightful place in the United Nations.171.	At a time when the international situation is steadily worsening and is fraught with serious threats to peace and freedom  the peoples must be more vigilant than ever before.172.	The difficult situations which have been and continue to be created in the world make it necessary for States Members of the United Nations to see things as they are  freeing themselves of any feeling of inferiority or fatalism.173.	The strength and omnipotence of the superpowers should never be seen as definitive. The temporary strength of aggressors has always been based on the fear  retreat and submission of others. History has convincingly demonstrated that in the face of the strength of peoples determined to fight in defence of their independence  peace and freedom  the super-Powers are weak and powerless.174.	This year  the Albanian people will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the liberation of their homeland and the triumph of their people's revolution. Our people have accomplished more in these four decades than in all the preceding centuries because  under the leadership of the Albanian Labour Party  with Comrade Enver Hoxha at its head  and thanks to their own hard work and stubborn efforts  they have emerged out of the darkness into light and have made great socialist changes in all fields.175.	The all-round development of the country  based on self-reliance  the building up of industry founded on its own domestic resources and of agriculture so that the country is self-sufficient in foodstuffs  the major successes achieved in the fields of education  culture and science  and the training of a considerable number of workers at the high and middle levels have guaranteed uninterrupted economic and cultural development and a steady improvement in the standard of living of the working people.176.	The major changes brought about in Albania in these 40 years of the people's power are clear evidence of the superiority of the socialist system.177.	Our State pursues a foreign policy of friendship with all peace-loving countries; it is a completely independent policy  for it is not conditioned by political or military pacts or by exclusive economic organizations. We are in favour of commercial  cultural and scientific exchanges with other countries based on mutual advantage and free of all discrimination and prejudice. Chauvinism and the encouragement of hatred and animosity among peoples are alien to us. Each people and nation  whether large or small  has the absolute right to defend and affirm its national identity.178. Albania is a small country  but in spite of this  it has the same right as all the other States Members of the United Nations to express its views openly and unhesitatingly  convinced that in this manner it best serves its highest national interests  the cause of peoples and international security."
"4",168,"ARE",39,1984,"ï»¿At the outset  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is an expression of the international community's recognition of your experience and ability  and an assertion of the important role played by your friendly country  Zambia. We are confident that your ability will contribute positively and effectively to the realization of the hopes pinned on this session.153.	We are pleased to extend our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who skilfully presided over the thirty-eighth session; we highly praise his efforts aimed at the settlement of international disputes.154.	We should like to seize this opportunity to renew our expression of confidence in the endeavours undertaken by the Secretary-General and to reaffirm our support for his persistent efforts aimed at ensuring adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and enhancing its role in the settlement of the international disputes that threaten the security and existence of mankind.155.	My country's delegation is pleased warmly to welcome the admission of the State of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations; we look forward to the establishment of mutual co-operation with that friendly country based on our common ties.156.	As we are approaching the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we hope that the day will come when the countries still under colonialism or foreign occupation will become free and join the United Nations.117. The Secretary-General has indicated  in his report on the work of the Organization  that the past year has been characterized by great-Power tension and by violence or threatened violence in various parts of the world. The cycle of violence referred to by the Secretary-General and undoubtedly involving almost all parts of the world  is caused by lack of good sense  by the obstinate adherence by States to concepts of self-interest and by the exertion of pressure on third-world countries to prevent them from achieving stability and devoting their national resources to the development of their economic potential. Hence  security has become the preoccupation of individuals and nations in our contemporary world.158. Our region  the Gulf area  is one of the regions of the world where tension has increased as a result of the destructive war raging between two neighboursâ Iraq and Iran. The consequences of that war have affected international shipping lines  thus seriously endangering international navigation in the Gulf area and inflicting severe damage not only on the economies of the Gulf countries but also on those of the entire world.159.	Events have shown that the course of that war  and its consequences  will only bring havoc to the two Muslim peoples in particular and to the security of the Gulf area  as well as to world peace in general. The real beneficiaries of the continuation of that war are those who exploit regional disputes for the attainment of their own aims  namely  the extension of their spheres of influence in the world through the creation of regional climates conducive to that end.160.	In view of our responsibility with regard to the region's stability and security as well as the maintenance of international peace  we have supported all the efforts being exerted by the Secretary-General  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries for the halting of this haemorrhage  bringing the combatants to the negotiating table to settle their differences through peaceful means  infusing a spirit of peace and leading to an accord between the two States.161.	In our endeavour to achieve these lofty goals  we have not only supported those initiatives  but we have also contributed  in co-ordination with the member States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  by contacting both parties in an attempt to put an end to that war in a manner guaranteeing the legitimate rights of both countries.162.	In this context  we put on record with appreciation the positive response exhibited by brotherly Iraq towards the initiatives taken and its declared readiness to end the war immediately. We look forward to the day when the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will do likewise and respond positively to the efforts and initiatives undertaken for that purpose.163.	We  in the Gulf  attach particular importance to freedom of navigation because of its close connection with the development of our resources and economy  in addition to its significance to the world economy. We are opposed to any action which hinders or restricts freedom of navigation on the high seas. Hence  we were gravely concerned over the recent events in the Red Sea  given their inherent danger and threat to navigation in that vital waterway.164.	On the basis of this understanding and in view of our area's direct link with the Indian Ocean  my country continues strongly to support the efforts undertaken for die adoption of the necessary measures for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean is a Zone of Peace and for effective compliance with it on the part of the international community.165.	The United Arab Emirates has affirmed on more than one occasion that the security of the Gulf area is exclusively the security of its States and they are directly responsible for it. This principle is an extension of the general principle that mv country continues to adhere to  namely  non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.166.	The Middle East is one of those regions that continues to suffer from tensions. It witnesses daily  in an unprecedented manner  displacement  murder  destruction  wars  occupation and violence. The region has become the scene of the most violent acts of aggression in the contemporary world. An entire people has been denied stability and peace in a free and independent homeland  while other peoples are threatened with the same destiny. Calls for help and denunciations have been made on an almost daily basis from this and other forums; but the world stands helpless  despite all the progress made in various fields and at all levels  unable to put an end to the destructive violence which has already lasted too long and has almost become the inevitable destiny of man in the region.167.	The conditions which prevail in the Middle East region stem  in their origin and development  from Israel's continued persistence in perpetrating aggression and its refusal to comply with the resolutions of the international community. For this reason  the question of Palestine remains unresolved. It constitutes a source of continued concern because of the suffering of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples and the risk of global confrontation which could lead to a destructive war extending in its effects beyond the States of the region  to engulf the whole world.168.	The true reasons behind the continuation of this problem are well known to the international community  namely  Israel's desire to achieve the Zionist dream by means of expansion and hegemony over the States of the region  the convergence of this desire with the goal of certain States to play havoc with the destiny of the region's peoples and the pursuance by these States of policies hindering the Security Council from adopting resolutions aimed at putting an end to aggression and holding the aggressor responsible for its aggression.169.	We maintain and stress the conviction that the Middle East problem is a clear expression and an inevitable outcome of the failure to settle the core question  namely  the question of Palestine. The conclusion of a just and comprehensive settlement should be predicated  fundamentally  on the following: first  recognition of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to return to its homeland and to establish its independent State on its national soil under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative  the PLO; and secondly  Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem.170.	The continued absence of such settlement could lead only to further deterioration of the situation and greater tension and  consequently  to the creation of new problems  as is the case with the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. Thus  the world finds itself  once again  confronted with derivative issues that require further efforts that may drag on indefinitely.171.	Lebanon  a vivid example of this  has been the victim of Israeli aggression and occupation for over two years. In spite of all the efforts made and resolutions adopted by the United Nations  particularly Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982)  which call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces immediately and unconditionally to the internationally recognized borders  the Israeli forces continue to occupy southern Lebanon and to subject its population to all forms of military and economic pressures in order to force them to leave their lands. In this context  we regret the exercise by the United States of its right of veto last month  thus preventing all the other members of the Security Council from adopting a humanitarian draft resolution  calling upon Israel to desist from its inhuman practices against the population of the south and to comply with the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.172.	The separate attempts and the partial solutions aimed at addressing the Middle East problem will remain in their essence and ramifications  insufficient for establishing a sound basis for the desired just and comprehensive settlement. Therefore  we affirm that General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  which calls for the convening of an International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties  including the PLO  offers the appropriate framework for the establishment of the conditions for a just and durable peace in the region. We hope that certain major Powers will reconsider their position on the convening of this conference in conformity with their international responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.173.	Southern Africa  like the Middle East  continues to suffer from the abhorrent yoke of colonialism and the practices of racial discrimination  which constitute an affront to humanity. Such practices cast doubt on the ability of the international community to shoulder its responsibilities towards a large segment of mankind in the realization of justice  equality  freedom and human dignity. We salute the heroic struggle of the nationalists for freedom  equality and independence  and we reaffirm our belief in their just cause and our firm determination to continue to support their legitimate struggle.174.	We condemn the policy of apartheid pursued by the Government of South Africa. We consider that policy a crime against humanity  whose elimination requires concerted international efforts. This applies to the so-called new constitution introduced recently by the Pretoria regime and aimed at consolidating the policy of apartheid. Hence  we support Security Council resolution 554 (1984) and the recent resolution adopted by the General Assembly which condemned that act with all its implications.175.	On the same premise  we salute the just struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO  and we affirm our continued support for the self-determination  independence and territorial integrity of Namibia. We are very confident and unshaken in our belief that no matter how oppressive and evil aggression may be  it is inevitable for justice to win and for man's dignity to be respected.176.	In accordance with the basic principles upon which our foreign policy is predicated  together with our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and international norms and our conviction that non-interference in the internal affairs of other States is conducive to the alleviation  to a great extent  of international tension  we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and for the freedom of its people to establish the regime they choose. This applies to Kampuchea  whose people have long suffered from foreign interference. It also applies to the problems facing the States of Central America. In this connection  we endorse the principles and concepts adopted by the Contadora Group for the settlement or those problems. Likewise  we urge that the dispute between North Korea and South Korea be settled through free dialogue between the two countries in order to achieve the aspirations of their people for unity.177.	With regard to the question of Cyprus  we commend the recent efforts made by the Secretary- General to help the Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus to arrive at a solution to this problem that would guarantee the rights of both communities  ensure security and coexistence for the people of the island and guarantee the territorial integrity  independence and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.178.	We believe that arms control and disarmament are of vital importance for international peace and security and that they can be realized only in an atmosphere of political stability and mutual confidence  particularly among the States possessing nuclear weapons.179.	The Secretary-General has printed out in his report on the work of the Organization that the lack of concrete progress in disarmament and arms control has aroused deep fears of a nuclear confrontation. We are deeply concerned over the escalation of the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons and their storage in various parts of the world. Moreover  our concern is aggravated by the stalemate in the negotiations between the two super-Powers and the failure to resume them with regard to control of the development and production of certain kinds of nuclear weapons. Because of this grave situation  it is becoming more and more difficult to live in an atmosphere of escalating fear and panic from the possible outbreak of nuclear war. Furthermore  it is no longer possible to overlook the enormous resources that are wasted on armaments at a time when mankind is in dire need of those resources for the purposes of economic and social development.180.	The United Arab Emirates welcomes the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  including the region of the Middle East. We hope that the international community  and in particular the great Powers  will view this matter with the importance it deserves  since it constitutes a fundamental element in the maintenance of security and stability in the region.181.	The political situation cannot be examined separately from the prevailing economic problems. The economic problems in the world today indicate that the economic crisis continues to affect all countries. The current situation is not only disappointing but also a source of deep concern over the possible consequences.182.	While economic stagnation  low growth rates and high rates of unemployment and inflation have all become constant aspects of the world economy  their effects are most severely felt by the developing countries. Those countries are unable to sustain their economic and social development programmes and to arrest the continued deterioration in their already low standards of living. There is overall agreement that the continuation of such a situation could ultimately have catastrophic consequences.183.	Although in some developed countries the economy has experienced relatively slight recovery  that does not call for much optimism because that recovery is limited and has not brought about any real changes in economic policies with respect to current problems. In their economic policies  the developed countries have not always been willing to address the basic problems of the world economy.184.	Hence  the economies of the developing countries have continued to suffer a great deal from the consequences of such practices as continued protectionism  congestion of export markets  deterioration of the terms of trade  decline in export revenues  exacerbation of foreign debts  high level of interest rates and increasing pressure for instituting external structural adjustments. All of this has created enormous difficulties for the developing countries and made them unable to pursue their economic development programmes and to halt the erosion of their standards of living  thus creating a situation that could seriously threaten their social stability.185.	This critical situation of the world economy calls for serious and responsible consideration on the part of all in order to alleviate its negative effects within a comprehensive framework  with the participation of the developing and developed countries alike. It is therefore imperative to strengthen the role of the United Nations and its collective framework in a process of international economic reform.186.	It is also imperative to establish sound and objective foundations to be observed by all other international institutions in the consideration of the economic problems of the world on an interdependent  balanced and comprehensive basis  in order to lead ultimately to the establishment of a just and effective international economic order.187.	This appeal has its roots in numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  particularly those pertaining to the establishment of a new international economic order  it also stems from the continued efforts of the developing countries  represented by the Group of 77 which have been reflected in the positive decisions adopted by that Group in various economic forums; and it has been clearly expressed in our persistent pursuit to launch global negotiations  since we believe in the important role such negotiations could play in reforming the world economy.188.	We aspire to a world built on the solid foundations of justice  amity and peace  a world in which each State  big or small  will enjoy stability and a secure future."
"5",215,"ARG",39,1984,"ï»¿2. Mr  President  I wish first to express my personal congratulations to you on your unanimous election to your important position. We have two reasons to be pleasedâthat your well-known human and professional qualities represent an invaluable contribution to the success of the endeavours of the General Assembly  and that you represent Zambia and Africa  a brother continent of Latin America  whose hopes and demands we share.3.	I also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Jorge Illueca  Head of State of Panama and an eminent Latin American diplomat  who so skilfully presided over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We Argentines have special reasons to be grateful to him.4.	At the same time  we welcome Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations. Its admission emphasises once again the universality of the Organization.5.	Ten months ago  when Argentina was regaining its democratic life  I told the Congress of my country that our foreign policy would be the natural extension of our domestic policy. Both must be based on the same aspirations and  above all  on an identical system of values. Since we do not have two different moral codes  we do not have two different policies6.	All the reasons that drove us to political struggle  the heartfelt convictions that guided and supported us throughout the years  were based on a set of values that my country needed. Those values transcend a people and a territory. They can be applied to government actions that regulate domestic political life  to the way in which we approach our relations with other States and to the positions we adopt with regard to the problems of the international community.7.	However  defining an ethical system as the source of political action  which is  after all  the issue  is not simply an option that soothes the conscience of those who govern or a way of avoiding the practical  concrete problems of our time. This is not an abstract or idealistic position; rather  it is essential. It is to know why one governs  to know what type of society we seek for our countries  and what kind of world we want for mankind.8.	This thought stems from my conviction that the world order is dangerously distorted  the most obvious proof of which is that some countries seem not to wish for the rest of the world what they wish for themselves. In my opinion  this is the result of having replaced the moral view of the world order by a concept of power. It might be said that this is a naive thought. But let us examine where the so-called pragmatic ideas have led us.9.	Two types of problems affect our world as a whole: the crisis in the political order and the crisis in the international economic order.10.	We are witnessing today the extent to which strategic purposes tend almost exclusively to define relations between States. On the basis of these strategic ideas  a new phase in the nuclear arms race has begun  one that makes the boundary between peace and war very much more precarious and frail. I am speaking of the boundary between the life and the death of mankind. This is a tragic prospect  for which the strongest hold each other responsible  while the majority of the countries of the international community are made to stand idly by.11.	Bystanders and actors appear to follow two kinds of logic: the logic of peace  which is susceptible to ethical arguments  and the logic of the arms race  which is the result of a political concept of power based on threats. The worrying thing is that those who hold to one logic do not listen to or hear those who hold to the other.12.	What good are our arguments if they cannot penetrate the logic of others  in particular the logic of those who are truly capable of altering the situation?13.	What means are available to us to moderate  with our ethical reasoning  the reasoning of power and threat?14.	Sometimes  everything seems to indicate that our role is limited to making demands  or possibly to denouncing this state of affairs. None the less  we shall continue our anguished clamour  because we know that our voice must be raised unceasingly in defence of peace. That is why I ratified the 22 May 1984 Joint Declaration  together with the Heads of State or Government of Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania. In that Declaration we stated that we share the conviction that there must not be another world war and that the advance towards global suicide must be restrained and halted. The world cannot oscillate between a devastating nuclear war and peace. We must work together to influence present and future events.15.	That position with regard to peace has been held consistently by all the democratic Governments of my country. Thus  in accordance with the policy which had been developed previously by President Hipolito Yrigoyen  another of my predecessors  President Arturo Frondizi  said in 1961  at the sixteenth session of the General Assembly: ""invariably  with exemplary consistency  Argentinaâs international policy has been based on the three fundamental principles of international lifeâthe legal equality of States  non-intervention in domestic affairs  and the self-determination of peoples . . .""... We have opposed foreign intervention and any kind of pressure  whether political  economic  legal or ideological  by one nation upon another.16.	I further believe that the maintenance of peace involves a wider reality  in which we are not mere spectators. Indeed  in our world  it is not only arms that endanger peace. The international political order is not only increasingly a strategic military order  but is also increasingly dependent on the world economic order.17.	Over the decades we have related political questions to East-West tension  while  in connection with the economic order  we have referred to North- South relations. But I believe that even if we can identify two distinct kinds of tensionâone among equals and the other among those who are not equalâthese are not isolated from one another. Indeed  today we can assert that peace and security alike could be seriously affected by the enormous disparities between the rich countries and the developing countries of the world.18.	In a developing world characterized by instability and social tension  national conflicts have increasingly attracted the attention of those with strategic interests. The evolution of the social and economic conflict in the South has attracted the interest of the super-Powers. Our territories have thus become the victims of harassment by both Powers. This results  first of all  in the exacerbation of local conflicts; in this way  although the suffering continues to be national  the conflict becomes more and more a foreign one. Secondly  this interference intensifies the strategic conflict itself; in this way  the balance of the Northâunstable and dangerous as it isâis reflected in clashes in the developing world.19.	We have seen and continue to see this phenomenon whereby a national conflict is intensified by strategic conflict to the point at which a nation is broken down. Hence  to our own problems is added the problem of a confrontationâcovert or overtâ between the big Powers on this third ground  in this third arena provided by the countries of the so-called South.20.	In sum  I believe that there are two things which threaten peace. On the one hand  there is the arms race and the direct strategic confrontation between the big Powers  and  on the other hand  there is the instability  injustice and poverty in the South. There is very little we can do about the first  but the second involves us directly.21.	It will suffice to note as an example of the second cause the extremely serious economic situation now obtaining in certain regions of Africa owing to a persistent drought and the lack of the material resources necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and development. Africa must have the support and solidarity of the whole international community if it is to overcome this crisis  with all its unforeseeable consequences.22.	It is a question not only of putting forward arguments favourable to the developing countries  but also of showing that the destiny of those countries directly affects the industrialized world.23.	The ethical reasons that make us call for a more equitable international order unite with practical reasons  for an unjust world is today more than ever before an unstable and insecure world. Justice in the South is today more than ever before a necessary prerequisite for peace in the North.24.	The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77 have clearly pointed out the unjust and unstable situation which I have described. The international community as a whole  and the developed countries in particular  must show their willingness to listen to the economic and political proposals formulated by these groups of States  which represent two thirds of mankind.25.	I have stated that one of the characteristics of the present day is that international relations are increasingly relations among Powers rather than relations among societies. But I must say too that another disturbing fact of our day is that the economic order is increasingly becoming an exclusively financial order.26.	These are severe distortions that we must avoid  because a world in which politics is replaced by arsenals and economy by finance is simply a world in danger. We cannot accept that the future we seek for mankind should be based on and motivated by weapons and money. That is why I insist on the fact that ethical rebirth is a vital enterprise for our civilization.27.	It is painful to note the backward motion of our countries. Until some years ago  we were calling for the improvement of commercial and technological conditions in order to lessen the gap between our countries and the more advanced countries. Today  the objective of our claim is that of no longer being exporters of financial resources to the industrialized countries.28.	In Latin America  in 1983  the per capita gross national product was 10 per cent below the level of 1980. We have slipped backward six years  since we had already reached that level in 1977. This has greatly affected the welfare of our peoples  as has also the deterioration of our earnings brought about by the decline in the terms of foreign exchange.29.	The crisis of our foreign debt lies precisely in this deterioration of our economies  which are^ hindered from utilizing their productive potential  and in the reduction of employment and welfare. Last year  this debt meant  in terms of interest alone  the allocation of almost a third of the exports from the region.30.	Forgotten now are the international commitments agreed to during the first and second development decadesâlaunched by the United Nations in 1961 and 1971âwhich obligated the most advanced countries to transfer 1 per cent of their national product to the developing countries.31.	Paradoxically  these commitments are reversed today. The developing countries are now the ones that must transfer part of their national product to the developed countries; and it is not an annual 1 per cent  but an annual 3 per cent and sometimes more.32.	Owing to this overwhelming reality and to the attempt to restore rationality and good sense in the financial order  we in Latin America have proposed dialogue as a necessityâa dialogue between the richer countries and our countries  a practical dialogue about one of the questions that most upsets the financial order and stability of our countries; the question of foreign debt. We believe that this debt not only affects the debtor countries  but  because of its political impact  also directly involves the creditors.33.	We think that if everything depended on the manner in which the problem was being dealt with at present  we would not find a permanent and dependable solution. This is a subject that no longer has anything to do with the problem as it was in the early 1970s. Nevertheless  the solutions proposed are still the same. Only a joint political will can now give rise to new solutions for a problem that is no longer traditional.34.	Today  the question of debt is inextricably linked to the political and social destiny of our countries and  since it affects the whole region  it jeopardizes global stability in Latin America.35.	The meetings at Quito  Cartagena and Mar del Plata this year have been the best expression of the gravity of the situation. They also expressed our caution and moderation  which was translated into a call for a dialogue with the creditor countries. We hope that there will be a positive response to that call. Dialogue is not confrontation  as some people have alleged. Rather  confrontation arises when dialogue is precluded. I believe that both political logic and experience show this.36.	Perhaps on the basis of this concrete subject the aspiration for the North-South dialogue may materialize. It has been formulated many times  but up to now practical results could not be achieved.37.	This call for peace by the Argentine democracy is valid because we acted decisively for its preservation in the events in which we participated directly.38.	In one of those disputesâbetween us and the Republic of Chileâmy country took resolute steps. In the framework of the mediation of His Holiness Pope John Paul II  whose assistance we highly value and appreciate  my Government showed its firm will to find an equitable solution that would put an end to a century-old controversy. What we can present before the international community are words of peace translated into peaceful actions through dialogue and negotiations.39.	In the other conflict  the one which continues between us and the United Kingdom over the Malvinas  South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands  our negotiating will and decision have encountered intransigence.40.	For almost 150 years  a portion of Argentine territory has been subjected to the colonial regime imposed by the United Kingdom. This unjust and illegal situation  which Argentina has never accepted  permanently affects our national life.41.	The mission of recovering the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands for our heritage is a mandate that has been transmitted by successive generations of Argentines up to our day  and this process will continue until the attainment of that objective. There should be no doubt about this  as this is a cause with which my people identifies deeply. We have the law on our side. The failure to understand it in this way is tantamount to ignoring one of the most important facts of the problem that exists between my country and the occupying Power.42.	It is a national cause  but it is also a Latin American cause inasmuch as Latin America has come forth in solidarity to defend a national integrity that it considers its own. Latin America now also views with alarm the presence in the South Atlantic of a military force equipped with the most sophisticated armaments  threatening the interests and stability of the entire area and constituting a dangerous intrusion of the East-West conflict into the region.43.	Argentina is firmly committed to seeking the restitution of the Malvinas Islands only through peaceful means. This my Government has stated  and it will fulfil this aim. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind about this. Our concept of democracy  which my country has now fortunately recovered  has two facets: a domestic one and one that looks outward. The first one is related to the full exercise of the Constitutionâwith the concomitant limitations upon the exercise of State powersâand respect for human rights. The second one  as I have already mentioned  involves relations with other countries. This outward projection of the democratic way of life translates into a behaviour that is civilized and law-abiding and may be summed up as respect for the prevalence of legal rules in relations among States.44.	The Charter of the United Nations  a true constitution of the international community  imposes on Member States the obligation to solve their disputes by peaceful means. Consistent with this legal duty  my Government has taken steps towards attaining the maximum flexibility compatible with national rights and has sought to reinitiate negotiations with the United Kingdom to solve this conflict. Naturally  we also seek the normalization of the friendly relations which Argentina has traditionally had with that country. But that cannot be achieved if  from the very beginning of the attempts at normalisation  we lack the certainty that a mechanism will be established to allow negotiation on the sovereignty dispute  which represents the main obstacle on the path leading to that normalization.45.	Unfortunately  judging by recent bilateral contacts that culminated in the meeting at Berne in July of this year under the auspices of Brazil and Switzerland  up to now we seem to be left with nothing but the intention  clearly stated by the United Kingdom to postpone sin die the fulfilment of the urgent call by the General Assembly for the parties to sit down at the negotiating table. Together with my gratitude to Brazil and Switzerland and to the Secretary-General for their laudable efforts  I wish to express my ardent desire for that request of the General Assembly to be carried out as soon as possible for the sake of law and justice.46.	Next year the international community will commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. There is no doubt that the Organization has fulfilled an essential role in the search for international peace and security  the economic development of peoples and the eradication of colonialism. Its work is not over. I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of Member States will lend their assistance and best endeavours to achieve an international system based on justice and on the social  cultural and material progress of the peoples.47.	Mindful of these objectives  today we cannot fail to express our deep preoccupation with the situation in southern Africa  where the structures of colonial and racial discrimination still exist  in violation of international law and morality. Namibia must be made independent once and for all. The unjust system of apartheid must be eliminated for ever. Those who suffer under it can continue to count on the support of the civilized world.48.	There are areas of tension and armed conflict in the Middle East and the Gulf region; the United Nations must continue to give them special attention so that quick  just and peaceful solutions can be achieved.49.	My country also views with serious concernâas do  I am sure  all the other nationsâthe situation in Central America. In our opinion  the proposals and actions of the Contadora Group  expressly supported by the General Assembly  offer a suitable alternative to achieve the sought-after peaceful solution to this very painful conflict for all of Latin America.50.	I believe that if power relations replace relations among men  we shall have lost the ethical motivation that ensures progress and peace for mankind.51.	No one should doubt  in reviewing history  that civilizations live and thrive when they are based upon moral premises and that  by contrast  their extinction systematically stems from ethical confusion.52.	I believe that the fact that the world order is increasingly defined by the arms race and financial greed is an ethical confusion. Were these motivations to persist  there would be no well-being for the majority of our countries. It is also well to recall that what affects the South will sooner or later affect the welfare of the more advanced countries.53.	I have the firm conviction that  as recently stated by Pope John Paul II  today development is the new name for peace"
"6",275,"ATG",39,1984,"ï»¿I must first of all congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election is a tribute to the outstanding diplomatic skills which he has brought to the work of the Organization. It is also recognition of the important role played by his country in its attempts to bring peace not only to Africa  but to the world as a whole. I am confident that he will bring a steady hand to the helm in the deliberations at this session.2.	It is fitting that in this year  1984  a son of Africa should preside over the activities of the world's nations in convocation  for 1984 marks the one- hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the passage of Acts of Parliament to end slavery in the former British Empire. That slavery was the slavery of Africans snatched from their native lands and transported across the Atlantic. Those slaves endured conditions of human deprivation and moral degradation on a scale that defies civilized comprehension. It is a stain on the conscience of mankind that the justification for the brutality and savagery of African slavery was founded on a doctrine of racismâthe assertion that Africans were less than human. But  if African slavery as it existed in the so-called New World  in the United States  in the Caribbean and in Central and South America  if that African slavery was a cause of moral indignation because of its foundation in racism  then it was even more a reason for universal shame because of its brazen exploitation of man by man. It remains one of the tragic symbols of human injustice that  when African slavery ended  the slave owners were compensated while the slaves were only delivered to destitution.3.	In an attempt to remedy this grotesque blemish on the face of humanity and to recall mankind to its highest ideals  my country has proposed that at this thirty-ninth session the General Assembly should commemorate the one-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the abolition of slavery. The world community can make little reparation for the past  but we can ensure that there is no need for retribution in the future. In this connection  my delegation looks forward to the support of every nation represented in the Assembly.4.	While 1984 marks the one-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the formal end to African slavery  it fails to herald an end to modern-day slavery in South Africa  where apartheid holds the majority African people in bondage. The year 1984 also fails to record the independence of Namibia  to which the Assembly has dedicated itself year after year.5.	Each day that passes with no change in the conditions in southern Africa diminishes the prospect for mankind's total freedom and enlarges the spectre of a major conflagration in Africa. These developments will have grave repercussions for the world as a whole  for  as Abraham Lincoln asserted  no society can exist half slave and half free. In this connection  the world will not subsist at peace while southern Africa remains troubled by the oppression of many by a few.6.	My delegation wishes to place on record its repudiation of the efforts of the South African regime to perpetuate its apartheid policies by the farcical elections recently held and the fraudulent constitution recently proclaimed. The constitution continues to deny the majority Africans a voice in the political life of their country  and the election ignores more than 80 per cent of the Colored and Indian population  who showed their opposition to apartheid by refusing to vote.7.	In a statement I made before the General Committee  I asked  on the question of South Africa: ""Where are the super-Powers?"".  And I will ask that question again: ""Where are the superpowers?""8.	It is not sufficient for us to make high-sounding moral statements about the excesses of the regime in South Africa and Namibia without recognizing that many  in this Hall  are contributors to apartheid's continuance. Apartheid could not survive without the support of the world's more powerful nations. Apartheid will only end when those nations are ready to place principle before profit and justice before avarice.9.	It is well known that gold is the most crucial element in South Africa's strength. On the supply side  South Africa produces two thirds of all the gold that comes from non-communist countries  yet only about one fifth is utilized for practical purposes. But the price of gold is maintained artificially by the holdings of several Governments. The stock of refined gold in government hands is 30 times annual production and six countries alone have stocks greater than annual production. If even a small portion of these holdings were to be released  the total supply of gold in the world would rise and the price would collapse  bringing the South African regime down with it.10.	Will the Governments with the power to do so act in the cause of human justice? Will they end the iniquity of apartheid and set the black people of South Africa free? Or will they falter and hesitate as they did with slavery until outrage turns to carnage and bitterness to bloodiness? Let no nation leave the Assembly absolved of the sin of support for apartheid  for if we do not act against it then  unpardonably  we act for it. Apartheidâs greatest friend is hopelessness. My delegation calls on the Assembly to reaffirm its commitment to end apartheid  to renew its resolve to free Namibia  and by so doing to turn hopelessness to resolution and resolution to victory.11.	In addressing the question of apartheid in South Africa and the comfort which is given to the regime  my delegation is mindful of South Africa's involvement in the Antarctic Treaty1 of 1959. We noted  with sympathy  the position adopted by the delegation of Sierra Leone during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  at the 42nd and 46th meetings of the First Committee  that South Africa should be excluded from the present Treaty arrangement. We recognized that  while this view was not included in the resolution on the question of Antarctica adopted at the thirty-eighth session  it was none the less a view supported by many countries.12.	That is as it should be  for as long as South Africa sets its people apart at home it sets its people and itself apart abroad. And the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty should understand quite clearly that the world will regard South Africa's continuance in the Treaty arrangements as an act of betrayal of international opinion.13.	At the current session  the General Assembly will receive a study from the Secretary-General on all aspects of the question of Antarctica. My delegation does not wish to pre-empt the findings or recommendations of that study  but we must make it clear that the growing tendency for nations  rich and poor  to seek solutions to international problems through confrontation rather than negotiation and the widening chasm between the developed and developing countries intensify our sense of alarm over the arrangements which currently subsist in Antarctica.14.	We still fear that Antarctica could become a final frontier for human conflict. It is of more than passing significance to us that all the nations with the capacity to participate in a scramble for Antarctica are parties to the Antarctic Treaty and therefore are able to initiate a review in 1991. Doubly significant is the fact that poor developing States with no vested interest in Antarctica have no voice in decision making about the area and are unable to influence the activities of other nations.15.	But small States such as mine cannot abandon international responsibility for developments in Antarctica simply because they lack military might or economic clout. And nothing that the powerful nations have done so far in their relations with each other has convinced us that they should be the sole arbiters of the world's future.16.	To add to all this  the world has changed enormously since the Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959. There are now 159 Member States of the United Nations  most of which are developing countries. In 1959  they had neither the opportunity nor the sovereign competence to participate in events in Antarctica. It is not only unfair  it is unjust  to suggest that we should abide by decisions made without our involvement. Indeed  we would warn the world that if the status quo in Antarctica is maintained and further institutionalized a confrontation is bound to develop between the Consultative Parties and the rest of the world.17.	In our view  it is in the interest of global peace and stability to address the democratization of Antarctica now  for delay will only divide still further an already divided world.18.	Antigua and Barbuda is not so naive as to believe that the Consultative Parties would accept our tearing up the Antarctic Treaty and declaring the region the common heritage of all mankind to be administered by the United Nations. Nor do we see them agreeing to the area's being declared a repository for science or a park for the conservation of wildlife. Since a number of the Consultative Parties have benefited from fishing in the area  and over the last few years have been working on a regime to exploit the mineral resources  it is obvious that they will not surrender Antarctica to the world. However  no country can ignore growing world opinion that Antarctica should not be managed by an exclusive club  particularly when the ecology is so vitally important to global climatic patterns. In this connection  my delegation proposes the following: the retention of the Antarctic Treaty as a basis for administering the region; the creation of an authority  under the umbrella of the Treaty  to manage the Antarctic  with the existing Consultative Parties as members of the authority and equal membership by representatives of every region of the world; environmental non-governmental organizations with an established record in Antarctica to be observers at all meetings of the authority  with the right to speak; and the establishment of a system of international taxation and revenue-sharing administered by the proposed authority for Antarctica.19.	We believe that our proposals  if implemented  would go a long way towards democratizing Antarctica and should be acceptable to all  except those with sinister objectives in the region. We have advanced the idea of a system of international taxation and revenue-sharing because we accept that certain countries will continue to exploit the marine life of Antarctica. But we feel they should do so in a controlled manner and within a framework in which the world and Antarctica itself no less  benefits from revenue derived from taxation. We propose that the revenues raised from taxes on fishing and  in time  mining should be placed in a special development fund for maintaining the Antarctic environment and advancing global human development. The fund should be subdivided in three ways: expenses for the maintenance of the Antarctic environment  hard loans to developed countries and soft loans and grants to less developed and least developed countries.20.	It is only in these conditions of global participation in decision-making and global sharing of the benefits of Antarctica's resources that the region will be genuinely safe for all mankind. The alternative is an intensification of global confrontation and a fatal step towards the final frontier of human conflict.21.	Much has been made of the close co-operation that exists between the two super-Powers in Antarctica. Indeed  their representatives have drawn attention to the fact that  while they cannot agree on arms control matters  goodwill and a genuine desire to find mutually acceptable solutions have made it possible to make Antarctica a zone of peace. But it is precisely this unprecedented level of co-operation between the two super-Powers which intensifies suspicions about Antarctica.22.	Why can this co-operation not be repeated in other parts of the world? If the super-Powers could bring to Central America the same level of collaboration that has obtained m Antarctica  the problems of that region could be brought to an end  with enormous benefits for the people of the area and with a corresponding reduction of tension between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union.23.	The world would breathe a sigh of relief if the super-Powers concentrated their efforts not on military escalation in Central America but on economic improvement. For  apart from a hard core of activists in the troubled countries of Central America  people want bread  not bullets. In this connection  would it not be a better role for the super-Powers of the world to act as intermediaries for peace rather than agents for war? The question needs no answer  for the response is self-evident. We must all hope that in time the super-Powers will come to recognize the value to the world of co-operating internationally in the same way as they have done in Antarctica.24.	In the meantime  developing countries can offer an example of responsibility. In Central America  Belize has proffered the hand of friendship to Guatemala. These two countries can show the world a new way to peace by reaching out to each other and constructing a lasting solution to their problems  based on recognition of each other's sovereignty and co-operation in the social and economic development of their peoples. We would urge Guatemala to take the first step along the road to global peace by showing the super-Powers that developing States have the maturity and capacity to settle their problems in peace.25.	Other developing States also have it within their power to demonstrate to the super-Powers that conflict resolution is not the exclusive preserve of those with the greatest might. The peoples of North and South Korea can strike a blow for dignity in the third world by acting on the proposals put forward by South Korea to normalize the relations of the Korean people.26.	Action by developing States to establish peace and promote social well-being should cease to be dependent on the influences of one super-Power or another. Developing States should strive to change the image that we are incapable of dealing with our own affairs. We should eschew big-Power politics in our countries and seek our salvation by our own efforts. We should create the conditions for international respect for third-world States and reverse the derision to which we are so constantly subject.27.	Far too many of our problems  which have their genesis in economic inequality  have provided opportunities for protagonists in East-West rivalry to interfere in our affairs. It is time for third-world countries to free themselves from such rivalry and assert their independence with dignity and pride.28.	In the case of Cyprus  which has suffered the torment of strife for so long  my delegation would once again appeal for support for the Secretary- General in his efforts to extinguish the flames of conflict which so persistently threaten to set Cyprus alight. The people of Cyprus are remarkable for their ability to build on the ashes' of ruins. They are surely able to transpose this great strength to the future of their country by establishing a united  free and fully independent Cyprus in which the interests and rights of all are fully protected and guaranteed. The international community would bring a welcome respite to the people of Cyprus by promoting peace  not partition; unity  not disunity; nationalism  not separatism.29.	I turn now to the question of the development of third world States. Developing countries have learned the hard way that voting strength in the Assembly and in other United Nations agencies does not convey authority in decision-making. Resolutions  laboriously drafted and painfully negotiated  produce no meaningful results. Hence  in the context of a North-South dialogue on development  there has not only been no progress  there has been nothing. Nothing has happened in the General Assembly; nothing happened at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade; nothing resulted from the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun; nothing came of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.30.	While nothing has occurred to advance a North- South dialogue on development  the nations of the world have rushed dangerously close to disaster. The one thing that has delayed the moment of catastrophe is that suffering and pain in many developing States is a norm.31.	The norm of suffering is what has stopped the developing countries from exploding into violence despite the fact that the majority have experienced no growth for the last three years. The norm of suffering is what has pulled back more than 24 countries in Africa from absolute chaos  despite the fact that 30 million people will die this year and next from malnutrition and related diseases. The norm of suffering is what has saved developing countries from economic collapse  despite the fact that in 1983 the loss in income through reduced exports to developed countries was some SO billion.32.	Paradoxically  it is this same norm of suffering in third world States that has helped to maintain the resoluteness of developed States not to enter into a dialogue on development. For third world suffering is expected in the equation of international politics. It is first world suffering that is not expected.33.	Hence  it seems that the developed countries will only enter into a dialogue on development when their own economic conditions reach the point of inflicting pain upon their own peoples. It is a sad commentary on the state of human relations that mankind has reached such a woeful point.34.	Given this situation and the further dimension of declining official development assistance and a constraint upon the international financial institutions to carry out reforms necessary to discharge their responsibilities  third world States may find value in promoting the concept of a greater co-operation among themselves. Indeed  there may even be relevance in creating a third world secretariat to institutionalize trade and other commercial arrangements among third world States and to provide expertise for more co-ordinated and beneficial negotiations with developed countries.35.	My delegation agrees with the sentiment of Thomas Paine  so eloquently cited by the President of the United States  Mr. Ronald Reagan  in this very Hall on 24 September last  at the 4th meeting: ""'We have it in our power to begin the world over again'"". My delegation would urge developing States to ensure that  in any efforts to begin the world over again  we have a strong and effective voice."
"7",320,"AUS",39,1984,"ï»¿May I congratulate you  Sir  warmly and sincerely  on behalf of the Australian Government  on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Although at opposite ends of the alphabet  Australia and Zambia enjoy closer relations than many would expect. We do this through the Commonwealth and bilaterally. I know  too  that Australia can regard you  personally  as a friend. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  the Government of Australia is well aware of your valuable contribution as President of that body.103.	I should also like to extend a warm and neighbourly welcome to Brunei Darussalam as the newest Member of this world body. The admission of the 159th Member brings us closer to the goal of universality in membership of the United Nations.104.	As all representatives will know  Australia is one of the two agreed candidates of its regional group standing for election to the Security Council for 1985 and 1986. We see membership of the Council as an opportunity for Australia to pursue its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. I should like to take this opportunity of assuring other delegations that Australia  if elected  will approach its duties with a sense of responsibility and self-confidence. We shall also strive to uphold the Charter and to make the Council a more effective instrument for the containment of existing conflicts and the prevention of new conflicts.105.	It has to be said that in the last 12 months the long march to world harmony and the achievement of universal basic human freedom has been painfully slow. Australia agrees with the observation in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization that a major reason for this is the regrettable tendency to retreat from internationalism and multilateralism. I propose to explain Australia's position on those issues in which  for strong historical and geographical reasons  we have a special interest.106.	The United Nations continues to spend much energy on the state of affairs in southern Africa and particularly the poisonous effects there of the apartheid policies of the South African Government. The facade there of constitutional reform has in fact made matters worse. Indeed  the non-white citizens have demonstrated this in the most dramatic way possible. Black South Africansâ70 per cent of the populationâhave been allowed no part in this alleged reform. Only one Coloured or Indian person in five was persuaded to vote for the new constitution.107.	The constitution that emerged in this so-called reform depends totally on the system and the laws of apartheid. Apartheid is designed  as we know  to entrench the domination in South Africa of a racial minority. This evil doctrine depends on injustice and fosters violence. The world community has condemned it and Australia is unequivocally opposed to it. So long as it continues and so long as the South African Government pursues it  South Africa cannot expect to be welcomed back into the international community.108.	In Namibia  we are still waiting for the promised outcome of the latest round of negotiations  which started early this year. All principal parties have professed to agree to the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Australia therefore regrets that the principle of linkage between independence negotiations and the presence of Cuban personnel in Angola has been raised as a barrier to progress. Moreover  there is no guarantee that more issues outside the scope of resolution 435 (1978) will not be raised in the future to impede solution of an issue which could and should have been solved by now. Australia shares the impatience of African and other nations over the delay of Namibia's independence and we question the professed good intentions of the South African Government in this regard.109.	In the South-East Asian area  stability is subjected to undesirable strain by Viet Nam's continued occupation of Cambodia. Australia condemned the invasion of Cambodia when it happened and we continue to condemn it. Nobody can tolerate armed incursion by one country into another  wherever it occurs. Accordingly  Australia considers that Viet Nam should withdraw from Cambodia. The reasonable way for this to take place would be in the context of a settlement acceptable to all parties. This is why the need continues for negotiations towards a settlement  for which Australia has been working in the past 18 months. Australia remains ready to provide the site and any facilities necessary so that the parties involved  or any combination of them  can discuss ways in which settlement can be reached in Cambodia.110.	The Soviet Union continues its occupation of Afghanistan and  through recent offensives  including high-level bombing of the Panjshir Valley  has added immeasurably to the suffering of the Afghan people. The recent widening of the conflict through the bombing of civilian targets in Pakistan by Afghan aircraft has served to heighten the degree of risk associated with the continued Soviet occupation. The needless loss of civilian and military life in the region will come to an end only when the Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan in accordance with successive United Nations resolutions.111.	In the South Pacific region  Australia remains alert to the fact that a colonial situation remains in New Caledonia. We continue to support peaceful evolution to independence in New Caledonia  determined in accordance with the wishes of the people there and free from outside influence. We welcome the recognition by the French Government of the legitimate claim of the Kanak people to an inherent and active right to self-determination in which independence is an option. We no e that an act of self-determination is scheduled to be held by 1989. Australia calls on France to ensure that the transition to an independent  multiracial New Caledonia is achieved speedily and peacefully and  indeed  in a shorter time-scale than previously envisaged.112.	A just and lasting peace in the Middle East remains a necessary but elusive goal. It can be achieved only if it is accepted that Israel must be allowed to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and that the Palestinian issue is centrally important for any settlement. Acceptance of these principles does not mean that Israel can feel free to continue its settlement programme in the West Bank  since these settlements are contrary to international law and an obstacle to peace. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which represents a significant proportion of the Palestinian people  should be included in the search for peace. Australia acknowledges also that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination  including a right to choose independence and the possibility of their own independent state. However  there is limited  perhaps non-existent  opportunity for the PLO to engage productively in the search for peace so long as it persists in denying Israel's right to exist. The Australian Government will maintain its refusal to recognize the PLO while it persists in that denial.113.	A major cause of fear around the world community  of course  lies in the unsteady state of relations between the super-Powers and the obstruction this is creating to effective arms control leading to disarmament. This year has seen more growth in nuclear arsenals and deployment of new missiles in both East and West. The prospect for talks between the super-Powers in September on arms control for outer space was withdrawn  for what to the rest of the world must seem specious reasons. Their negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces and on strategic nuclear weapons have been suspended. In the negotiations at Stockholm and Vienna about European issues  there has been no progress despite the new proposals. In the Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva  a shameful procedural deadlock is holding up the agenda of negotiations.114.	Australia has a special right to express its concern about this  as the site of the joint facilities with the United States  and as a major supplier of uranium. The Australian Government believes that the joint facilities are an essential part of the monitoring system in effective arms control. It believes that holding on to our uranium would be an obstacle to disarmament because it would mean abandoning the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Government has gone to great lengths to convince Australians to accept the paradox that the existence of the facilities and the supply of uranium make nuclear war less  not more likely. We believe that our role in these matters gives us the right to be heard on the need for genuine progress towards nuclear disarmament.115.	This crucial issue has the very highest priority among our policies. We have fully supported moves to draw up a draft convention on chemical weapons. We believe that there is a general will within the Geneva Conference to establish a convention that prohibits chemical weapons and their means of production. The Australian Government welcomed the submission by the United States of a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  which contains what we consider to be elements of an effective system. This draft text has been criticized in some quarters. Let us not leave it there; let the critics come forward with constructive alternatives.116.	WeâAustraliaâhave put it to the Conference on Disarmament that in its exploration of the issue of arms control in outer space it should consider measures to protect from attack all satellites which help to preserve the strategic balance and which can contribute to monitoring disarmament agreements. We have proposed also that the same protection be given to the ground stations which are essential to the operation of those satellites.117.	The Australian Government has given an extraordinary amount of attention to the issue of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  an issue which is central to effective arms control and disarmament. Our objective is to get meaningful negotiations on the way to establishing such a treaty. We have been trying to help overcome the procedural obstacles which have been put in the way of the treaty. We have been trying to get a subsidiary body of the Geneva Conference set up to do the urgently needed practical work with a view to negotiating such a treaty. Naturally  we would prefer a so-called full negotiating mandate. We would prefer agreement in clear terms that parties will start negotiating with a view towards drafting a truly comprehensive test-ban treaty. But the consensus for such a mandate apparently is not there. The mandate that we have proposed instead is the best possible in the present circumstances. It proposes that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference on Disarmament should work on scope  verification and compliance with a view to the negotiation of such a treaty. I submitted a working paper at Geneva in August as a guide for negotiations on these very points.118.	The Australian Government will give all possible support to work on the treaty. But I will repeat now what I said in August at Geneva: we cannot accept a state of affairs in which an already limited mandate is used to justify delay in progress towards a treaty which has been in the gestation phase for far too long as it is. It would be wrong for anybody to presume that Australians in general have an inexhaustible well of patience with the slow pace of the work being done in the cause of solving a problem that could destroy us all.119.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General urges that the multilateral forums be used to deal with this compelling issue. All Member States should use those forums to let the nuclear-weapon States know that real progress is needed towards limiting those weapons that cause such fear around the world. Let us smaller States remember the opportunity that the United Nations providesâin the General Assembly  in the various disarmament forums and in the IAEA. In common  we have an influence on even the most powerful of our colleagues that we lack when we act alone.120.	In the context of disarmament  I refer briefly to two important developments: first  the increased international interest in Antarctica promoted by our good friend Malaysia. The Antarctic Treaty has provided an effective basis for peaceful co-operation  for scientific co-operation and environmental conservation for a quarter of a century. The disarmament provisions of the Treaty have established the only denuclearized and demilitarized zone in the world today. While we believe the Treaty system is flexible and that the operation of the Treaty can be improved  Australia will oppose any proposals in this body which we consider would lead to undermining the Treaty. The best course on Antarctica is to await the expected report of the Secretary-General. Only when we have examined it will we be in a position to consider what  if any  further steps involving the United Nations might be considered.121.	The second development of importance was the recent decision by the countries of the South Pacific to begin work on a treaty to create a nuclear- free-zone in the South Pacific region. The proposal  brought by Australia to the countries of the South Pacific Forum  has significance not only for the region but also for the whole of the international community which wishes to make the world a nuclear-safe place. This time next year  I feel sure  the countries of the region will be able to report that a significant step in reaching this objective has been taken.122.	Another great issue the resolution of which demands our combined will concerns the instability caused by the indebtedness of developing countries. This issue is pressing not only because of its impact on the world financial system but also because of the hardship involved for developing countries that are undertaking adjustment programmes. The Australian Government firmly supports the international consensus for the central role of the IMF in this issue and the case-by-case approach it has adopted to deal with current problems. This approach has its critics  but there is in the short term no effective alternative. It is important that the IMF continue to insist on a disciplined attack on a most complex problem and that it be given consistent support while it is doing so. But we must be careful to keep our eyes on the political dangers ahead as we deal with the debt problem.123.	One of those dangers concerns the burden of interest ratesâa matter that the leading economies represented at the London Economic Summit  held in June this year  failed to address adequately. It would be unfortunate if rescheduling attempts now being arranged were to be overrun by any sudden climb in interest rates. I say that although there appears to be a fairly solid level of confidence that these arrangements have been crafted together in a more secure way.124.	A note of caution also needs to be sounded about the possible political effects of some of the conditions imposed by IMF debt rearrangements. There are States going through the adjustment processâwith all that that implies about strict economic managementâ which are also undergoing complex and sensitive political change; some are emerging into democracy from long periods of authoritarian rule. We must be careful that policies for economic recovery and stability do not undermine their fledgling social and political reforms.125.	Another danger lies in the tendency to over-simplify the debt problem. The debts that command our attention are those of the relatively well-off countries which tapped the commercial markets in the 1970s to help achieve their considerable industrial growth potential.126.	There is  however  a real danger that the problems of other debtor countries  less significant in terms of their implications for their creditors but no less serious in relation to their own domestic impact  will be crowded out of our attention. Such countries  generally poorer and with less ability to attract the new opportunities of commercial borrowing in the 1970s  are linked more to traditional sources such as official development assistance and development institution loans. The solutions may be different  but the task is no less urgent. When coupled  as in Africa  with additional problems such as drought and rapidly spreading desertification  the need for attention is all the more compelling. This issue was recently reported on by a Commonwealth Group of Experts on the Debt Crisis. That Group  established by the Commonwealth Heads of Government at their 1983 summit  included among its proposed measures to help low-income debtor countries a call for additional resources for IDA. Australia has decided to respond by making a voluntary and unilateral special contribution to IDA  in addition to our pledged contribution of $200 million.127.	I have said that this complex problem demands our combined will for its resolution. It is in the United Nationsâwhich has striven for 40 years to serve the interests of all members of the world communityâthat this combined will can best be utilized.128.	Australia emphasizes the point  because we disagree with the disposition in some quarters to accept that the United Nations is perhaps afflicted by a kind of premature hardening of the arteries. Part of the blame for this feeling must be attributed to the Organization itself. From earliest days  Secretaries- General have complained of lack of co-ordination and of inefficiency. Many persons inside and outside the United Nations have become disenchanted with its reputation as a talking-shop. But we should be careful not to encourage too extreme a reaction to this. The complaints made about the Organization may to some extent be true  but they are far from the whole truth.129.	For all its imperfections  the United Nations has developed a range of policies and activities that have brought comfort and even life to people all over the world. As the Secretary-General says  it has played a decisive role in the process of decolonization. I should like to mention parenthetically in this context that Australia conducted an act of self-determination in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands  which was observed by a United Nations Visiting Mission. We expect that this development will lead at this session to the de-listing of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as a Non-Self-Governing Territory  thereby ending Australia's role as an administering Power.130.	In the field of human rights  the United Nations has facilitated the development of a framework of international standards and obligations which translates into practical terms the humanitarian ideals of the Charter. This is a continuing process. Australia very much hopes to see the Assembly take the necessary steps to adopt an effective convention against the abhorrent practice of torture.131.	United Nations agencies have helped eradicate disease  provide care for refugees  control drug abuse and expand food production. I specify the literacy and education programmes of UNESCO  since that agency has been subject to intensive examination recently.132.	I am not convinced either that all the 4 000 or so resolutions adopted by the General Assembly are entirely the ""hollow voting victories"" that Dag Hammarskjold suggested they were. The whole ritual of conference and dialogue has played an underestimated role in dampening down tension and satisfying passions.133.	Another source of criticism of the United Nations is the natural disappointment that has followed the enthusiastic but unreal expectations of early years. People expected the United Nations to create a Utopiaâsomething requiring powers that no nation was prepared to cede to it.134.	Yet another part of the United Nations problem is that it is no longer the tight little community of the Second World War victors that was set up nearly 40 years ago. The balance of representation in the United Nations is now starting to reflect the balance between the main regions of the world in terms of population. If the United Nations were today what it was 40 years ago  then it would truly be irrelevant; instead  it represents the real world  not the world some would like it to be.135.	I am saying this because the Organization  which has brought untold benefit to so many people  should be defended against attack. I am saying it because my country  Australia  feels that it has a special obligation to take part in this defence. Australia was not only a founding Member of the United Nations  but also an active supporter of the view in its early days that the United Nations should not be the preserve of great Powers. We foresaw the opportunities for Members of a truly representative United Nations to advance interests in common that we could not promote individually. We wanted the newest and humblest of nations to be able to mix with the oldest and mightiest in conferences and dialogue. We believed that smaller States like ourselves would be swamped if great Powers in a nuclear age were free to arrange matters among themselves in private as they did at Potsdam and Yalta. We are all affected by the arrangements between great Powers. We have the right to be able to express views about them and to be involved in the formation of these views.136.	I have said that disarmament and international economic stability are the major pressing issues of our time. The Australian Government urges that more energetic ways to settle these issues  in particular disarmament  should be pursued within the multilateral framework. Not only is the search for answers urgent; it is also of paramount importance that the answers be fully representative of us all  large and small nations alike."
"8",367,"AUT",39,1984,"ï»¿ It is with great pleasure that I extend to you  Sir  the congratulations of Austria on your election as President of the General Assembly. We greet you as an outstanding representative of Africa and of a country with which Austria enjoys close and friendly relations. Your rich diplomatic experience and your well-known commitment to the cause of the United Nations assure the General Assembly of objective and constructive leadership.50.	We also wish to express our sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who guided the General Assembly with great tact and skill. We are indeed grateful to him for his contribution to the work of the Organization.51.	I would like to welcome most cordially the delegation of the new Member State  Brunei Darussalam. We are looking forward to close and fruitful co-operation.52.	Before the beginning of this session of the General Assembly  the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were marked by increased confrontation  mistrust and mutual recriminations and  above all  by the continuation of a devastating arms race. The meetings of last week encourage us to hope that the dialogue will be resumed. The world expects a lessening of tensions and a reduction in the gigantic stockpiles of weapons.53.	In Europe  in our own region  Austria contributes to the strengthening of security and co-operation by its active participation in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process. This process is of particular importance to the smaller European States because it offers them a unique chance to play an active role in shaping their destiny. Thus  the Conference on Confidence- and Security- building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  as well as the forthcoming meetings at Budapest and Ottawa  are of utmost importance.54.	The world economic situation requires determined co-operation between North and South to alleviate the plight of the developing countries. The burden of debt which many developing countries have to bear reduces their living standards even further. This problem cannot be solved by banking operations alone but requires  in our opinion  a sharing of responsibility by the Governments of the creditor countries.55.	Human rights and fundamental freedoms continue to be disregarded on a large scale. Oppression  political persecution and economic exploitation cast a dark shadow over the lives of millions of people.56.	Peace is threatened by a large number of regional conflicts and crises in the Middle East  Central America  Cambodia  Afghanistan  Cyprus and southern Africa.57.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has outlined in clear and courageous terms the obstacles to the efficient functioning of the United Nations. We support his suggestions to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. We join him in appealing to all Member States not to carry political controversies into the specialized agencies. Austria supports his efforts to strengthen the Organization as an instrument to maintain peace and to promote international co-operation. Peace-keeping operations of the United Nations will continue to play an essential role. We urge all Member States to share in their financing.58.	The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1985 offers a welcome opportunity to give serious consideration to a better functioning of the world Organization. Let us explore together all possibilities of making better use of the United Nations in dealing with mankind's problems of today and the challenges of the future. We have to give more attention to the social dimensions of development and to economic policies which will not weaken but strengthen the social fabric of societies and democratic structures. We are convinced that the United Nations could play a most important role in addressing those fundamental issues and in promoting policies which would be beneficial  especially to the weaker and more vulnerable members of the international community.59.	At previous sessions of the General Assembly  Austria has explained its positions on many important agenda items. These positions remain unchanged. Today  I should like to focus on four problems.60.	I wish to start with human rights  because the individual and his well-being is the basic motivation of all political action. There is abundant evidence of a widening gap between the universally accepted norms of human rights and the dark reality in many countries. All Members of the United Nations have an obligation to change this situation  which is an affront to human dignity.61.	There are two areas where progress is overdue: the abolition of torture and the restriction or elimination of the death penalty. We trust that the Assembly will successfully complete the respective legal instruments. We shall continue to contribute actively towards this goal.62.	The implementation of human rights requires intensive efforts by every State within its own borders  as well as at the regional and global levels. Specific steps within each region to improve the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are particularly promising. In this context  the member States of the Council of Europe will meet at Vienna in March 1985 to hold a conference on human rights.63.	Let me assure representatives that whenever Austria speaks up in favour of human rights in a specific region or country  our only motivation is concern for the individual  his freedom and dignity.64.	Austria also believes that all human rights are interlinked. Human dignity cannot be upheld in the absence of adequate economic  social and cultural conditions. On the other hand  adverse social and economic circumstances can never justify the denial of individual rights and freedoms.65.	Central America is one of those regions where the denial of human rights has led to a cycle of violence  bloodshed and human suffering. At the same time  we witness a growing trend towards external intervention. The East-West confrontation is casting its shadow over Central America.66.	It has always been Austria's position that a solution to the crisis of Central America can be found only by the States of the region themselves. Efforts to achieve national reconciliation and to restore democracy in individual countries must be accompanied by a dialogue among all States and political forces of Central America. In order to be successful  the political peace process must be supported by measures to secure economic progress and social justice. This need is increasingly recognized. An encouraging sign in this direction is the meeting of the member States of the European Community and Portugal and Spain with the Contadora Group and the Central American countries at San Jose on 28 and 29 September 1984.67.	Austria will continue to support the Contadora process as an independent Latin American initiative for peace and progress. We appreciate the acceptance of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America by Central American States and  in particular  by Nicaragua. We are convinced that all parties will continue to work for lasting peace in the region.68.	The continuing crisis in Africa is a cause for special concern. Africa today faces two challenges: the immediate challenge of survival and the long- term challenge of development. It is a tribute to the leading statesmen of Africa that they have decided to rely first and foremost on their own efforts.69.	However  Africa's crisis cannot be overcome by the African peoples alone. Increased assistance will be required. Thus  we are concerned about the difficulties encountered during the last replenishment of IDA and about the present problems of IFAD. Above all  we need a stronger commitment from all sides  irrespective of social systems and historical backgrounds. This requires greater understanding for the problems of indebtedness which confront many developing countries. We also need a better appreciation of the social and political difficulties arising from painful adjustment programmes which hit the poor more than anybody else.70.	Austria welcomes the African initiative of the Secretary-General. We have participated actively in the deliberations of the Economic and Social Council on this subject. We regret that no agreement could be reached on a framework of action. My country will increase its own efforts to provide assistance to Africa. That continentâand above all its least developed countriesâis already a main focus of Austrian development assistance.71.	It is our strong belief that a peaceful and harmonious development of Africa cannot succeed without the elimination of the abhorrent system of apartheid  which constitutes a most serious violation of human rights and dignity.72.	The Palestinian question has been before the United Nations for many years. Year after year  its solution becomes more difficult. Thus  the Middle East is a permanent hotbed of conflict and a serious threat to world peace.73.	Many plans for the solution of the conflict have been proposed. I wish to refer to the decisions adopted on 9 September 1982 by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  and the Reagan plan of 1 September 1982  confirmed by the President of the United States before the Assembly at this session. The Egyptian-French initiative within the United Nations framework also contains valuable suggestions.74.	Austria's position is clear: we reject policies based on military superiority and occupation of foreign territories. Any solution must be based on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories  on the recognition of Israel's existence as a sovereign and independent State within secure and recognized borders  as well as on the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to its own State.75.	Together with the majority of the members of the Assembly  we continue to recognize the PLO as the representative and spokesman of the Palestinian people. Therefore  the PLO has to be included in all efforts to find a just and peaceful solution.76.	Israel's policy of de facto annexation violates international law. We strongly condemn its policy of establishing settlements in the occupied territories.77.	All parties to the conflictâIsraelis and Palestinians  as well as the Arab Statesâmust make new efforts towards peace. The initiation of such a peace process cannot wait any longer. An immediate halt to the settlements policy in the occupied territories  an end of the attacks in Israel and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon are necessary to create the confidence needed for successful negotiations.78.	Permit me now to address briefly the problem of South Tyrol  a subject which directly concerns Austria. We have good and friendly relations with Italy as one of our most important neighbours. These relations have been further improved by the official visit by Prime Minister Graxi and Foreign Minister Andreotti to Vienna last February.79.	In 1969 the resolutions of the General Assembly of 1960 and 1961 led to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new framework of autonomy for South Tyrol. However  15 years later  some of the provisions of that autonomy agreement still remain to be fulfilled. This is particularly the case with regard to the use of the German language. Despite the agreement in principle of May 1983 between the Italian Government and the minority concerned  that important provision has  to our regret  still not been implemented. This has significantly increased the concern of the South Tyrolean population. We are confident that the promise made by Prime Minister Graxi at Vienna to implement that provision will soon be fulfilled.80.	Austria has noted with satisfaction that the assurance given by the Italian Head of Government regarding the establishment of an autonomous section of the regional administrative court in Bozen has already been honoured by the passing of appropriate legislation. The commitments made by Prime Minister Craxi at Vienna and by Foreign Minister Andreotti at Venice increase our confidence that the Italian Government will soon take the remaining steps for a mutually accepted and full implementation of South Tyrolean autonomy.81.	The issues I have dealt with have more in common than one may realize at first glance. In every instance  the key to their peaceful solution lies in readiness to engage in dialogue  respect of the rights of others and willingness to compromise. Austria's own experience encourages us to promote close and friendly relations with all our neighbours. It shapes our approach towards the solution of regional conflicts and motivates our co-operation in international organizations.82.	Let me close my statement with a personal recollection: Shortly after the end of the Second World War  I met with many young people from all over Europe. We came from destroyed towns and villages in a continent devastated by war. We had few personal belongings; we had no riches; our countries were in ruins. But we had three things: hope  optimism and an unshakeable belief in our ability to rebuild our countries  to abolish hate and mistrust and to shape a new world.83.	Since then  much has been achieved. And now  having reached a somewhat riper age and also responsible positions  we are unsure and deeply pessimistic about our ability to solve the problems of today. Let us approach the problems we face with optimism and hope and with a belief in the future of mankind. Let us recapture the spirit of our youth. We owe it to the young people of today whose world we are shaping."
"9",438,"BDI",39,1984,"ï»¿Once again I am honoured to head the delegation of Burundi in the work of the annual session of the General Assembly. I can say that I see in this not a ritual Presence but a special responsibility and a very acute awareness of the numerous serious concerns of all Member States  of regions and of the entire international community assembled here.237.	But my first duty is to tell Mr. Lusaka how gratified I am at the confidence which the General Assembly  in electing him President of this session  has shown in Zambia  a neighbouring friendly country  as well as in its distinguished President  Mr. Kenneth Kaunda. I whole-heartedly congratulate him as well as the other officers of the Assembly.238.	My delegation also is happy to welcome Brunei Darussalam. We warmly greet it as a new Member of the United Nations family.239.	Recently  following presidential elections by direct universal suffrageâthe first which were ever held in the history of our country and which marked the culmination of the process of the establishment of definitive democratic institutions in our political systemâa solemn ceremony was held for the investiture of the President of the Republic of Burundi  Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza  for a new term of office. On that occasion  Colonel Bagaza stated the following  which is quite appropriate in this forum:""We appeal to all countries throughout the world to join efforts to ensure the development of all parts of the world  to contribute to the acquisition of and respect for the freedom and independence of countries and peoples and to struggle for international peace and security.""240.	That message by the most authoritative spokesman of our people shows that the Republic of Burundi places great hopes in international solidarity and co-operation  for which the United Nations is the best possible instrument. None the less  we must note that the era when the United Nations was establishedâan era when wisdom  resulting from fear  prevailedâhas long since passed  and the Organization is now tending to fall apart and to lose the essence of its ideal. It seems to be lending itself to immobility  to impotence  and public opinion appears to have lost faith in it.241.	How can one assess what has happened since the last session of the Assembly without using the word ""failure""? This is seriously disquieting both in regard to peace and security and in regard to world developmentâand yet these are the two major concerns of our time.242.	With regard to peace and security  one would seek in vain any reasons for satisfactionâwhether we are talking about wars  conflicts  tensions or the rights of peoples to freedom or independence in the Middle East  in the Persian Gulf  in South-East Asia; whether we are talking about the intolerable situation in southern Africa or the insecurity reigning in Central America; whether we are talking  finally  about rivalries of ideological blocs or about disarmament negotiations. The only ray of light in this rather sombre international picture is the recent initiative to resolve the situation in Chad. With all our hearts  we desire for that country so dear to our region a process of national reconciliation  unity and reconstruction.243.	As for world economic development  the situation has become even worse  for the majority of countries  it the last 12 months. Indeed  a turning inward  resulting from both selfishness and incomprehension  is seriously compromising international co-operation. The economic recovery which is spoken of in some industrialized countries is scarcely noticeable in the developing countries  which are more than ever before burdened by debt  the fall in the prices of raw materials  the trade deficit  the effects of natural disasters  and the slowing down of economic and commercial activities. The recession which has struck the developed countries has strengthened protectionism  thereby worsening the debt burden of third-world countries and their balance-of-payments difficulties.244.	And so it seems that the world is in the grip of a multidimensional crisis  which has tragic effects on the developing countries. Despite the great achievements of research and of scientific and technological development  which opened up prospects of unlimited progress  a large part of the world's population has no access to the fruits of those achievements. The gap between the developed world and the developing countries  between the rich and the poor  is constantly widening.245.	At the same time  the United Nations systemâwhich was to be the framework for dialogue and joint efforts and was designed to harmonize varying positionsâengenders neither cohesion nor compromise. On the contrary  it is becoming a place for confrontation  for cruel indifference  for the sterile expression of hitherto repressed feelings  for contradictory or propaganda speeches. But  in establishing the United Nations  the international community entrusted it with the objectives of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international co-operation. Those objectives were the reflection of the sentiments of reconciliation and generosity of a world that had just emerged from the horror of war. Its sole ambition was to ensure the full development of the human being.246.	To be sure  during the almost 40 years of the Organization's existence  progress has been made and should continue to be made. For instance  the establishment and functioning of the United Nations  of its specialized agencies and of its operational instruments have contributed to the improvement of human well-being  to the decolonization of many countries  to the elaboration of a wide juridical system of international norms. I am ready to recognize that the co-operation between Burundi and the United Nations system has been a real source of satisfaction and hope to my Government.247.	But the United Nations system has gradually become discredited. Within it  trends have emerged that are contrary to the feelings which prevailed at its birth. There is an ever more marked lack of faith in multilateral co-operation.248.	And have not the United Nations conferences on trade and development become the almost living symbol of a world at odds with itself? That kind of conference is no longer anything but a forum for false meetings  for dialogues of the deaf  or  quite simply  for the lamentable confrontation of two monologues: that of the North and that of the South. The developed countries have become less and less interested in this framework on which the developing countries had based their future. The aspirations of peoples and countries have once again met with the opposition of forces that are doing everything possible to perpetuate the unequal relations and the privileges that history gave them. 249.	UNIDO is also a long way from meeting the challenge of the industrial take-off of the developing countries. Its most recent conferenceâthe Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984âonly confirmed  unfortunately  that the selfishness of the privileged countries is still very much with us.250.	Whether on the monetary  financial  commercial  industrial  or development aid level  international co-operation has come to a standstill. This situation has been a catastrophe for entire peoples.251.	The 1984 study on the world economy is clear on one point: the situation in the sub-Saharan regions of Africa is especially serious. That part of the continent is experiencing a crisis that is unfortunately accelerating and worsening. Per capita income is constantly decreasing  the rate of production growth is lower than the rate of population growth  the cost of debt-servicing continues to rise and the budgetary and balance-of-payment situations continue to deteriorate. Forecasts by such highly respected technical authorities as the World Bank and the Economic Commission for Africa predict a very dark future for Africa  going from a 1 per cent decrease to an infinitesimally small annual growth of 0.1 per cent in per capita incomeâI repeat  a 1 per cent decrease to an infinitesimally small annual growth of 0.1 per cent in per capita income.252.	Unfortunately  contingent problems accompany such structural problems. Unpredictable weather conditions have caused a noticeable decrease in agricultural production  which has  in turn  created a serious food crisis and led to a massive population exodus.253.	A high-ranking United Nations official  speaking of Africa  recently said: ""Today  a kind of permanent state of emergency prevails there."" It is imperative  therefore  that the urgent measures be taken that alone can enable Africa to escape from this situation into which it has been plunged by the constraints of history and an economic system built on inequitable foundations. These odds cannot be overcome without the active goodwill and solidarity of the entire international community. The assistance of the most advanced countries is indispensable to Africa  a land of unexploited potential  a continent experiencing acute growing pains.254.	Indeed  in the history of nations  each people  each country  each continent  is indebted to the contributions of othersâin culture  in technology  in inventions  in natural resources; every empire and every economic power has been built thanks to the assistance of others. It is only fair that Africa be given its chance. And it is important to emphasize that assistance based purely on specific cases will not meet the situation. It is necessary  as the French Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasized in his statement to the Assembly to support and put into effect the proposal to establish a special fund. Such a fund would be used to support the programmes of structural reform and recovery measures which the majority of African countries are now courageously undertaking.255.	This also seems to me to be the moment to make a new appeal to the sense of responsibility of the leaders of those developed countries that have not yet met the target set by the United Nations for official development assistance. In this connection  we must congratulate those countries that have met or exceeded that target and that have shown that the standard of living and well-being of their own citizens have not been adversely affected thereby.256.	Similarly  we must follow closely the efforts and attempts being made to implement the special programme for the least developed countries  which are not prepared to resign themselves to relegation to the scrap heap of development.257.	At a time when we are preparing to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the Organization should become a driving force for international co-operation. But that cannot happen without the massive  increasing and continued support of the international community for the restoration of multilateralism. Confidence in the capability of international institutions is in the interest of all peoples.258.	However  it will take more than good intentions and mere hopes to get the world out of the present crisis  which is a structural one. Development must become the problem of all the peoples. Decision-making on questions of vital interest to the peoples must no longer be the monopoly of certain countries. The developed countries must make up their minds to engage in serious negotiations to find workable solutions to the world economic crisis  which has been created and is exacerbated by the inequalities and injustices in international economic relations. In a world in which resources are limited and unequally distributed  where poverty  deprivation  ignorance and destitution are the daily lot of the majority of peoples  only the establishment of a new international economic order can provide a lasting source of peace and security.259.	Similarly  we consider that the negotiations under way on the establishment of a new information order should be pursued. Is it not partly owing to the unilateral nature of information that there is no equality or equity among the different cultures mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany just two days ago. Is it not because information is unilateral that the problems of development are poorly or little understood by the world public?260.	How  in an interdependent world  can we ignore the implications and the importance of communications in establishing harmony among the peoples  avoiding disputes and wars and establishing peace and collective security?261.	Just as it longs for economic prosperity  so the world of today also longs for peace and security.262.	Current trends in the international situation give real cause for concern. Recourse to the threat or use or force  military intervention  interference in the internal affairs of States have become everyday practice  in violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.263.	The developing world  a realm of poverty  is also becoming the realm of violence. The third-world countries are also  unfortunately  the testing grounds for the new weapons of the Powers that produce them.264.	Every year at this rostrum we deplore the state of war that has now become a familiar background in certain regions. The Middle East  the Persian Gulf^ Central America  southern Africa  South-East Asiaâ to mention but those fewâhave gradually become accustomed to war. 265.	Mankind has retained only a distant and rapidly fading memory of the collective peace that was called for at the end of the Second World War. Each day  pacifism loses ground to militarism. Every country  beginning  paradoxically  with the most powerful  is seeking so-called security based on the stockpiling of weapons  and every country claims that it is arming solely in order the better to defend itself.266.	Would it not be wiser and more sensible to forestall the event  to avert the outbreak of war  than to resign oneself to awaiting it as if it were a predestined and natural phenomenon  by establishing a framework of good-neighbourliness  co-operation and solidarity that would lead to a climate of mutual trust?267.	In keeping with the principles that led to the establishment of the United Nations  as well as those on which the OAU is based  my Government  for its part  will contribute to anything that can promote the stability and security of the countries of our region. Thus  in our own geographical environment  thanks to formal or tacit agreements of good-neighbourliness  Burundi lives in total peace and security with bordering countries  notwithstanding the problems that may exist in any one of them. This is an essential pre-condition of the development of our country and we cannot allow countries from outside our region to disturb this balance which we have not always enjoyed in the past. We believe that this is the best way to behave if we are to act in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to contribute to establishing a climate of peace and security for the whole world.268.	With regard to troubled regions  the most disquieting and dangerous situation m Africa and the one which can least be tolerated is to be found in the southern part of the continent. We must not only condemn but vigorously combat the system of apartheid institutionalized by the racist regime of Pretoria. The inhuman policy practised by South Africa is a source of instability for the sub region and constitutes the most outrageous violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The non-white peoples of South Africa are humiliated daily. They live like foreigners in their own country.269.	The so-called consultations of the people recently organized by the Pretoria regime and intended to mislead world opinion can deceive nobody. The so-called constitutional reforms  which exclude blacks from participation in the power structures  are nothing but a perpetuation and further strengthening of270.	South African attacks on neighbouring countries hostile to the Fascist policy are an affront to all States faithful to the principles of the United Nations. The entire world has followed with great interest the most recent developments in the region. The recent agreements concluded between the Republic of South Africa and its neighbours  Angola and Mozambique  a test of good faith for South Africa  must not lessen the vigilance of the States concerned and must give rise to no illusions as far as the African countries are concerned as to the real intentions of the South African regime.271.	The Government of the Republic of Burundi deplores the political  economic and military support given by certain Member countries of the United Nations  without which the Pretoria regime could not have gone so far along the path of intransigence. It is important to stress that the contempt shown by that regime is a challenge to the entire international community.272.	As regard the South African presence in Namibia  neither law nor common sense can justify this in the eyes of the international community. The Government of Pretoria continues to occupy Namibia illegally  violating the many relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.273.	Even more than the occupation of Namibia  nothing could justify the present intensive exploitation of that Territory. What will become of an independent Namibia deprived of its enormous resources by the Pretoria regime and its allies?274.	The Government of the Republic of Burundi opposes any attempt to establish a link or a parallel of any kind between the independence of that Territory and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The presence of those Cuban troops in Angola  through an act of sovereignty by the latter  could not lend legitimacy to a blatant act of aggression.275.	In any event  the situation which results from the policies of oppression applied by the Pretoria regime against the Namibian people and the policy of intimidation and terrorism against neighbouring countries constitute in themselves a serious threat to international peace and security and should therefore discourage support of Pretoria by its allies.276.	For its part  the Government of the Republic of Burundi reiterates its support for the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWA- PO and calls for the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It rejects the policy of Pretoria  with all its forms of oppression  exploitation and domination based on inequality and discrimination.277.	The southern part of Africa is unfortunately not the only danger point in the continent. The situation which prevails in north-west Africa is a cause of great concern to my Government  which condemns all manoeuvres aimed at blocking the process to self-determination of the Saharan people under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO.278.	The resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  and endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 38/40âwhich contains the text of that resolutionâshould be followed up. My Government hopes that the parties to the conflict will enter into negotiations with a view to reaching a just and lasting solution. That is the only way to restore peace and stability in the region and avoid foreign intervention and the internationalization of the conflict  which could only increase the suffering of the peoples involved. The OAU has done everything possible to bring about the decolonization of Western Sahara. The obstruction of the process is the fault not of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic but rather of the party which has rejected the organization of the referendum.279.	Also in Africa  Chad is a cause of particular concern and interest  especially for my country's region. The peace plans prepared outside the region  and satisfying foreign interests only  should give way to a Chadian plan drawn up within the society and based on the desire for unity and national reconstruction. In line with this  the international community should assist the people of Chad to bury the hatchet of war. Support for the rebuilding of Chad must be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and the cessation of hostilities  so that negotiations among the people of Chad may begin. In this connection  we welcome the decision with regard to the withdrawal of foreign troops  which should be followed by a process of national reconciliation and the definition by the people of Chad themselves of a final  stable institutional framework.280.	The situation prevailing in the Middle East is another source of great concern to my Government. The fate of the Palestinian people  the instability in Lebanon and the war between Iran and Iraq are all obstacles to lasting peace in the region. The current session of the General Assembly must give those questions the attention they deserve.281.	The deadlock over the Palestinian problem  which is the greatest obstacle to peace in the Middle East  continues  owing to the obstinacy of Israel. The refusal of Israel to recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to existence and to self-determination is dangerous and threatens the future of the entire sub region. Israel is jealous of its own rights; it should act constructively and recognize its obligations to other peoples  m this case the Palestinian people.282.	Convinced that no respite in the Middle East is possible without recognition of the Palestinian people  followed by the free exercise of its rights  Burundi supports the courageous Palestinian people in its struggle to recover its homeland and its fundamental national rights.283.	In addition  the situation in Lebanon  another hot spot in the Middle East  is a threat to regional and international peace and security. The Government of the Republic of Burundi  in solidarity with the people of Lebanon  supports that country's efforts to maintain its security  its territorial integrity  its independence and its sovereignty  within its internationally recognized borders.284.	Also in the Middle East  the war between Iran and Iraq is acquiring increasingly alarming dimensions and is threatening to extend to neighbouring countries. The Government of the Republic of Burundi encourages the various initiatives and the mediation aimed at ending that painful  fratricidal and costly conflict. In that connection  the parties to the conflict should show sufficient wisdom to open negotiations. That would be a major contribution to peace in the region and to the development of the third world  which has been seriously harmed by a host of ills resulting from that war.285.	Peace must also be built on the other side of the continent of Asia. The Korean people  whose unity was broken 30 years ago  has legitimate aspirations to reunification. My Government firmly supports the peaceful reunification of Korea. Aware that the solution of the Korean problem requires a political settlement  Burundi encourages the holding of talks to permit a reduction of tension in the Korean peninsula and the peaceful reunification of the country. It supports the holding of tripartite talks.286.	Burundi continues to be concerned about the serious tensions resulting from the ongoing conflicts in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. My Government reaffirms its firm support for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the inadmissibility of the use of force against sovereign States. We remain convinced that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Democratic Kampuchea and from Afghanistan is the only way to end these grievous situations once and for all.287.	Latin America and the Caribbean  which form another region of the third world  is also the scene of instability brought about by all kinds of foreign domination and interference in the internal affairs of States. Burundi supports the Latin American peoples  and the Contadora Group in particular  which are working for peace and stability in Central America.288.	While the world lacks the means to achieve economic prosperity and peace and security in its various regions  it seems  on the other hand  to possess a talent for self-destruction. Never before has the arms race accelerated at such a pace as today. In some countries  resources devoted to weapons are far greater than those devoted to economic activities. At the world  continental and regional levels  States are arming themselves in a frenzy which finds expression in the atrocities of localized wars.289.	What is even worse  the world accepts the possibility of nuclear war. Now then  what more serious danger hangs over us than that to which a nuclear conflagration would expose the survival of mankind? Scientific and technological advances  which should serve to enhance our well-being  are resulting in the deployment of new generations of nuclear weapons and increasingly deadly chemical weapons. As if our planet did not provide enough scope  there is a risk that the arms race may be extended to outer space.290.	It is pure hypocrisy  in these circumstances  to speak of peace and security. In their absence  it is Utopian to think of the well-being and future of mankind. International peace and security cannot be assured without general and complete disarmament. The arms race  which threatens the survival of mankind  cannot be halted without a freeze on the development  production  stockpiling and deployment of nuclear weapons and the rapid conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.291.	In this context  the major Powers with the most destructive weapons have a major role to play  and history will judge them by their sense of responsibility. The peoples of the world  including those of the nuclear Powers  are demanding that these Powers sit down at the negotiating table without further delay and without pre-conditions  in order to agree first on a freeze of nuclear and chemical weapons  then on their limitation and reduction and finally on the destruction of stockpiles. It does not matter who is right and who is wrong; the only reasonable person is he who decides to assure the survival of mankind.292.	It is clear that the future of the world depends on disarmament  because that will guarantee not only survival but the quality of life for future generations. It is no longer necessary to prove the considerable impact that it would have on the socio-economic progress of peoples.293.	I could not conclude without stressing that the world today longs for peace  security and co-operation. The aspirations expressed in 1945 remain unfulfilled. The world must also return to its roots. Only by Becoming convinced that the three purposes of the United Nations form an essential whole and by uniting in good will can our States achieve them. 294.	in that connection  as is deplored in the report on the work of the Organization by the Secretary- General	whom my delegation congratulates on his courageous efforts  it seems pointless to go over the same questions year after year and leave them with a clear conscience after shifting the responsibility to the Secretary-General and asking him to produce another report. No! The time has come to re-examine the working of the United Nations in order to make it credible.295.	On the eve of the celebration of the Organizationâs fortieth anniversary  the time has come to take a critical look at the past. Each Member State should ponder its contribution to the realization of the Organization's noble purposes and should honour its own commitments. The United Nations can only emerge strengthened  for the greater happiness of all the peoples of the world."
"10",485,"BEL",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  I would like to begin by conveying to you the congratulations of the Government of Belgium on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly and expressing our wishes for success in the fulfilment of this most prestigious and essential task.104.	My country is delighted that a person of your stature has been chosen for this high office. It views this as an assurance of the success of our work. Furthermore  Belgium is happy to see a representative of a region of the world to which it attaches a very special interest chairing the General Assembly of an institution which  as underlined by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  constitutes the embodiment of multilateralism itself.105.	Allow me also to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Mr. Illueca  for the manner in which he guided the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly and for the positive contribution he thus made to the Organization.106.	The universal character of the United Nations unquestionably remains one of its most important features. Its task  which is to receive into its fold all the States of the world on an equal footing  with respect for the sovereignty of each  is essential to its mission of peace. I am therefore happy to greet the arrival of a new member  Brunei Darussalam. I assure it of our intention to maintain with it relations of meaningful co-operation and friendship.107.	I wish to recall with emotion one of our late colleagues  Mr. Lee Bum-Suk  former Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea. A year ago Mr. Lee led the delegation of observers of the Republic of Korea to the General Assembly. A week later  he fell victim  with other Korean leaders  to a repugnant political crime. I express the admiration of the Belgian people and Government for the moderation and self-restraint with which the leaders of the Republic of Korea reacted to this assault  refusing to respond to violence with violence.108.	This tragedy underscores more than ever how imperative it is to find  without delay  a peaceful and democratic solution to the question of the reunification of the Korean peninsula. Belgium shares the opinion of the Republic of Korea that any negotiation in this respect must begin with a dialogue between the two parts of Korea  a dialogue aimed at restoring confidence between them  which is indispensable.109.	While we await this reunification  Belgium declares itself in favour of the simultaneous entry of both Koreas into the United Nations. A decision to this effect could contribute to easing the tension in the peninsula and would also be in conformity with the principle of universality of the United Nations  a principle which we uphold.110.	This year Belgium had the privilege of welcoming the Secretary-General. I express our gratitude to him for this visit and our appreciation of his untiring efforts for world peace and security. The talks I had with him enabled me to understand better his dedication to his duties and his personal commitment to the best performance of his tasks. We think particularly of the consultations he is holding to bring about the necessary conditions for a peaceful settlement of the question of Cyprus.111.	I read the Secretary-General's report this year with the utmost attention  just as I did his two preceding ones. Similarly  I took note with great interest of his statements in other forumsâparticularly two speeches he delivered last May  one to the Brookings Institution and the United Nations Association of the United States of America and the other at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. I want him to know how much his analysis of the crisis of multilateralism impressed me and how much I admire the opinion he expressed  as the highest official of the United Nations  on this crisis and its consequences.112.	What the Secretary-General said reminded me of the words of one of my predecessors  Paul-Henri Spaak  who in 1946  as you know  was the first President of the General Assembly. Even before assuming this post he made clear at San Francisco how he viewed the work of the Organization  declaring:""Everybody today stresses the necessary solidarity that ought to manifest itself in time of war  and one is right to do so. But this solidarity would probably become unnecessary if the peoples understood more clearly that they must help one another in times of peace.""From a strategic point of view  there are no more frontiers. When war breaks out in one part of the world  it does not take long to devastate the whole world. That is the terrible vision that is presented to us to remind us from time to time  since we tend to forget it  that we are all dependent on one another.""But why do we wait for war to become conscious of this reality? It also existsâas much  and perhaps even moreâin times of peace. It is fine to be united to achieve victory  but it would be even better  much more effective and less costly to be united to build a better world.""One cannot limit oneself to drafting texts for use only when the situation becomes serious. I wish that we could build something that would become part of our daily life  of our daily concerns  something that would not only come to mind when the spectre of war threatened us but would help us to respond effectively to the disturbing questions that will be posed by the economic and social organization of the world.""I should like the international organization that will result from our work not only to tell us hew we may avert war and how to win it if  despite everything  it breaks out  but also to give us the means to ensure peace by giving men the chance to live with employment and in happiness.""113.	The Secretary-General expresses the same concern when he calls in his report for the firm establishment of the three main elements of a stable international order: an accepted system of maintaining international peace and security; disarmament and arms limitation; and the progressive development of a just and effective system of international economic relations. I wish him to know that we share his views and that he has our full support.114.	My colleague  Mr. Barry  current President of the Council of Ministers of the 10 member countries of the European Communities  has accurately expressed their views from this rostrum [6th meeting]  for which I thank him. I recognize Belgium's own opinions in the ones he expressed and in the survey he made of an international situation that is more disquieting than ever. I can therefore concentrate on just a few subjects.115.	First  however  I should like to stress  as did Mr. Barry  the importance my country attaches to the planned meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the countries of Central America and the Contadora Group  on the one hand  and of the Ten  accompanied by the European Communities Commission  and Spain and Portugal  on the other. This meeting  which will take place in a few days  will enable representatives of States linked by history and culture to consider the problems of a region torn by a crisis rooted in political  economic and social problems. We hope that this meeting will bring about a new kind of co-operation which will lead to peace  economic recovery and social progress.116.	Rereading the statements I had the honour to make in the past two years to the Genera! Assembly  I found that both covered subjects related to security and disarmament  the reduction of tension  and peace. My predecessors had already deemed these problems sufficiently important to dedicate most of their attention to them  as did the majority of my colleagues at this rostrum.117.	Is not that normal? Is not the pursuit of peace and the means to ensure or preserve it the prime objective of the United Nations and the foremost duty of the international community? The United Nations even dedicated two special sessions of the General Assembly to disarmament  in the work of which we placed great expectations. Unfortunately  crises have continued to cause upheavals in certain regions of the world and are all the more disturbing since they are set against a backdrop of regrettable tensions in East-West relations.118.	Indeed  far from having narrowed  the division between the Western countries and those of the Warsaw Pact seems to have widened  the arms control negotiations are stalled or have been interrupted  and the political dialogue itself seems to be in deadlock  to such an extent that some political commentators do not hesitate to call 1984 ""the lost year"".119.	In fact  1984 seems not to have borne fruit with respect to disarmament  and even to detente  but it has not been completely lost for peace  and we should beware of an excessive and unreasonable pessimism  for a number of reasons.120.	I cannot help but feel that the most serious threats to peace he in imbalances and errors of judgement. Undoubtedly  nuclear weapons have such a terrifyingly destructive power that no side could hope to win a nuclear conflict it might have started; but  precisely for that reason  should we not admit that this formidable weapon is a powerful deterrent ?121.	The danger of a nuclear conflict would be greatest precisely if one of the potential adversaries were to stop viewing the atomic weapon as unacceptable and were to consider it as a weapon ""like all others""âthat is  a weapon which would enable it to wage and to win a warâand if  through misreading or miscalculation  it felt itself to be in a position to subject its enemy to a nuclear blaze without fear of retaliation. Hence  risks are due far more to imbalances and errors of judgement than to an increase in armaments. I think  therefore  that it is the upsetting of the balanced equilibrium which fosters the arms race  and not the reverse.122.	In this context I should like to take this opportunity  in my capacity of Minister for Foreign Affairs of a member State of the Atlantic Alliance  to reaffirm emphatically two fundamental elements of the doctrine of the Alliance: first  that the strategy of the Alliance is not to ""wage war"" or even to ""win a war""  but indeed to see that war never breaks out; and  further  that none of our weapons will ever be used except to react against aggression.123.	I should like to add that while taking the necessary steps to maintain and  where needed  restore this balance  essential to security and peace  Belgium and its allies have taken measures to avoid an arms race: indeed  they have twice decided to cut down their nuclear arsenals and resolved to reduce those arsenals by one nuclear warhead for each intermediate-range missile deployed. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has also adopted the doctrine that ""only the minimum number of those forces necessary to support NATO's agreed strategy of deterrence and defence should be retained"".124.	Indeed  although balance seems to us indispensable  it does not follow that such balance must necessarily be at the present level. On the contrary  Belgium  like its allies  favours a balance at the lowest possible level  and that applies equally to conventional and to nuclear weapons. It is precisely for that reason that we are wedded to the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  as well as to all other negotiations likely to bring about reductions in the level of armaments without affecting the security of each country concerned.125.	We have pointed out that this will not be an easy task. Thus  we advocate the view that we should set ourselves to developing measures of confidence and security conducive to stimulating a climate in which negotiations having a more specific bearing on the reduction of armaments will stand a better chance of bearing fruit. Our efforts at the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  at Stockholm  have no other intent.126.	Anther reason for not indulging in excessive pessimism is precisely the willingness of the Atlantic Alliance to enter into negotiations at any moment and without pre-conditions. This overture has unfortunately not so far met with any response from the leaders of the Warsaw Pact nations. I want to believe that those leaders will come to realize how sterile such an attitude can be and that they will bring themselves to grasp the hand we hold out to them.127.	Finally  we are now on the eve of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and I cherish the hope that for the greater well-being of the whole international community this exercise will be fruitful. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has been a success so far as limiting horizontal proliferation goes. Unfortunately  the results have not been equally convincing with regard to the limitation of vertical proliferation. If some progress could be made in that regard also  the chances of success of the Third Review Conference would be enhanced.128.	My intention is not to minimize the importance of the present crisis but only to put it back in its right perspective. The situation is perhaps not as alarming as some would claim  but it is worrying in more ways than one. First of all  we see the dynamics of overbidding  along with mounting tensions and a correspondingly diminishing confidence  taking root. Further  it has to be recognized that the increase in military budgets deprives the developing nations of necessary  indeed vital  aid. These expenditures also weigh very heavily on our own economies in these days of budgetary restrictions.129.	There are thus enough good reasons for wanting to reverse the present course of events without having to invoke bad ones. What makes us want to say ""Enough!"" to arms development is the waste that such development implies  the responsibility of the developed countries towards those not yet sufficiently developed  and the danger of nuclear proliferation.130.	We should not deceive ourselves  however. It will not be easy to retie the broken thread of negotiation. Too much emotion has entered into play; too much confidence has been undermined. We shall nevertheless have to overcome distrust  to rise above disappointment and to resume the dialogue. There is no alternative.131.	In the present state of affairs it is undoubtedly imperative to make every effort to achieve substantive progress in the near future at the most important negotiating tables which are still operating at Geneva  Stockholm and Vienna. The prospects of resuming negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces or the strategic arms reduction talks have not so far materialized  though we pray most fervently for such resumption. The hope of seeing an early start of discussions on the demilitarization of space has not yet materialized either.132.	We thus note with the utmost regret that practically all the established channels of discussion between East and West are blocked. For Belgium  it is not the venue which is essential: what is essential is that negotiations resume and be brought to a successful conclusion.133.	Perhaps we shall have to start from new  more realistic and  for the present  less ambitious bases  but our goal will always remain the same  that is  to turn Europe into an area of peace and security  based on respect for freedom and for the legal and humanitarian principles that must govern the relations between States and peoples.134.	Belgium  for one  has always considered that this ongoing dialogue is essential to the restoration of confidence but that it is not enough. We should not limit our contacts to the political issues alone; we must encourage the development of sound economic relations on realistic and mutually beneficial bases. Cultural  technological and scientific relations also have an essential role to play in bringing closer together individuals and communities across borders.135.	I am convinced that through patience and perseverance and by keeping in mind clear goals we shall in the end fulfil the true ideals of the Helsinki Final Act in which we had placed so much hope.136.	As the representative of a European country  I beseech all other countries of that continent to transcend the atmosphere of mistrust which in 1984 has rendered too many discussions fruitless  in order once again to take the path of negotiations. This will undoubtedly not be easy  but let us by all means take the path of dialogue  step by step  towards a horizon which will gradually grow ever wider.137.	By its tone  its philosophy and the proposals it contained  the statement made yesterday before the Assembly by the President of the United States constitutes  to my mind  a positive contribution to the early resumption of this indispensable dialogue. Such dialogue is important not only for the countries of the Warsaw Pact and for those of the Atlantic Alliance but for the whole world  for the East-West tension does not affect only those States which play a direct part in it. In fact  it hampers  sometimes greatly  international relations as a whole. It weighs heavily on the work of the United Nations  making its action in the service of peace and development even more difficult. The President of the Council of Ministers of the 10 member countries of the European Communities has stressed this in a truly remarkable fashion in his statement. Is it not true that this tension also often lends an additional dimension to local conflicts which  by broadening them  exacerbates them and makes them more difficult to solve?138.	My Government  which respects the sovereignty and independence of States as well as genuine non-alignment  has indeed always expressed the desire that the utmost care be taken to avoid involving other continents in the ideological and political differences which may develop between East and West and  in this context  not to bring division to those continents.139.	For example  two of the principles on which my Government bases its African policy are: first  that our country will strive to prevent the involvement of Africa and the African countries against their will in clashes between blocs and major Powers; and secondly  that it will endeavour to prevent anything that might contribute to the division and weakening of the African continent and will  rather  strive to promote inter-African co-operation.140.	The resumption of the North-South dialogue is imperative at all costs and should provide the effort required to combat the economic crisis which affects us all.141.	Belgium  like most other industrialized nations  is suffering particularly from unemployment  which is a source of anxiety for a large portion of our population. This makes wide-ranging industrial re- adaptation indispensable.142.	However  the economic crisis affects even more seriously the least favoured nations. Undoubtedly  some signs of economic recovery have been evident for some time  but so far it has had only a very limited effect on the industrialized world and even less on the developing countries.143.	The considerable indebtedness of many States seriously jeopardizes their development efforts even though some of them have faced this burden courageously and  with the help of the IMF  have at least begun to find some solutions. Famine continues its devastation  and for some among us it is the question no longer of development but of simple survival.144.	In a world of ever-increasing economic inter-dependence  the international economic situation concerns us all directly. No matter which continent we belong to  what stage of development we have reached or what our political and ideological options may be  it is in our interest  just as it is our duty  to work together to find solutions to these acute problems  which weigh heavily  if perhaps unequally  on each one of us.145.	What do we see? The global negotiations are at present deadlocked. Proof of this is the fact that the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  have disappointed us in many ways. Even if the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  produced certain results  we cannot affirm that the North-South dialogue  in which we had placed so much hope  has had all the expected results.146.	What then can we do? I sincerely believe that we must  in spite of everything  strengthen the North- South dialogue  but we must realize that this dialogue can only be successful if it leads to balanced commitments. I am convinced that it is by heading in this direction that genuine progress can be made.147.	Belgium appeals urgently to the United Nations and in particular to its specialized agencies to spare no effort and to use all the means at their disposal to fight the scourge of recession and its consequences. Millions of men and women expect the international community to translate into action  under United Nations guidance  the commitments accepted under its Charter.148.	In this spirit  Belgium advocates an agreement between the European monetary zone and the zones of the yen and the dollar. This should result in a more stable basis for the world economy and a climate of increased confidence.149.	Furthermore  Belgium believes that everything possible must be done to find speedy solutions to the problems of the indebtedness of the developing countries. We consider this to be an indispensable condition of the recovery of the international economy and the improvement of North-South relations.150.	We cannot afford to despair. Recent experience proves that when our States are challenged by a situation in which man  his dignity and his life are at stake  they can surmount their different interests and their political differences to decide on and put into effect together the practical means required by the situation. I am thinking of the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984. I have rarely seen an international conference inspired by such sense of human solidarity.151.	From the outset  the countries participating in that Conference recognized that the problem of refugees in Africa is the concern of all  for it is the common responsibility of all nations  even if  regrettably  some States chose to remain aloof from this great movement of international solidarity. On the one hand  the African Governments clearly reaffirmed their commitment to do everything in their power to find lasting solutions for often painful human problems. On the other hand  donor Governments  which offer their financial assistance  committed themselves to working hand in hand with the African countries to support such solutions and to bear the often heavy cost of the infrastructure which the reception and repatriation of refugees implies for the countries concerned. The international development organizations  for their part  said that they are ready to co-operate fully in this undertaking.152.	It is not surprising  therefore  that this spirit  marked by positive and constructive determination and humanitarian concern  enabled the Conference to culminate in the adoption by consensus of a Declaration and Programme of Action. These documents are clear and reflect very well indeed the will that inspired all the countries represented  since they demonstrate the commitment of all to work together  in close solidarity  sharing the burdens  on the basis of a strategy designed to bring about a lasting solution to the refugee problem in Africa.153.	Moreover  the Conference stressed the vital importance of the complementarity of aid to refugees and development aid. The commitment to give concrete expression to this correlation was one of the substantive achievements of the Conference. Emergency aid and assistance are major aspects of this correlation and must continue. The efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to promote long-term solutions through voluntary repatriationâthe most desirable solution  since it goes right to the heart of the refugee problemâand through settlement programmes have proved correct. All these efforts must also be continued. But to ensure these solutions  it is necessary to integrate the projects relating to refugees within the development process. The Conference clearly confirmed this principle.154.	It thus took its place within the general framework of North-South relations and proved that substantial progress is possible within this context as long as there is the will and the realism.155.	I firmly believe that if the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa achieved such success it was because its participants put the determination to save lives above all else  for it was for humanity that the United Nations was createdâto save mankind from war  protect it from oppression  free it from poverty and hunger.156.	Every time that this is remembered  the actions of the United Nations have been crowned with success  a success which the Secretary-General points to in his report. Each time it is forgotten  the Organization has failed.157.	It is time  on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  that we remember this.158.	It is  moreover  what the Secretary-General asked for in the statement he made on 31 May 1984 before the Preparatory Committee for the Fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations. He said that the anniversary should be an occasion for the world community to ââspeak out frankly and with a full sense of responsibility towards the entire human family and its planetary home  about the shortcomings of Member States and of this Organization to fulfil such vital purposes as the consolidation of peace and security  disarmament  economic development and the promotion of human rights"". He went on to say that ""a firm recommitment by all Member States to their obligations under the Charter and its fundamental purposes . . . needs to be expressed not so much through ceremony and in words as in policies and actions. A renewal of faith in the Organization is absolutely necessary to the future of the global community.""159.	That is a proposition to which Belgium  for one  intends to make a contribution  and it wishes to do so in the closest co-operation with each and every one of its fellow Member States in the Organization.160.	May this fortieth anniversary offer us the opportunity to ensure that elements that unite us prevail over those that divide us. Let us try to remember the tragedy of the Second World War  the state of the world at the end of that conflict  our desire that such a calamity should never happen again  and our decision to create  to that end  the organization which became the United Nations. After the tragic failure of the League of Nations  the hopes of humanity were transferred to an organization which would be universal and would be able to ensure collective security once and for all  tackle fundamental economic issues and reaffirm the basic rights of every human being. Let us recall the extraordinary surge of hope to which the birth of the United Nations gave rise in our people from all walks of life. Let us try from now on to fulfil that hope and let us learn from our failures.161.	A poet of my country  Emile Verhaeren  once sang the epic of a century-old tree  evoking the ordeals by which its growth had been marked from season to season; but he concluded:""Its energy  however  Never failed One single moment. It wished  unwaveringly  its life To expand and be more beautiful In every spring.""That is my wish for the United Nations on the eve of its fortieth anniversary."
"11",531,"BEN",39,1984,"ï»¿It is a signal honour for me to speak for the first time as head of the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin to the representatives of the international community gathered here to explore  together  ways and means to ensure the peaceful coexistence and security of all the peoples of the world  for which we all yearn and for which we strive with all our strength  and to bring about the best conditions for mutually beneficial international cooperation.300.	I should like  Sir  to add the warm congratulations of my delegation to the unanimous chorus of those addressed to you by preceding speakers on the occasion of your election as President of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly. The People's Republic of Benin is especially pleased that the difficult and important task of leading our discussions has this year been entrusted to an outstanding  experienced man such as yourself  whose thorough knowledge of all the inner workings of the organs that make up the United Nations system is incontestable. Above all  however  you represent a country that has achieved an undeniable reputation on the international scene  and especially in Africa  through the tireless efforts it has constantly made in the search for a lasting solution to the problem facing our brothers in southern Africa who are the victims of all types of racial oppression.301.	You are taking up your important lofty task in the footsteps of Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  who led the work of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly with great wisdom and remarkable clear-sightedness and firmness. We pay him a heartfelt tribute.302.	The delegation of Benin would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General in keeping with the outstanding qualities he displays in putting into practice courageously and with perseverance the noble ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. The brilliant report on the work of the Organization that he has submitted to us is further evidence of his courage and clarity of mind. My delegation would like to extend to him the sincere thanks of the People's Republic of Benin for the friendship he showed our country by paying an official visit to Cotonou in January 1984  following the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The National Executive Council of the People's Republic of Benin wishes  through me  to reiterate to the Secretary-General its total support for him in the heavy responsibilities he has assumed.303.	I should also like warmly to welcome Brunei Darussalam  the new Member of the United Nations.304.	Each year  impelled by the inevitable surge of solidarity that must unite us  we meet here to take up the major problems of our time  those that affect the life of our States and our peoples and constitute a threat to the fragile balance of today's world and that of the future. The floodlights that we direct today upon the status of mankind force us to face many painful facts that do not make for a great deal of optimism. Indeed  on the horizon the clouds of disaster and collapse arc building up.305.	In the throes of selfishness  of the will to power and of greed  our world has turned into an overheated planet subject to increased tensions of all kinds that are seemingly impervious to joint action  dialogue  understanding  and recognition of the inevitability of our common fate and the universality of our problems the better to solve them. Awareness of the common dangers awaiting us  instead of inspiring us to unite to avert them  makes us lose our heads and pushes us into taking defensive measures each as irrational as the other.306.	How is it that  everywhere  we see  rising up in ever greater numbers  sorcerer's apprentices desperate to destabilize and compromise everything? We cannot resign ourselves to accepting these signs as heralding disruption and cataclysm  because our problems and difficulties are not insurmountable.307.	On the world economic scene  where the most serious disorders prevail  a common political will to link all the major regions of our planet in brotherly action to avert hunger and guarantee progress is the only answer. It is the sole solution to our world in disarray  where the human rights recognized and inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations are everywhere trampled underfoot and no longer effectively applied  because of the burdens which weigh so heavily on freedom  the right to decide one's own destiny  the right to food  the right to a roof over one's head and the right to take care of oneself and to be educated.308.	To mention these fundamental rights today is to take note of the tragic situation at the end of this twentieth century of the billions of people who make up the third world and who are totally disregarded in a system which does not pay them enough for their efforts and their production  thus giving rise to a cycle of impoverishment. The painful efforts of the developing countries to restructure their economies are cancelled out by the constant worsening of the terms of trade. It seems that nothing can alleviate the poverty of the developing countries. The return to arbitrary and unjustified protectionism has a constant effect on the production and export prospects of the developing countries  blocking their access to foreign markets. These countries seem to have been struck by a blind fate  but a closer examination shows that there are reasons for the situation from which they are suffering. Those reasons are to be found in the logic of a system based on profit dictated by the multinationals for their own selfish interests. The poor relations of the international economic system  the third-world countries  receive only small favours  given them because of their marginal participation in a hard and pitiless system that does not belong to them. The worst effects of the crisis are destined for them.309.	In this way  the aid planned by the institutions devoted to co-operation is considerably reduced. To monetary depreciation has now been added what some people call ""galloping demography"". In real terms  per capita transfers have declined by 20 per cent  for example  in the countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific  reducing the total aid in real terms to $4 per capita per year.310.	It is all the more important to recall these facts because certain of the richest States use the crisis as a pretext to make massive reductions in resources for development. A reduction of 30 per cent in total aid had even been envisaged without the slightest hesitation in certain decision-making circles. If that measure had been applied  it could only have seriously worsened the precarious position of the developing countries  some of which  lacking resources  no longer have access to lending markets.311.	One of the biggest problems facing the third world is the unprecedented growth in external debt  which means that our countries now produce only to pay to service debts which are increasing at a diabolical and unfair rate. Efforts at stabilization  growth and economic adjustment are thrown off course by rising interest rates and the soaring dollar  which are creating tension throughout the world. The external debt of the third world is now nearly $850 billion. The pernicious machinery which has created this stagnation must be changed. No one stands to gain by allowing the situation to develop to the breaking-point  which has already nearly been reached in some regions  where a suspension of payments to creditor banks has been ordered. Such scenarios  which mark a new stage in the economic decay of the third world  now bordering on total collapse and bankruptcy  involve the risk  if we are not careful  of bringing about deterioration in North- South relations  tension and confrontation on a frightening scale.312.	Obtaining liquid funds on the international financial market requires prodigious efforts  including blackmail and sordid deals. The biggest international borrowers cannot obtain what they need  and States with large budgetary deficits which try to siphon off world savings for themselves cannot do so either  despite various manoeuvres.313.	The survival of our countries cannot be accommodated to a world reorganization plan designed for and characterized by the technological and industrial domination of the rich countries. This solution  which seeks at all costs to restore profit levels in a rigid way  giving the strongest a privileged place  would undoubtedly leave the weakest by the wayside. Close examination shows that the proposed rescheduling or refinancing of debts to ensure the maintenance of the rich countries' position in the existing economic system cannot bring about worthwhile improvements in the situation of our countries.314.	What our sick world needs today is to make financial management truly democratic  which requires the drafting of a contract of solidarity and therefore the establishment of a new international economic order.315.	The present system is blocked. Therefore  a restructuring which will help the development of such bodies as the IMF and the World Bank is more necessary than ever. If we are to succeed in this new task we must adopt other criteria than those of profitability. A genuine contract of solidarity between the wealthy and the poor countries has yet to be established. Here we may follow the path advocated by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  providing for the creation of a development fund financed by reducing and transferring expenditure on armaments.316.	It is more important than ever today  as we face the unavoidable reality of poverty and hunger  which continue to be the cause of considerable political upheavals  to find solutions to the serious contradictions of our world in crisis. The prosperity of the wealthy countries cannot continue to be built on the destitution and poverty of the poor countries. It is impossible to think of any kind of development if the problems of survival facing some of the third- world countries are not overcome and equitably resolved. Helping the third world to create a more just international order means helping oneself and guaranteeing the progress of mankind.317.	For four yearsânotably in its resolution 35/88 of 5 December 1980âthe General Assembly has appealed to the international community to give financial  material and technical assistance to Benin in order to assist it in overcoming its economic difficulties. Meanwhile the Secretary-General has not ceased to take dynamic measures to mobilize and organize that special economic assistance to Benin. In particular  review missions have gone to Benin periodically to take stock  together with our authorities  of the progress of the programme. There was also a round-table conference of the socio-economic development partners of Benin  held at Cotonou in March 1983  which received crucial assistance from UNDP.318.	I should like to take this opportunity to express once again the sincere gratitude of the people of Benin  its Party and Government to the States Members and specialized agencies of the United Nations for the Interest they have taken in  and the help they have given to  the programme of special economic assistance to Benin and Benin's development plan for 1983-1987.319.	A new mission to review the programme went to Benin last June. The results and recommendations of that mission are to be found in the Secretary- General's report on that subject 320.	Here I should like to recall that the results of the four years of implementing the projects of the programme remain modest because of certain hazards  such as drought  which have upset the original programme schedule.321.	My delegation would like to express its sincere thanks  on behalf of the Government of Benin  to all the States and the bodies of the United Nations system which provided emergency assistance to Benin during its serious problems following the drought of 1983-1984.322.	I should like to appeal to all States Members  to international organizations and to the specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations to make new efforts to provide assistance to my country so that effect may be given without any further delay to the development projects under the United Nations programme of special economic assistance to Benin.323.	My delegation  together with other brother countries  would like the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly to adopt a resolution alerting the international community to the need to increase the capacity of the specialized agencies of the United Nations to assist countries that are victims of desertification and drought.324.	I would have liked very much not to have to speak at this session of certain political crises  or at least to speak of them solely in other terms and say how pleased I was that they had been eliminated or overcome. Unfortunately  despite the judicious and relevant proposals which some delegations have formulated at previous sessions in this Hall  I have to say with deep bitterness that the international political situation is more disquieting than ever.325.	Indeed  whether it be in Africa  the Middle East  Latin America or elsewhere in the world  the clearly expressed will and good intentions of some have not been effective because of the duplicity  treachery and obstructive attitude of others with regard to tackling certain problems already considered at great length last year. What is worse  those problems have been exacerbated  while  at the same time  other particularly difficult situations have been created by those self-same States which have been openly and cynically profiting from the confusion  tensions and manoeuvres of all kinds.326.	The delegation of Benin is deeply concerned by the anachronistic situation which persists in southern Africa because of the minority racist regime of Pretoria  which is denounced by all peoples that cherish peace  freedom and justice. Indeed  human dignity and the fundamental principles and the resolutions of the United Nations continue to be flouted in southern Africa by the racist regime of Pretoria  which enjoys the active support and barely concealed complicity of those who still seek colonialist and neo-colonialist adventures  as well as any loot or profit they can extract therefrom.327.	The black people of South Africa are still innocent victims of the ignominious policy of apartheid  whose well-known corollaries include blind  bloody  barbarous repression  mass arrests and cowardly assassinations.328.	The illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa unfortunately continues. There can be no doubt here. The stubborn persistence in attempting to link the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  the extreme excesses of racism and the violations of human rights all prove  if proof were needed  that the South African military rabble has no intention of putting an end to its annexationist  racist policy and is increasing its well-known diabolical plans and manoeuvres.329.	The sham constitutional reforms and the electoral charades organized last August for the Coloured and Indian peoples of South Africa are part of this reprehensible daily fare.330.	Fortunately  the oppressed people of South Africa displayed a spirit of maturity and solidarity and very quickly understood the cynical purpose of the so-called new constitution  which is to destroy their unity and entrench the odious system of apartheid. Those oppressed people took a heroic  historical decision and successfully boycotted the fake elections.331 The People's Republic of Benin  which unreservedly condemns this new farce organized by the Pretoria r6gime under the ingenious slogan of ""constitutional reforms""  welcomes the response of the people of South Africa to this latest apartheid trick.332. My country also welcomed Security Council resolution 554 (1984) for its denunciation and firm rejection of the so-called new constitution in South Africa However  going beyond that resolution  Benin is convinced that it is urgently necessary to adopt comprehensive sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations against that pariah of the international community.333.	I wish furthermore to assure all those in southern Africa who are struggling for independence  peace  freedom  equality and justice of the support of the people and Government of Benin. I reaffirm in particular my country's support for the ANC in its glorious struggle against apartheid and for SWAPO in its heroic fight to win independence for Namibia. Indeed  my country is deeply convinced that only the complete elimination of the scourge of apartheid and the unconditional and comprehensive application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) can bring peace to southern Africa.334.	We whole-heartedly desire such peace also in Western Sahara  where the confusion and the impasse concerning the question of decolonization in that region is of concern to us for more than one reason. My country  which welcomes the resolution on Western Sahara adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983  is convinced that through its recommendations the pan-African organization has provided the ideal framework within which a political settlement of the burning Saharan problem can be negotiated by peaceful means. That just point of view was largely shared by the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session  when it did not hesitate to endorse those recommendations. Unfortunately  this did not take into account certain obstructionist  delaying tactics. Those behind such tactics are gratified by the confusion which they have brought about deliberately and knowingly  confusion harmful to the interest of the peoples of the region  who are the unfortunate victims of a conflict which with a little common sense  logic and frankness could have been avoided.335.	My delegation  faithful to the principle of the right to self-determination of all peoples without exception and aware that such confusion cannot constitute an honourable outcome to the Saharan tragedy  draws the attention of the Assembly to the imperative need to do everything possible to break the deadlock in the situation in Western Sahara  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations.336.	My delegation reaffirms its support for the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  which Benin recognizes as a sovereign State. It is firmly convinced that only the logical and responsible implementation of the recommendations of the OAU and the United Nations can lead to a just solution of the Saharan problem and allow the peoples of the region  which have suffered for so long  to devote themselves to the complex tasks of development which await them.337.	Similar tasks await the brother people of Chad  to whose tragedy no delegation  certainly not my own  can remain indifferent. In fact  the situation of ""no war  no peace"" which has prevailed for several months in Chad is as harmful to the national reconstruction effort as is war itself. Only genuine peace and effective reconciliation among all the sons of Chad will make it possible for the people of Chad to resume  with calmness and a renewed zealousness  the enormous task of reconstruction of their country  which has been so harshly affected by years of civil war.338.	My country supports all efforts from whatever direction likely to bring peace and harmony to Chad through the essential unity of all its people. That is why my delegation welcomes all the attempts at reconciliation made by the current Chairman of the OAU and several African heads of State.339.	My delegation welcomes with satisfaction the decision of the Governments of France and Libya to withdraw their forces and supporting elements from Chad as of 25 September 1984. We trust that the operation that has just begun will indeed be the prelude to a process of true reconciliation among all the sons of Chad and to lasting peace in that brother country.340.	At the General Assembly's thirty-eighth session  the delegation of Benin sounded the alarm concerning the deterioration of the situation and the increasing tension in the Middle East. The delegation I lead is concerned over the developments in that area  which is one of the most explosive on earth because of the scope of the tragedy taking place there. Once again it appears that peace and security in that region undoubtedly depend on the respect shown by the Zionist State of Israel for all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  which it has obstinately refused to recognize and to implement. The Organization should duly assess the attitude of Israel and draw all the relevant conclusions from it. The international community cannot and should not remain passive in view of the policy of aggression  genocide  massacre and the establishment of settlements which the Zionist leaders continue to practise with impunity.341.	All appropriate measures should be taken to bring reason to bear on the Zionist State and to prevail upon it not only to implement United Nations resolutions  for which it has shown reprehensible disdain  but also to abandon a policy which constitutes a source of instability and danger for all the peoples of the region and a permanent threat to international peace and security.342.	In view of the current state of events  my country demands  on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions  the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon and from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967. We also demand that the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to establish an independent State in Palestine  be recognized without delay. To that end  my country lends and will always lend its political and diplomatic support to the PLO  the sole representative of the oppressed people of Palestine.343.	Lebanon  the tragic theatre of fratricidal confrontations brought about and maintained by foreign intervention  is an object of concern to my delegation. We welcome the establishment in Lebanon of a Government of National Unity in which all political tendencies of the country co-operate in the democratic management of the affairs of the Lebanese State and for the restoration of peace and security in the country. My delegation hopes that that Government  the symbol of dialogue among Lebanese brothers  will honourably direct the destiny of Lebanon and consolidate  for the well-being of all  the peace which has progressively been established in the country.344.	I could not refer to the situation in the Middle East without also dealing with the persistent conflict between Iran and Iraq  two brother countries which are engaged in a merciless war. The recent developments in that conflict are a source of great concern and deep apprehension to my delegation  because the risks of internationalization of the conflict are increasing and the massive destruction that has taken place in various parts only cancels out the development efforts of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples  which have already lost a large number of their worthy sons in that war.345.	My delegation once again invites Iran and Iraq to sit down at the negotiating table so as to settle peacefully  on the basis of established principles  the dispute between them  which has lasted for more than four years and which is not in the interests of their respective peoples.346.	As much as the situations in Africa and in the Middle East  where there is total instability and where  because of the tensions  the peoples are diverted from the development concerns that should be preoccupying them  the situations in Asia and Central America also deserve our attention.347 My country is concerned over the presence of foreign troops in the Korean peninsula  which constitutes a major obstacle to bringing about a just and honourable settlement of the crisis persisting in that part of the world. My delegation fervently hopes that the foreign forces will leave the peninsula as soon as possible so that the tireless struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the just  peaceful  independent and democratic reunification of all Korea may be quickly achieved.348. In Central America  my country is shocked to note all the orchestrated actions taken against the progressive peoples and States of the region  whose legitimate rights are being disregarded and flouted. My delegation wishes to reaffirm the firm commitment of the people and Government of Benin to the universally recognized rights of any people to determine its own destiny and to have the political system of its choice.349.	My delegation urges all States to conform in their actions to the fundamental principles which apply to all States  large or small  weak or powerful.350.	My country stands in solidarity with all op-pressed peoples  with all States suffering from aggression in Central America  and we reiterate to them our staunch support in their just struggle to free themselves from oppression and foreign domination. Benin lends its support to the Latin American peoples and the Contadora Group  which are working for peace and stability in Latin America.351.	It is easy for all of us together to make our world more liveable and more responsive to our needs  provided that we make the necessary effort to find factual expression of our will to eliminate resolutely the spectre of death and holocaust  to which we refer more and more frequently  considering disarmament an imperative need for the survival of the human race.352.	Today  a sad and fearsome new reality is coming into being and it threatens to dash again the meagre hopes we were beginning to have about the impossibility of nuclear war. Indeed  up to this time some had been sure of the improbability of a nuclear conflict  because no one could be the victor in such a cataclysm. Previously  one could still maintain the purely deterrent nature of the emplacement of nuclear devices. Unfortunately  day after day new events lend a new dimension to the situation.353.	Despite everything that has been said or done in that regard  the unbridled arms race still continues. However  the essential fact is that  far from a lasting restoration of a balance which had been disrupted because of a new type of weapon of mass destruction  the deployment of a weapon of the same type to counter that has represented in fact only another stage in the nuclear-arms race. That shows that  as we are speaking here  the development of nuclear weapons has finally become part of a logic of warâin other words  part of war plans and plans of military operations.354.	In the circumstances  how can we not be overcome with deep anxiety  in the face of such a serious threat? Much has been written lately about the cruise missiles  whose deployment  it seems  makes control and compliance with arms limitation agreements very difficult and increases the possibility of working around and thus violating such agreements.355.	The cost of a cruise missile  one single missile  would suffice to alleviate the sufferings and change the lives of a million people that are today the victims of adverse climatic conditions in the Sahel in Africa. Today these weapons may be counted by the hundreds.356.	To what court should we resort to plead the cause of peace  which is nevertheless within the realm of possibility?357.	More and more astronomical sums are devoted to the construction and maintenance of arsenals for conventional and nuclear war  whereas at the same time we deliberately or unwittingly turn away from international responsibilities which call upon us to mobilize these precious resources and devote them to development and to improving the living conditions of peoples  including those in developed countries.358.	Once again we appeal to all the leaders of all the countries of the world  and particularly to those whose countries possess fearsome military capability  to undertake a responsible political dialogue which would make it possible to lead  without acrimony or complacence  to a diagnosis of the crisis and the implementation without delay of the measures advocated by the international community. We wish our appeal to be the expression of the urgent need for action and also an act of faith imbued with a very high sense of responsibility.359.	The name of the United Nations is identified with an ideal of law  justice and peace  an ideal from which our world is steadily withdrawing. We must have the certainty that there are laws to be defended and values to be safeguarded. Unfortunately  the primary functions of the United Nationsâmaintaining international peace and security and guiding international co-operation for developmentâcontinue to be persistently disregarded.360.	We cannot ignore this. The crisis of confidence  even of identity  can be overcome. This is a major task which it will not be easy to carry out. The definition of the United Nations and the very foundations of its existence constitute an act of hope. Why  then  not act? Let us undertake immediately a frank dialogue which could serve to underpin the edifice. Such an immense pooling of efforts would certainly result in a return to the true universal vocation of the United Nations.361. Ready for the revolutionâthe struggle continues!"
"12",576,"BFA",39,1984,"ï»¿I bring the fraternal greetings of a country covering 274 000 square kilometres  where 7 million men  women and children refuse henceforth to die of ignorance  hunger and thirst  even though they are not yet able to have a real life  after a quarter of a century as a sovereign State represented here at the United Nations.3.	I come to this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly to speak on behalf of a people which  on the land of its ancestors  has chosen from now on to assert itself and to take responsibility for its own history  in both its positive and negative aspects  without any complexes.4.	I come here  mandated by the National Council of the Revolution of Burkina Faso  to express the views of my people on the problems that have been included on the General Assembly's agenda  which form the tragic background of the events which are sadly undermining the foundations of the world late in this twentieth century. It is a world of chaos  in which the human race is torn apart by struggles between the great and the not-so-great  attacked by armed bands and subjected to violence and plunder. It is a world in which the nations  eluding international jurisdiction  command groups beyond the law  which  with gun in hand  live by preying on others and organizing the most despicable kinds of trafficking.5.	I do not intend to enunciate dogmas here. I am neither a messiah nor a prophet. I possess no truths. My only ambition is a twofold aspiration: first  to be able to speak in simple language  the language of facts and clarity  on behalf of my people  the people of Burkina Faso  and  secondly  to be able to express in my own way the feelings of that mass of people who are disinheritedâthose who belong to that world maliciously dubbed ""the third world""âand to state  even if I cannot make them understood  the reasons that have led us to rise up  all of which explains our interest in the United Nations  the demands of our rights drawing strength in the clear awareness of our duties.6.	Nobody will be surprised to hear us associate the former Upper Volta  now Burkina Faso  with that despised rag-bag  the third world  which the other worlds invented at the time of our independence in order better to ensure our intellectual  cultural  economic and political alienation. We want to fit in there without at all justifying this great swindle of history  still less accepting that we are a backward world left behind by the West. Rather  we do so to affirm our awareness of belonging to a three-continent whole and to state  as one of the non-aligned countries  our deeply felt conviction that a special solidarity unites the three continents of Asia  Latin America and Africa in the same battle against the same political traffickers and economic exploiters.7.	Thus to recognize our presence in the third world is  to paraphrase Jos6 Marti  to affirm that we feel on our cheek every blow struck against every other man in the world. So far  we have turned the other cheek. The slaps in the face have been redoubled and the evil-doers have felt no tenderness in their hearts. They have trampled on the truth of the just. They have betrayed the word of Christ. They have turned His cross into a club  and after putting on His robe they have torn our bodies and souls to shreds. They have obscured His message  making it a Western one  whereas we saw it as a message of universal liberation. Now our eyes have been opened to the class struggle and there will be no more blows dealt against us. It must be proclaimed that there will be no salvation for our peoples unless we turn our backs completely on all the models that all the charlatans of that type have tried to sell us for 20 years. There can be no salvation for us unless we reject those models; there can be no development without that break.8.	Now all the new ""master minds"" are awakening  roused by the dizzy increase of millions of men in rags and frightened by the threat to their digestion of this multitude hounded by hunger. They are beginning to change their tune and are again anxiously seeking among us miraculous ideas for new forms of development for our countries. In order to understand this it is necessary only to read the proceedings of innumerable colloquys and seminars.9.	I certainly do not wish to ridicule the patient efforts of those honest intellectuals who  because they have eyes to see  have observed the terrible consequences of the ravages caused in the third world by the so-called development specialists.10.	I fear that the results of all the energies seized by the Prosperos of all kinds may be turned into a magic wand to be used to turn us back in to a world of slavery  dressed up according to the taste of our times. This fear is justified by the fact that the African petite bourgeoisie with its diplomas  if not that of the whole third world  is not readyâwhether because of intellectual laziness or simply because it has sampled the Western way of lifeâto give up its privileges. It therefore forgets that all true political struggle requires a rigorous theoretical debate  and it refuses to do the thinking necessary in order to invent the new concepts needed to wage the kind of struggle to the death that is ahead of us. A passive and pathetic consumer group  it overflows with the ""in"" words of the West  just as it overflows with its whisky and champagne  in salons where there is a dubious kind of harmony. One will search in vainâ the concepts of Blackness or the African personality now being a little outdatedâfor truly new ideas from the brains of our so-called intellectual giants. Words and ideas come to us from elsewhere. Our professors  engineers and economists are content simply to add a little colouring  because they have brought from the European universities of which they are the products only their diplomas and the surface smoothness of adjectives and superlatives. It is urgently necessary that our qualified personnel and those who work with ideas learn that there is no innocent writing. In these tempestuous times  we cannot leave it to our enemies of the past and of the present to think and to imagine and to create. We also must do so.11.	Before it is too lateâand it is already lateâthis elite  these men of Africa  of the third world  must come to their senses; in other words  they must turn to their own societies  they must look at this wretchedness that we have inherited  to understand that the battle for thought that will help the disinherited masses not only is not a vain one but can become credible at the international level. They must provide a faithful picture for their own peoples  a picture that will enable them to carry out profound changes in the social and political situation so that we can free ourselves from the foreign domination and exploitation that can lead our States only to failure.12.	This is something that we understood  we  the people of Burkina Faso  on that night of 4 August 1983  when the stars first began to shine in the heavens of our homeland. We had to take the lead of the peasant uprisings in the countryside  threatened by desertification  exhausted by hunger and thirst  and abandoned. We had to give some sense of meaning to the revolts of the unemployed urban masses  frustrated and tired of seeing the limousines of the alienated elite flash by following the head of State  who offered them only false solutions devised and conceived in the brains of others. We had to give an ideological soul to the just struggles of our masses mobilized against the monstrosity of imperialism. Instead of a minor  short-lived revolt  we had to have revolution  the eternal struggle against all domination. Others have noted this before me and yet others will say after me how broad the gap now is between the rich peoples and those that aspire only to have enough to eat  enough to drink  to survive and to defend their dignity  but nobody could believe how much of the food of our people has gone to feed the rich man's cow.13.	In the case of Upper Volta  the process was even more crystal clear. We demonstrated the essence of all the calamities that have crushed the so-called developing countries.14.	The truth about aid  represented as the panacea for all ills and often praised beyond all rhyme or reason  has been revealed. Very few countries have been so inundated with aid of all kinds as has mine. Aid is supposed to help development  but one can look in vain in what used to be Upper Volta to see any sign of any kind of development. The people who were in power through either naivety or class selfishness could not or else did not want to gain control over this inflow from the outside or grasp the scope of it and use it in the interests of our people.15.	Analysing a table that was published in 1983 by the Sahel Club  Jacques Giri  in his book entitled The Sahel Tomorrow concluded quite sensibly that aid to the Sahel  because of its content and because of the machinery in place  was only aid for survival. He emphasized that only 30 per cent of that aid would enable the Sahel simply to remain alive. According to Jacques Giri  this outside aid was designed only for the continued development of the unproductive sectors  imposing intolerable burdens on our small budgets  completely disrupting our countryside  creating deficits in our trade balance and  in fact  speeding up our indebtedness.16.	Here are just a few standard facts to describe what Upper Volta used to be like: 7 million inhabitants  with more than 6 million peasants; infant mortality at 180 per 1 000; life expectancy of 40 years; an illiteracy rate of 98 per cent  if literacy is considered to mean being able to read  write and speak a language; one doctor for 50 000 inhabitants; 16 per cent receiving schooling; and lastly  a gross domestic product of 53 356 CFA francs  that is  just over $100 per capita.17.	The diagnosis obviously was a very bad one. The source of the evil was political and so the only cure must be a political one.18.	Of course  we encourage aid that can help us to manage without aid  but in general the aid and assistance policies merely led us to become completely disorganized  to enslave ourselves  to shirk our responsibility in our economic  political and cultural areas.19.	We have chosen a different path to achieve better results. We have chosen to establish new techniques. We have chosen to seek forms of organization that are better adapted to our civilization  abruptly and once and for all rejecting all kinds of outside diktats  so that we can create the conditions for a dignity in keeping with our ambitions.20.	We refuse simple survival. We want to ease the pressures  to free our countryside from medieval stagnation or regression. We want to democratize our society  to open up our minds to a universe of collective responsibility  so that we may be bold enough to invent the future. We want to change the administration and reconstruct it with a different kind of civil servant. We want to get our army involved with the people in productive work and remind it constantly that  without patriotic training  a soldier is only a criminal with power. That is our political programme.21.	At the economic level  we are learning to live simply  to accept and to demand of ourselves the austerity that we need in order to carry out our great designs.22.	Thanks to the revolutionary solidarity fund  which is fed by voluntary contributions  we are now beginning to deal with the cruel questions posed by the drought. We support and have applied the principles of the Declaration of Alma-Ata expanding our primary health care. We endorse as a State policy the global strategy of GOBI FFF advocated by UNICEF.23.	We believe that through the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office  the United Nations should enable those countries affected by drought to establish a medium- and long-term plan to achieve self- sufficiency in food.24.	To prepare for the twenty-first century  we have begun  by creating a special tombola section  an immense campaign for the education and training of our children in a new school. The programme is called ""Let's teach our children"". Through committees to defend the revolution  we have established a vast house-building programmeâ500 units in three monthsâand we are also building roads  small water collectors  and so forth. Our economic ambition is to work to ensure that the use of the mind and the strength of each inhabitant of Burkina Faso will produce what is necessary to provide two meals a day and drinking-water.25.	We swear that in future in Burkina Faso nothing will be done without the participation of the people of Burkina Faso themselves  nothing that has not been decided by us  that has not been prepared by us. There shall be no more attacks on our honour and dignity.26.	Strengthened by this conviction  we want our words to cover all those who suffer  all those whose dignity has been crushed by a minority or a system.27.	Let me say to those who are listening to me now that I speak not only on behalf of Burkina Faso  my country which I love so much  but also on behalf of all those who suffer  wherever they may be.28.	I speak on behalf of those millions of human beings who are in ghettos because their skin is black  or because they have a different kind of culture  those whose status is hardly higher than that of an animal.29.	I suffer  too  on behalf of those Indians who have been massacred  trampled on and humiliated and who  for centuries  have been confined to reservations  so that they do not have any aspirations to any rights whatsoever  so that their culture cannot become enriched 'through contact with other cultures  including that of the invader.30.	I speak out on behalf of those who are unemployed because of a structurally unjust system which has now been completely disrupted  the unemployed who have been reduced to seeing their lives as only the reflection of the lives of those who have more than themselves.31.	I speak on behalf of women throughout the entire world who suffer from a system of exploitation imposed on them by men. As far as we are concerned  we are willing to welcome all suggestions from anywhere in the world that will help us to promote the full development and prosperity of the women of Burkina Faso. In return  we will share with all countries the positive experience we are now undertaking with our women  who are now involved at all levels of the State apparatus and social life in Burkina Faso  women who struggle and who say with us that the slave who will not shoulder responsibility to rebel does not deserve pity. That slave will alone be responsible for his own wretchedness if he has any illusions whatsoever about the suspect indulgence shown by a master who pretends to give him freedom. Only struggle helps us to become free  and we call on all our sisters of all races to rise up to regain their rights.32.	I speak on behalf of the mothers of our poor countries who see their children dying of malaria and diarrhoea  unaware that to save them there are simple methods available but which the science of the multinationals does not offer to them  preferring to invest in cosmetics laboratories and engage in cosmetic surgery to satisfy the whims and caprices of a few men and women who feel they have become too fat because of too many calories in the rich food they consume with regularity. That must make even members of this Assembly dizzyânot to mention the peoples of the Sahel. We have decided to adopt and popularize the methods that have been advocated by WHO and UNICEF.33.	I speak on behalf of the child  the child of the poor man  who is hungry and who furtively eyes the wealth piled up in the rich man's shop  a shop that is protected by a thick window  a window which is defended by an impassable grille  the grille guarded by a policeman in a helmet with gloves and a bludgeon  the policeman placed there by the father of another child  who comes there to serve himself or rather to be served because these are the guarantees of capitalistic representativeness and norms of the system.34.	I speak on behalf of the artistsâpoets  painters  sculptors  musicians  actors and so onâpeople of good will who see their art being prostituted by the show-business magicians.35.	I cry out on behalf of the journalists who have been reduced to silence or else to lies simply to avoid the hardships of unemployment.36.	I protest on behalf of the athletes of the entire world whose muscles are being exploited by political systems or by those who deal in the modern slavery of the stadium.37.	My country is the essence of all the miseries of peoples  a tragic synthesis of all the suffering of mankind but also  and above all  the synthesis of the hopes of our struggles. That is why I speak out on behalf of the sick who are anxiously looking to see what science can do for themâbut that science has been taken over by the gun merchants. My thoughts go to all those who have been affected by the destruction of nature  those 30 million who are dying every year  crushed by that most fearsome weapon  hunger.38.	As a soldier  I cannot forget that obedient soldier who does what he is told  whose finger is on the trigger and who knows that the bullet which is going to leave his gun will bring only a message of death.39.	Lastly  I speak out in indignation as I think of the Palestinians  whom this most inhuman humanity has replaced with another people  a people who only yesterday were themselves being martyred at leisure. I think of the valiant Palestinian people  the families which have been splintered and split up and are wandering throughout the world seeking asylum. Courageous  determined  stoic and tireless  the Palestinians remind us all of the need and moral obligation to respect the rights of a people. Along with their Jewish brothers  they are anti-Zionists.40.	Standing alongside my soldier brothers of Iran and Iraq  who are dying in a fratricidal and suicidal war  I wish also to feel close to my comrades of Nicaragua  whose ports are being mined  whose towns are being bombed and who  despite all  face up with courage and lucidity to their fate. I suffer with all those in Latin America who are suffering from imperialist domination.41.	I wish to stand side by side with the peoples of Afghanistan and Ireland  the peoples of Grenada and East Timor  each of those peoples seeking happiness in keeping with their dignity and the laws of their own culture.42.	I rise up on behalf of all who seek in vain any forum in the world to make their voices heard and to have themselves taken seriously.43.	Many have already spoken from this rostrum. Many will speak after me. But only a few will take the real decisions  although we are all officially considered equals. I speak on behalf of all those who seek in vain for a forum in the world where they can be heard. Yes  I wish to speak for all thoseâthe forgottenâbecause I am a man and nothing that is human is alien to me.44.	Our revolution in Burkina Faso takes account of the ills of all peoples. We are also inspired by all the experiences of mankind  from the very first breath of the first human being.45.	We wish to enjoy the inheritance of all the revolutions of the world  all the liberation struggles of the third-world peoples. We are trying to learn from the great upheavals that have transformed the world. We have drawn the lessons of the American revolution  the lessons of its victory against colonial domination  and the consequences of that victory. We endorse the doctrine of non-interference by Europeans in American affairs and non-interference by Americans in European affairs. In 1823  Monroe said ""America for the Americans"". We would say ""Africa for the Africans; Burkina Faso for the Burkinabe"". The French revolution of 1789  which disrupted the foundations of absolutism  has taught us the rights of man linked to the rights of peoples to freedom. The great revolution of October 1917 transformed the world and made possible the victory of the proletariat  shook the foundations of capitalism and made possible the dreams of justice of the French Commune.46.	Open to all the wishes of the peoples and their revolutions  learning also from the terrible failures that have led to truly sad infringements of human rights  we want to preserve from each revolution only that essence of purity that prohibits us from becoming servants to the realities of others  even though in our thinking we find that there is a community of interests among us.47.	There must be no more deceit. The new international economic order  for which we are struggling and will continue to struggle  can be achieved only if we manage to do away with the old order  which completely ignores us  only if we insist on the place which is ours in the political organization of the world  only if we realize our importance in the world and obtain the right to decision-making with respect to the machinery governing trade  economic and monetary affairs at the world level.48.	The new international economic order is simply one among all the other rights of peoplesâthe right to independence  to the free choice of the form and structure of government  the right to developmentâ and like all the rights of peoples it is a right which can be gained only through the struggle of the peoples. It will never be obtained by any act of generosity by any Power whatsoever.49.	I continue to have unshakeable confidenceâa confidence I share with the immense community of non-aligned countriesâthat  despite our peoples' battering-ram cries of distress  our group will preserve its cohesion  strengthen its power of collective negotiation  find allies among all nations  and begin  together with all who can still hear us  to organize a really new system of international economic relations.50.	I agreed to come to speak before the Assembly because  despite the criticism of certain major contributors  the United Nations remains the ideal forum for our demands  the place where the legitimacy of countries which have no voice is recognized. This was expressed very accurately by the Secretary- General  when he wrote:""The United Nations reflects in a unique way the aspirations and frustrations of many nations and groups all over the world. One of its great merits is that all nationsâincluding the weak  the oppressed and the victims of injustice""âthat is  usâ""can get a hearing and have a platform even in the face of the hard realities of power. A just cause  however frustrated or disregarded  can find a voice in the United Nations. This is not always a well- liked attribute of the Organization  but it is an essential one.""The meaning and scope of the Organization could not be better defined.51.	Therefore  it is absolutely essential for the good of each of us that the United Nations be strengthened and provided with the means to take action. That is why we endorse the Secretary-General's proposals to this end  to help the Organization break the many deadlocks which have been carefully preserved by the great Powers in order to discredit it in the eyes of the world.52.	Since I recognize the admittedly limited merits of the Organization  I cannot but rejoice to see new Members join us that is why the delegation of Burkina Faso welcomes the admission of the 159th Member of the United Nations  the State of Brunei Darussalam.53.	The folly of those who  by a quirk of fate  rule the world makes it imperative for the Movement of Non-Aligned Countriesâwhich  I hope  the State of Brunei Darussalam will soon joinâto consider as one of the permanent goals of its struggle the achievement of disarmament  which is an essential aspect of the principal conditions of our right to development.54.	In our view  there must be serious studies of all the factors which have led to the calamities which have befallen the world. In this connection  President Fidel Castro stated our view admirably at the opening of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Havana in September 1979  when he said:""Three hundred billion dollars could build 600 000 schools  with a capacity for 400 million children; or 60 million comfortable homes  for 300 million people; or 30 000 hospitals  with 18 million beds; or 20 000 factories  with jobs for more than 20 million workers; or an irrigation system for 150 million hectares of landâthat  with the application of technology  could feed a billion people."" If we multiply those numbers by 10âand I am sure that that is a conservative figureâwe can see how much mankind wastes every year in the military field  that is  against peace.55.	It is easy to see why the indignation of the peoples is easily transformed into rebellion and revolution in the face of the crumbs tossed to them in the ignominious form of some aid  to which utterly humiliating conditions are sometimes attached. It can be understood why  in the fight for development  we consider ourselves to be tireless combatants for peace.56.	We swear to struggle to ease tension  to introduce the principles of civilized life into international relations and to extend these to all parts of the world. That means that we can no longer stand by passively and watch people haggle over concepts.57.	We reiterate our determination to work actively for peace; to take our place in the struggle for disarmament; to take action in the field of international politics as a decisive factor  free of all hindrance by any of the big Powers  whatever may be their designs.58.	But the quest for peace also involves the strict application of the right of countries to independence. On this point  the most patheticâindeed  the most appallingâexample is found in the Middle East  where  with arrogance  insolence and incredible stubbornness  a small country  Israel  has for more than 20 years  with the unspeakable complicity of its powerful protector  the United States  continued to defy the international community.59.	Only yesterday  Jews were consigned to the horrors of the crematorium  but Israel scorns history by inflicting on others the tortures it suffered.60.	In any event  Israelâwhose people we love for its courage and sacrifices of the pastâshould realize that the conditions for its own tranquillity are not to be found in military strength financed from outside. Israel must begin to learn to be a nation like other nations  one among many.61.	For the present  we declare from this rostrum our militant  active solidarity with the fighters  both men and women  of the wonderful people of Palestine  for we know that there is no suffering that has no end.62.	Analysing the economic and political situation in Africa  we cannot fail to stress our serious concern at the dangerous challenges to the rights of peoples hurled by certain nations which  secure in their alliances  openly flout international morality.63.	We are naturally pleased at the decision to withdraw foreign troops from Chad so that the Chadian people themselves  without intermediaries  can find the way to put an end to that fratricidal war and finally be able to dry the tears that have been shed for so many years. But  despite the progress made here and there in the struggle of the African peoples for economic emancipation  our continent continues to reflect the essential reality of the contradictions between the big Powers and to be oppressed by the unbearable scourges of today's world.64.	That is why we cannot accept and must unreservedly condemn the treatment of the people of Western Sahara by the Kingdom of Morocco  which has been using delaying tactics to postpone the day of reckoning that will in any event be forced upon it by the will of the Saharan people. I have visited the regions liberated by the Saharan people  and I have come to believe more firmly than ever that nothing will stop its progress towards the total liberation of its country under the militant and enlightened leadership of the Frente POLISARIO.65.	I do not wish to dwell too long on the question of Mayotte and the islands of the Malagasy archipelago; since the facts are clear and the principles obvious  there is no need to dwell on them. Mayotte belongs to the Comoros; the islands of the archipelago belong to Madagascar.66.	With regard to Latin America  we welcome the initiative of the Contadora Group as a positive step in the search for a just solution to the explosive situation in the region. Commander Daniel Ortega  speaking here on behalf of the revolutionary people of Nicaragua  made concrete proposals and posed some basic  direct questions. We hope to see peace in his country and throughout Central America on and after 15 October; this is what world public opinion calls for.67.	Just as we condemned the foreign aggression against the island of Grenada  so we condemn all foreign intervention. Thus  we cannot remain silent about the foreign military intervention in Afghanistan.68.	And yet there is one point that is so serious that each of us must give a very open and clear explanation of it. That question  as members can imagine  is that of South Africa. The unbelievable insolence of that country with respect to all nations of the worldâeven those that support the terrorism which it has erected into a State system designed physically to liquidate the black majority of that countryâand the contempt that it has shown for all our resolutions constitute one of the most serious and overwhelming concerns of the world today.69.	But the most tragic factor is not that South Africa has outlawed itself from the international community because of its apartheid laws  not even that it continues to occupy Namibia illegally and keep it under its colonialist and racist boot or that it continues with impunity to subject its neighbours to the laws of banditry. No  what is the most abject and the most humiliating for the human conscience is that it has made this tragedy a matter of everyday reality for millions of human beings  who have only their own body and the heroism of their bare hands to defend themselves. Sure of the complicity of the big Powers and the active support of certain among them  as well as of the criminal collaboration of some pathetic African leaders  the white minority simply ignores the feelings of all those people  everywhere in the world  who find the savage methods of that country to be absolutely intolerable.70.	There was a time when international brigades went to defend the honour of nations that suffered aggression. Today  despite the agonizing open wounds that are suffered  all we do is vote for resolutions that do nothing more than call on a nation of pirates  which ""destroys a smile as hail kills flowers""  to mend its ways.71.	We shall soon be celebrating the one-hundred- and-fiftieth anniversary of the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire. My delegation supports the proposal of Antigua and Barbuda for the commemoration of that event  which is of very great importance to African countries and the black world. For us  all that can be said throughout the world during the commemorative ceremonies must emphasize the terrible cost paid by Africa and the black world in the development of civilization. Nothing was given us in return  which no doubt explains the tragedy on our continent today. It is our blood that nourished the rise of capitalism that made possible our present condition of dependence and consolidated our underdevelopment. But we cannot hide the truth anymore; it cannot be ignored. The figures cannot be simply haggled away. For every black man who came to the plantations  five died or were crippled. And here I do not mention the disorganization of the continent and its consequences.72.	While the entire world  thanks to you  Mr. President  with the help of the Secretary-General  will be commemorating that anniversary and noting this truth  it will understand why we long for peace among nations and why we demand our right to development with absolute equality through the organization and distribution of human resources. It is because we belong to one of the races that has suffered the most that we in Burkina Faso have sworn that we shall never accept any splitting up of our country or any denial of justice. It is the memory of that suffering that causes us to stand side by side with the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] against the armed bands of Israel. It is the memory of that suffering which  on the one hand  causes us to support the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] and the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and  on the other  makes absolutely intolerable the presence in South Africa of men who say they are white and feel entitled on that account to set the whole world on fire. It is that memory of suffering that makes us put all our faith in the United Nations  with the common responsibility  the common task and the common hopes of us all.73.	We demand that throughout the world the campaign to free Nelson Mandela be intensified so that his presence here at the next session of the General Assembly will be a victory of collective pride. In memory of our suffering and as a collective pardon  an international humanitarian prize should be given for all those who have contributed to the defence of human rights through their work and research. We call for cutting all budgets for space research by one ten-thousandth and devoting that amount to research in the field of health and to improving the human environment which has been disrupted by those ""fireworks"" which are harmful to the ecosystem.74.	We also propose that the structures of the United Nations be reviewed and revised so that an end may be put to the scandal of the right of veto. The perverse effects of its abuse have  of course  been offset by the vigilance of some States that possess the veto right. However  nothing can justify that rightâ neither the size of the country nor its wealth.75.	If the argument used to justify that inequity has been the cost paid during the Second World War  then those nations that have arrogated those rights to themselves should know that each of us has an uncle or a father whoâlike thousands of other innocent people recruited from the third world to defend the rights that had been flouted by the Hitlerite hordesâ also suffered and died from Nazi bullets. Therefore  let those major Powers  which miss no opportunity to question the right of peoples  not be so arrogant. The absence of Africa from the club of those that have the right of veto is an injustice which must be ended.76.	Lastly  my delegation would be failing in its duty if it did not call for the suspension of Israel and the pure and simple exclusion of South Africa from the United Nations. When  in the course of time  those countries have done what they must do to justify their presence in the international community  then we would be only too happy to welcome them here and to guide their first steps.77.	We should like to reconfirm our confidence in the United Nations. We are grateful for the work which its agencies have done in Burkina Faso and for their presence side by side with us in the difficult times in which we are living. We are grateful to the members of the Security Council for having allowed us twice this year to preside over the work of the Council. We only hope the Council will recognize the principle of the struggle against the extermination of 30 million human beings each year through hunger  which today is more devastating than nuclear weapons.78.	Our confidence and faith in the United Nations leads me to thank the Secretary-General for his visit  which we greatly appreciated; he came to see for himself the harsh reality of our life and to get a true picture of the aridity or the Sahel and the tragedy of desertification.79.	I cannot conclude without paying a tribute to the President of the General Assembly  who  with his great intelligence and perception  will guide the work of this thirty-ninth session.80.	I have travelled many thousands of kilometres to be here. I have come to ask each member to work together to put an end to the contempt of those who are unreasonable  to eliminate the tragic spectacle of children dying of hunger  to do away with ignorance  to ensure the triumph of the legitimate rebellion of peoples and to put an end to the use of weapons so that they can be laid down and fall silent  and to ensure that mankind will survive and that together  with the great poet Novalis we can all sing together:""Soon the stars will come back to the Earth where they have long been gone; soon the sun will return  the star will shine again among the stars  all the races of the world will gather together again after a long separation  the old orphaned families will find one another again and every day there will be new discoveries  more people will embrace one another; then the inhabitants of the old days will come back to the Earth  the ashes will be relit in each tomb  the flame of life will burn again  *he old houses will be rebuilt  the old times will come again and history will be the dream of the present extended to infinity.""81.	Down with international reaction! Down with imperialism! Down with neo-colonialism! Down with ""puppetism""!82.	Eternal glory to the peoples who are struggling for their freedom! Eternal glory to the peoples who stand shoulder to shoulder to defend their dignity! Eternal victory to the peoples of Africa  Latin America and Asia in their struggle!83.	Fatherland or death: we shall triumph."
"13",619,"BGD",39,1984,"ï»¿We are commemorating this year the tenth anniversary of Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations. I would like to take this opportunity of addressing the General Assembly in the language of my country  which is spoken by about 200 million people all over the world. I may mention here that  in recognition of the fact that such a large segment of the world's population speaks Bengali  the United Nations has introduced broadcasting in Bengali and also has issued an official translation of the Charter of the United Nations in our language.121.	It is indeed an honour and privilege for me and the members of my delegation to participate in the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We bring to the Assembly the warm greetings of the Government and the people of Bangladesh.122.	I should like to express our warmest felicitations to Brunei Darussalam on its independence. I welcome it in our midst as a Member of the United Nations. Its membership in the Organization has no doubt added to the strength of the United Nations.123.	On behalf of the Bangladesh delegation  Sir  and also on my own behalf  I extend to you our warmest congratulations on your assumption of the high office of the presidency of the Assembly. The constructive role of your great country  Zambia  in regional and international issues has earned deep appreciation from all of us. As fellow members of the Commonwealth and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  both Bangladesh and Zambia have a shared perception on all major international issues. The visit of Mr. Kenneth Kaunda to Bangladesh last year has further consolidated the existing friendly relations between our two countries. Your own association with the United Nations  particularly your effective leadership as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  has given us every reason to believe that  under your able and dynamic leadership  we will be able to achieve fruitful and constructive results at this session. We were deeply moved by your insightful address which you made soon after you took over the presidency. We would like to assure you of our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities. I should like to express our felicitations to other officers of the Assembly on their well-deserved elections.124.	We express our gratitude to our friends who reposed their confidence in us by electing Bangladesh as one of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly. We shall make every effort to contribute towards your effort  Sir  in promoting international peace  co-operation and development.125.	We would also like to convey our deep gratitude to Mr. Jorge Illueca for his valuable contribution as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The constructive role played by his country  Panama  in various issues  particularly in the Contadora Group  has earned our admiration.126.	I should also like to record our sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General for his dedicated and untiring efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the courage and perseverance with which he has continued to work towards the achievement of our shared objectives of international peace  progress  co-operation and development. We have read with interest his illuminating report on the work of the Organization which constitutes an important contribution to the work of the current session of the General Assembly.127.	We have viewed with deep concern the fact that the arms race  both nuclear and conventional  continued at a feverish pitch over the last year. We have also witnessed with even deeper concern the break-off of bilateral negotiations between the two super-Powers. We hope that serious negotiations will commence between them in respect of both theatre nuclear forces and START at the earliest possible opportunity. In this context  we note with satisfaction the very recent high-level contacts between the two super-Powers.128.	World military expenditure is now estimated to reach about a trillion dollars. This unrestricted use of scarce resources for military purposes has  on the one hand  created a sense of fear and uncertainty among nations and  on the other  has added to the cost of social opportunity world-wide. The close relationship between disarmament and development does not need any elaboration. It is now universally recognized that a redirection of resources from armaments to development will be in the interest of the developed and developing countries alike. But how to transfer resources from armament to development? President Hossain Muhammad Ershad  in his address in 1982 to the Assembly's twelfth special sessionâthe second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmamentâ made a number of important proposals in this regard. These proposals for arresting the arms race deserve to be studied and examined carefully for the greater benefit of mankind.129.	The tragedy of Palestine is the tragedy of our times. No other issue in recent times has evoked so much attention and concern as the plight of the Palestinians. For more than three decades  the inter-national community has witnessed the sufferings and anguish of the Palestinian people  who were forcibly uprooted from their hearths and homes. It is now universally recognized that the heart of the problem is the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish a State of their own with Jerusalem as its capital. It is regrettable that Israel continues to flout the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations and persists in its illegal occupation of Arab and Palestine territories  including the Holy City of Al-Quds al-Sharif. The position of Bangladesh on this question has always been firm and consistent and we have always extended our unstinted support to our Palestinian brothers in their struggle for the restoration of their inalienable right to self-determination under the leadership of the PLO  their sole and legitimate representative. We condemn the continued Israeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories and the establishment of settlements in the occupied lands. We are convinced that the situation demands a comprehensive settlement of the problem which must be based on total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Palestinian and Arab territories and the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We are also convinced that the participation of the PLO  on an equal footing with all other parties  in the peace process is indispensable. It is in this context that we extended our full support to the Arab peace plan as a sound basis for establishing peace in the region. We commend the Secretary-General for his sincere endeavours and for his untiring efforts to restore peace in the region.130.	We are happy to note that the recently reconstituted Government of Lebanon is gradually but surely progressing towards restoring peace and stability there. All peace-loving countries wish Lebanon a quick return to normalcy  which can ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity. However  this most desired objective cannot be attained without the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and the termination of its control of southern Lebanon.131.	It is an outrage to the conscience of the international community that South Africa still continues to pursue its abhorrent policy of apartheid. This policy is not only contrary to the values of contemporary civilization; it is also against the tenets of all scriptures and religions. Therefore  those who  directly or indirectly  sustain and tolerate the continuance of the policy of apartheid in South Africa are casting an indelible blemish on the history of their own civilizations and transgressing the laws of their own scriptures.132.	Bangladesh is irrevocably committed to the cause of the oppressed peoples of Namibia and southern Africa and we renew our unstinted support to them in their legitimate struggle for freedom  liberty and human dignity. Bangladesh will continue to take an active part in the United Nations Council for Namibia  and we are convinced that the independence of Namibia can and must be achieved on the basis of the United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which constitutes the only acceptable basis for the peaceful transition of the territory from colonial subjugation to independence. We have consistently asked for its full implementation without any pre-condition. Similarly  we have rejected the persistent attempts to link the independence of Namibia with extraneous issues.133.	The continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq is a matter of serious concern to all of us. This war has continued for too long and it has brought pain and suffering  death and destruction to the people of both countries. We are all painfully aware of how the intensification of this conflict can jeopardize international peace and security. We take this opportunity to reiterate our appeal to both Iran and Iraq to take full advantage of the many peace initiatives which have been placed before them to bring their conflict to an end. The ongoing efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations must be maintained to restore peace in the region. The Secretary- General deserves our sincere appreciation for the valuable efforts that he has undertaken for the peaceful resolution of this conflict.134.	Bangladesh is deeply committed to the Charter of the United Nations and to the principles of sovereign equality of States  territorial integrity  the non-use of force  non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the right of every nation to self-determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We therefore view the developments in Afghanistan and Kampuchea with deep concern. In this context  we call upon our friendly country  the Soviet Union  to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. We believe that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan is a sine qua non now of a satisfactory and viable solution of the Afghan problem. Similarly  we call upon Viet Nam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea. It is our conviction that the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea should be allowed to determine their destiny without outside interference and intervention  and this is possible only with the total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from their territories.135.	The United Nations has been seized of the Cyprus question for the past two decades and we are all conscious of the unfortunate events that have led to the present situation. The recent developments in Cyprus  however  should not be viewed in isolation from the overall unresolved question. Bangladesh has consistently supported the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus. At the same time  we emphasize that no solution of the problem can be lasting unless it takes into account the legitimate aspirations of the two communities. The recent developments have once again demonstrated that the establishment of a bi- communal  bi-zonal Federated State of Cyprus is the only viable solution of the problem  and a beginning to that end must be made through the resumption of meaningful intercommunal talks. My delegation will continue to extend its fullest co-operation to the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices on the Cyprus problem.136.	Bangladesh shares the perception that regional and international peace and security would be promoted through the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. As a littoral State  we have consistently attached great importance to the creation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and have maintained that the successful implementation of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  containing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  will be in the interest of peace and security. It is in this context that we have actively participated in the deliberations of the Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and have extended our full support to the convening of an international conference at Colombo without delay.137.	My delegation shares with the Secretary-General his deep concern at the increasing recurrence of acts of international terrorism. We believe that concerted efforts by all States Members of the United Nations at both the national and the international level are necessary for the total elimination of this scourge  which is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations  the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to emphasize its profound abhorrence of this phenomenon  which is taking an increasing toll of innocent lives  and would like to call upon all countries of the world to co-operate closely with one another with a view to combating and preventing such acts.138.	Bangladesh has friendly relations with both the Koreas  and this position has been reflected in our role in all international forums  especially in the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Bangladesh hopes that peaceful reunification will be successfully achieved  and we shall support all efforts towards that end. Bangladesh believes that the primary responsibility for attaining a viable solution of the issue of reunification through peaceful means rests with the Koreans themselves.139.	A decade ago this august Assembly adopted the historic Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. More than anything else  these documents symbolized the high hopes and reflected the aspirations of the developing countries. More importantly  they provided the blueprint for the long-awaited integration of the developing countries into the mainstream of the global economy as partners in development in the true spirit of interdependence. But  10 years later  their hopes and aspirations still remain as distant as ever. A global perspective and a pragmatic attitude towards negotiations seem to have suffered a setback. The spirit of multilateralism itself faces the most serious threat since the 1960s. This Assembly of nations is only too aware of the abortive negotiations in recent years  particularly in the area of international economic co-operation for development.140.	While it is true that interdependence has been recognized as a reality in formal gatherings at the highest levels  nothing has materialized to translate this awareness into meaningful actions. The proposal for global negotiations has been the centre-piece of the initiatives of the developing countries aimed at making interdependence work in the collective interest and for the good of all  laying the groundwork for a global economic system more responsive to the demands of equity  justice and fair play. The gradual erosion that this important concept of multilateralism has suffered in recent years is painfully revealing. We believe that this matter merits serious review by the Assembly in the context of its resolution 34/138  which was adopted by consensus but which remains unimplemented so far.141.	This year the General Assembly is also entrusted with yet another very important responsibility  that is  to carry out the review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The Strategy  which was adopted by consensus  and the subsequent General Assembly resolution 38/152  spelt out in clear terms the aims and objectives of this exercise. My delegation notes with regret the slow pace of this important exercise. The global economic situation  and particularly the economic situation of the developing countries  demands that we broach the review exercise much more seriously than at present. The findings of the latest report of the Committee for Development Planning  as well as the	World Economic survey and other similar documents  are only too revealing of the acute nature of the crisis faced by the developing countries.142.	Despite the reversal of recessionary trends which began last year  we cannot lose sight of the continuing seriousness of the critical situation faced by the world economy as a whole. The reported upswing in economic growth in North America should not lull us into complacency. Recovery in Western Europe continues to be weak. The expansion of world output at 2 per cent in 1983 is at best modest for a period of economic recovery. As for the developing countries  they have suffered a persistent and gradual decline in the growth of output since 1979. These countries as a group recorded no growth at all in 1983. For most of them  per capita incomes have fallen for several consecutive years and investment expenditures are generally well below the levels attained in the 1970s. The modest increase in world output has for the first time in decades not been accompanied by a proportionate gain in exports. These have practically stagnated  and in the case of most developing countries there has been a sharp decline in export volumes. In value terms  world trade actually declined by 2 per cent in 1983.143.	Suffice it to say that the actual economic performance of the developing countries since 1980 has been in stark contrast to the growth path traced in the International Development Strategy.144.	The economic crisis in Africa  which has been characterized by a persistent drop in the rate of growth of overall output of goods and services over the years  is a case in point. Apart from the consequences of recession  at least 150 million people and 22 countries in this otherwise potentially rich continent have been adversely affected by drought. Unemployment and malnutrition have been intensified  and every major sector of the economy has suffered a decline.145.	The stifling effects of recession have been no less severe in the case of Asia. It is true that a number of Asian countries were able to withstand the onslaught of recession  but that provides no cushion or solace to the majority of those countries  particularly the least developed among them. The largest concentration of the world's desperately poor and hungryâ estimated at around 900 million peopleâis still located in Asia.146.	Though 10 of the 22 largest debtor developing countries are Latin American  the debt problem is not confined to that region alone. The capital- importing countries now owe the staggering sum of about $730 billion. The main point is that the debt problem became a crisis only when the debtor countries' growth in export earnings declined significantly in the face of mounting protectionism. This was further accentuated by the depth  dimensions and duration of the recession. It is to be noted that  in spite of the rapid increase in the foreign indebtedness of the capital-importing developing countries during the 1970s  their debt-to-export ratio did not change much  since exports rose at practically the same rate as foreign indebtedness. This situation changed radically in the early 1980s as their export earnings failed to grow and even declined.147.	Through all these crises  the countries which have suffered most have been the least developed countries. By the very nature of their economics  these countries  which are located mostly in Africa and Asia  lack the wherewithal to withstand such acute difficulties  and in a situation of prolonged and intensified crisis their vulnerability increased out of all proportion. No wonder the early 1980s have witnessed an increase in their ranks. Primarily dependent on commodities  whose prices continue to remain weak  their difficulties have been further accentuated by a declining flow of official development assistance. The fate of negotiations on the replenishment of IDA resources is a case in point. And commodity prices  despite their relative increase in 1983  still remain nearly 20 per cent below the level of 1980. The slow pace in the implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries remains a matter of deep concern.148.	In these circumstances  my delegation's earnest hope is that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action to be undertaken next year will be broached with seriousness and sympathy by all countries  developed and developing alike  to accelerate the development of the least developed countries.149.	We strongly believe that the objective of all development efforts is the improvement of the quality of life. In this context  we note with appreciation the efforts being made in the economic and social fields by the United Nations system  in particular the strategy being pursued by UNICEF to achieve a revolution in child survival and development and the efforts being made by UNDP concerning human resources development. We also note with great satisfaction the successful and comprehensive outcome of the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984.150.	As we approach the mid-point of the 1980s  the world economy in general remains strained by the legacies of a prolonged and disastrous recession. Those legacies have virtually crippled the development momentum of the overwhelming majority of developing countries. Cut-backs in investments  the suspension of longer-term development projects and public programmes  the slashing of expenditures in social sectors that these countries had to endure over the years of recession have taken many of them to the verge of serious political and social upheavals.151.	These difficulties are too deeply entrenched to be overcome easily as a by-product of recovery in a few countries. Certainly  a proliferation of protectionist barriers in the industrial countries has not made this task at all easier. Even existing commodity agreements which have served the international community well over the years are now falling apart owing to the lack of political support by some of these countries. In finance  apart from the uncertainty surrounding debt rescheduling  the constraints of high interest rates  inadequate flow of official development assistance  the drying up of bank lending and the overall deflationary policy of the international monetary and financial system could stifle any stirring of economic activities in a large number of the developing countries.152.	If the recovery is to spread to the developing countries  a series of measures must be undertaken immediately to reactivate their economies; and if this recovery is to be a sustained and durable one  the reinvigoration and improvement of the international trading and financial system must be undertaken in earnest and as a matter of priority. It is also imperative for the sake of the sustained health of the world economy that growth in the developing countries be undertaken as a self-sustained and mutually- reinforcing process and not merely as a by-product of growth elsewhere  because if we do not deal with the more fundamental structural problems in an adequate manner  crisis will in the end overwhelm us. We must therefore act seriously and with pragmatism before it is too late.153.	The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade called for the necessary political impetus to carry out essential adjustment  intensification and reformulation of policy measures in the light of evolving needs and developments. We cannot delay that any longer. We must once again demonstrate the same political will and vision that enabled us to establish this great assembly of nations to implement our commitment to its Charter.154.	In this connection I should like to inform the Assembly briefly of developments in my country.155.	Soon after assuming responsibility  the present Government  under the leadership of President Hossain Muhammad Ershad  initiated some drastic reforms covering the entire gamut of national life. The reform measures taken by the present Government include economic reform aimed at stopping waste  boosting production and giving maximum encouragement to the development of the private sector. The most spectacular among the reform measures  however  have been the administrative reforms  based on the principles of decentralization and devolution of power to the common people  and the judicial reforms  also based on the principle of decentralization. Under the new system  the administration has been taken right to the doorsteps of the country's vast rural population. The grass-roots units have now become the focal points of all local activities. This means that through these units  known as upazillas  the vast rural population of Bangladesh will now have the full power to decide and control its own affairs for itself.156.	While these measures of reform continue  I should like to draw attention to the unprecedented floods which have struck my country this year  causing great misery to our people and widespread damage to our crops. The Government of Bangladesh is doing all that is humanly possible to overcome the effects of this exceptional disaster  which has not yet ended. Our President has been overseeing relief measures personally by daily visits to affected areas throughout the country. We take this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation the help and assistance which we have received and are receiving from a number of friendly countries and organizations.157.	Regionally  our patient diplomacy in forging co-operation among the South Asian countries has borne fruit. The primary objective of Bangladesh's 1980 proposal for regional co-operation was to harmonize and strengthen the efforts of those regional developing countries to establish collective self- reliance  for the common benefit of their peoples. The integrated programme of action within the framework of South Asian Regional Co-operation was launched at the Foreign Ministers' meeting at New Delhi in August 1983  which was followed by the ministerial meeting at Male in July 1984. These ministerial meetings were preceded by meetings of a number of senior officials to work out this programme. It is a matter for satisfaction that as many as nine areas of co-operation have been identified and that working groups have been set up to study and deal with them. The selection of Dhaka as the venue for the first South Asian Regional Co-operation summit  to be held in the last quarter of 1985  is a demonstration of the faith and confidence placed in Bangladesh.158.	Before I conclude  let me say a few words on the observance next year of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The present state of deteriorating international relations gives added importance to the observance of the occasion. These are challenging times for the world Organization. It is being increasingly bypassed  and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are being systematically ignored  and with impunity. The continuing economic crisis is wreaking havoc on the world economy  and particularly the economies of the developing countries. The North- South dialogue and the establishment of the new international economic order have made little progress.159.	In view of all this  in some sections of world public opinion the United Nations is suffering from what may be called a crisis of confidence; but it need not be so if Member States are determined to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  which are as valid today as they were at the time of the founding of the Organization almost four decades ago.160.	In spite of its weaknesses  the United Nations remains the appropriate and irreplaceable international forum for finding solutions to major world problems  some of which I have enumerated today. Our faith in the Charter of the United Nations and our commitment to its purposes and principles remain as unshakeable as ever. The observance of the fortieth anniversary will provide Member States with an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the principles enshrined in the Charter and to reaffirm their support for the world Organization. On this solemn occasion  let us resolve anew to work for the promotion of the purposes and principles of the United Nations and for the strengthening of the Organization in order to make it an effective instrument for the fulfilment of its central role in the maintenance of international peace and security  in developing and strengthening co-operation among nations  in establishing equitable economic relations among States and in promoting fundamental rights and freedoms throughout the world."
"14",665,"BGR",39,1984,"ï»¿Permit me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. In your person  we greet an eminent son of Africa  the representative of friendly Zambia. We are convinced that under your able guidance the world Organization will adopt important decisions aimed at easing international tension and strengthening security and peace throughout the entire world.44.	I would also like to congratulate the delegation of Brunei Darussalam on the occasion of its admission to membership of the United Nations.45.	An objective assessment of the situation in the world bears witness to the fact that no positive changes have occurred in international affairs over the past year. On the contrary  even more serious signs have appeared  pointing to an aggravation of the danger that looms over the whole of mankindâ the danger of a devastating nuclear war. The responsibility for this state of affairs rests exclusively with certain imperialist circles  above all with the United States  which is pursuing a policy of confrontation and escalation of the arms race  striving to secure military superiority and to proceed from a position of strength. They interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries and follow a policy of State terrorism against them  endanger the independent development of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America  which have liberated themselves from colonialism  and fan the flames of old hotbeds of tension and kindle new ones. They have even gone so far to question the political realities established in Europe as a result of the Second World War.46.	Not only is this course alien to the genuine interests of peoples but it is openly hostile to their natural and legitimate aspirations to live in peace  as well as to their sovereign right to determine for themselves their own future and path of development. Its purpose is to check the objective historical processes and to stifle social progress.47.	The existing realities are such that there are countries of different political  ideological and socioeconomic systems existing on our planet. To extend ideological differences to inter-State relations and to make them the basis of foreign policy is an illogical and dangerous practice. The international situation is further worsened by attempts to exert political  economic and diplomatic pressure against the socialist countries and to mount propaganda campaigns  unprecedented in their scope  which in effect constitutes psychological warfare.48.	In fact  this attack is directed not only against the socialist countries but also against all those who reject as unacceptable the policy of hegemonism and diktat. Everyone who is opposed to such a policy is declared an outlaw. Such ""logic"" is extremely dangerous in the age of nuclear weapons.49.	We regard as extremely dangerous  and we emphatically reject  the concepts according to which peace could be safeguarded and international security enhanced through the execution of large-scale programmes for over-rearmament and the endless escalation of the arms race. Plans are being devised of the very basis of such concepts  which creates a real danger of turning Europe into a theatre of ""limited"" nuclear warfare. The calls for the creation of a potential for the launching of a ""first pre-emptive strike"" and action along those lines are tantamount to preparations for a nuclear war  The acquisition of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction  the deployment in Western Europe of medium-range nuclear missiles and the plans for the militarization of outer space have not only failed to strengthen but on the contrary have undermined peace and international security. Such actions imperil the life and future of everyone  including those of their initiators.50.	The countries of the socialist community  including the People's Republic of Bulgaria  have repeatedly emphasized that the only sensible policy is one of peaceful coexistence among States with differing social systems. This policy has demonstrated its advantages and its viability. It is fully in accord with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with contemporary international law. Today the question is whether the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are ready to adhere to such a policy. The fate and the future of all countries and peoples depend on the answer to that question.51.	We have repeatedly and resolutely declared our readiness for dialogue  for negotiations to reach agreements based on the principles of equality and equal security  and we now reaffirm that readiness. What is needed is constructive  practical steps. What is needed is realism  political will and a sense of responsibility before history for the destiny of mankind. What is needed is concrete action  designed to avert nuclear war  so that the very idea of such a war becomes inadmissible.52.	The only sure way to preserve peace and strengthen international security is by the immediate cessation of the arms race  the renunciation of attempts to upset the existing military-strategic equilibrium and the taking of decisive steps aimed at lowering the level of military confrontation.53.	The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  recently stated:""The countries of the Warsaw Treaty are not seeking military superiority. What is more  we are ready to engage in negotiations on arms limitation and the gradual attainment of complete disarmament. We are prepared to begin the elaboration and adoption of such a code of relations between the East and the West  between the socialist and the capitalist States  as would eliminate for ever the threat of a global military conflict.""54.	Such is the approach of my country and of our allies to the most important present-day problems. That approach has been amply corroborated in the wide range of constructive proposals for reaching mutually acceptable agreements aimed at saving mankind from the nuclear threat  curbing the arms race and taking effective measures for disarmament  with the ultimate goal of achieving general and complete disarmament. Those proposals continue to be valid.55.	In our view  the current session of the General Assembly is duty-bound to contribute to the solution of such vital questions as the prevention of nuclear war  the guaranteeing of the right of peoples to live in peace  the renunciation by all nuclear-weapon States of the first use of nuclear weapons  a nuclear-weapons freeze  a general and complete ban on nuclear- weapon tests  and the prohibition of chemical weapons.56.	It is necessary to place a solid barrier against the plans for the militarization of outer space. In this regard  a major positive potential is contained in the new proposal of the Soviet Union on the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind. Its implementation would make a real contribution to the curtailment of the military threat and provide further opportunities for curbing the arms race.57.	Military confrontation in the world's seas and oceans is fraught with grave danger. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is of the opinion that talks should be initiated as a matter of urgency on the curtailing of the naval activities of States and the limitation and reduction of naval armaments.58.	The interests of world peace demand the removal of the obstacles that led to the collapse of the Geneva talks on nuclear-arms limitation in Europe. Our final objective is the elimination of nuclear weapons m Europe as well as in all other parts of the world.59.	A key manifestation of the sensible approach to international relations is the ongoing Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. If the constructive approach prevails at Stockholm  the Conference will be able to make a substantial contribution to the improvement of the political climate  to the building of confidence and security  and to the strengthening of peace in Europe and throughout the world. That is indeed precisely the purpose of the comprehensive proposals put forward by the socialist countries; of particular importance among those proposals is the initiative for the conclusion of a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations.60.	The most cherished desire of all peoples is to live in peace. This is borne out by the scope of the anti-war movement  which has been echoed at large by the World Disarmament Campaign launched by the United Nations. Aware of the danger of the annihilation of mankind  Governments in a number of countries and realistically minded statesmen and politicians are now seeking ways to remove and eliminate this danger. An illustration of this is the Joint Declaration issued on 22 May 1984 by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania. Further evidence is the contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and security made by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countriesâthis major factor in international life.61.	We should like to believe that common sense and an awareness of responsibility will ultimately prevail  that peace-loving words will be followed by peace-loving deeds  and that a frank and constructive dialogue will be resumed. That would serve the interests of everyone.62.	The fate of the world depends to a considerable extent on the peaceful and just settlement of international conflicts and on the elimination of hotbeds of tension. We have witnessed repeated attempts on the part of imperialism  taking an approach based on military force  to impose upon peoples its own ""solutions"" aimed at establishing its domination in various regions of the globe. In this connection  we support the extremely timely Soviet proposal concerning the inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism63.	Recent developments in the Middle East have glaringly demonstrated that the approach lying at the heart of the policies of Israel and those who support it is running into the stiff resistance of peoples. Given that situation  the soundest way to settle this conflict is undoubtedly the one indicated in the new Soviet proposal for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the PLO.64.	Yet another source of alarm is the growing military presence of NATO countries in the Persian Gulf; this further exacerbates tension in that already explosive part of the world.65.	The methods and means of terrorism and violence have also been applied to the problems of Central America and the Caribbean basin. This is illustrated by the intervention in Grenada  the unremitting pressures against Cuba  the mining of ports and the conducting of subversive activities against sovereign Nicaragua  and the extension of substantial military aid to dictatorial regimes  enabling them to continue their oppressive policies and to perpetrate crimes against their own peoples.66.	The same unacceptable approach is also being taken in other regions of the world. In southern Africa  the occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues  as does the practice of racism and apartheid. In the South Atlantic  there is a smouldering state of tension because of unresolved problems. Not only is the right to self-determination being denied to the so-called small colonial Territories  but dangerous military activities are being conducted in them.67.	The undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is continuing. It is essential that outside interference in the affairs of that sovereign State be halted in order to create conditions for the settlement of the situation surrounding Afghanistan on the basis of the well-known constructive proposals of the Afghan Government.68.	We whole-heartedly support the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the peninsula and the reunification of the country through peaceful means and on a democratic basis.69.	We deem it essential that a constructive dialogue be instituted for the purpose of implementing the idea of turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability md co-operation  in accordance with the proposals made by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea.70. Our position of principle remains unchanged with respect to the settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of preserving the territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus in the interests of both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. This position is fully consonant with our policy of fostering peace  good-neighbourliness and mutual under-standing in the Mediterranean and the Balkans.71.	The policies of imperialism have had a negative impact also on the development of international economic relations. Sanctions  discrimination and diktat are all concrete manifestations of the desire of certain circles in the West to extend political tensions to the sphere of international economic relations. For the purpose of the achievement of political goals dictated by expediency  traditional economic and trade relations that took years to build up are being severed.72.	All efforts undertaken within the United Nations and other intentional forums for the restructuring of international economic relations on an equitable and democratic basis and for the establishment of a new international economic order are meeting with stubborn resistance.73.	For more than 10 years  the socialist and the developing countries have been waging a persistent struggle for the practical implementation of the provisions of such important documents as the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and others. Of particular importance among these are the questions of ending the exploitation of the developing countries and the elimination of all forms of trade discrimination based on differences in socio-economic systems  as well as the exercise by all States of sovereignty over their natural resources and over economic activities on their territories  the curbing of the negative consequences of the activities of the multinational corporations  and so forth.74.	The Declaration and Statement issued by the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance at their high-level Economic Conference  held in Moscow from 12 to 14 June 1984  contain a realistic programme for the improvement of international economic relations. This programme indicates the proper way to solve the problem of development  a necessary prerequisite for which is the definitive elimination of the threat of nuclear war  the establishment of lasting peace and the adoption of genuine measures in the field of disarmament.75.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria recently celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution. For 40 years now  my country  having overcome its economic backwardness and its concomitant social ills  has been building a socialist society whose paramount goal is the welfare of our people. For 40 years  Bulgaria has been pursuing a policy of promoting peace  security  detente  good-neighbourliness and broad international co-operation in the Balkans  in Europe and throughout the world.76.	The implementation of the concept of turning the Balkans into a nuclear-weapon-free zone has now assumed overriding importance. This is in the interests of all the Balkan peoples and would  indeed  be a major contribution to strengthening confidence and security in Europe. This initiative  which has won broad support  has already become the subject of discussions and exchanges of views among the Balkan countries We believe that this process should be continued in order to bring positions even closer together and achieve a general agreement in principle on the creation of such a zone.77.	The proposals by the Chairman of the Council of State  Todor Zhivkov  concerning the conclusion of bilateral agreements with all the Balkan countries that would also contain a code of good-neighbourly relations are also well known.78.	This policy of my country is a matter of deep principle and an integral part of our overall approach to contemporary international relations.79.	We are on the eve of the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War  the victory over Hitlerism and fascism  and the creation of the United Nations. Over the years  the United Nations has unquestionably adopted a number of important  positive decisions in accordance with its Charter that have stood the test of time. We have no doubt that through the collective efforts and goodwill of all Member States the noble goals in the name of which the Organization was created can and will be achieved."
"15",710,"BHR",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me  Six  at the outset to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I pay a tribute to your friendly country  Zambia  and wish you all success and good luck in conducting the work of this session. I assure you of the full co-operation of the delegation of the State of Bahrain in carrying out the duties of your high international office.140.	I should also like to offer the thanks of the delegation of my country to Mr. Jorge Illueca for his skill in conducting the work of the thirty-eighth session.141.	It gives me pleasure likewise to pay a tribute to the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General to strengthen the role of the Organization and achieve the goals of the Charter of the United Nations  particularly with regard to the maintenance of peace and security in the world.142.	I have the pleasure also of congratulating the Government and people of Brunei Darussalam on the occasion of the admission of that country to membership of the United Nations  and wish this friendly State all prosperity and progress.143.	We have all come to this international forum for the purposes of maintaining international peace and co-operation  finding effective solutions to current world problems and securing  further progress for all the peoples of the world. These purposes can be attained only by an international community which believes in interdependence and solidarity  works for justice and co-operation among the peoples of the world and adheres to the purposes and principles of the Charter  whose high goals we have all promised to respect.144.	It is regrettable that developments over the years have rendered our duty more difficult and more onerous. We have to take such developments as a challenge which requires collective  concentrated effort.145.	The war in the Gulf has now entered its fifth year. Its dangers and the threat that it poses to world peace and security have intensifies It has taken a particularly dangerous turn over the last few months with attacks outside the zones of hostilities on oil tankers belonging to States which are not parties to the Iraq-Iran conflict. This dangerous development requires us more than ever before to increase our efforts at mediation to settle this dispute peacefully.146.	Moved by their desire for peaceful co-existence and good-neighbourliness  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  the Arab States of the Gulf Co-operation Council asked the Security Council to adopt a draft resolution calling upon States to respect the territorial integrity of the States that are not party to the hostilities in the Gulf  to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any act which might lead to a further escalation or widening of the conflict.147.	Security Council resolution 552 (1984) con-firmed the conviction of the international community that such attacks constitute a threat to the safety and stability of the area and have serious implications for international peace and security. The Security Council is requested to follow up the implementation of this resolution to ensure the free and safe navigation in international waters and sea lanes for shipping en route to and from all ports and installations of the littoral States that are not parties to the hostilities in the Gulf. The Security Council should carry out its responsibilities  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter  and take positive and decisive action to end this war and have it settled peacefully.148.	To reduce the tension of the war  the State of Bahrain called upon Iraq and Iran  early in July of this year  to accept the principle of the neutrality of seaports in the Gulf  as a natural step after both parties  on the proposal of the Secretary-General  had agreed not to attack civilian targets. We hope that our call will be heeded by Iran  since Iraq has responded to it  so that the lives of civilians in the warring States may be spared and the economic interests of all countries in the Gulf protected.149.	We again call upon the two neighbouring countries  Iran and Iraq  to settle their differences by peaceful means and to re-establish normal relations between them on the basis of mutual respect  good- neighbourliness and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs  so that peace and constructive co-operation may prevail in the region  for the well- being and prosperity of its people. I commend the positive response of Iraq to all international attempts at mediation to settle this war by peaceful means.150.	The Arab Gulf region has been the centre of attention of the States of the world because of its important strategic location and large oil reserves  which supply world markets with a great part of their energy needs. The Gulf Co-operation Council countries have frequently affirmed that the maintenance of peace  security and stability in the region is their own collective responsibility  free from any foreign interference whatsoever. This joint policy has become a fact  thanks to fruitful understanding and cooperation among the countries of the Council in the political  economic  defence and other fields.151.	The war in the Gulf  the continuous Israeli aggression against the Arab countries  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the intensification of East-West rivalry are all dangerous warnings that the world is constantly facing acute crises that threaten international peace and security and entail the elimination of all the achievements of the United Nations over the four decades since the Second World War. Now  more than ever before  the international community is facing a difficult historical option: either war and the non-observance of the rule of law  or the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the Charter of the United Nations. Peace based on justice  on the dignity of man and on non-interference in the internal affairs of other States is a noble human aspiration which should be attained despite all difficulties.152.	The crisis through which the United Nations is passing is due to the fact that some Governments ignore the Organization and its Charter and try to reach certain political goals through the threat or use of force to prevent the United Nations from accomplishing its main objective: the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council  the organ responsible for the maintenance of peace and security  is often unable to carry out its duties because of East-West rivalry and conflict.153.	The two super-Powers  which should bear greater international responsibility as regards the maintenance of peace and security  have disappointed other States by their preoccupation with the arms race  particularly strategic nuclear weapons  and the creation of political and military spheres of influence in the world. This has stalled detente between the two super-Powers and disturbed the atmosphere that is needed for positive and constructive dialogue between them.154.	Although detente between the two super-Powers is considered to be a positive factor for the reduction of world tensions  the current crisis in international relations should not be looked upon as a crisis between two parties  without a third. The current crisis is unfortunately universal in its nature and ramifications. The security and stability of the world should therefore be the collective concern of all countries. Atomic terror  the world food crisis  and peace and stability in the world are problems of a universal nature  which all States in the world should effectively contribute to solving. Hegemony in international relations should therefore be replaced by equality and the rule of law  in order that faith in the international Organization may be strengthened and it can play a prominent humanitarian role  enabling all the peoples of the world to enjoy peace and prosperity.155.	The aggravation of acute international problems is a source of concern and pessimism in relation to the future of current international relations. We still hope  year after year  that this concern and pessimism will vanish through the emergence of a new era of co-operation and understanding among States. We believe that the cause of the pessimism is not the existence of problems in international relations  for mankind has always faced such problems. What is really distressing is that  after centuries of civilization and progress in all fields  nations have not been able to establish an effective international system based on co-operation  justice and mutual respect. Narrow national interests still dominate international relations and often involve the use of force as the main instrument for securing such interests.156.	A question that arises in this respect is the nature and role of the United Nationsâas the Organization that should maintain and preserve peace and security in the worldâin such a welter of international problems and crises.157.	Despite its great contributions in the social and development fields  the United Nations has not been ableâor has not on many occasions been afforded the opportunityâto play the role entrusted to it under the Charter. The international community should face this fact with a sense of responsibility and realism so that it may disentangle itself from the vicious circle of hope and wishful thinking and so that the international Organization can become an effective instrument for the implementation of the purposes and principles of the Charter. To do so  of course  is not easy. It is an arduous and complex task and one that requires a new  collective outlook characterized by courage and faith. It is clear that there is a collective international feeling that changes should inevitably be made in the United Nations to modify and strengthen its role  particularly as regards the maintenance of world peace and security.158.	The Middle East has been the scene of bloody and tragic events since 1948  when the Arab land of Palestine was forcibly seized to establish a Zionist State on it. All the international attempts and efforts to reduce tension in this strategic and sensitive region of the world have failed because they have not touched the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict.159.	The core and the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict the refusal to grant the Palestinian people their imprescriptible and inalienable right of sovereignty and the establishment of their own State on their national soil  under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative.160.	Israel's refusal to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  which have been reaffirmed by recurrent United Nations resolutions over the course of 37 years  has aggravated tension in the Middle East  particularly since Israel has revealed its imperialist and expansionist ambitions through its militaristic  sectarian and racist war against the Arab States  the occupation of their lands by force and the exercise of the most inadmissible forms of repression and terrorism against the Arab population  especially the Palestinians who live under the yoke of Israeli occupation.161.	The increase in the ferocity of the Israeli aggression against the Arab people has reached such a level that decisive and effective international measures should be taken to curb it because it contravenes the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. The Organization  and particularly the Security Council  which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security  are still unable to prevent Israel from pursuing its aggressive policy because of the support it receives from the United States Government.162.	We declare now  as we did last year  at the thirty-eighth session  our support and approval of the unified Arab peace plan  adopted at Fez on 9 September 1982 by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference. That plan  which deals with all the aspects and details of the Arab-Israeli conflict  is a realistic attempt to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict. Its elements are derived from the principles of the Charter and from resolutions of the United Nations which call upon Israel to withdraw from all the Arab occupied territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and to dismantle all settlements which it has unlawfully established in those territories. The plan also reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the exercise of their imprescriptible and inalienable rights  including the establishment of their independent State on their national soil.163.	Israel has rejected the Arab peace plan for the Middle East and all serious initiatives for the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It has thereby confirmed that it is an expansionist settler State which condones the crimes and massacres perpetrated against the Arab nation  particularly against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. For how long will the international community remain powerless to carry out its declared intention  embodied in recurrent resolutions  to put an end to Israeli aggression  the dangerous nature of which is escalating daily  threatening not only the security of the region but that of the whole world?164.	The continuation of aid and support to Israel has made it more arrogant and resolute in its violations of United Nations resolutions and basic human rights. Israel still procrastinates and imposes unreasonable and unacceptable conditions for its withdrawal from Lebanon  which proves its evil intention to perpetuate its occupation.165.	It is a principal historical duty of the international community  as represented by the Security Council  to restore security and stability to the victimized land of Lebanon. This can be done only by restraining Israel and compelling it to withdraw from all Lebanese territory  in accordance with the numerous Security Council resolutions in that respect.166.	The Israeli invasion of Lebanon has complicated the internal situation in the country and increased tension in the Middle East region. We hope that Arab Lebanon will recover from its ordeal through the unity and solidarity of its people  so that its territorial integrity and sovereignty may be maintained for a better future  with the restoration of security  tranquillity and stability to that Arab country  whose sufferings have been beyond imagining.167.	There are other important questions which still occupy the attention of the international community and for which suitable solutions have not yet been found.168.	Soviet forces have been occupying Afghanistan since the end of 1979  despite numerous United Nations resolutions and renewed appeals to the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan so that its people may regain their freedom and return to the policy of non-alignment which they have adopted for themselves. I should like to call nowâand it is a call of the international community as a wholeâupon the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and leave the people of that country free to choose its political system without any pressure or threat.169.	In South Africa  the minority white Government subjects the black majority to the harshest forms of racial segregation and discrimination  contrary to all the high moral principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations. I appeal to the Security Council to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the Pretoria Government abandons its racist policy.170.	With regard to the question of Namibia  the Government of South Africa still procrastinates and evades the finding of a just solution. The State of Bahrain is convinced more than ever of the need to increase international pressure on South Africa to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which calls for the independence of Namibia under United Nations supervision.171.	With regard to the question of Cyprus  we reaffirm the importance of creating a suitable atmosphere to pave the way for a peaceful settlement acceptable to both parties to the dispute. We should pay a tribute to the ceaseless efforts of the Secretary- General to narrow the differences between the parties and find a durable and just solution to this problem.172.	In connection with the attempts made to settle the dispute between the two parts of Korea  we welcome the call for unconditional negotiations and the unification of the Korean peninsula for the well- being and prosperity of the Korean people as a whole.173.	The world is now passing through the worst stage of economic stagnation and recession since the Second World War. The recovery the world witnessed some years ago  which varied in different parts of the world  is now over. The end of the recovery in some large industrialized countries has aggravated the economic difficulties of developing countries  particularly the poorest among them.174.	Economic stagnation and recession in the world have caused the debts of developing countries to increase to an amount estimated at present to be over $800 billion. It is worth noting that the increase in the debts of the developing countries was caused originally by the reduction of the prices of raw materials produced by those countries and the increase of the prices of manufactured goods imported from industrialized countries. This has had dangerous adverse repercussions on economic and social development in developing countries and widened the deep gap in the standard of living between the countries of the North and those of the South.176. We may ponder whether on the same planet two such different worlds can coexistâone too rich and one poor  suffering from hunger and diseaseâ without acute crises arising in the world  both North and South. We should realize that our world is one in which interests are interconnected and interrelated and in which the importer and the exporter depend on each other. The rich and the poor are individuals of one community and  if the gap between them widens  deprivation will inevitably lead to confrontation. The international community should therefore consolidate its collective efforts to reduce the intensity of the crisis and its destructive effects. This cannot be achieved except by the establishment of the new international economic order based on justice  independence and collective partnership.176.	The delegation of my country hopes that the current session of the Assembly will adopt appropriate resolutions to deal with world problems which threaten humanity with dire consequences if no collective action is taken to combat them. I should like to reaffirm that the Government and people of Bahrain are fully prepared to work with the peoples and Governments of the world to attain the aspirations of the world community  in accordance with the high aims and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. We should work to build a better world in which security and harmony prevail  so that we may fulfil our mission to allow future generations to live in peace  prosperity and stability."
"16",748,"BHS",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  I extend my congratulations to you  on behalf of the Bahamian delegation  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that the proceedings of this session will be executed skilfully under your able leadership  which you have already demonstrated for many years as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  and I can assure you of my delegation's support throughout our deliberations.123.	I should like to commend Mr. Jorge Illueca for the excellent manner in which he carried out the functions of the office of President of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. His qualities as a leader and his knowledge of the issues were evident throughout his term of office.124.	I must also pay tribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General in seeking to identify and establish those means whereby international peace and brotherhood  economic security  respect for human dignity and sovereignty of States can become realities.125.	It also gives me great satisfaction to welcome to the United Nations the delegation of Brunei Darussalam  a sister Commonwealth State.126.	I believe that all nations can see the wisdom of the observation that  if the United Nations did not exist  it would have to be invented. This being the case  then all States large and small  whether powerful or weak  industrialized or developing  must uphold the ideal of interdependence. This body has not been immune to negative comments. Nevertheless  I believe the world holds the Organization in high esteem. If all Governments demonstrated a willingness to implement its decisions  there can be no doubt that the image of this body would be enhanced and its credibility strengthened. Towards this end  among the many activities envisaged for the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  all States should renew  through concrete goals as well as declarations  their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.127.	My Government is deeply troubled by the problems of our region. Political ideology and the tendency of some to view the uncertainties of the area from a geopolitical point of view  thus placing all of the area's problems under the umbrella of East- West confrontation  is in our view a mistake. My delegation  however  shares the opinion that  notwithstanding ideological factors  the fundamental crisis faced by the people of the region is rooted in deep-seated social and economic ills. In this context  we welcome the continuing efforts of the international community to provide assistance to the people of Central America. The efforts of the Contadora Group in trying to devise a peaceful settlement of the problems of Central America  which would take into consideration all political views  are commendable and deserving of the support of the international community. The history of our region has taught us that an imposed settlement which does not accommodate the views of all parties will never stand the test of time.128.	The national security and defence of small States is a matter of grave concern to countries such as the Bahamas  and it ought equally to be of concern to the international community. Given their limited resources  it is impossible for small States to incur the expenditure necessary to create and maintain military capacity for self-defence against powerful forces of aggression.129.	In the case of the Bahamas  the problem is further compounded by its geographical make-up. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas  with a population of less than a quarter of a million  is an archipelago comprising some 700 islands  fewer than 30 of which sustain a permanent population. Given the priorities incumbent upon any Government for the provision of adequate services  inclusive of national health  social security  education and the other prerequisites of welfare  the creation and maintenance of a military cannot  especially for a country of extensive archipelagic expanse such as the Bahamas  be an objective of high priority.130.	The United Nations is charged with the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Strict adherence by Member States to these obligations will eliminate the necessity for small States to be concerned with these matters. But we today live in a world characterized by superpower rivalry and competing self-interest where States guard jealously their national sovereignty  thus making it more difficult for the Organization to discharge its functions.131.	We are aware that efforts have been made by organs of this body responsible for international peace and security to make arrangements under which the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States can be preserved. We are also aware of the obligations imposed upon all States not to interfere in the domestic affairs of another State. As the matter relates to economic aggression or coercion  there exist  in particular  the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States of 1970 and 1974  respectively.132.	At the fifth meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community  held at Nassau from 4 to 7 July 1984  the problem of the security of small States was considered. The communique issued at the end of that meeting states the following:""The Heads of Government expressed their concern that the security of small States continues to be seriously threatened. They observed that small States were increasingly vulnerable to external aggression  manifested in traditional as well as new forms  and were being subjected to various forms of economic aggression  including the attempt of some States to impose extraterritorial jurisdiction.""133.	The Heads of Government also renewed their commitment to the maintenance of the territorial integrity of the Caribbean Community and of its member States. They emphasized the need for continuing efforts within the Caribbean Community to identify and document the various forms of threat to the security of States in the region. They took note of the proposed study by the Commonwealth Secretariat on the security of small States and agreed on a procedure which would ensure that the particular needs of the States of the Caribbean Community would be adequately reflected in the study. The Heads of Government further called for the early convening of the previously established working group to consider a unified approach to the question of economic aggression and the establishment of a scheme of mutual assistance. We are not convinced  however  that sufficient viable machinery exists today to tackle successfully the problem of threats posed to small States. We therefore pose the question: does not the necessity now arise for the codification and conclusion of a multilateral treaty concerning this issue?134.	Someone once referred to disarmament as any plan or system for the limitation  reduction or abolition of armed forces  including their arms and budgets. It is clear that this approach is not now being followed for  despite the fact that Governments are aware that the arms race has resulted in the wastage of valuable resources that could have been put to more productive use  there is a great unwillingness by many to desist from acquiring andâeven more disconcertingâdeveloping newer and more sophisticated weapons of destruction.135.	While we can take comfort in the fact that a global war is not going on now  we are disheartened by the war between Iran and Iraq  by the situation in the Middle East  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea and by the conflicts in the Latin American region. A paradoxical concept exists that security can be had only through an accumulation of weapons of mass destruction  which both sides claim they will never use. It seems incongruous that  at a time when nations decry the use of chemical weapons and assert that nuclear weapons would annihilate our planet  they seem to be rushing into a race to build  acquire and use these deadly weapons. If the words of the Charter of the United Nations  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  are to have any meaning  then there must be more concerted efforts on the part of all nations to desist from the senseless act of escalating the arms race. While it is recognized that the United States and the Soviet Union  as super-Powers in the military field  have a moral and social obligation to the peoples of the world to curb the arms race  no State  big or small  militarily significant or militarily insignificant  can continue to shirk the responsibility that comes from the fact that globally every State is involved directly or indirectly in the web of military arsenals with which we could be destroyed.136.	Mahatma Gandhi  in his timelessly inimitable fashion  directed our attention to our responsibilities when he said:""If we are to reach real peace in this world and if we are to carry on real war against war  we shall have to begin with children; and if they grow up in their natural innocence  we won't have to struggle  we won't have to pass fruitless idle resolutions  but we shall go from love to love and peace to peace  until at last all the corners of the world are covered with the peace and love for which consciously or unconsciously the whole world is hungry.""137.	Another matter of urgent global concern is that of stagnated economic development. Given the economic state of affairs of the world  it is amazing that a total collapse of the monetary system has not yet occurred. High interest rates  inflation and defaults on loans are all contributors to the mounting crisis. Protectionism is on the rise and exploitation of natural resources in developing countries by transnational corporations aggravates the problem. The new international economic order and global negotiations lie dormant because of the lack of commitment to and acceptance of the concept of interdependence. John Donne's ""no man is an island"" theory is not being practised and consequently nations have become more selfish and introspective.138.	Granted there are no easy answers to the sensitive matters of finance and economic development. My Government is convinced  however  that too much of the world's wealth is concentrated in too few hands. There has to be a much greater broadening of this base if the concept of equity is to be effectively applied and the downward spiralling international economy is to be revived.139.	There is an obvious relationship between political independence and economic independence and there is an equally obvious relationship between political independence and the global ideological conflict in which  willingly or not  we are all caught. So it must follow that failure to reach agreement on the means by which economic independence will be achieved is bound to influence political and ideological considerations. Hence it is necessary that those of us who wish to preserve our freedom and the political independence we have must seek to promote the reconciliation of legitimately conflicting points of view among developed and developing countries.140.	Freedom and political independence are rich harvests to reap  but they become an empty feast at the table of economic dependence. The economic philosophy of development which dictates that the rich should get richer and let riches trickle down to the poor is an affront to national dignity and sovereign independence. It is a philosophy of dependence worse than colonialism. The evolution of a more equitable system of economic relations among nations must not be deferred by those who fail to realize that the total interdependence of the world requires  paradoxically  that the road to self-sufficiency and economic independence is called co-operation.141.	We are rightly proud of the level of liberty and freedom enjoyed by the people of the Bahamas  but we are not unmindful of the fact that that level of sovereignty is still denied large numbers of persons in the world. Consequently  there is today some movement  sometimes overt and sometimes less open  of people attempting to secure a larger measure of political freedom and more real control over their own affairs. No super-Power's armed might or economic authority can deter indefinitely the peoples' movementsâwhich we support everywhereâin which man claims freedom from minority rule and economic oppression. Those movements may take the form of peaceful revolution  such as we were able to achieve in the Bahamas; others may be less fortunate and choose a separate route. But so long as the ultimate objective is greater freedom through giving the people the unfettered right to choose their own form of government  who would find fault with that?142.	It is not trite to inquire here today who speaks with a powerful  clear and credible voice for the rights of man. The old world order of the ideological right and left has failed to provide either leadership Or hope for mankind. Super-Powers feed us unrelentingly with a morality of physical confrontation and our hope of peace and tranquillity is balanced on the scales of something called nuclear parity and deterrence. I do not believe that mankind is ennobled or that people of the world are impressed or their lives enriched by the magnificent means of world destruction which are being accumulated  but I do believe that all people are dismayed  frustrated and frightened by them. Those who value power over principle  and political ideology over ideas and reason  occupy the seats of the controllers of our destiny. Freedom and democracy are on the defensive. Those who have the voice  the power and the riches to mobilize those forces which do exist and which are in pursuit of democracy  political freedom  territorial integrity and economic and racial justice are silenced completely or muted beyond recognition. The recognizable power centres of the world are locked in the bondage of power politics  as they are held hostage by their histories and cultures  which  unfortunately  time is quickly passing by. Is it too much to hope that during the thirty-ninth session of this Assembly of the nations of the world some tangible signs will be evinced that will touch the conscience of mankind and kindle in the mighty some vision  reason and courage to promote  encourage and indeed lead those who cry out for more freedom  more democracy  more regard for human rights and more economic and racial justice?143.	It is incumbent upon me to state unequivocally that it is time apartheid and racial discrimination came to an end. We believe that it is the duty of each and every Member State to do its utmost to see that apartheid and racial discrimination are thoroughly eliminated  indeed eradicated. Our commitment to the promotion and encouragement of human rights and fundamental freedoms is clearly evident in our Constitution and in our determination to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.144.	The Bahamas condemns  without reservation  the racist minority regime of South Africa  which continues to oppress the black majority and  through its institution of apartheid  seeks to destroy and deny this majority their inherent dignity and the exercise of their inalienable rights as free human beings. The Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the various human rights instruments adopted by the Organization theoretically form the core of the international community's defences against racism and racial discrimination. Not only are ideas based on racial superiority and hatred renounced and rejected in those instruments  but the equality of man and the entitlement of all to basic human rights and fundamental freedoms  regardless of race  colour  place of origin or any other consideration  are reaffirmed. By blatantly and unashamedly declaring the superiority of one race over another  the policy of apartheid challenges  directly  the very foundations and principles on which the Organization was based. This really ought not to be condoned by any member of the international community. Nor should any member of the international community condone the fraudulent so-called new constitution designed to foster the entrenchment of the abhorrent system of apartheid.145.	It is discouraging and even deplorable that year after year we continue to be plagued by some of the same issues. The racist regime of South Africa poses a threat to international security and peace  not only through its policies within its borders but also through its actions beyond its borders  in Namibia  by constantly setting up obstacles to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which provides the basis for the independence of Namibia and the establishment of democratic rule in that country.146.	South Africa's occupation of Namibia is illegal. The current ploy by South Africa  to link Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  is totally unacceptable to the Bahamas Government. We support whole-heartedly Security Council resolution 539 (1983).147.	We reiterate the concern expressed by the Commonwealth Heads of Government at their meeting held at New Delhi from 23 to 29 November 19836 in regard to the delaying of Namibia's independence. They urged the contact group as well as other negotiating bodies to make more serious efforts to ensure the speedy and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).148.	A solution to the Cyprus problem has eluded us for far too long  and now  once again  recent developments in that country pose a serious threat to international peace and security in that region. While the Bahamas firmly believes that the principle of the right of peoples and countries to self-determination is a paramount aspect of international relations  national unity  which is a precondition for the development of nationals in any society  is not fostered by unilateral declarations of independence. In the Cyprus situation  such a unilateral declaration has created more problems than it has resolved. We are therefore convinced that effective social and economic development in Cyprus  or in any other nation or region  will evolve only in a situation where there is peace and respect for human dignity and freedom.149.	The Bahamas commends the Secretary-General of the United Nations and endorses the utilization of his good offices in seeking to formulate a frame-work for an overall solution to the Cyprus problem. To this end  we urge the speedy implementation of Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984) as means whereby the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of that country will be ensured and any disruptive interference by others will be precluded.150.	The problem of drug control and  in the case of the Bahamas  trafficking in drugs represents the primary social and moral problem facing the Bahamas. Two factorsâthe geography of the Bahamas itself and the geographical location of the Bahamasâ are contributory factors in the incidence of the traffic in drugs through our archipelago. The Bahamas covers an area of almost 100 000 nautical square miles of water with many isolated islands where ships and aircraft engaged in drug trafficking may seek haven to elude detection. The geographical location of the Bahamas also makes it a convenient transit country for illegal drugs destined for the big and profitable markets in North America.151.	The Bahamas is not now and has never been a producer of drugs and is not  in the international context  a major consumer  but consumption in the Bahamas has increased in direct relation to the volume of traffic passing through. Producer countries are generally south of the Bahamas; the major consumer country is to the north. This puts us in an unenviable position. As a result  drug trafficking through the Bahamas is straining the economic  moral and social fabric of the islands of our Commonwealth. What is important to the Bahamas is the effect the traffic in drugs is having  and has had persistently for years  on small Bahamian communities where a high percentage of the adult male population may find it economically to its advantage to become involved in this illegal business. This is a moral and cultural threat the long-term ramifications of which could be devastating to the social fabric of the country.152.	The major participants in this trade are not Bahamian nationals. They are almost all nationals of the producer and consumer States. It ought therefore to be readily understood why the primary concern of the Bahamas in this matter is for greater involvement of the United Nations system to internationalize the approaches to these problems of trafficking so that those who contribute the most to the traffic  that is  the producer and consumer countries  would be required to bear a greater share of the burden of law enforcement and eradication.153.	The resources of the Bahamas  as a developing country  are not unlimited. Narcotics control should not have to be in competition with social services for funding from the national budget. What is urgently needed is adequate international co-operation among all States: the producer States  the consumer States and the transit States such as the Bahamas.154.	The Bahamas wishes to see the problem of international drug control in all its aspects given priority in the United Nations system. As a member of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs  my Government pledges itself to do its utmost to work for the speedy implementation of the suggested international measures which have been discussed and recommended in this and other bodies. It hopes that  with the support of this body  the participation of the Bahamas can continue to make a contribution to international drug control.155.	Undoubtedly  one of the most valuable re-sources of any country is its youth. Particularly in the developing world  youth comprises a significant proportion  or  in some cases  the majority  of national populations. The United Nations is there-fore to be commended for fulfilling an important part of its mandate in proclaiming 1985 International Youth Year: Participation  Development  Peace.156.	It is not sufficient  however  simply to identify or codify issues and problems which concern youth. National Governments  in particular  must seize this opportunity to increase their knowledge of this valuable resource and to adopt and implement policies and programmes directed towards the specific human needs and conditions of young people.157.	To be successful in our endeavours  two important considerations must be borne in mind. First  efforts for youth must be undertaken in consultation and co-operation with youth. Secondly  the momentum of International Youth Year must be sustained to ensure that youth is utilized as a force for economic progress  nation-building  and peace. In pursuit of these goals  the Bahamas has undertaken efforts to implement many of the United Nations recommendations in this field  and will co-operate fully with regional and international programmes in support of International Youth Year.158.	Even the detractors and the harshest critics of the United Nations  and therefore  much more  declared supporters  would agree that the world would be a worse place without it. Yet one must ask: is everything being done which can be done to use and improve this most invaluable global institution? I believe the answer  unfortunately  is no.159.	Member States' actions in many instances reveal contradictions between legal  theoretical and practical political support for the purposes and principles of the Organization. If the opportunities afforded by the United Nations are to continue to improve the security and well-being of mankind  there must be a closing of the gap between declared expectations and commitment.160.	At the level of international action there must be  generally speaking  more frankness in the evaluation of the total magnitude of resources present among Member States and the part that is diverted to United Nations endeavours to turn a recession- and conflict-ridden international society into a mutually co-operating healthy community of States. There must also be courage and enlightened self-interest in the establishment of priorities to solve long-standing problems. Such courage and enlightened self-interest should have its practical expression in a more critical review and consequent revision of the Assembly's agenda.161.	In closing  I reiterate my Government's un-categorical support for the work of the United Nations  based on the principles and objectives delineated in its Charter. It is our view that the United Nations is indeed a unique and indispensable Organization  which  among other things  serves to cushion those harsh realities with which we are faced as members of the international community. While we recognize its shortcomings  we are convinced that  with the appropriate degree of commitment by its Member States  the United Nations could become the greatest institution for progress through co-operation and interdependence that mankind has ever known. We believe that this was the implicit intent of its founding fathers and  with this vision as a guiding beacon  the Bahamas will continue to promote the principles and objectives of the Charter and to enhance the functioning of the Organization  in a spirit of hope and brotherhood with other Member States  in pursuit of our ultimate goal of world peace."
"17",820,"BLR",39,1984,"ï»¿The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Re-public wishes to congratulate you  Sir  upon your election to the important post of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly and wishes you success in the discharge of your responsible functions  which you have assumed in the year of the twentieth anniversary of the independence of Zambia and its entry : the United Nations.128.	The near universality of the United Nations  which now has 159 Members  and the content of the items on its agenda impose upon the Organization the task of working on the basis of strict observance of the Charter of the United Nations for the solution of urgent problems such as international disarmament and security  total decolonization  economic and social progress  and the maintenance of the international rule of law. However  there is one problem whose solution will determine not only the progress of mankind  but its very survival. This is the problem of eliminating the danger of war and  above all eliminating the threat of a nuclear catastrophe.129.	The majority of the statements in the general debate have testified to the fact that most States  regardless of their social system  ideology or way of life  recognize the absolute priority of what is literally the task of tasks.130.	However  the course of events in the world continues to be a matter of great concern. The risk of a nuclear conflict has sharply increased as a result of the policies and actions of the United States and some of its closest allies. The course they have taken aimed at securing military supremacy over the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty Organization  an unrestrained and across-the-board escalation of the arms race  power politics and diktat in international relations and  ultimately  world domination has been taken to extremes and is pushing the world towards a confrontation which in the nuclear age can mean only one thing: universal nuclear disaster.131.	This cannot be concealed by the expediency of the rhetoric of high-ranking United States officials about ""peaceful intentions""  which does not contain the faintest sign of readiness to translate these words into deedsâall the more so when the words we hear them using are not even the same.132.	How are we to reconcile  for example  assertions of ""peaceableness"" with repeated statements that they have the right to deal the first nuclear strike  their intention to acquire the capacity to win a nuclear war  to acquire military superiority and to undertake ""a crusade"" against socialism? How are we to reconcile the statement of the President of the United States that ""spheres of influence are a matter of the past"" with his statement that: ""Today the world is expecting leadership from America. America for its part turns its eyes to its Marine Corps""? In actual fact  how are we to reconcile the moderate tone of the words being used with the deep and irrepressible impulse to brand the Soviet Union ""an outlaw"" and immediately bomb it? It is only at the movies that you can play one character one day and another character the next.133.	Washington now proclaims its readiness for ""constructive talks with the Soviet Union"" since ""America has restored its power."" Yet  in practice  the United States not only fails to put forward its own constructive proposals  but it is unwilling even to follow the good example of the Soviet Union or to heed the appeal of the United Nations and renounce the first use of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union proposes to agree that relations among States possessing nuclear weapons should be governed by certain norms and principles which would be in keeping with the vital interests of all peoples. The Soviet Union has made these peaceful principles the very basis of its foreign policy and is ready at any time to come to an agreement with the other nuclear Powers on the joint recognition of such norms and on making them binding. The United States and its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] refuse to do this. The Soviet Union and its allies have called for a treaty between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO on the non-use of force and the maintenance of peaceful relations. The United States is doing its very best to get out of this. Nor can we see on the part of the United States any readiness to implement the United Nations declarations on the prevention of nuclear war and on educating  peoples in the spirit of peace and other decisions designed to prevent any ""limited"" or ""protracted"" nuclear wars and to take real disarmament measures. There has been no response from them to the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic  for the adoption by the United Nations of a declaration on the right of peoples to peace.134.	We can only conclude that the United States has its own concepts of dialogue and talks. Only recently  the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Shultz  stated in so many words: ""We know  as surely as we know anything  that negotiations and diplomacy not backed by strength are ineffectual at best  dangerous at worst."" In other words  the United States only wants talks where it can lay down American conditions. All its talk about negotiations is obviously something it wants just to cover up its hegemonistic designs. The reality is that its policy of using the territory of a number of Western European countries as launching pads for American first-strike nuclear missiles remains unchanged. Furthermore  in addition to the increasing palisade of missiles  they now want to divide Europe by an explosive dynamite strip. In actual practice  what is the meaning of all this talk about the ""absence"" of pre-conditions and the ""desire"" of the United States Administration hold talks? It means constantly targeting on the Soviet Union and its allies new types of American nuclear missiles  totally rejecting the constructive proposals of the Soviet Union and  at the same time  calling for talks. Surely  this is political duplicity.135.	There is a need for dialogue  there is a need for talks  but an honest dialogue  serious talks. Washington must show by deeds that it really wants talks. The Soviet Union has put forward proposals for a radical reduction of nuclear armaments which would in no way be detrimental to anyone's security interests. The Soviet Union is ready to consider these questions seriously at the negotiating table as soon as the United States removes the virtually insurmountable obstacles which it has erected with a view to securing military supremacy.136.	The position of the Soviet Union is clear and consistent. It is based on the following words of the founder of the Soviet State  Vladimir Ilich Lenin:""We shall do our utmost to preserve peace in the future  we shall not shrink from great sacrifices and concessions in order to safeguard this peace.""There are  however  limits beyond which one cannot go. We shall not permit treaties to be flouted; we shall not permit attempts to interfere with our peaceful work.""137.	The United States Administration is now claiming that it wants disarmament and is even proposing a journeyâduring the next 20 years or soâdown the road of disarmament negotiations. But this American road-map does not show either the routes or the final destinations. All it shows are the barriers  old and new  plus he intention to get whatever it can out of anyone who chooses to travel along this toll-road. Meanwhile  the United States keeps coming up with more and more military programmes. Physical preparations for nuclear war are in full swing: ever new nuclear-weapon systems are constantly being planned  developed and manufactured: the MX and the Midgetman intercontinental ballistic missiles  the B-l and the Stealth strategic bombers  long-range cruise missiles of every basing mode  the Trident submarine nuclear missile system  the Pershing II missile  neutron bombs and shells. This list  I am sorry to say  could be extended. According to mass media reports  three new warheads are being added every day to the United States nuclear arsenal. These systems are now many times more accurate and their basic characteristics make it clear that they have been designed for use as first- strike weapons. The United States military budget is reaching fantastic heights: $300 billion.138.	With all this disarmament rhetoric  has the United States Administration halted or scrapped even one of these programmes? Quite the contrary  they are in a hurry to stake out new ground for the arms build-up. They are now extending the arms race to new environments and are making no attempt to conceal their intention to follow a policy of heightening tension and confrontation for decades to come. They repeat over and over again their fallacious argument that it is only by carrying out such dangerous and adventuristic programmes that it will eventually be possible to create the conditions for agreement on arms reductionsâon Washington's terms  of course.139.	There is a growing movement in the world in favour of freezing nuclear arsenals. On the initiative of the Soviet Union and other countries  the General Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions calling for this. However  the representatives of the United States are always against it. The leaders of six States on different continents have appealed  in a Joint Declaration  for an end to the arms race and for a nuclear-weapon freeze. While the Soviet Union welcomed this initiative and once again reaffirmed its readiness to take such steps on a reciprocal basis  the United States has ignored this appeal.140.	Circumstances have given a high priority on the international political agenda to the question of preventing an arms race in outer space. The Soviet Union has put forward a number of initiativesâin the United Nations and elsewhereâdesigned to solve this problem and has unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to deploy any type of anti-satellite weapons in outer space  whereas the United States has refused to engage in talks on preventing the militarization of outer space. The United States has tested anti-satellite weapons and is now preparing to continue those tests. It has set up a special space command and is now in the process of establishing a joint armed forces space command. It is building a command centre for military operations in outer space. A new presidential directive has been signed on the deployment of new weapons in space.141.	The Soviet Union has submitted to the United Nations for its consideration a new proposal entitled ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"". It provides for urgent measures to be taken to prohibit for all time the use of force in outer space and from space against the earth  as well as from the earth against targets in outer space  and for the prohibition and elimination of all types of attack systems in space. The idea is that outer space should be used for solving major problems of economic  social and cultural development  such as studying the earth's natural resources  controlling natural disasters  food supplies  improving transport and communications  developing new materials and technologies  and other problems. It is proposed that States join efforts in this area and  among other things  work for the eventual creation of a world organization for the use of space for the benefit of mankind. The Soviet proposal has met with a favourable response in the United Nations  and we hope that no one will obstruct its implementation.142.	There is no way that the current United States positionâno matter how nebulously phrasedâcan be sold as evidence of a constructive and serious approach on the part of the United States Administration to the central problems of peace and security. The unwillingness to engage in constructive negotiations has also been demonstrated by the United States position at the Conference on Disarmament and at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  where it has blocked even the slightest progress in these matters. At Stockholm  instead of seeking ways of strengthening trust and security and achieving disarmament in Europe  it has been attempting to facilitate the efforts of its special services to find out about the structure and activities of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and its allies.143.	If one looks at what Washington has actually been doingâwhether it be in the field of nuclear  chemical or conventional arms  zones of peace or nuclear-free zones  or reductions in military expendituresâeverywhere the picture is the same. The United States is against solving these problems on the basis of the principle of equality and equal security.144.	It is time it learned the lessons of the history of the last few decades  namely  that attempts to impair the security of others inevitably leads to the diminishing of one's own security. There can be no winners in the arms race.145.	To conclude this part of my statement devoted to the subject of preventing nuclear war and of disarmament  I would like to refer to a point recently made by Konstantin Chernenko  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:""We make an unequivocal appeal to the United States and its allies: it is time for them to reaffirm by concrete deeds their share of responsibility for the fate of the world  to realize the futility of a policy based on a position of strength and on reliance on the arms race  and to demonstrate real  rather than a mere ostensible  readiness to engage in dialogue and negotiations in order to find mutually acceptable solutions to problems on which the future of mankind depends. The Soviet Union is not wanting in such willingness.""146.	The declarations by the United States about its desire for peace and stability cannot be reconciled in any way with the increased intensity with which it is extending its great-Power ambitions to embrace the whole globe. Furthermore  the United States is increasingly using NATO in these efforts. Steps are being taken to extend the geographical range of activity of this bloc and to use it as a tool of the policy of force and diktat in various parts of the world.147.	Pursuing the militaristic policy of attempting to secure military superiority and winning a dominant position in the world and striving to realize their dangerous ideas of ""a policy based on strength""  ""crusades"" and ""psychological warfare""  the forces of imperialism are taking action  including the use of armed force  designed to undermine the socio-political system of other countries  thus putting into practice the policy of State terrorism. A look at any part of the world will make it obvious that  by destabilizing the situation throughout the world  Washington's militaristic policies are terrorizing nations and peoples. The existing hotbeds of tension and crisis situations are being aggravated and new ones are being created; undeclared wars are being waged against a number of independent States.148.	Co-ordinating its actions with its ""strategically"" in Tel Aviv  Washington is seeking to remove from the agenda the question of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to create their own State  which is the key to a Middle East settlement. Despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  the United States is frustrating the implementation of the United Nations decision to convene an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all interested parties  including the PLO. Moreover  the United States itself has brutally shelled Lebanese territory and continues to encourage Israel in its aggressive policy against Arab peoples and in carrying out its ""creeping annexation""  naked terror and violence in the occupied Arab lands.149.	Increasing pressure is also being felt by independent Mediterranean States. Owing to an accelerated process of militarization  the Mediterranean is turning into a zone of immediate danger to the peoples inhabiting that region. Acts of military provocation have been undertaken against Libya. The situation in Cyprus continues to remain unresolved  and the right of the Cypriot people to territorial integrity and unity without foreign military presence and interference in the internal affairs of that non-aligned State is being trampled on.150.	Turning to another regionâCentral Americaâhere too  in an attempt to suppress the struggle of peoples for socio-economic changes  for freedom and independence  the United States is working to exacerbate the situation. Socialist Cuba continues to be subjected to wanton attacks and acts of hostility.151.	Undisguised attacks are being organized and carried out against Nicaragua  including the mining of its harbours. The waters of the Pacific and the Caribbean are being plied by United States naval flotillas with marines on board 'heir main task is to terrorize and intimidate the people of that country  whose sole desire is to be master of its own destiny. In order to prop up its stooges  the blood-stained butchers of the people of El Salvador  Washington is continuing its shameless interference in the affairs of that country. The land of Grenada  a small  peace- loving country  which has never in any way -threatened anyone  is being trampled upon by the iron- heeled boot of United States Marines.152.	The United States is stubbornly refusing to accept the peace initiatives of Cuba and Nicaragua as well as those of the Contadora Group with respect to a peaceful settlement in Central America. That is not surprising because the United States has already used military force 82 times against 11 Latin American countries  and it wants to be able to continue this practice of banditry in the future.153.	Another region of open and increasingly wide and dangerous interference by the imperialist forces is the African continent  where attempts are being made to impose neo-colonialist bonds on the newly independent peoples  limit their sovereignty and deprive them of the right to take their own decisions. South Africa and its protectors are blocking the independence of Namibia. The ""constructive co-operation"" between Washington and Pretoria and the moves to prevent the Security Council from taking effective measures against the apartheid regime encourage the racists in their open aggression against neighbouring countries and create new and dangerous hotbeds of tension.154.	United States monopolies have invested approximately $14 billion in South Africa's economy and are making a fortune out of exploiting the indigenous population of South Africa. It is not surprising  then  that already at this session of the General Assembly  the United States delegation has refused to support an African draft resolution calling for the struggle against the policy of apartheid.155.	Recently  all kinds of pressure have been applied with increasing persistence against some Asian countries in order to draw them into global adventurist designs and to step up the militarization of the Far East. The United States is strongly opposed to acceptance of the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific.156.	It is frustrating the efforts of the Indian Ocean nations to turn that region into a zone of peace because  according to the head of the Pentagon  ""this is a region where the terms 'parity' and 'equality' are unacceptable to us; we must have military and naval supremacy"".157.	The unresolved Korean question is not adding to stability in the Far East. The proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which provide for the withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea and peaceful reunification of the country without any outside interference  are a good basis for the solution of that problem.158.	Dangerous intrigues continue unabated around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The foes of the Afghan people  including those who boast about their commitment to democracy  are trying to disrupt the construction of a new  genuinely democratic life in that country. While paying lip-service to a political solution to the problems which have arisen around Afghanistan  they are in effect doing everything possible to impede it.159.	There are possibilities of such a solution. They are offered by the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  and we fully support them. In fact  only one thing is necessary  namely  the cessation of the foreign armed intervention against Afghanistan and interference in the internal affairs of that sovereign non-aligned State.160.	The only way to ease tension in South-East Asia is to renounce the policy of State terrorism. We strongly support the well-known proposals by Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea for a peaceful settlement of the problems of that region and its transformation into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation. The attempts to impose politically bankrupt outcasts  no matter how they are dressed up nowadays  on the people of Kampuchea through all kinds of illegal moves and manipulations are intolerable. It is high time they were thrown out of the United Nations and the People's Republic of Kampuchea given its place in international organizations.161.	The intensified military activities in the Persian Gulf  the waters of which are increasingly patrolled by large United States naval formations  have a destabilizing effect on South-West Asian countries. Such is also the purpose of the United States Central Command  which seeks to turn that vast region into a military and political springboard and to threaten the security interests  sovereign rights and independence of the peoples of the region.162.	In order to protect the sovereign rights of the peoples and to put an end to the imperialist habit of dictating to other States  the General Assembly must emphatically censure as inadmissible the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the social and political system in other sovereign States. This is the aim of the relevant proposal made by the Soviet Union and supported by a number of delegations.163.	It is noteworthy that at this sessionâmore often and more extensively than at any other sessionârepresentatives of imperialist Powers are hypocritically referring to some ""sudden"" and ""unexpected"" economic  financial and debt problems of the developing countries. These ringing declarations cannot conceal the fact that through so-called free enterprise the imperialists are severely exploiting the economically weak countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America  from which they extract each year up to $300 billion. The London Economic Summit of the seven Western countries  held last June  has not made things easier for those who belong to the Group of 77. Nor does the United States spare even its highly developed ""partners.""164.	The socialist States consistently advocate the restructuring of international economic relations on an equitable  democratic basis and support the corresponding demands of the developing countries. The high-level Economic Conference of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  held last June in Moscow  supported the progressive demands of the developing countries that their full sovereignty over their natural resources and economic activities be ensured. The Declaration of the Conference  entitled ""Maintenance of peace and international economic co-operation""  underscores the need to ensure the economic and social development of every country  whereas to all appearances the United States and its allies intend to pursue their policy of exploitation. The net result can only be a wider gap between industrialized capitalist countries and developing nations  which will be in even greater difficulty tomorrow. The arms race  which is being escalated by Washington and its NATO allies  is having a pernicious effect  too  forcing the developing countries to spend more money on arms than they receive as development aid.165.	The whole world is aware who is working for peace and who is dreaming of military solutions. In this context  we cannot but point out that all sensible people are greatly concerned over the increasing attempts by the United States and its NATO allies to call into question the entire structure of agreements aimed at ensuring peaceful  stable progress in Europe. The United States and some of its NATO allies are virtually conniving with the neo-Fascist forces that are reappearing and seeking revenge. The countries of the socialist community and all others that cherish the cause of peace resolutely condemn any manifestations of a policy aimed at undermining the foundations of the post-war European settlement. They will not allow the tragedies of the past to happen again.166.	It is a cause of serious concern that last summer  in disregard of international agreements and decisions  the Council of the Western European Union  at the request of the Federal Republic of Germany  lifted the ban which prevented that country from manufacturing strategic bombers and long- range missiles. Thus  the Federal Republic of Germany will be able to build and deploy its own long-range offensive weapons capable of threatening the security of not only neighbouring but also distant States. It should be recalled that the Federal Republic of Germany  as one of the successors of the former Reich  is bound by the Potsdam Agreement  which decreed that never again would German soil become the source of a threat to neighbouring countries and to the world at large. This prohibition must be strictly observed.167.	Nikolai Slyunkov  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  has said the following:""We are not dramatizing the existing situation. At the same time  there are no grounds for carelessness or complacency. The lessons of the past and the aggressive designs of imperialism oblige us to be vigilant and ready for anything that may happen.""168.	This year the Byelorussian SSR is commemorating the fortieth anniversary of its liberation from the Fascist invaders. The Soviet people paid by the millions with their lives  grief and suffering for this liberation. Since the Second World War  there has been a 33-fold increase  as compared with 1940  in the industrial potential of the working people of the Republic  despite the loss of one quarter of its population and one half of its national wealth during the destruction inflicted by the war. We are successfully dealing with the tasks of economic and social development in the current five-year plan. The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our liberation has also demonstrated the will of the people to peace and its determination to prevent another war.169.	In 1985 mankind will be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great victory of the forces of reason and peace in the Second World War and the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  which is part of the post-war peace arrangements for the world. We must take advantage of these forthcoming events to strengthen our ranks on the basis of unswerving observance by all peace-loving forces of the Charter and the progressive decisions of the United Nations  so that by concrete deeds we may promote the strengthening of international peace and security and eliminate the nuclear threat.170.	No question  however important it may be  can be allowed to overshadow the issue at the basis of the founding of the United Nationsâthat is ' the question of how to preserve peace. It is the duty of every State individually and of all the States Members of the United Nations to do everything they can to ensure that people can live in peace in the remaining 15 years of the twentieth century and can enter the third millennium  not with fear for the future of civilization but  rather  with certainty about the limitless prospects for the development of civilization.171.	The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic is ready to co-operate with other States to achieve those goals."
"18",855,"BLZ",39,1984,"ï»¿We are fortunate indeed  Sir  to be approaching the end of the fourth decade of the life of the United Nations under the distinguished presidency of a man such as yourself  a man of experience and stature closely identified with your own land  Zambia  your continent  Africa  and your constituency  the world. It is my particular personal pleasure to congratulate you on behalf of my country  Belize  and on my own account on your election to steer the deliberations of this session.174.	You follow in the footsteps of another great friend of Belize  President Jorge Illueca  of Panama  whose conduct of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly's difficult and at times awesome agenda assures him posterity's recognition as one of the eminent statesmen of Latin America.175.	Both our nations are the product of the ideals promulgated in the landmark decision of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960âa testimony to the potential for world transformation inherent in the United Nations.176.	The fact that this potential has not as yet been more fully realized is a comment on the absence of moral and political commitment among those with the authority and the influence to translate for the benefit of their own peoples the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations for the benefit of all peoples.177.	We welcome the admission of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member State of the Organization and offer it our friendship and cooperation.178.	Belize begins the fourth year of independent life as a functioning democracy in the Central American and Caribbean region. At this time  the people of Belize are on the threshold of both local and national elections  under the provisions of a Constitution that guarantees universal adult suffrage to all citizens aged 18 years and more.179.	In a region of the world where violence and civil strife seem endemic  where human rights and human values are often mortgaged for political advantage or ideological impulse  I am proud to speak for a nation that has no political prisoners in its gaols  that recognizes that men and institutions remain free only when freedom is founded upon respect for moral and spiritual values and upon the rule of law.180.	Our policies of government are based on principles of social justice. These principles allow us to operate the economic system in such a way that the material resources of the community are distributed to serve the common good and ensure adequate means of livelihood for all; that labour is not exploited  or forced by economic necessity to operate in inhumane conditions; and that there is opportunity for all to advance on the basis of merit  ability and integrity.181.	But we recognize that it is not an easy task to maintain these noble principles in difficult political and economic circumstances. There must be a daily struggle to keep our freedom  our independence and our sovereignty intact and secure. A nation three years of age is an infant nation. It needs the help and understanding of older nations  especially those concerned with the peace and stability of our region  if we are to fulfil the promises of the fruits of independence for our people and continue to be a free and independent nation  sovereign over all our territory.182.	As a young nation  we wish to live in peace and harmonious cooperation with all our neighbours. We cherish the example of good neighbourliness that characterizes the relations between Belize and Mexico  our larger northern neighbour  with which we share land and sea borders. We also cherish the relationship of trust and understanding developed over the years with the nations of the Caribbean community which share with us a common history  culture  language and experience.183.	We are enriched by the friendship of the Central American nations with which we share a common geography  common aspirations and a common destiny. We thank them for their friendship  their support and their cooperation. In return  we ask them to recognize our God-given right to determine our existence as a nation for ourselves  free from external threat and domination  sovereign over all our territorial treasures.184.	To our neighbour State of Guatemala  which persists in claiming our land  Belize reiterates its willingness to negotiate with good faith and determination to find a just solution. Such negotiation  however  will not be predicated on the presumption on the part of Guatemala that it has any rights over independent Belize. The independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize are not for negotiation.185.	We invite Guatemala to face the reality that the self-determination of the Belizean people  after years of struggle and constitutional evolution  culminated in the process of decolonization and separation from the Administering Authority and the emergence of a new nation in Central America. Belize did not have two colonizers. The independence of Belize could not have been a unilateral grant from the United Kingdom; it was the result of a legal and constitutional process. This fact is recognized by the United Nations  the Charter and principles of which Guatemala's spokesmen profess to respect; and Belize is recognized by all the nations of the world  except Guatemala.186.	We invite the Government and the people of Guatemala to move away from the archaic and anachronistic attitudes of the past  to acknowledge the exercise of the right of the Belizean people to self-determination  to respect our land and sea borders  to recognize the new State of Belize and to accept its sovereignty.187.	The failure to recognize Belize adds special impediments to negotiations between our two sovereign States. The Government of Guatemala must recognize that authority over Belize is vested in the Government of Belize; therefore  negotiations over Belize must be with the Government of Belize. It is the Government of Belizeâand only the Government of Belizeâthat has and can exercise the authority to conclude a settlement with the Government of Guatemala.188.	To perpetuate the fiction that Guatemala is negotiating with the United Kingdom over Belize is unreal and unproductive. We invite Guatemala to abandon this fiction and to recognize the State of Belize. In this way  we can move forward with realism towards a solution.189.	It is equally fictitious to pretend that Guatemala can strengthen its ties with the people of Belize as long as there exist the institutional distrust and disrespect inherent in their reluctance to accept Belize's independent existence. I can assure the international community that the people of Belize are as united now as they have ever been against the false claims of Guatemala over our territory. We hope that our continuing discussions will bring it to the realization that the way to strengthen the ties between our peoples begins with recognition of our independent existence as a State  respect for our sovereignty and acceptance of our historical borders.  Belize continues to agonize over the deteriorating situation in our region of Central America. We express our solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the area and our readiness to assist in every way in the search for peace and stability. We regret the introduction  with the resulting damaging effects  of considerations of an East West configuration.191. We support peaceful solutions and adhere to the principle of non-intervention in conflict situations. Because of this  we welcomed the initiatives of the Contadora Group in searching for regional solutions to regional problems. We congratulate the countries of the Contadora Group on their positive efforts towards a peace agreement and look forward to early acceptance and implementation of the agreements by the countries of the region. For our part  Belize supports the principles and concepts put forward in the new Contadora accords.192.	Belize thanks all its friends and allies who  in this world of interdependence  work together with it to advance the economic development and social progress of its people and the peoples of the region and the world. At the same time  we cannot ignore the fact that  for reasons extraneous to our development needs  Belize often finds itself excluded from regional and hemispheric initiatives designed to improve the economic conditions of our region.193.	As a Central American State  my country is not immune from the results of the conflict in the region. While not a participant in the conflict  we are a recipient of some of the inevitable tragic results  including the need to give refuge  at great sacrifice  to thousands of displaced refugees fleeing from the theatre of civil war. Motivated by our human duty  Belize provides a safe haven for our brother Central Americans in our society.194.	As a disadvantaged developing nation  Belize grapples daily with the facts of underdevelopment: declining export earnings for our sugar and other primary products  high interest rates and the subsequent lessening of foreign exchange available for purchases from the industrialized world. While we have initiated policies to stimulate economic growth  countries such as ours rely heavily on concessionary arrangements and technical and other assistance from international and regional organizations and institution?.195.	We regret  therefore  the deliberate policy of exclusion that prevents Belize from participating in the Organization of American States and its institutions  in the economic initiatives designed for the Central American region and in financial institutions established to assist the development of our part of the world. Passive acceptance of this state of affairs by friendly States in the region is a contribution to the slowing down of the development process in Belize and runs counter to protestations of friendship and regional cooperation.196.	Nearly a year has passed since the tragic events in Grenada traumatized the Caribbean and caused such deep disquiet among our Caribbean sister States and in the larger international community. Our Commonwealth family has agreed that the time for recriminations has passed and that all possible efforts should be made to assist the Grenadian people to reconstruct their shattered country. We view positively the announcement of free and fair elections  to take place in December  and we commit ourselves again to respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that Caribbean country.197.	We maintain our solidarity with Guyana and support for its right to exercise sovereignty over all its territory  and are encouraged that the Secretary General has become involved in the search for a suitable settlement of the controversy. We wish him well in this effort and respect the assurances from both sides concerning the maintenance of a climate conducive to a favourable outcome.198.	We continue to support the United Kingdom in its efforts to find an honourable settlement that will not infringe upon the rights of the people of the Falkland Islands to decide their own destiny  and we call on the new Government of Argentina to resume negotiations without preconditions that would be prejudicial to the islanders' rights.199.	The independence of Namibia is inevitable. Efforts to discourage the acceleration of that process serve only to delay the final outcome but cannot prevent it. We reiterate our support for and solidarity with SWAPO in the heroic struggle for the liberation of that country.200.	The suffering continues in South Africa  where the racist apartheid regime arrogantly  and with seeming impunity  persists in trampling on the rights and dignity of the majority black population. We condemn the trickery and sleight-of-hand being attempted by the racist regime under the guise of constitutional reform designed to defy world opinion and divide the oppressed people of South Africa.201.	While recognizing the right of Israel to exist  we recognize equally the right of the Palestinian people to forge their own destiny in their own homeland on their own territory.202.	Belize joins the rest of the international community in deploring the continuation of the unfortunate war between the nonaligned States of Iran and Iraq and imploring them to put an end to war and begin the task of reconstruction and reconciliation.203.	We remain concerned at the situation in Afghanistan and look forward to a negotiated political settlement that does not prejudice the independence  sovereignty and nonaligned status of that country.204.	As a minor actor on the international stage  Belize has no pretensions to considerable influence in world affairs. Our domestic concerns are limited to the consolidation of our independence  to building a durable and enduring democracy  to extending the fruits of development and a better life to all our people  and to offering every Belizean a dignified existence.205.	On the international scene  our policies of peaceful coexistence  good neighbourliness  non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  nonviolence and the peaceful settlement of disputes are aimed at promoting international peace  security and cooperation among nations. They are aimed at assisting in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic and social order in the world  with respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings among nations. And they are intended to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize  to broaden our international recognition and to consolidate our nationhood.206.	We have an abiding interest in the continued existence of the planet Earth. All our efforts to fashion a world order would be meaningless in the aftermath of nuclear war. We call on the international community  and the nuclear Powers in particular  not to shirk their responsibility to humanity but to work strenuously to save us all from the unspeakable horrors of nuclear devastation.207.	Belize's policies coincide with those of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  as well as with the approach adopted by the Commonwealth of Nations. We reaffirm our commitment to those organizations.208.	My delegation commends the Secretary General for his untiring efforts to streamline the Organization in the face of great odds  for his report on the work of the Organizationâa forthright  frank and realistic reportâand for his faith in the vision expressed in the Charter.209.	Our vision of the usefulness  indeed the necessity  of the United Nations is not clouded by the criticisms the Organization has attracted during its 39 years of existence. The list of accomplishments of the United Nations far outweighs the amount of criticism it receives. Indeed  the United Nations reflects the aspirations and frustrations of many nations and groups all over the world. We share the Secretary Generalâs view that ""one of its great merits is that all nationsâincluding the weak  the oppressed and the victims of injusticeâcan get a hearing and have a platform even in the face of the hard realities of powerâ210.	As we approach the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  let us pledge to preserve and strengthen the Organization so that it emerges stronger and more responsive to the needs of the kind of world we are in the process of creating."
"19",902,"BOL",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is an honour to come to this important rostrum to represent a Government born of the people's will. Your personal qualities and experience ensure the success of this Assembly's deliberations and the continuance of outstanding leadership such as was given by the previous President  a Head of State and friend of Bolivia  Mr. Jorge Illueca.2.	My delegation is happy to welcome Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations.3.	I wish also to express the special fraternal gratitude of the Bolivian people to the Secretary- General for the interest which the United Nations system has shown in my country and for its cooperation.4.	The people and Government of Bolivia once again reiterate their support for the principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations  particularly those concerning the peaceful solution of disputes and the non-use of force in international relations  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  non-intervention in internal affairs  and the self-determination of peoples. In the same way  we reject territorial conquest and all forms of military occupation.5.	Bolivia emphatically stresses its attachment to the principles of non-alignment; it rejects the occupation of Lebanon and Cyprus by foreign forces; it deplores the fact that the Secretary-General's efforts concerning the crises in Kampuchea and Afghanistan have not achieved the progress hoped for by the international community; it regrets the continuance of the Iran-Iraq conflict and reiterates the need to make more intensive efforts to resolve it; it supports all actions designed to bring about the reunification of Korea; it deeply regrets the absence of peace in the Middle East and supports the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.6.	Bolivia  for reasons of principle and historical experience  supports the universal doctrine that conquest by the use of force is inadmissible.7.	My country stresses its solidarity with the peoples struggling to throw off the colonial yoke and reaffirms Namibia's right to independence within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).8.	Of course  we must emphatically repudiate the doctrine of apartheid and would point out that no constitutional change in the Republic of South Africa can be legitimate if it does not include the direct participation of the majority of its population.9.	The distressing conflict in Central America not only affects sister countries but also threatens to have negative consequences for the whole continent. Bolivia has always expressed its solidarity with the people and Government of Nicaragua in their struggle to move ahead with the country's liberating national transformation  designed to bring about the institutionalization of a pluralist democratic system.10.	The work of the countries of the Contadora Group  which enjoys the support of the international community  demonstrates the capacity  imagination and will of the Latin American countries to find their own solutions to their problems without the intervention of outside interests. The advances recorded on 7 September 1984 at the seventh meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Contadora Group and the Central American countries  held at Panama City  demonstrate that by means of dialogue and negotiation it has been possible to identify the principal problems and find formulas of conciliation for their solution. My Government reaffirms its support for the work of the Contadora Group and its hope that a final solution to the conflicts in the region may be found.11.	Since the last century  Bolivia has recognized the legitimate rights of the people and Government of Argentina over the Malvinas. We express the hope that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom will resume negotiations and work to find a just and honourable solution  I should like to mention once again our concern at the deployment of nuclear weapons in the islands.12.	My country views with satisfaction the beginnings of the application of the Torrijos-Carter treaties which have restored to Panama its sovereignty over the Canal Zone. We hope that the provisions of the treaties will be complied with faithfully within the scheduled timetable.13.	Bolivia is the epicentre of political and social movements that are sweeping the continent. The rugged terrain of its mountains is swept by the winds of geopolitical storms  the drug traffic and the economic crisis. Against this background  the dramatic epic of the building of democracy among the Latin American peoples is being played out.14.	In October 1979  the General Assembly of the Organization of American States [OAS\ stated that ""it is in the permanent interest of the hemisphere to find an equitable solution whereby Bolivia would acquire sovereign and useful access to the Pacific Ocean"". This categorical assertion can be explained only by recognition of the fact that the war of 1879 brought about an artificial breach in Bolivia's sovereign rights on the Pacific Ocean  altered the continental equilibrium and introduced elements of tension and mistrust which threaten peace in the hemisphere.15.	In another statement in the same Assembly  on the occasion of the centenary of the Pacific war  I pointed out that not only was that war unjust but also that it was an historical error  because it severely limited the continental role which properly belongs to my country as a crossroads between the Pacific and the basins of the Amazon and the Plata. The land-locked status forced on Bolivia created an atmosphere of tension which was most dangerously manifested in the arms race unleashed in the zone  which has just in the last decade swallowed up a sum amounting to almost $25 billion and at the same time placed barriers on the path to harmonious and fruitful economic co-operation between countries which were born to be complementary but which have ended up artificially separated by an historical error which must be corrected.16.	The consequences for the economic and political development of Bolivia have been still more serious. It has drained the natural resources of a territory five times as large as that of Belgium and deprived it of access to the riches of the sea along a coastline of 450 kilometres. It has limited sovereign access by my country to the Pacific ports and its traditional routes for foreign trade and placed it in an unacceptable situation of dependency vis-a-vis other Powers. It has increased the cost of Bolivia's external trade with an invisible customs toll which is estimated at approximately 35 per cent of the total of its imports and exports  because of the amount of losses  the delays and the mishandling of goods. In truth  the lack of a coastline is in itself a genuine cause of economic lag  as is shown by the circumstance that countries without their own access to the sea occupy the lowest places on the scale of development in Africa  Asia and Latin America.17.	In the case of Bolivia  this geographical seclusion involves an additional psychological factor  since to this temporary land-locked status must be added the feeling of isolation and mistrust resulting from an unjust war. This circumstance makes a clear difference between the situation of my country and those which for other reasons of international justice are seeking free transit and access to the sea. It is for this reason that the non-aligned countries stress the ""inalienable right"" of Bolivia to recover sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean  since there is a universal doctrine to the effect that conquests brought about by force are not legitimate.18.	It is my hope that this description will help members of the Assembly to have a better under-standing of the unswerving determination of my country to return to the sea with the same rights of sovereignty as those which it possessed at the time it gained its independence. There has never been any doubt as to what Bolivia seeks in its demand for access to the sea  although the dynamism of international relations has several times modified the context in which its demand has been made  almost always to the detriment of its national interest.19.	Recently  the constitutional Government of President Hernan Siles Zuazo  based on the popular will  brought forward a process of internal consultation from which emerged a national consensus to put an end to the enclosed position of my country between the Andes Mountains  the high plains and the Amazon jungle.20.	These objectives can be summed up in the statement that Bolivia must recover its own useful and sovereign coasts and ports on the Pacific  linked to the country by a sovereign and useful land route which would guarantee the effective continuation of the territorial status and make it possible to bring together all the geographical attributes which would finally make Bolivia a country linking the great South American basins and not merely the scene of confrontation of conflicting interests.21.	Before thinking of the concept of territorial compensation  which cannot be sustained in the light of juridical precedent and the universal principles of equity  we venture to remind the Assembly that the solution to this problem would liberate resources designed for unproductive and senseless purposes of war and open the door to broad and beneficial integration and economic complementarity between countries which are rightly known as sisters  something that has been lost on a far-distant battlefield.22.	There can be no substitute for the restoration of the sovereign status of a coastal state. All transit facilities and other advantages which depend on the will of outside entities will not be sufficient  because they would be nothing more than palliatives which would obscure the real and fundamental solution of the problem inherent in the fact that Bolivia is a land-locked country.23.	Within the framework of these premises  my country is ready to continue its appeals to the American countries in the OAS to embark upon direct negotiations with the parties concerned within the inter-American system and under the auspices of the President of Colombia  Mr. Belisario Betancur  whose Pan-American and noble-minded initiative deserves the sincere gratitude of the Bolivian people.24.	My country believes that  following the long experience of frustration and disappointment  it would be possible in this way to create appropriate conditions to bring about serious and practical negotiations in keeping with the rights  interests and expectations of the countries concerned. It is along that path that we shall find the hoped-for solution for a ""stable peace "" as called for in the 1979 OAS resolution. It is along that path that we shall find a lasting settlement to the age-old Pacific conflict.25.	As this war and its distressing consequences involve Bolivia  Chile and Peru  it is logical that its solution should include and benefit those nations  within the framework of legal treaties and precedents on the subject  so that we can achieve an agreement that ""will take into account the rights and interests of the parties involved""  according to a paragraph in the resolution the OAS unanimously adopted in November 1983.26.	There can be no doubt that the road to peace is understanding  based on good faith a *d the clear political willingness to resolve the difficulties separating our peoples. Bolivia is once again ready to engage in dialogue with a view to having its rights respected  because it has always relied on peaceful methods to solve international disputes.27.	For a long time now  the domino theory in conflicts has been accepted. Perhaps the time has come to restore the domino of peace hypothesis  according to which the solution to one conflict is likely to facilitate ending others. This is the hope of my country during these crucial years. This may be the contribution that the indomitable will of my people will make to the international community  following up on Panama's earlier admirable example. The control of drug trafficking and the consumption of drugs is today another challenge which jeopardizes the life and health of our peoples and the stability of democratic institutions.29.	Traditionally  the fight against this form of crime has focused on the producing countries. Following that logic  the cheapest and most effective method is to eliminate illegal cultivation and to prevent the processing of drugs by using control programmes and punitive measures in producing countries. Nevertheless  since production in fact responds to demand  the heart of the problem is in the purchasing countries. At least in so far as concerns Bolivia  this conclusion is supported by indisputable cultural and historical evidence. It must be recalled that in the Andean countries the innocent use of the coca leaf is as old as their civilizations themselves  without drugs being a factor of social degradation.30.	Furthermore  it is also clear that most of the earnings generated by this illegal activity remain in the consuming countries and  to a less degree  with the intermediaries  increasing the wealth and scope for action of organized crime. The producers receive a very tiny fraction of those earnings  as is the case with most exports from the developing world.31.	Consequently  the elimination of the real roots of this problem requires some rethinking with regard to concepts and operating methods. It should be said that a genuine solution is the responsibility of the international community  but that the principal contribution must come from the consumer countries  which possess the necessary financial and technical resources to fight this scourge with any hope of success.32.	As is well known  drug trafficking operates through a complex international structure. Production  processing  transport  financing  adulteration  marketing and consumption are all phases of an illegal activity vertically and horizontally integrated. The developing countries that produce drugs and allow them to pass through their territories are once again dependent links in this chain. Other countries determine how they are produced and for what reason.33.	It is clear that isolated national action will not be successful given this intricate network criss-crossing economic regions  various kinds of activity and political and social strata  if there is no co-ordinated  centralized and concerted effort internationally.34.	Another aspect of this matter is that we must take into account that any action against drug trafficking should not be restricted to purely punitive measures. Although that is an indispensable element of any overall strategy  it r of fundamental importance to offer development alternatives to the peasants and sectors of the population subsisting on the production and processing of drugs; their backs are against the wall owing to poverty and marginality. We must also replace sub rosa and illegal economies being developed within this international drug trafficking network and resulting in grave and profound distortions in the development of producer countries.35.	It will not be in punitive measures but in economic and social development that we shall find the social and politically valid answer to deal with this problem radically.36.	My country has suffered tragically from the presence of this criminal activity and its social  economic and political consequences. The constitutional Government of President Siles Zuazo has confronted this challenge within the context of a profound economic crisis and the tremendous difficulties caused by the transition from dictatorship to democracy.37.	Indeed  the Bolivian people first overthrew an illegitimate Government born in the very bowels of drug trafficking. A few weeks later  in the exercise of its legitimate attributes  it ordered the armed forces and police to occupy extensive zones of the tropical areas and to destroy the drug-producing centres. Plans for integrated rural development in these areas have been drawn up which will make it possible for the peasants there to rely on an adequate social infrastructure and to consolidate profitable  legitimate and stable economic activities.38.	For Bolivia  the fight against drug trafficking is a moral obligation and a practical imperative. The constitutional Government will be unswerving in its efforts to punish all those involved in those illicit activities. Nevertheless  the Bolivian effort will remain inadequate if the need for concerted international action is not followed upâan appeal which President Siles Zuazo made in November 1982  at the Assembly's thirty-seventh session.39.	In this spirit and on the initiative of my country  Argentina  Brazil  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela  on 1 October this year  approved the New York Declaration against Drug Trafficking and the Illicit Use of Drugs  in which it is resolved to request the United Nations to convene a specialized conferenceâwhich we hope will be held in Boliviaâto examine and find a solution for the various aspects of this criminal activity from a global standpoint  which in the Latin American view is an essential pre-condition for success in the task being undertaken today.40.	The concatenation of various factors has caused two  almost continuous  world recessions: the first in the middle of the 1970s and the second at the beginning of the 1980s. For Latin America  this phenomenon was manifested in a gradual reduction in its gross national product  the acceleration of the inflationary process and the loss of its purchasing power on external markets owing to the constant decline in the terms of trade.41.	Latin America today has a per capita gross national product similar to what existed seven years ago  with an increase in consumer prices that in 1983 reached 130 per cent and with a decrease in the terms of trade of 38 per cent from 1977. Consequently  the region has found itself obliged to reduce its imports to a dangerous level  a fact which is even more serious when we consider that since 1983 Latin America has become a net exporter of capital. In fact  whereas in 1981 it had received a net transfer of real resources from abroad  this process was reversed in 1983  when an amount of $30 billion was transferred abroad.42.	If we add to this the burden of its foreign debt  the servicing of which requires resources that are more limited today than ever  we may conclude that the economic crisis in Latin America needs priority treatment  calling not only for the solutions required by the existing situation  but also for medium- and long-term measures.43.	The case of Bolivia is characteristic of the crisis affecting the region. Its economy is suffering from an unprecedented contraction  which is seen in a drop in per capita national income of 30 per cent over the past biennium; runaway inflation  which in 1983 rose to an annual figure of about 300 per cent  and a doubling of the level of unemployment over the past few years.44.	The efforts of the Government of Bolivia to cope with this grave situation have met with obstacles caused by the high level of the foreign debt  unfavourable terms of trade  reduction in the volume of exports  and a sharp decline in essential imports needed for the normal functioning of the country's economic system. For example  the terms of trade worsened by 10 per cent in the last quarter  imports fell by 45 per cent in 1983  and the decline in exports  in the period between 1976 and 1983  reached 35 per cent.45.	As regards the social situation  the picture is tragic  showing a drastic deterioration in the living conditions of broad sectors of the population  large elements of which are underfed  while others are virtually starving. Social indicators of malnutrition  infant mortality and life expectancy  among others  are some of the most critical on the continent.46.	In these circumstances  social and political conflicts are becoming ever more acute  and the demands of the population in this regard are becoming intransigent. Consequently  we are witnessing increasing difficulty in carrying out the programme of economic recovery  and the stability of the democratic process itself is at risk.47.	President Siles Zuazo  at the beginning of his term of office  said in his statement to the General Assembly  in November 1982  that the constitutional Government had inherited a country mortgaged to the hilt and suffering from an acute economic crisis  factors that would require tremendous sacrifices from the Bolivian people in order gradually to restructure and improve the country's economy.48.	Through daily sacrifices  the people of Bolivia are contributing to the restructuring of the national economy. Nevertheless  the international community must also contribute its understanding so that together we can overcome this overwhelming crisis. The sacrifices required of most of the population are of such a nature that they cannot go on much longer unless at the same time we witness signs of hope and real economic recovery.49.	Adjustment programmes established by the Government have revealed its sense of responsibility. Nevertheless  the fact that they have not been developed in a consistent way shows that there are disturbing factors of a social and political nature  and indicates also the need for accelerated and prompt support on the part of the international community in order to neutralize these negative factors which make it impossible to carry out the programme without recourse to force or political repression  which would be contrary to the democratic spirit of President Siles Zuazo.50.	We have a long way to go in order to restructure the economy and place it on a sound  dynamic footing in both the public and the private sector. For this we need new resources  appropriate technology and administration.51.	In this context  the problem of servicing the external debt has assumed particular political and social relevance  since it has only given rise to the need for further sacrifices and placed heavier demands on the weak economies of the region.52.	It would appear that it is still not understood that the burden of all this economic adjustment on the Latin American peoples can only lead to a worsening of the crisis  the impoverishment of regional societies  the paralysis of its productivity  and social violence. Nor would this be likely to improve its capacity to repay the external debt.53.	For this reason  President Siles Zuazo has always pointed out the need for Latin America to combine forces to enter into a political dialogue with the creditor countries  since the consequences of the external indebtedness clearly transcend purely financial and technical aspects and call for global definitions with regard to financing and international trade. In this way  the creditor countries and the international banks would assume part of the costs of adjustment proportionate to their share of the responsibility for the creation of the problem of the indebtedness of Latin America and its consequences. Without doubt  this is the true spirit of the Cartagena Consensus and the Mar del Plata Communique.54.	The extraordinarily difficult circumstances of its present economy led to the Government of Bolivia's decision to postpone temporarily servicing part of its external debt. Although this decision seems isolated within the present international context  it will be quite common in the near future to see other countries at a level of development similar to our own also finding it impossible to comply with their obligations. The solution  however  is not to be found in sanctions  which would be counter-productive  as well as unjust  but in helping them to restore their production  which would also have a favourable effect on creditor countries. Such reactivation requires fresh input in order to promote exports of both traditional and new products. Bolivia has the necessary resources to cover its present obligations and to improve the standard of living of its people  but in the absence of domestic savings it urgently requires external financing in order to transform its goods into exportable resources.55.	These are the facts on which we should focus the co-operation of the international community  including  of course  private banks and multilateral financing organizations. On the basis of this philosophy  it will be possible to find a constructive solution to a problem which  approached in the traditional way  could generate only adverse consequences for the development of the Latin American countries and the stability of the international economic order.56.	The wave of democracy passing over the continent from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego is more vigorous than ever. One by one  the American peoples have reaffirmed their right to live in freedom. One by one  authoritarian regimes have given way to representative governments born of the will of the people. This process is so widespread and strong that one may fail to recognize its depths and tend to overlook its consequences and risks. Of course  this is not a neatly simultaneous change from military to civilian Governments  as has so often occurred in the past. What we are witnessing is a profound historical change which has its roots in alterations of the economic and social structure of South America in the last 50 years.57.	In the 1930s  the great depression overthrew the old oligarchic  feudal and backward republic  opening the way to a civilian and military populism which  although there were differences of nuance  modernized Latin American societies through agrarian reform  industrialization  substitution of imports  direct participation of the State in economic activity  and the mobilization of the broad masses of the people in the towns and countryside.58.	In this way  a new productive and social structure was established in Latin America  both urban and sophisticated  but at the same time with tremendous differences in standards of living and wealth: a throbbing and vital society  but a profoundly unjust one; nations with vast internal imbalances  subject to an oppressive international system; countries with significant human  natural and technological resources which  nevertheless  remained isolated  cut off from one another but dependent on others.59.	Throughout much of that period  we were able to perceive the contradiction that arose between an open and participative social and economic structure and an increasingly authoritarian and paternalist political system. Democracy ceased to be just a word and became a banner. In fact  it fully reflected the real needs of society and thus mobilized millions of people  filling the streets and prisons of America with heroes and martyrs.60.	Finally  as occurred half a century ago  a vast international recession exhausted the possibilities of the neo-liberal economic model and caused the collapse of authoritarian regimes  leaving the way open to the fuller  though still disorderly  democratic process which Latin America is now experiencing. It is a process which clearly is substantially different from the formal and oligarchical democracy of old. It poses new and complicated challenges to the thinking and political organization of the continent. In fact  within the framework of classic democratic values  of respect for human rights  individual freedom and subjection to the law  we must integrate within the machinery of participation and political decision-making new  emerging social strata born of the process of modernization  urbanization and agrarian reform.61.	In the case of Bolivia  this is undoubtedly a difficult task  fraught with tension because of the upsurge of new protagonists that have won their right to participate at the price of their blood  and because of unprecedented forms of regional presence that are contrary to the classic modes of social  economic and political organization.62.	It is therefore indispensable to renovate political doctrine and practice in order to include  in the appropriate institutional forms  new social protagonists and structural levels of active representation of the mass of the peoples in the economic  social and political decisions affecting the life of the community and the State.63.	From those considerations stem certain aspects of the concept of democracy: economic democracy  through the strengthening of the system of a mixed economy resting on the relative balance of power between the public and private sectors and the explicit recognition of the guiding role of the State in the planning of the national economy; regional democracy  in the sense that it is absolutely indispensable to open up imaginative and valid forms of administrative decentralization and local government that will reflect the new realities and make it possible to take full advantage of the potential human and natural resources  now wasted within our countries; social and cultural democracy  through the rooting out of all forms of racial and economic discrimination and the establishment of methods that will ensure health  education  housing and equal opportunities for all the people; and political democracy  based on respect for the opinions of others and rejection of the old practice of clients and patrons  opening up  finally  a real opportunity for the vast majority of the peoples in the field of political decision-making.64.	These are the challenges that history has placed before the peoples of Latin America  including those of my own country. President Siles Zuazo's Government and the People's Democratic Unity must build a democratic  pluralistic system that respects individual freedom and human rights  in the midst of profound social upheavals and the gravest economic crisis of the century  of the distorting and perverse effects of the drug traffic  and of the apparent indifference of the great Powers to the plight of the peoples of the third world. When one observes this struggle in all its magnitude  it is difficult to resist a deep  ambivalent feeling of fear and hope; for we see between the shade and the light of the struggle the vague  still imprecise  outlines of the new society that this generation is building at a heroic stage of Latin American history."
"20",949,"BRA",39,1984,"ï»¿71. On behalf of the Government of Brazil  it gives me great satisfaction to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am certain that I express the confidence that all delegations present here in this Hall place in your experienced and balanced guidance for the success of our labours. I also take the occasion to greet you as a representative of Zambia and the African continent  with which my country has strong cultural  historical and political ties.72.	At this point  allow me also to pay a well- deserved tribute to Mr Jorge Illueca for the competent and able manner in which he presided over the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.73.	It is a privilege to congratulate the people and Government of Brunei Damssalam upon their new membership in the United Nations  and I hereby renew my best wishes for the peace and prosperity of that country  with which Brazil already has diplomatic relations.74.	It is our daily experience to live with international tension and crises. Clearly the crises overlap successively in a vicious and self-reinforcing process. More than ever  orderly change is required. 75.	To face this challenge  Brazil believes in the commitment to the fundamental principles of inter-national life contained in the Charter of the United Nations. My country reaffirms that its foreign policy adheres to the high aim of seeking solutions consistent with the universal causes of peace and development. It maintains a balanced approach to current international issues.76.	We understand that only confidence can create a lasting basis for dialogue and co-operation among nations.77.	These values and this will to change guide my words in opening the general debate.78.	Epochs of crisis  such as the one we are going through  evidence themselves not only in facts but also in ideas and in the political culture. The United Nations cannot remain immune to the crises of our times.79.	From the generation that founded the United Nations we inherited a message that repudiates double standards in judgements. More than ever  it is necessary to recover the meaning of that message. The strong and the weak  the allied and the adversaries must understand and abide by the criteria that govern international life. Only thus can dialogue become truly possible. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the work performed at the United Nations.80.	Although authoritarianism may assume many guises  it does not seem right  in this year of 1984  to confuse the ideal of peace with the obsessive proclivity to war. Freedom  justice or progress should not be invoked to cloak a desire to dominate. There can be no quibbling about respect for the universal principles of the Charter. Equality means equality; sovereignty means sovereignty; non-intervention means non-intervention. Those who give in to expedient temptations to the detriment of the values essential to the credibility of the United Nations are only deluding themselves.81.	Brazil has taken clear  well-known positions on the great foci of political tension that continue to challenge the international community's capacity for action. After years of debate and negotiation on some of these questions  sizeable margins of consensus have been reached.82.	It will not be denied that the best road to self- determination and independence for Namibia is the implementation of Security Council resolution 433 (1978). As long as this directive is followed  the recent signs of flexibility on the part of South Africa are auspicious for dialogue and negotiation. In addition  the conscience of the international community has remained unequivocal in its repudiation of racial discrimination  and for that very reason the United Nations cannot compromise nor waiver in its absolute condemnation of apartheid83.	Time has shown that a comprehensive  just and lasting solution in the Middle East cannot be foreseen outside the parameters originally established by the United Nations. A succession of crises resulting from the non-acceptance of those parameters has for more than a generation been preventing the building of peace in that disturbed area.84.	In the Middle East as in other regions  Brazil condemns the persistence of a policy of faits accomplis in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations. Among the many victims of the recent and persistent crisis in Lebanon  we must mourn the loss of many soldiers of the multinational forces operating there. This should make us all  even the most powerful  reflect on the role that the United Nations can and should play in the conduct of peace-keeping operations in fulfilling the mandates of the international community with the full backing of the Security Council.85.	In all areas of tension  such as Afghanistan and Kampuchea  the principle of non-intervention should admit no exceptions to its application. Wherever attempts are made to interfere in national political processes  whether by force or by infiltration under the cover of technical excuses  they will deserve the condemnation of the international community. It is no longer possible to believe that public opinion can still be deceived by facades of legitimacy for acts of real intervention which seek strategic advantages or mere prestige.86.	In Central America there will be no long-term solutions without whole-hearted observance of the basic principles of self-determination  mutual respect among all nations and democratic life. For that reason it is vital that the work of the Contadora Group should go forward and be carried to a successful conclusion  since that Group is best able to promote awareness of the problems of the region in all their historical  social  political and economic complexity. Good relations in the hemisphere today depend  in a very critical way  on stability in Central America.87.	The spirit of the Charter must prevail so that we may have dialogue and negotiation. In this regard  it behoves us to express our thanks to the Secretary- General  who  whenever called upon  has given his good offices and played the role of mediator  even under adverse circumstances  with a sense for the opportune and a discretion appropriate for each occasion.88.	The same applies to the question of the Malvinas. The contribution of the United Nations continues to be indispensable for reaching a positive solution and should include providing encouragement for diplomatic understanding between the parties. This is a question that directly affects the Latin American countries  which have a solid position on the merits of the case  recognizing the rights of Argentina and desirous of dispelling the risk of tensions in an area that has a vocation for peace and harmony. This is the time to demonstrate consistency and authenticity  to honour the principles of the Charter by implementing Security Council resolution 502 (1982) in its entirety.89.	For all the critical problems I have just mentioned  the United Nations has not failed to take stands and prescribe cures.90.	But the scarcity of effective solutions does not derive from flaws in assessment: the problems persist because of fragmentation in the political will of the international community. While the decision-making machinery and even the implementation of decisions of the United Nations remain stalled  painfully negotiated formulas for consensus are subject to a process of erosion. The practical result is  very often  a lamentable retreat from the bases of understanding officially endorsed by this forum. To use an eloquent example  I recall the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament. 91.	Thirty-nine years ago  still under the impact of a conflict without precedent  the United Nations was born under the sign of universality and equality among nations. The Organization  in its very name  mirrors the ideal of solidarity and union and  in addition  the recognition that no longer can any nation afford to live in isolation. If there was a generous utopianism apparent in this vision  there was also a lucid grasp of the real needs for mankind's survival and well-being.92.	In our century  no nation  however powerful  can defy the international community as represented here  nor can it cut itself off from dialogue with other nations. No single State can enact laws for the whole world. In other words  to be effective  international leadership must be vested with real democratic meaning. It will be strong as long as it maintains this intrinsic value.93.	The international system should not be vertical and centralized. Whatever affects everyone must be decided upon by all. This argument applies specifically to two themes of global interest that cannot be dealt with separately: peace and development. But it is precisely in these themes of such vital importance for humanity that the political deadlock makes itself felt and equations of power override democratic dialogue.94.	Last August I had the opportunity to address the Conference on Disarmament  where I reiterated my country's growing apprehension at the acceleration of the arms race. I then announced Brazil's endorsement of the Joint Declaration issued on 22 May 1984 by six Heads of State or Government to the nuclear Powers  and I quoted the following excerpt from it: ""It is primarily the responsibility of the nuclear weapons States to prevent a nuclear catastrophe  but this problem is too important to be left to those States alone""95.	In order to discharge such a task  which is of first priority  international decision-making must effectively incorporate broad and representative participation by the community of nations. This will curtail the current monologue of intransigence which has replaced the negotiating process among those who through dialogue should have the primary responsibility for the security of us all. Under such a paralysing influence  discussions on ""arms control"" run the risk of completely missing their mandatory final objective: general and complete disarmament under effective international control.96.	The dynamics of confrontation  in its various doctrinary disguises  only lead to higher levels of terror  not of security. Political intelligence has already identified this tragic rationalization of the will to power.97.	Peace must not be turned into a mirage; it must not fade in the spiralling arms race. There is no substitute for peace  and peace emerges from a just and credible international order  not from a balance of mistrust. That is a fundamental lesson of the Charter of the United Nations.98.	It is on the economic plane that the contemporary crisis has its most sensitive dimension  but its dynamics are essentially political. The roads to peace and development cannot fail to be parallel. We are in an extreme situation which forces us to examine its roots without illusions or pretences.99.	Brazil will not give up its development prospects; it cannot accept a reduction in the place it has gained for itself in international trade within legitimately agreed rules. For a long time my country has been fighting in the proper forums for correction of the defects in the world economic structure  of which we are today one of the chief victims.100.	Several times in the General Assembly I have voiced Brazil's concern at the course the international economy has been taking during the last few years. In many different ways I have reiterated a call for a determined international effort to overcome the effects of the grave world crisis. I have reaffirmed the need to reverse a growing tendency towards the erosion of a most valuable asset  something for which we all worked hard during the post-war period; namely  international co-operation in the service of development as an indispensable factor for the management of a trade and finance system that is undoubtedly precarious and unstable.101.	At a certain stage I stated that ""when the world economy becomes highly diversified and the problems are universal in scope  the challenge is no longer that of how to obtain unilateral advantages but is that of how jointly to define viable ways to govern an increasingly unstable system.""102.	Recent occurrences  such as the reduction of inflation and the resumption of growth in some developed countries  seem to demonstrate the validity of recourse to unilateral policies by one or other of the main developed countries. However positive the recovery now taking place in some developed economies may be  it cannot be denied that it is limited and that it is leading to an excessive escalation of the coefficient of instability in the international economic system.103.	Nor can it be denied that  because of recourse to unilateral policies  perverse mechanisms have come into existence whereby debtor countries are led to transfer resources that subsidize the prosperity of wealthy nations. Worse still  those debtor nations see their prospects for development stultified under the impact  often overwhelming  of actions taken by the great industrial Powers.104.	The solution of the pressing problems of the international economy cannot be found in individual actions or short-term approaches; nor can it be ensured as a by-product of the recovery of one or other developed country. This is all the more true when such recovery  which is subject to strong elements of uncertainty and risk  has a restrictive effect upon the possibilities of expansion of other countries  particularly those most deeply in debt.105.	The way to a sustained and healthy recovery of the international economy cannot  therefore  be through the precarious reactivation of a few economies and an attempt  inevitably doomed to failure  to maintain an economic policy with restrictive effects upon the prospects for development of the nations of the third world.106.	The social and political tensions to which those countries have been subjected cannot continue much longer  nor can their peoples continue to live indefinitely at the mercy of abrupt fluctuations in the already intolerably high interest rates  in the availability of financial flows and in the conditions of access to international markets.107.	Over the past few years there have been recurrent episodes of resistance to concerted international action on the part of the developed countries  as shown by the lack of results at the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun in 1981; the obstacles posed to the launching of global negotiations; the failure of the latest session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; and the non-compliance with the principles and commitments of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In view of the extremely adverse situation confronting us  the time has come to open new avenues in the direction of the objectives which President Figueiredo definedâwhen addressing the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session [5th meeting]âas the need to restructure the international economic order.108.	The rejection of dialogue and concerted action among Governments has had particularly harmful consequences over the past two years  which were characterized by the emergence of the debt crisis  with devastating results for Latin America. Countries whose efforts to maintain adequate rates of growth in the 1970s  which were important at that time to sustain the level of economic activity in the developed world  today see themselves  because of events beyond their control  punished by severe recessive pressures. This is certainly not the reward they deserve for the important contribution they made to the prosperity of the world's economy.109.	The developing world has not failed to give clear indications of its willingness to enter into a realistic and constructive dialogue  as evidenced by several statements delivered in such varied forums as the Economic and Social Council  UNCTAD  GATT and the IMF. Their willingness to do so has been strengthened by a growing internal movement at the level of South-South co-operation and of interregional contacts.110.	As regards Latin America  three important steps in search of a dialogue with the developed world were taken this year with the holding of the Latin American Economic Conference at Quito in January and  more recently  the meetings held at Cartagena in June and Mar del Plata earlier this month by 11 countries particularly affected by the question of indebtedness.111.	At Quito  Cartagena and Mar del Plata  Latin American countries  acting in a moderate  objective and pragmatic manner  put forth a body of political principles which  in their view  should govern the relationship between debtors and creditors. They laid emphasis on the need for the creditors to recognize their share of responsibility in the solution to the debt problem  as well as the importance of symmetry and equity in sharing the burden of the adjustments required.112.	At Cartagena  especially  the participating countries took a significant step by clearly and strongly expressing their political will to act together in search of a dialogue with the Governments of the creditor nations on the general aspects of the debt issue. As indicated in the Cartagena Consensus  the question of the debt requires adequate political consideration at the international level  as it has obvious political and social consequences. Only the will of the governments of creditor and debtor countries will make it possible to modify the conditions which hamper the attainment of lasting solutions to problems which cannot be dealt with exclusively through a dialogue with the banks  by isolated action on the part of international financial institutions or by the mere behaviour of the markets.113.	The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Finance of the 11 countries that had met at Cartagena gathered at Mar del Plata  on 13 and 14 September to call for a dialogue with the Governments of the creditor nations. In the Mar del Plata Communique  they stressed the need for a meeting dedicated to the debt question and the means to alleviate the burden now faced by indebted nations. This dialogue  which will of course take into account the interests of all parties involved  is considered indispensable for the solution of problems that cannot remain subject to the vagaries of a highly unstable international economic environment. Let us hope that this time our appeal will not be in vain.114.	Like peace  development also threatens to become a mirage in the eyes of the weaker countries. If I insist on this correlation  it is to stress that in the political sphere  as well as in the economic  the difficulties we face arise from the very structure of the international system  resistant to change not mediated by power.115.	We can no longer avoid recognizing that if current distortions persist  the existing crisis will culminate in decisively hurting everyone  poor and rich  debtors and creditors alike. As we approach the end of the century  the economic world  like the political world  has become indivisible. Interdependence is not a rhetorical image: it is a historical necessity that demands political action in the sense of co-operation and not of regression or isolation.116.	To conclude  I should like to return to my initial remarks on the role of the United Nations in the present-day world.117.	Too frequently  the Organization has seen itself transformed into a ""forum for sterile confrontation""  as President Figueiredo stated when he addressed the General Assembly in 1982. In acknowledging the virtual paralysis of the machinery of multilateral diplomacy  Brazil seeks a higher objective: the preservation and perfection of the United Nations  to make it what it should be  the forum par excellence for settling controversies between States and promoting international co-operation.118.	Brazil does not subscribe to the allegation that the United Nations is condemned to becoming an anachronism. What would be more properly anachronistic would be the rejection of democratic dialogue within the community of nations; the rejection of genuine aspirations and formulas of consensus resulting from lengthy and wearing negotiating efforts; the prospect of the geometrically expanding gap in the distribution of wealth between the nations of the North and South.119.	There will be reason for comfort and optimism if we profit from the lessons of accumulated experience. As the United Nations approaches its fortieth anniversary  it has a more sorrowful  albeit clearer  perception of its limitations. This perception is courageously reflected in the reports on the work of the Organization submitted to the Assembly by the Secretary-General in the past three years. His suggestions for improving the potential of the United Nations are both timely and valuable. This notwithstanding  his warning that we are ""perilously near to a new international anarchy"" remains frighteningly vivid.120.	Never has humanity been so indissolubly associated in destiny  and yet  to our peril  the International community's capacity to act is weakening every day.121.	The United Nations is once again suffering acutely from the corrosive effects of the rivalry between the super-Powers. It would be unwise to ignore the realities of power in international life. None the less  it is also realistic to note that the justification of coercion is  in fact  the acknowledgement that political intelligence and creativity have failed. A greater threat is in the offing: that of a tragic doctrinal retrogression with regard to the rules governing relations among nations. Times of crisis always foster national egotisms.122.	Once again it must be stated that the Charter of the United Nations is a common heritage of political wisdom. The United Nations is not the monopoly of any country or bloc of countries  nor is it committed to immobility. Efforts to attain harmony must respect differences between individuals as well as between peoples. To reaffirm this philosophy  which is the responsibility of all  rich and poor  strong and weak  is also to preserve an arduously gained spiritual legacy  one to which Brazil remains faithful."

I am certain that our common characteristics as small island States will lay the foundation for a fruitful association in pursuit of the goals of the Organization.132.	Since I last had the honour to address the Assembly  little headway has been made in resolving the critical and often overwhelming problems with which mankind is beset. Indeed  one may be forgiven for yielding to cynicism and despair at the daily reports of hunger  strife and economic collapse  and at the endless chronicle of increasingly chilling human rights abuse.133.	For us  in the English-speaking Caribbean  the events which began on 19 October last year with the bloody overthrow of the Government of Grenada have constituted  unquestionably  the single most traumatic development in the recent political history of our region. After all the years of struggle for our internal political emancipation  followed by the battle for our independence  the practice of electoral democracy has become engrained in the psyche of our people. Government by the duly elected representatives of the people is something which we have come to take for granted as a natural part of our political reality. Any overthrow of such a system  any imposition of gun rule on the people in one part of our regionâpeople who are often our blood cousins  sometimes even our blood brothers and sistersâ strikes instantly at the deepest level of our security. Despite the formal constitutional divisions between the entities in the English-speaking Caribbean  we are essentially one people. The events in Grenada brought this home with a new and frightening awareness. Unfortunately  in a world which has become inured to change of government by coup dâÃ©tat  which increasingly acts as if democracy were a luxury reserved for a privileged few  this special relationship is not generally understood.134.	Happily  throughout the Caribbean the feeling has grown that the time for recrimination has passed. The process of reconstruction  both economic and political  has begun in Grenada  and shortly  in the full glare of international publicity and scrutiny  the people of Grenada will elect a government in free and open elections.135.	It is a sad but seemingly inexorable rule of history that great change seldom comes without great shocks to trigger it. The shock of the Grenada tragedy may turn out to be salutary if it pushes the international community to recognize the fact that it owes a particular duty to the smaller States among its membership. It is a duty that springs almost organically from the nature of international society. The integrity of small States is  first of all  the business of those States themselves  otherwise there would be no meaning to the concept of national sovereignty. But  for the very health of the international community itself  and hence of this Organization  it is imperative that the special difficulties of smaller States be high on the agenda of international deliberations. A former Secretary General of the United Nations argued eloquently that the Organization is  above all  the Organization of the small and the weak. Much lip service has been paid to this concept  but the truth is that the Organization has not yet been able to wind its increasingly cumbersome machinery into the proper position for dealing with the realities of the plight of many of its smaller Members. It brings to mind the unhappy image of a great ship incapable of changing course quickly or safely enough to save the man who has fallen overboard.136.	More and more  it is obvious that the international community must gear itself  both practically and constitutionally  to the task of shoring up the sovereignty and integrity of its smaller member States. The other possibilities are stark: if  in times of trouble  small States cannot be confident of the disinterested embrace of this Organization  there is a very real risk that they will fall into the clutches of those whose interests and power are by definition inimical to the flourishing of diversity and independence among States.137.	It is not only on the political front that small States are exposed to security threats. Policies on the part of powerful States which amount to economic coercion can easily upset the fragile balance of small open economies. I need hardly say that disruption of economic security leads sooner or later to political instability.138.	Fortunately  the past few years have seen a growing recognition of the special difficulties faced by small States. The particular problems of small island States  of which Barbados has an intimate knowledge  have also been receiving the attention not only of the United Nations  through the work being done by UNCTAD  but also of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries. It is to be hoped that some of the fruits of this work will be presented to the General Assembly in order that the international community may be made more aware not only of the problems but also of the possible solutions to the dilemmas of these geographically disadvantaged countries.139.	Until very recently  however  consideration of this issue has focused primarily on economic concerns. One notable exception has been the work of the United Nations with regard to mercenaries. Mindful of our own vulnerability to mercenary attack  Barbados has been consistent in pressing for the adoption of resolutions and conventions to stamp out the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries.140.	We are heartened by the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries has at last been able to agree on a ""Consolidated Negotiating Basis"" for future negotiations. We are optimistic enough to  interpret this as a signal that the members of the Committee are prepared to work seriously in future sessions towards the early elaboration of a convention  which is so sorely needed. Barbados will continue to contribute to this end in whatever way it can.141.	It is evident that the original concept of a nation State  responsible for  and capable of  providing fully for its own defence  is no longer applicable in today's world. Nor is the United Nations equipped in its present form to play this role. As Prime Minister Olof Palme  of Sweden  Chairman of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  points out in his report  ""Common Security""  the present United Nations security role is restricted to peacekeeping. The report highlights the limitations of United Nations peacekeeping operations  noting that such operations ""can only be launched after a conflict has broken out""  and then only ""with the consent of . . . the warring parties""  and require ""the mandate of the Security Council which may not be forthcoming because of political differences among the permanent members ... In short  current concepts of peacekeeping possess little capacity to deter"".142.	Until the necessary international machinery is put in place to safeguard their security  the sense of vulnerability felt by small States will continue to increase. It is therefore incumbent on the Organization to set about this task as a matter of urgency.143.	Economic security goes hand in hand with political security. Indeed  the security of small States can hardly be considered in isolation from their special economic problems. Caught in the ebb and flow of global economic fortunes  small States have their extreme fragility brought into sharp focus. It is in such States that the impact of a sudden economic downturn in the international economy is felt first and most forcefully  and they are the last to benefit from any subsequent upturn.144.	Against this background  we must once again call upon the international community  in particular the developed countries  to show substantive proof of their oft-stated commitment to the development of the economically disadvantaged nations. The evidence is growing that their own continued prosperity is inextricably linked to the viability of the developing world.145.	We take note of the Economic Declaration issued at the tenth Economic Summit of Western industrialized countries  held in London from 7 to 9 June 1984. In this document  recognition is given to the economic pressures on the developing world and to the vital role which industrialized countries must play in promoting the process of economic growth in the third world.146.	This is fine language. But what is needed is action  urgent and purposeful action. It is our firm belief that a restructuring of the international economic order is imperative if the third world is ever to attain acceptable levels of prosperity. It is evident too  that such a process must involve a significant input from the developing countries for whose benefit it is intended. In this context we reiterate our support for global negotiations  with the full and meaningful participation of all developing countries.147.	A genuine and consistent effort is needed to reverse the protectionist trends in international trade which are effectively stifling the efforts of developing countries to create the linkages essential for self-sustaining growth. At the same time  the international community must be prepared to channel a greater flow of resources to developing countries to assist in the necessary structural adjustment of their economies. In concert with this  ways must be found to ease the debt burden of these countries and to initiate the long overdue revamping of the international financial system.148.	My Government considers that the debt problem is one of the most crucial and urgent issues on the international agenda. Unless there is rapid acceptance of the need to reschedule short-term debts and to accord an extension of repayment periods  it is difficult to see how a real and comprehensive recovery can come about.149.	At the same time  it must be recognized that there is an urgent need to restructure the international monetary system. The endemic instability in that system  with its wildly fluctuating exchange rates  constitutes a real impediment to the economic advancement of the developing world.150.	High on the agenda of international political concerns is the question of Namibia  which continues to defy solution. The world body finds itself powerless to end the illegal occupation of that country by South Africa. In 1978 there was optimism about a settlement of the Namibia issue  when the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978). However  since then  little progress has been achieved and South Africa continues to tighten its grip on the Territory and to exploit and plunder its natural resources. In the recent past  the racist regime of South Africa has continued to thwart all hope of progress towards the independence of Namibia  by stubbornly refusing to make sincere or serious attempts to come to terms with the genuine efforts of SWAPO and the frontline States to reach an acceptable solution.151.	Barbados must once again unreservedly condemn South Africa's refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions on Namibia. We categorically reject all efforts to link the independence of Namibia to extraneous considerations. Such demands are nothing more than diversionary and delaying tactics.152.	I wish here to reaffirm the unchanging determination of the Government of Barbados to support the struggle to free the black majority of South Africa from the yoke of apartheid. The recent constitutional reforms are purely cosmetic  as they plainly fail to address the fundamental issue in South Africaâthe systematic and constitutionally sanctioned suppression of the black and coloured majority in their own country. The elections recently held in South Africa have been shown up for the sham which they are  through the boycott of the polls by the overwhelming majority of the coloured and Indian peoples of South Africa. My Government renews its pledge not to rest until the scourge of apartheid is relegated finally and irrevocably to the scrapheap of history.153.	The Middle East conflict continues to occupy centre stage  amid the myriad conflicts raging around the globe.154.	The Government of Barbados maintains its position that the resolution of the question of Palestine is fundamental to the achievement of peace in the Middle East. Just as the State of Israel has the right to exist within agreed and secure boundaries  by the same token Israel must recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to existence as a sovereign and independent State within secure boundaries.155.	In this respect  I wish to reiterate my country's support for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which provide a valuable starting point in the search for a negotiated settlement of the Middle East problem.156.	Barbados views with deep concern the latest development in the troubled Middle East region  namely  the mining of the Red Sea waterways. Not only has this succeeded in disrupting shipping in the region  but it could conceivably have claimed the lives of many innocent people. Such indiscriminate acts of terrorism encourage even more extreme retaliatory measures and prove self-defeating in the long run.157.	It is with a sense of cautious optimism that we follow the tentative progress being made in Lebanon towards restoring peace in that country which has suffered for so long. The formation earlier this year of a Government of national unity comprising representatives of the Christian  Muslim and Druse communities was a welcome and positive development. Recent indications that withdrawals of foreign military forces may soon be under way also give cause for cautious optimism.158.	The outlook for peace in another part of the Middle East appears far less promising. We must all deplore the loss of human life and the waste of resources which the conflict between Iran and Iraq  now in its fifth year  is continuing to cause. We join others in calling on both Governments to declare a ceasefire in the conflict and to enter into negotiations to settle their dispute  which poses such a grave and growing threat to international peace and security.159.	Nearer home  international attention continues to focus on the situation in Central America. We are convinced that deep-seated social and economic inequalities are at the root of the conflict in Central America and must be redressed as a matter of urgency.160.	The Government of Barbados is therefore deeply disturbed by the massive build-up of military forces in the area  which not only is dangerous in itself but represents a tragic diversion of funds from necessary social and economic development efforts. In this context  I wish to reiterate our firm support for the efforts of the Contadora Group in seeking a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the conflict.161.	Elsewhere  we seem to be faced with stalemate after stalemate. This is true with regard to Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Korea. In the case of Korea  there are signs  which we warmly welcome  that the possibility of peaceful resolution exists. We would exhort the two sides to grasp such opportunities and to seek a creative and constructive path to peace.  Against the background of the intensification of global conflict and the security needs of small States  it is pertinent here to touch on the issues of the arms race and disarmament.163.	The breakdown of the Geneva talks on strategic arms reduction gives cause for deep disappointment. It is in the hands of the two major Powers that the delicate balance of world peace is held. It is therefore their solemn duty to put aside intransigence and to seek a viable agreement in a spirit of compromise. Nothing casts so large a shadow over the world as the fear of nuclear war. Those who hold the keys to the final holocaust have an overwhelming duty to mankind to narrow their differences and to maintain permanently open channels of dialogue.164.	In this context  the statistics on military expenditure are depressing in the extreme. It is particularly heart-breaking to see small developing nations devoting vast sums to military budgets while poverty  hunger and unemployment run rampant in their countries. This phenomenon serves to underscore my earlier remarks concerning the need for effective international machinery to shore up the security of small States. For where there are real or perceived threats to their national security  nations cannot concentrate fully on their economic development and social progress.165.	I need hardly point out that if a fraction of the resources devoted to the expenditure on arms were channelled instead to social and economic development a better life might at last be within reach of the wretched majority on this planet. Moreover  until the world as a whole  and the superpowers in particular  are prepared to show tangible proof of their commitment to disarmament and to putting an end to the arms race  the threat of a sudden conflagration will continue to hang over us like the sword of Damocles.166.	Mr. President  one of your most onerous responsibilities in the coming year will be to oversee preparations for the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Barbados considers the celebration of this anniversary to be of the utmost importance  beyond the formalities of ceremony and protocol. This anniversary will provide the opportunity for the international community to assess the operation of the present international system and then to improve it to meet the realities of today's world.167.	The Charter of the United Nations was framed at a particular point in history  in the face of a particular set of circumstances  to meet a particular set of objectives. There is no doubt that the international system has been eminently successful in the humanitarian and social areas  in health and education  in agriculture  in emergency relief  and in relation to the interests of workers and the welfare of refugees. Despite all this  the United Nations system is too frequently the target of criticism.168.	This state of affairs arises because so often in the areas of both politics and economics the international system is not allowed to function to its fullest capacity. Narrow concepts of national interest are given a higher priority than the peace and security of mankind; the Governments of some nations are so busy trying to impose their values on the Governments of smaller and weaker countries that they fail to see that the longer-term interests of all countries and peoples depend on cooperative international effort. Some United Nations agencies find themselves starved of resources and are correspondingly ineffective as they try to fulfil their mandate to deliver the programmes required to give the majority of mankind the chance to reach the minimum living standards established by the international community itself.169.	The Charter was drafted on the assumption that the great Powers would act in concert to safeguard peace and security in the world. This concept emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War  when horror at the devastation suffered acted as a catalyst for a new international solidarity that would for ever banish the scourge of war.170.	Events since the Second World War have created a completely different atmosphere on the international scene and it has now become virtually impossible for the great Powers to act in concert. My Government believes that the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations would be an excellent opportunity to undertake a review of the way in which the Organization functions and to determine what practical steps could be taken to make it a more flexible and apt instrument for dealing with present-day realities. It may be that a special session of the General Assembly with this single item on its agenda would be appropriate  and the Assembly might wish at this present session to set in motion the preparations towards that end.171.	Whatever reservations I may have expressed  I feel bound to conclude my statement before the Assembly by reasserting my Government's continuing faith in this great Organization. If the problems of the world were simple  there would be no need for the United Nations. But that  alas  is not the case. At the storm centre of the difficulties which face the international community is a problem as easy to identify as it is hard to solve  the problem of ideologies  of methods of viewing the world and its history. There is  we all know  no magic potion  no technology  no electric shock therapy that will suddenly bring about a universal perspective in which we can all happily acquiesce. Meanwhile  we know only too well that in a nuclear world we have no choice but to find  in the grimmest sense of the expression  a modus vivendi.172.	In this search  the United Nations system is the best that we have been able to achieve so far. It is the repository of our best hopes  the expression of our highest ideals. Its universality is a promise that with persistence and imagination the community of States may yet find its way out of confrontation and conflict into an era of compromise and conciliation. Let us keep our feet firmly on that path."
"22",1069,"BTN",39,1984,"ï»¿I have the honour to convey to the President of the General Assembly and to all representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  for the success of this session of the General Assembly.187.	Allow me also to extend our warm congratulations to Mr. Paul Lusaka on his election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election is not only a recognition of his outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman  but also a tribute to his great country  which has been in the forefront of progressive causes in Africa and in the world at large.188.	To his predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  I should like to convey our admiration of the great skill and distinction with which he guided the last session of the General Assembly.189.	My delegation attaches considerable importance to the universal character of the United Nations. In keeping with this view  we are happy to extend a hearty welcome to the Organization's new Member  Brunei Darussalam.190.	One of the primary purposes for the founding of the United Nations was to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. To that end  all the speakers who have taken part in the general debate during the past two weeks have drawn our attention to the urgent need to strengthen international peace and security. Sadly  however  in spite of such universal calls for peace year after year  much of the world still remains torn by conflicts. New upheavals take place while old wars drag on. After 39 years of the existence of the United Nations  the world has certainly not become a safer place to live in.191.	In fact  the international situation has reached its most critical point since the Second World War. The seriousness of the situation was recently underscored by the appeal for peace and disarmament made by the leaders of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania in their Joint Declaration of 22 May 1984.192.	It seems that proxy wars will continue  with developing countries invariably the victims. Whether in Asia or in Africa  in the Middle East or in Central America  the scenario is the same. Why  in the face of the oft-repeated desire for peace of all countries  have these situations been allowed to continue  and in fact to worsen?193.	In our view  conflicts and tension will continue as long as efforts are made to divide the world into spheres of influence and military blocs. The world is being gradually forced back to the era of the cold war as a result of such great-Power rivalry. Furthermore  tension is heightened by the worsening economic situation in the developing countries. People of all nations are beginning to lose confidence in their future. This situation was aptly summed up last year by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  when he said: ""The belief in a common future has been  to a large extent  lost in the anxieties of a divided present. Short-term national interests  old resentments and fears  and ideological differences have obscured the vision of the Charter."" That bleak and dismal picture remains unchanged in 1984.194.	We see in the Middle East the ongoing senseless and tragic confrontation between Iran and Iraq. The fate of Lebanon is another source of concern to all of us. The international community must do all it can to redress these situations.195.	The resolutions of the Security Council and those of the General Assembly which provide that Israel must withdraw totally and unconditionally from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 remain unimplemented. We must state that not even Israel's legitimate security interests can condone the continuing occupation of southern Lebanon and other Arab territories.196.	Furthermore  the rights of the Palestinians must be fully restored  including the right to self- determination in their homeland. Only then can there be any real chance of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East  a peace founded on the rights of all States in the region to exist within internationally recognized boundaries.197.	In southern Africa  we deplore the blatant evil of apartheid and call for its swift and complete eradication. Apartheid hurts black and white alike; its inhumanity causes suffering to the oppressed and corrupts the oppressor. We also reiterate our support for the just struggle of the Namibian people for independence under the leadership of SWAPO.198.	Until the super-Powers and their allies learn to refrain from pursuing a policy of intervention and interference and learn to live together in peaceful coexistence  there will be no peace on this planet. Policies aimed at promoting ideologies and extending spheres of influence are a self-defeating process from which neither East nor West will gain in the long run.199.	We all live today under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust brought about by the nuclear arms race. The danger this represents cannot be highlighted strongly enough  though discussions about it are often couched in coldly academic terms amounting to euphemism or a ghastly numbers game. Let us be honest: there can be no such thing as a ""limited nuclear war""  nor the chance for life  as we know it  after a nuclear holocaust. There can be no talk of the ""rationality"" of such a situation  nor can we realistically speak of massive nuclear arms build-ups as a deterrent to war. History affords us few examples of weapons invented but not used. The choice before us is whether we are to have a future at all.200.	The trend evinced by each side to harden positions and to refuse to come to terms  whether on arms limitation talks or the non-use of space for nuclear weapons  must be reversed. Outer space must definitely be kept free of ""star war"" scenarios.201.	The cementing of an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban is one practical first step. This move would impede  if not halt  the sophistication of existing nuclear weapons and put a stop to the creation of totally new nuclear arms. Furthermore  production of chemical weapons must be banned and existing stocks destroyed.202.	Achievement of superiority by either side is a pathetic illusion  and the headlong rush to try to attain such dominance produces ever greater insecurity and instability. Each megaton of potential destructive force brings us closer to the probability of an accident or a breakdown in restraint. Let us apply the same ingenuity wasted on these gigantic follies to find constructive solutions to the problem of collective security  and thereby end the perceived need for instruments of mass annihilation.203.	The Secretary-General  in his report last year  posed the pertinent question:""Who can possibly believe that a world dominated by the nuclear balance  where $800 billion a year is spent on armaments and where a large proportion of the population lives in destitution and with little real hope  is OP the right track?"" Indeed  with fully two thirds of the world's population living below the poverty line  the question deserves consideration.204.	The North-South dialogue was a promising beginning to finding ways of overcoming dilemmas confronting the world economy and fostering a spirit of co-operation. Resolutions were debated and agreed upon  but no action has been taken so far. The negative attitude demonstrated by a few Member countries is tantamount to rejection of international co-operation for development. The issues originally addressed by the dialogue remain as vital as ever. The negotiations  in our view  must be resuscitated in the interests of a better future for all humanity.205.	We live in an interdependent world. What happens in one country or region has repercussions in the next and often affects the whole world. Economic interdependence is a concept with which we are all familiar  and yet we must constantly bear it in mind when seeking remedies to the problems of poverty  hunger  illiteracy  and underdevelopment.206.	The state of the world economy in general continues to be plagued by structural deficiencies and imbalance. As a result  there has been a serious erosion of living standards in developing countries. The situation is most desperate in the least developed countries. Regrettably  the results of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in September 1981  are yet to materialize. We believe that the international community must assist in eradicating hunger and malnutrition. There is an urgent need to go beyond expressions of concern to positive action. While we recognize that developing countries themselves have the main responsibility for development  we should at the same time remember that external resources do have a vital role to play in complementing national efforts.207.	The past year saw many distressing events  but there have been some encouraging signs as well. One such positive note was sounded by the Nordic Foreign Ministers meeting at Reykjavik just a month ago. In their official communiqueâan extraordinarily enlightened document by any standardâthe ministers affirmed their strong support for the Charter of the United Nations  called for disarmament and resumption of detente between the major Powers  urged a comprehensive test-ban treaty  reiterated their full support for efforts to bring about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  condemned the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa  and stated the necessity of adopting concrete measures to strengthen the development of developing countries through bilateral and multilateral aid. The international community would do well to listen to the concerted voice of reason  moderation and good sense emanating from Reykjavik. Indeed  in the tension-ridden situation prevailing in the world at present  the Nordic Group  with its pragmatic  constructive and enlightened thinking  could well serve as a bridge between West and East and between North and South.208.	Another positive aspect of the past year has been the continued efforts of the Contadora Group to help maintain peace in Central America. Their task is formidable  but the very existence of the Group is a sign of hope.209.	In our own part of the world  in the Kingdom of Bhutan  the people are moving forward under the wise  dynamic and dedicated leadership of our King  Jigme Singye Wangchuck. After two and a half decades of development planning  we have been able to create the basic infrastructure and to enthuse the people to participate in shaping their own present and future well-being. In doing so  we strive to meet the most basic needs of our peopleâaccess to education  health care  decent housing and productive employment. We do not wish development for development's sake. Through innovative measures  we are seeking to achieve a pattern of development best suited to our natural environment and the genius of our people and in conformity with our rich spiritual and cultural traditions.210.	In our region of South Asia  we have taken a significant step forward to further regional cooperation. The Foreign Ministers of Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan and Sri Lanka had their second meeting in Maldives last July. The meetings were held in a friendly and co-operative atmosphere. We are now hopeful that the next meeting  which will be held in Bhutan sometime in the spring of 1985  will make adequate preparations for the summit to be held in Bangladesh later in the year. All this augurs well for the people of our region. Many problems lie before us  but we know that it is only through regional action that we can hope to meet these challenges. The seven member countries are aware that orderly development and progress can take place in South Asia only in an atmosphere of peace  harmony and mutually beneficial co-operation.211. Human history is not merely a list of tragedies  but is rich in inspiring stories of the glorious achievements of individuals and groups in the fields of politics  economics  the arts  philosophy and other areas of human endeavour. Let us look on our shared present problems as challenges and opportunities. We have on record many fine resolutionsâlet us implement them. Let this thirty-ninth session be a landmark for world peace and prosperity."
"23",1109,"BWA",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like  Sir  to join preceding speakers in extending to you the congratulations of the delegation of Botswana on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The honour and pride that we feel in seeing you presiding over our deliberations derive not only from the fact that you are a Zambian and that Zambia and Botswana are bound together by deep-rooted ties of friendship  culture and history  but also from the happy realization that you are the first son of southern Africa to assume this high office. We repose in you our confidence that the thirty-ninth session will  commensurate with the brilliance of your stewardship  produce the desired results.2.	I should like to express my sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for the efficient manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session.3.	I should like to pay an especial tribute to the Secretary-General for his stable and enlightened leadership of the United Nations. We particularly commend him for his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization. The message conveyed by his report is timely and must receive the attention it so richly deserves as we embark upon the preparations for the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.4.	The admission of the new independent State of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations is an occasion for joy and celebration  for it represents another nail in the coffin of colonialism. It is a confirmation of the fact that the existence of the United Nations is incompatible with the existence anywhere in the world of colonial outposts tenaciously dedicated to the preservation of socio-political values  beliefs and practices that have long been discredited and consigned to the scrap- heap of history. But in welcoming Brunei Darussalam to our midst let us also reaffirm our determination to struggle even harder to rid the world of all the remaining pockets of colonial resistance. 5.	There has been no improvement in the world situation since the last session of the General Assembly. The arms race between the super-Powers has continued unabated  while the fury of the cold war has persistently threatened to consume all of us.Admittedly  the super-Powers have now started what we hope will be sustained overtures to each other; otherwise  world stability will remain seriously at stake as the East and the West continue to communicate with each other across the widening ideological divide with virulent verbal abuse.6.	Almost everywhere else on our globe  bloody conflicts persist  conflicts which may or may not have anything to do with super-Power rivalry  as nations large and small seek habitually to settle their disputes on the battlefield. Wasteful ideological wars have become the popular means to which nations resort in the pursuit of dubious and narrow national objectives. Warmongering seems to have become a habit  an addiction  in many places.7.	My own part of the world  the region of southern Africa  has endured much conflict and bloodshed in the last two decades. Since the early 1960s  we have had continuous wars of liberation  some of which have happily ended in victories  as in the case of the people of the former Portuguese colonies and of Southern Rhodesia. But  although the Portuguese empire in Africa is no more and Southern Rhodesia has become the proud  independent Republic of Zimbabwe  southern Africa remains poised on the edge of a dangerous precipice. Thanks to South Africa's intransigence  the international Territory of Namibia is yet to be delivered from foreign occupation  while South Africa itself continues to totter on the brink of a revolution.8.	The question of Namibia has been a burning issue in the United Nations  particularly in the past six years. It is six years since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) as a blueprint for the peaceful decolonization of Namibia. That resolution has not been implemented  but not because the people of Namibia do not want independence or because our friends of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] have been found deficient or wanting in their commitment to the peaceful liberation of that country. There has been no progress towards the implementation of the resolution for two reasons: first  South Africa continues to refuse to cooperate in the implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  the provisions of which it accepted without reservation six years ago; and secondly  the resolution no longer stands on its own; it is linked to an issue on which neither SWAPO nor South Africa  and neither the Western contact group nor the front-line States  have locus standi: the issue of the presence of Cuban troops in Angola.9.	The Foreign Minister of South Africa was reported recently as having said that  because of the uncertainty about the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  ""an all-out effort should be made now to achieve a cease-fire""ânot the United Nations supervised cease-fire  but one prior and in addition to it. This is another linkageâa cease-fire designed to stop the liberation struggle in Namibia in return for a new lease on life for the status quo in that Territory.10.	Botswana remains adamant in its view that a solution to the Namibian question acceptable to all can come only out of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  undiluted by the injection into it of extraneous and irrelevant elements. The surest way to kill the resolution and thus destroy the whole process of peaceful change in Namibia is to encumber the resolution with endless pre-conditions. If South Africa wants peace in Namibia  the road to the achievement of that peace is via the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).11.	And the occupation of Namibia by South Africa must end for another reason. The front-line State of Angola has suffered a great deal as a result of South Africa's acts of aggression committed from the territory of Namibia long used by South Africa as a military base from which the bandits of UNITA are supplied  and Angola is subjected to an endless series of incursions and invasions. Even at this moment  South African troops are still ensconced in N'giva  in southern Angola  seven months after their promised withdrawal. And they have wreaked untold havoc in that part of Angola which they have occupied for more than two years.12.	The situation in South Africa itself has developed into a crisis of frightening proportions. At their Summit Meeting  held at Arusha on 29 April 1984  the front-line States reiterated in their Final Communique that ""the root cause of the problems in South Africa is apartheid itself'. And yet  five weeks ago  the world watched helplessly as the minority white rulers of South Africa introduced a new constitution  the obvious purpose of which is to consolidate and entrench apartheid by confirming the irreversible permanence of Bantustans and the disenfranchisement in perpetuity of the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa. Instead of initiating steps to abolish the abhorrent system by which the people of South Africa are graded like animals  the white minority rulers of South Africa have recruited South Africans of Asian origin and the so-called Coloureds into the ranks of the white minority as junior partners in a futile attempt to escape reality.13.	The historic Manifesto on Southern Africa makes our position abundantly clear. We persist in our demandâthe collective demand of the people of Africaâthat an unfettered opportunity be afforded all the people of South Africa  ""together as equal individual citizens  to work out for themselves the institutions and the system of Government under which they will  by general consent  live together and work together to build a harmonious society"". The so-called reforms now going on in that country beg the question. They amount to nothing more than tinkeringâreckless tinkering with a very dangerous situation.14.	The 23 million black South Africans who have been so callously left out of the new constitutional dispensation are not likely to suffer in silence  for  as one wise man has aptly observed:""It is one of the oldest laws of history that where there is no democracy to provide for the counting of heads  men denied those rights and brutalized by oppression inevitably turn to violence as what they believe  however wrongly  to be their only way to obtain their rights.""So it is that black South Africans treated as aliens in their own country are being given no other choice but to resort to violence  the weapon of desperation  to recover their rightsâviolence which  tragically  knows or respects no frontiers  violence against whose ghastly consequences the independent States of southern Africa cannot be insulated.15.	Indeed  many of them have already fallen victim  not to the consequences of liberation violence as such  but to South Africa's acts of aggression known as destabilization. Dissident movements  the purpose of which is clearly to force South Africa's neighbours to coexist submissively with apartheid  are being spawned everywhere in the region.16.	Then there is Pretoria's sudden obsession with the signing of non-aggression pacts with its neighbours. My own country has been under pressure in the past several months to sign a non-aggression pact with South Africa  a country with which Botswana has historically maintained peaceful relations despite the political and philosophical differences that characterize those relations. The harsh facts of history and geography which confronted us as we regained our independence 18 years ago have dictated that we coexist in peace with South Africa  for not only do we depend almost entirely on that country for our economic survival  but it would be sheer lunacy on our part even to dream of seeking confrontation with a country as lethally powerful as South Africa. That is why  like most of our sister countries of southern Africa  we decided at independence that we would not allow our country to be used as a military base for attacks against our neighbours. We have strictly enforced this policy  for we are in mortal fear of the alternative to it. We have often taken strong measures against those who violate it and have done so publicly  secure in the knowledge that the international community appreciates our geographical predicament.17.	This is why we cannot comprehend South Africa's insistence that we sign the so-called treaty of good-neighbourliness as if we have been a bad neighbour. In sum  we refuse to sign a non-aggression pact or a good-neighbourliness treaty for the following reasons.18.	First  we have never committed an act of aggressionânot even oneâagainst South Africa. We are incapable of committing acts of aggression against South Africa.19.	Secondly  to sign a non-aggression pact or treaty of good-neighbourliness with South Africa would imply that we have been found seriously wanting in our enforcement of our policy of not allowing our country to be used as a stepping-stone for guerrilla attacks against South Africaâwhich is far from being the case. The record is there to attest to the strictness of our enforcement of the policy.20.	Thirdly  signing a non-aggression treaty with South Africa would compromise the peace and stability of our country  as we would be seen  wrongly or rightly  to be joining the ranks of the white minority in South Africa in its confrontation with the black majority. So far  our policy of not allowing guerrillas in our country is respected because the reasons for it are understood. This understanding would be impaired if we signed a treaty which would virtually force us to join the South African Government in its war against South African liberation movements.21.	Fourthly  if  unbeknown to us  freedom fighters pass through our country and perpetrate acts of sabotage in South Africa  we could not be any more to blame than South Africa  whose wider and finer netâsophistication  financial and manpower prowessâthey continue to elude.22.	Change will come from within South Africa. In March 1984  The United Democratic Front News in the Western Cape aptly had this to say:""The apartheid Government can make as many peace agreements as it likes  it can talk to as many leaders of other countries as it wants to. We know that it is to us and our leaders that the apartheid Government must talk. There will not be any peace while our leaders are banned  gaoled and in exile. There will not be peace while apartheid rules our land. In the end Mr. P. W. Botha must make peace with the people of South Africa.""23.	For the sake of the security and survival of our country  we are committed to continuing co-operation with South Africa to ensure that the spirit of good-neighbourliness which has  on the whole  characterized the relations between our two countries for so long is not disturbed.24.	If I have spoken at length on the situation in southern Africa it is because the situation causes a great deal of concern to us. The international community has to be sensitized to it and to the very serious ramifications of its persistence and intractability. But perhaps even more intractable is the situation in the Middle East  to which I must now turn.25.	The Middle East situation remains volatile and tense  as no movement whatsoever was recorded in the past year in the search for a lasting solution to the Palestinian question. The Palestinian people remain homeless and stateless  and there does not seem to be any end in sight to their misery. The dehumanizing squalor of refugee camps and the hopelessness  precariousness and emptiness of life in the diaspora have become their persistent lot. Thousands of them have been brutally hounded out of their sanctuaries in Lebanon  while hundreds of others have lost their lives in a brutal cycle of violence perpetrated against a people whose only crime is to want to regain its freedom and its home in its ancestral homeland  Palestine.26.	The Middle East will never know peace as long as one of its nations  the Palestinian nation  remains a nation of refugees. None of the countries of the region  including Israel  will enjoy peace and stability as long as the aspirations of millions of Palestinians remain frustrated. The building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza will not enhance security for Israel; it will engender more violent bitterness among the Palestinians towards the Jewish State.27.	So will the occupation and annexation of the Golan Heights  which can never give Israel the security it so desperately needs; Syria is 'rightly embittered by the usurping of its territory and will employ every means to regain it. The occupation and ransacking of southern Lebanon by the Israeli army during the past two years also can only have earned Israel the bitter enmity of the people of Lebanon. All these are the deeds of a country which seems bent on ensuring security for itself literally at all costsânot only at the cost of the very security it seeks but also to the detriment of the security of all its neighbours.28.	We support Israel's right to exist  but only within internationally recognized boundaries. Yes  like all the countries of the Middle East without exception  Israel deserves the right to exist in security and peace  but not at the expense of the security and peace of its neighbours. In other words  just as we shall never support the destruction of the State of Israel  the State of Israel must in turn understand that we shall never support its expansionist wars.29.	The war between Iran and Iraq has in the past several months shown that it still has the potential to set the world aflame  as it has increasingly involved third countries which have nothing to do with it. The sinking of innocent oil tankers owned by countries as far away from the Gulf as Japan and Panama can only fuel the flames and escalate the conflict. The war must be stopped before it goes too far.30.	South-East Asia also remains at war with itself. Kampuchea is yet to be relieved of the unwanted presence of foreign troops on its soil  the purpose of which is to maintain in power  a regime which derives its authority to govern from the will of a foreign Power. The General Assembly must once again insist on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and must continue to call for the convening of an international conference on Kampuchea to enable the people of that tormented country to shape their political future at the conference table rather than on the battlefield.31.	The non-aligned country of Afghanistan continues to bleed  as the troops of a super-Power seek ""to pacify"" its people against their will. Once again  we deem it our duty  in the name of peace and non- alignment  to call on the super-Powers to respect the independence and territorial integrity of small  peace-loving  non-aligned countries. We join in the call of the non-aligned for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan so that the efforts of the Secretary-General may bear fruit.32.	The Korean question remains troublesome. The two Koreas have long accepted the desirability of peaceful negotiations to attain the reunification of Korea  and yet every year they talk about negotiating without actually getting anywhere near the negotiating table. The North has recently proposed tripartite negotiations  in which the United States would be involved  while the South has continued to call for the resumption of ""direct inter-Korean negotiations with a view to taking measures to remove the existing mistrust and antagonism"". Both sides are thus agreed on the need to talk peace  and yet nothing beyond talking to each other across the forbidding tension of the demilitarized zone has been achieved.33.	Botswana continues to support the peaceful reunification of Korea  for we shudder to contemplate the alternative. We will support any plan  any proposal  regardless of its author  which is genuinely designed to achieve that end.34.	The situation in the Central American region has caused us a great deal of anxiety for some time now. The endless bloodshed in El Salvador and the persistent unwarranted provocations to which Nicaragua has been subjected since the fall of the Somoza dictatorship have seriously compromised the peace and stability of the region. The southern African region desires for the people of Central America the very same peace  progress and prosperity it has wished for its own people for so long with very little success. That is why we fully support the Contadora Group's laudable exertions for peace and commend Nicaragua for promptly agreeing to sign the historic Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America prepared by the Group. We call on all others concerned to give the Contadora Act a chance.35.	The state of the world's economy today continues to place the developing countries in a position of extreme hardship. Despite some evidence of economic recovery in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the developing world on the whole has yet to see improvement. Indeed  the shortfalls in resources for development have increased more rapidly  while the need for assistance has grown.36.	In large parts of the developing world  levels of per capita output fell for the third consecutive year and are below those recorded in 1979. The impact of this continuous economic erosion is increasingly being felt in the social and economic spheres. Unemployment  underemployment and poverty are on the rise in many of those countries. Social infrastructures and public services are frequently under severe pressure. There is growing evidence of difficulty in insulating health and education from the effects of the economic crisis. Physical investment is also being severely constrained in a large number of countries  reflecting both a drying up of private investment in the face of economic recession or contraction and the falling of public investment following pressures to reduce public spending. The impact of the crisis on health  education and investment places future development in jeopardy.37.	The forces underlying this severe set-back to development have been gathering momentum for a number of years. Although the precise causes vary from region to region and from country to country  severe strains in external payments are a common factor. The debt crisis in Africa  Latin America and some parts of Asia has been characterized by a cutback in new private and public financial flows  which has led to a slow-down in economic activity.38.	No region has had to face this stark reality more directly than Africa. The Secretary-General has clearly described the magnitude of the challenges facing most of sub-Saharan African countries. As is well documented by reports prepared by the Secretary- General  the African economic crisis calls for simultaneous action on several levels. In the most immediate time-frame  the international community must work closely with the affected countries to respond to the emergency needs. Among the requirements are adequate supplies of food and water and steps to counteract desertification  as well as others related to population displacement  unemployment and debt-servicing. In the medium- and long-term  we must seriously address the need for developing institutional infrastructure which will enable these countries to deal more effectively with future emergencies.39.	In reviewing the African economic crisis  it is highly important to appreciate that the emergency  short-  medium- and long-term implications and ramifications are not only interrelated but are very closely intertwined. Any measures to be taken  be they at the national  regional or international level  must ensure internal consistency between the different requirements in the short-  medium- and long- term.40.	Indeed  as long ago as April 1981  the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  at its seventh meeting  held at Freetown  when considering a paper entitled ""Africa's rapidly escalating crisisâproposals for a short-term immediate programme for survival""  emphasized the linkage between emergency programmes and short-  medium- and long-term structural adjustment programmes. What was stated then remains as valid today as it was in 1981. Emergency programmes of action in the critical areas of food  drought  energy and balance-of-payments difficulties are not in any way meant to replace development strategies and plans of action adopted by the various United Nations agencies. These emergency programmes should be envisaged to clear the ground and lay the necessary foundations for the successful implementation of the long-term strategies and programmes of action.41.	Underlying the current crisis is Africa's under-development and economic backwardness  its failure to achieve a clear break from its colonial  dependent economic inheritance  with a production structure heavily dominated by export-oriented agriculture  a small industrial base  fractured and only minimally linked with its natural resources base  with mining output being predominantly for export and with the most open and exposed economy in the world. As is well known  external trade normally constitutes a major stimulus to spur internal socio-economic progress even where this is affected by the narrowness of export commodities and dramatic price shifts over which Africa has no control.42.	The economic and social transformation of Africa  which started in the 1960s after the attainment of political independence by most African countries  is not only coming to a halt but also gradually reversing. Throughout the 1970s  Africa  particularly sub-Saharan Africa  experienced deterioration in all major economic and social indicators. While the gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 3 per cent between 1970 and 1980  this rate has persistently fallen and is at present negative. On the other hand  population has been rising consistently at an annual rate of 3 per cent. Consequently  per capita income has been declining. Today  26 of Africa's 50 independent countries are classified by the United Nations as least developed among developing countries. Because of the severe drought which has negatively affected agricultural production in a large number of countries in sub- Saharan Africa since 1982  food is the most critical aspect of the crisis.43.	The Special FAO/WFP Task Force  established in 1983  estimated food deficit for 1983/84 for the 24 food-aid dependent African countries at about 5.4 million tons. Despite reports of good rains in West Africa  the projections remain valid for the 1984/85 period. I wish at this juncture to thank the international community  especially the donor countries  for responding very generously and expeditiously to our appeals. Without their assistance whole populations would have perished. However  there remains a lot to be done  and I hope we can continue to count on the generous support demonstrated so far. Because of the continued drought  poor harvests are expected for the 1984/85 period in eastern and southern Africa  resulting in a food deficit of about 2.6 million tons  of which 1.35 million tons are required as food aid. My country  Botswana  is among the most affected.44.	In most of the 24 food-aid dependent countries  deteriorating health conditions and severe malnutrition are reported. UNICEF and WHO  with the financial support of the donor community  especially the non-governmental organizations  have been very active in providing relief. We are most grateful to them.45.	The rehabilitation  reconstruction and revitalization measures for the African economies will have to focus on three major sectors: food and agriculture  industry  and the provision of essential infrastructure. Such measures must tackle not just the symptoms of the crisis but also its root causes if they are to be consistent with long-term policy objectives. In this connection  one cannot over-emphasize the crucial role of domestic policy reforms for accelerating the process of rehabilitating  reconstructing and revitalizing the African economies.46.	A consensus has long emerged among African countries as to what these measures should be. The Lagos Plan of Action4 and the Final Act of Lagos are clear testimony to the resolve by Africa to tackle its problems squarely. It is heartening to note that a similar consensus has emerged among major donor agencies such as the World Bank  the European Economic Community  the Asian Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa on what needs to be done to pull the African continent out of the economic pit in which it finds itself.47.	In order to restore growth and to enable African countries to rely mainly on their own resources  it is essential to devise special short-term measures which will ensure that their export earnings are stabilized at remunerative levels. Export earnings of most African commodities have dropped by as much as 20 to 47 per cent since 1980.48.	In this connection  the implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  especially the entry into operation of the Common Fund for Commodities  as well as the early conclusion of new commodity agreements are an important element in the realization of this objective. Also important is the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers against African agricultural and mineral products.49.	To enable African countries to face the Herculean tasks of rehabilitating  reconstructing and revitalizing their disintegrated economies  massive external resources will be needed. The Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa in May of this year  proposes some concrete measures  which include: first  an increased flow of concessionary resources to the African least developed countries  especially those most seriously affected by natural calamities; secondly  the increase of resources by the World Bank to Africa to enable it to cope with the current external debt crisis; to that end  we urge that structural- adjustment lending should be expanded to constitute a major lending programme and that it should be spread over a longer period; thirdly  the substantial increase in IDA resource flows to Africa for the implementation of the World Bank Special Programme for Sub-Saharan Africa; fourthly  the expeditious completion of negotiations for supplementary funding of at least $3 billion for the seventh IDA replenishment and the taking into account of the current crisis in Africa in allocating the existing and the new IDA resources; fifthly  the increase in Africa's share of special drawing rights to meet its current economic crises; sixthly  the full implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries 7 especially the transfer by 1985 of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries as official development assistance to least developed countries; seventhly  the early replenishment of IFAD and a substantial allocation therefrom to Africa; and eighthly  liberation of IMF conditionalities  including facilitation of access to other IMF windows  such as the cereal window; and the restructuring of lending programmes and policies as well as aid-disbursement procedures by the World Bank  regional development banks and other multilateral financial institutions with a view to a speedier and more flexible flow of resources to Africa.50.	It is essential that the international community accept the fact that the economic crisis facing the African continent is a challenge not only to African Governments but to humanity as a whole. The international community must respond positively  magnanimously and speedily to the various proposals put forward by the various United Nations agencies in order to resolve the present economic and social crisis that is crippling the African continent. It is also important  and even more important  that the African Governments themselves should continue with their efforts to institute fundamental domestic policy reforms which enable them to accelerate the process of structural change for achieving the objectives set forth in the Lagos Plan of Action. In this vein  at Lusaka on 1 April 1980  the Heads of State and Government of the nine independent countries of southern Africa adopted the Lusaka Declaration  entitled ""Southern Africa: Toward Economic Liberation""  which established the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference [SADCC] and set in motion a historic process of growth and change and a strategy for integrated regional development. The objectives enunciated in the Declaration include: the reduction of economic dependence  particularly  but not only  on South Africa; the forcing of links to create genuine and equitable regional integration; the mobilization of resources to promote the attainment or implementation of national  inter-State and regional policies; and concerted action to secure international co-operation within the framework of a strategy for economic liberation.51.	The southern African leaders knew their strengths and weaknesses. They knew the power of collective self-reliance as well as the value of extra- regional co-operation. They were aware that their nine countries constituted a population approaching 60 million people  inhabiting a geographical area replete with rich natural resourcesâagricultural and mineralâwhich could be harnessed efficiently and equitably for the benefit of the masses of the local populations and  indeed  for mankind as a whole.52.	The member States of SADCC realized that pragmatic  realistic and attainable objectives were essential for the attainment of their noble goals. They picked on selected and specific tasks and functions to be undertaken by chosen members among themselves. SADCC recognized  to begin with  that one of the first economic objectives to be pursued by member States was the provision of basic infrastructure without which their economies could not function.53.	Transport and communication was selected as a priority among priorities. Anybody who has travelled in our part of the world will easily understand why. Energy and food security are among the top priorities. This  however  does not diminish the importance of other sectors.54.	For the African countries to be able to achieve their noble objective of collective self-reliance they will  more than ever before  need the full support of the member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the other developing countries in a position to do so  as well as that of bilateral and multilateral institutions.55.	I am convinced that  given the necessary support  Africa is capable  in the not-too-distant future  of moving from its current position of an economically crisis-ridden continent to that of an economically dynamic one. It is within the means of the international community to help African Governments to turn the current despair into hope and I have no doubt they will do so.56.	Let me conclude my statement by reaffirming my country's undiminished fidelity to the principles and purposes of this  our United Nations. A great deal has been achieved by the Organization in the past 39 years of its existence in its search for solutions to the many problems that face our troubled world. But that is obviously not enough. A great deal more remains to be done to bring into reality the kind of world envisaged almost 40 years ago by the founding fathers of the United Nationsâa world without colonialism and imperialism  without racism and intolerance  without hunger  disease and ignorance  a free  peaceful and safe world."
"24",1153,"CAF",39,1984,"Allow me first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Central African Republic  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your long experience acquired in the course of your diplomatic career and your superb knowledge of international issues bode well for the great success of the work of this session. My delegation would like to assure you at the outset of its readiness to assist you.105.	I should also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the support of the Central African Republic for the Secretary-General  whose work on behalf of the Organization is both dedicated and selfless.106.	Lastly  our delegation w. hes to extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam whose admission is a further reflection of the universal role of the United Nations.107.	Since the founding of the Organization  its usefulness and effectiveness have continually been called into question. The resolutions it has adopted  the solutions it has worked out  the recommendations it has made  have never really fulfilled the hopes cherished by peoples stricken by crises and conflicts; they have never completely allayed the tensions and upheavals in the world. Therefore  despite the heterogeneous nature of the Organization and its complexity  it should show a more definite spirit of consensus and return to its original objectives  namely  the noble ideals of peace and development laid down in the Charter of the United Nations.108.	The sweeping currents of ideas  discoveries and technological innovations should lead to a change in the relations between nations; all such changes should lead to a true world balance. Unfortunately  reality is quite different. We are  in fact  witnessing a resurgence of intolerance  insecurity  selfishness and violence. Despite that gloomy picture  we shall not give in to either defeatism or skepticism. Despite numerous stumbling-blocks  the United Nations continues to be the forum in which discussions and negotiations on the fate of the world are held.109.	In today's world  which is characterized by diversity  the right to be different should be recognized as a fundamental principle governing relations among States  a right to be different that the United Nations fosters and develops  the right of each people to flourish within the context of its own history  its own culture  its own beliefs and the political and economic system it has freely chosen. When denied to others - as is so often the case - this right to be different becomes a source of turbulence  hatred and confrontation.110.	In Africa  in Asia  in Europe  as well as in America  evidence of such intolerance and selfishness is all too common. Often  peoples are stifled. Their legitimate struggles for their inevitable emancipation and their power to decide their lot in full exercise of their sovereignty are being thwarted by sordid personal interests.111.	Are examples necessary? The situation prevailing in southern Africa is a very eloquent case in point. It is  of course  true that the agreements recently concluded between South Africa and some countries of the region are an encouraging step along the road towards peace. However  that remains problematical. So long as SWAPO  the sole representative of the Namibian people  is denied recognition of its national rights  peace cannot be lasting and total. It is more than ever important that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) be fully observed and implemented.112.	The Central African Republic welcomes the recent agreements concluded between France and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to withdraw all foreign forces from Chad. It hopes  however  that the simultaneous withdrawals will be effective and complete  not just from the capital  N'djamena  and its immediate environs  but from all Chadian territory. Chad must regain possession of the whole of its original territory. That would enable the Government of that brotherly neighbouring country finally to dedicate itself fully to the task of reconciliation and national reconstruction begun by President Hissein Mabre.113.	With regard to the question of Western Sahara  our delegation believes that an excellent basis for seeking a solution can be found in the resolutions adopted at the eighteenth and nineteenth ordinary sessions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity. In that connection  we cherish the firm hope that the next session of that Assembly will provide an opportunity to assess the efforts made by the countries involved.114.	With regard to the question of the Middle East  everyone knows that the Palestinian problem lies at the heart of the conflict. No acceptable solution can therefore be arrived at which ignores the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In that connection  we shall continue to support any initiative in line with the spirit of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) aimed at bringing about a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the conflict.115.	In the same context  the Central African Republic makes an urgent appeal to the international community to spare no eHort to preserve and guarantee the national unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty and neutrality of Lebanon.116. In the name of the principle of recognizing the right to be different  Democratic Kampuchea should be enabled fully to exercise its sovereignty. To that end  we hope to see the full application of the principles laid down by the Organization.117- The Central African Republic also supports any initiative designed to enable Afghanistan to regain its national rights and its status as a neutral  non-aligned country.118. The problem of Korea remains a pressing one. The persistent tension in the Korean peninsula is of concern to the Central African Republic. Thus  as part of our contribution to the efforts being made by the international community to reduce such tension  we shall continue to urge both parties  which undeniably aspire to reunification  to pursue their dialogue on the basis of the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972  which set forth the principles for such action. Free  direct dialogue  free of outside interference  would unquestionably enable the parties to establish the conditions for the restoration of the mutual confidence indispensable for the maintenance of peace in the region. Both parties could  in the mean time  plan for their simultaneous admission to membership in the United Nations.120. Given the situation prevailing in Central America  the Central African Republic believes that negotiation is the only appropriate means for achieving a peaceful solution and for promoting the harmonious coexistence of the States of the region 120. These several examples of the refusal of certain States to recognize and accept the right to differences are based on a two pronged interest. First  there is an ideological interest  since those States which reject the right to differences are often members of an alliance bloc. A treacherous complicity does  indeed  exist on the part of part of the international community. That complicity impedes mutual understanding and confidence. And then there is strategic interest in the policies of certain States which have embarked on the arms race in order to maintain their military and economic domination.121. Thus  while the Central African Republic welcomes the negotiations under way on disarmament  it also deplores the fact that they are brought to stalemate at a time when the proliferation and development of arms are reaching alarming levels  thus perpetuating the vicious circle of destruction. 122. The disarmament we so fervently wish for cannot be achieved solely through regional security and arms limitation agreements. AH States must be aware of the pressing and collective task of championing international peace and security. 123. The Central African Republic is firmly convinced that the effective development of all the countries of our community is a condition for global balance and a guarantee of peace. Development also means the right to life and therefore it cannot be jeopardized. We call on the developed countries to contribute effectively  through bilateral or multilateral agreements  to the realistic development of the countries of the third world. For  one and indivisible  peace requires  if it is to be preserved  the universal development of all the members of the international community.124.	The inadequacy of the present international economic system is resulting in enormous difficulties for the developing countries. Will the alarm so often sounded ever be heard?125.	While concerned with providing a minimal decent standard of living for our peoples  our countries are rarely able to find the means to implement the economic plans and programmes which have been drawn up. Thus  we continue to suffer severely from the effects of the world economic crisis and from the shortcomings of the economic system. We deplore the attitude of certain industrialized countries which act as though the developing countries should come to terms with their poverty levels and even be content with them.126.	The countries of the third world are struggling not only for the right to development but also for a more significant mobilization of the means for development. The unbreakable link between the right to development and the right to security requires  in turn  the developing countries to observe an indispensable and reasonable balance between the means allocated for security and those given over to development.127.	Thus  it is regrettable that  after the adoption in 1974 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [raw/M^on pfAYA^]  there is still a gap between the socio-economic development efforts of certain industrialized countries and others which are less industrialized.128.	The international crisis seems to have disallowed any claim of the developing countries to such development  and therefore to life. The assistance which is accorded them  dwindling day by day  is clearly inadequate and the terms of trade are growing worse at a dizzying pace.129.	Our countries are in debt and are bowed under the burden of the amounts due; these debts are worsened and inflated by the crisis of the international monetary system. At the same time  our balance of trade shows a deficit and access to development sources and new technology  which are so badly needed to maintain development projects  seems to be denied to us solely because we happen to be developing countries.130.	We continue to be greatly disappointed  and we state this in this lofty gathering  all the more so because out hopes have faded since the work of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983  and of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna earlier this year.131.	A joint definition of new international economic regulations by the industrialized countries and by the third world is needed today. The entire international community would benefit from the beginning of global negotiations designed to putting a halt to this crisis.132.	The results achieved in three years by the Military Committee for National Recovery in working to restore and rebuild the Central African Republic are very encouraging and are a cause of satisfaction for us because the result first and foremost from our own efforts133.	But such success is also due to the valuable assistance given by friendly countries and by international organizations  including the United Nations. 1 should like once again to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General and his co-workers for the unceasing concern which they continue to show for the Central African Republic. The road is still long and the task an arduous one. That is why we should like to be assured of the continuity and stepping up of international assistance.134.	While observing the third anniversary of ac-cession to power of the Military Committee for National Recovery  the Head of State  General Andre Kolingba  began his speech as follows: ""For three years now the Central African Republic has seen the Military Committee for National Recovery at work. These three years have been imbued  above all  with peaceful repeat  with peaceful factor working for stability and a condition for any kind of development.""135.	That equation of peace and development is the basis of the philosophy of action advocated by the Central African Republic  on both the domestic and the international level.136.	For we have faith in the possibility of warding off those ills which loom as a serious threat over the future of the international community. The solution lies in respect by all States for the fundamental values of the right to differences and the right to development.137.	That is the message which General Andre Kolingba  Chairman of the Military Committee for National Recovery and Head of State  deeply convinced of the ability of the Organization to resolve world problems and drawing inspiration from the well-springs of our philosophy  has entrusted us to present for the consideration of the Assembly.138.	The entire Central African Republic joins us in wishing all possible success for the work of the Assembly."
"25",1197,"CAN",39,1984,"ï»¿It is with particular pleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  and your country  Zambia  on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You have worked closely with Canadians since the start of your long years of dedication to the United Nations. We also value the many links between Zambia and Canada  one of the most rewarding being our shared membership in the Commonwealth. It was an enriching experience for me to visit Zambia in 1979 for the conference of Commonwealth Heads of Government.43.	I should also like to welcome Brunei Darussalam  another fellow member of the Commonwealth  as the 159th Member of the United Nations.44.	Eight days ago the Progressive Conservative Government of Canada assumed office. It is appropriate that the first foreign policy statement outside Canada by our new Government should be here at the United Nations. Like all countries  we have urgent problems at home  and we are determined to face them. But the basic reality of Canada is that we are open to the world; our economy responds to the international economy; our population comes from and connects with all continents and nations; the name of our capital city  Ottawa  is drawn from the Algonquin Indian word meaning ""a meeting-place""  and our history is that of a community where different cultures and contesting interests can meet together. Ever since we have been a sovereign nation  our Governments and our people have tried to put our talents to work for the world. We shall continue in that spirit.45.	Canada was active at the creation of the United Nations  and successive Canadian Governments  formed by different political parties  have consistently helped the Organization to meet its most difficult challenges. I come to this rostrum in the tradition of Howard Green of Canada  who struggled to achieve a partial test-ban treaty as a first step towards a comprehensive test ban; in the tradition of Lester Pearson  who inspired the concept of peace-keeping; and in the tradition of Paul Martin  who helped to end the log-am which had prevented the admission of new Member States in the early years of the United Nations. Canadians are proud of having contributed to the solution of problems such as those.46.	In the nearly four decades since the Second World War  the international community has come to count on Canada as a moderating influence in a world beset by extremes. Our new Government is in the mainstream of this Canadian tradition and intends to build on it  consistently and pragmatically.47.	We want to ensure that we are using our influence and defining our interests in ways which reflect the contemporary challenges facing Canada and the world. As a new Government should  we shall undertake a thorough and public review of Canadian foreign policy aimed at the creative renewal of a moderate and constructive Canadian role in the world. Citizens of Canada and friends of Canada will be encouraged to suggest how the Canadian international tradition can best be applied to the increasing tensions and interdependence of the modern world  including those of the nuclear age.48.	The frightening facts of the nuclear arms race are well known. The super-Powers are developing new kinds of nuclear weapons  more countries are developing nuclear capacities  and the risk rises that terrorist groups could acquire nuclear devices. Physicians and scientists warn that even for survivors the world would be virtually uninhabitable after a major nuclear conflict. But far more threatening than the weaponry are the patterns into which the world has settled. Nuclear-arms-control negotiations between the super-Powers are at a standstill. This stalemate allows other nuclear States to claim impotence in the arms race and could encourage States without nuclear weapons to argue that they  too  have a right to acquire them.49.	If these patterns continue and the path towards effective nuclear arms control remains blocked  the world will become infinitely more dangerous.50.	We therefore welcome the meeting that will take place in Washington later this week between President Reagan and Foreign Minister Gromyko. We applaud the United States willingness  expressed so eloquently yesterday by President Reagan to engage in political consultations on a regular and frequent basis. We hope that the Soviet Union will respond positively to this opportunity to meet and to talk.51.	On these questions  Canada's influence is limited but real. We have no corner on moral authority or technical expertise  but we do enjoy a reputation as a people who are serious about peace and skilled at mediation. Those qualities are critically important in reversing the ominous trends which threaten to unravel arms control. The essential problem today is not moral and it is not technical. Neither superpower wants a holocaust  and human ingenuity  which can invent weapons  can devise controls. The problem is political  and this is one of the forums in which we must work together to inch the world away from nuclear devastation.52.	Some people despair of anything constructive being possible in the present state of international tension. They point to the recent lack of progress in virtually every area of arms control. The Canadian view is that something must be done and so it can be done.53.	The major decisions rest with the super-Powers  but the responsibility rests with us all. Multilateral efforts  led and encouraged by the medium-sized and smaller countries  can help improve the atmosphere and can put specific  workable ideas on the agenda.54.	Canada  for its part  is determined to continue to play a leading role in the search for peace and disarmament. We believe that the nuclear build-up threatens the life of every Canadian and that it threatens the existence of human society. Countries like our own must use their influence to reverse that build-up and reduce the danger of destruction. That will be a constant  consistent  dominant priority of Canadian foreign policy.55.	My country is not neutral in the contest between open and closed societies. We defend and we actively assert the values of democracy and individual freedom. We believe it is essential to pursue the goals of peace and freedom simultaneously.56.	We shall seek  through concrete and realistic steps  progress towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We shall encourage super-Power and multilateral discussion on all outer space weapons and shall commission further studies on how a space-weapons ban might be verified. We shall work for the success of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year  in order to prevent the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons. We shall bring to bear our technical expertise in verification measures to ensure mutual confidence and security in areas where arms control agreements can be achieved. We shall encourage-age agreement on a mutual and balanced reduction of conventional forces in Europe  and hence reduce the danger of escalation to nuclear war. We shall continue to press for a verifiable convention prohibiting the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Canada will continue its financial support of the World Disarmament Campaign. We shall  in addition  expect that the newly created Canadian Institute for International Peace and Security will contribute its share of studies and advice on specific arms control proposals and measures to reduce international tension.57.	Since we are new in office  I speak today in more general terms than I shall on future occasions. The Prime Minister  Mr. Brian Mulroney  has said that our new Government ""will play a more active role in the United Nations and its agencies"".58.	Our Government is unreservedly committed to the United Nations. We value our bilateral relations with other countries and our role in such associations as the Commonwealth and La Francophonie. These links are important  but they are not enough. Whether medium-sized Powers or smaller countries  we all need elective international institutions so that our voices may be heard in the world and so that we may face together the huge political and economic problems of our century. A dynamic and responsive United Nations system is essential for countries such as Canadaâbut also for the super-Powers. It is precisely because more communities adopt an introspective attitude that we must strengthen the world institutions that bring us together.59.	In his reports on the work of the Organization over the past three years  the Secretary-General has tried to make us face up to our responsibilities as Member States. In his most recent report he asks this:""Why has there been a retreat from internationalism and multilateralism at a time when actual developments both in relation to world peace and to the world economy would seem to demand their strengthening?""60.	When are we going to start to answer his disquieting questions? Let us hope that it will not take a major disaster to jolt us out of our inertia.61.	The eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is a fitting occasion for each Member State to examine its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. This anniversary must be marked by a renewal of commitments for the future  not merely by a celebration of the past.62.	It is not enough to reaffirm our adherence to the Charter. Member States must work together actively to strengthen the United Nations system. The Secretary-General has expressed the hope that in each of our countries our best talents will be put to this task. Let us take up this challenge and establish the guidelines for this work.63.	An unprecedented conference of 35 leading Canadians  sponsored by the United Nations Association in Canada  will take place on 26 October at Ottawa to launch a review of ways to strengthen the United Nations. The Prime Minister  Mr. Mulroney  and the Government intend also to ask Canadian parliamentarians to study this question and present formal recommendations.64.	How can we translate the results of this soul- searching in each of our countries into collective action to strengthen the United Nations system in concrete ways?65.	We should consider at this session  as a priority issue  how we  the ""friends of the United Nations""  can identify and give effect to practical measures to strengthen the United Nations system.66.	Any analysis of what is needed to strengthen the United Nations system must be based upon a realistic assessment of what has gone right and what has gone wrong.67.	The first thing that has gone wrong is that the Security Council has become increasingly ineffective. We all recognize that the Council does not operate in a vacuum. It will continue to mirror world tensions.But deteriorating relationships between its permanent members must not be allowed to immobilize the Council. We must immunize the Council to the extent that no matter what the crisis and whatever the state of relations among its members their representatives will continue to talk.68.	Last year the members of the Security Council held a series of private meetings to discuss how to improve the effectiveness of the Council. But that exercise appears to have run out of steam. Even ideas which appear uncontroversial on the surface seem to have been ignored. Why  for example  cannot the members of the Council agree to hold regular sessions in camera  with the Secretary-General present  to review the Council's and the Secretary-General's roles in facilitating the solution of current  incipient or potential disputes? A reluctance to talk is no excuse. The Council  at least behind the scenes  must function as a multilateral hot-line.69.	A second failing is that we have not lived up to our own responsibilities as States Members of the United Nations. We have expected the Secretary- General to fill the vacuum  without giving him adequate political support to do the job. We must allow the Secretary-General a greater margin of initiative and a greater independence of action. He has been able on his own to take action in some areas of United Nations activity. He has  for example  made a promising start in improving the management of the limited financial and human resources of the Organization. He has used a period of budgetary restraint to begin to weed out lower-priority activities. The Secretary-General has also been exerting a positive influence on many intractable international problems. But we must provide him with more political backing. He should be allowed and encouraged to increase his fact-finding capacity and his ability to exercise his good offices in particular situations.70.	A third thing that has gone wrong is that too much valuable time and resources are being wasted throughout the United Nations system on extraneous political issues. We all accept the fact that the Security Council and the General Assembly are political forums  but even here we should avoid the repetition of sterile political debates  the proliferation of resolutions on the same topic and the scheduling of redundant conferences and meetings.71.	We must also resist the over-politicization that is increasingly infecting the technical parts of the United Nations system  which are neither mandated nor equipped to handle such issues. It is naive to expect that a certain number of heated political issues will not be raised. However  it becomes debilitating when political issues begin to frustrate the normal give and take between groups in working out consensus on the essential activities of United Nations organizations. UNESCO  for example  has been a serious offender in recent years. We must step up the momentum to bring UNESCO back into balance.72.	We must not permit challenges to the universality of membership to undermine the continued viability of the system. Israel  for example  must retain its right of membership in the United Nations family of organizations. The Republic of Korea deserves full membership in the United Nations.73.	We must not  of course  allow any analysis of the things that have gone wrong to obscure the many things that have gone right within the United Nations system. We often take for granted the many parts of the system which are continuing to function well. I shall cite only a few examples.74.	First  most of the United Nations specialized agencies are continuing to carry out their mandates with distinction and with dedication. ICAO  as a case in point  was able last spring to approve unanimously an amendment to its Constitution to make even clearer the existing prohibition against using force against civil aircraft.75.	Secondly  in human rights the distance still to go and the double standards still at play cannot obscure the step-by-step progress which has been made. All those who cherish human rights have been heartened by the election of a Government of Argentina committed to the restoration of human rights. Canada hopes that at this session of the General Assembly the next important international milestone in human rights will be passed by the adoption of the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. We must send a message to the world that torture is unacceptable to civilized nations.76.	Thirdly  the United Nations development activities and humanitarian assistance continue to be irreplaceable. In 1984  UNDP will generate about $1 billion in technical assistance to developing countries  using the parts of the United Nations system as executing agencies. UNICEF makes a vital contribution to meeting the development and humanitarian needs of mothers and of children. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and UNRWA co-ordinate essential humanitarian assistance to refugees.77.	Fourthly  the United Nations system is also helping to focus upon the most persistent social issues facing society. The designation by the United Nations of 1985 as International Youth Year has encouraged many countries such as Canada to develop a comprehensive national programme in this Held. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  has strengthened the momentum generated on population issues over the last decade and identified emerging problems of global concern. The World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  to be held at Nairobi next July  will provide an opportunity to develop forward-looking strategies to stimulate positive changes in the lives of women.78.	Fifthly  under the auspices of the United Nations system  positive and often innovative legal regimes have been established in such critical fields as the law of the sea  trade  outer space  civil aviation  telecommunications and the environment. The progressive extension of the rule of law is fundamental to the whole multilateral system.79.	The record is much less positive in the area of peace and security. We can do more to make creative use of the machinery under the Charter of the United Nations to facilitate the peaceful settlement of specific disputes.80.	My Government wants the independence  sovereignty and genuine non-alignment of Afghanistan restored and foreign forces withdrawn from that battered country. We support the continued efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative to accomplish this.81.	We support the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] in their efforts to bring peace to the unfortunate country of Kampuchea  which continues to be occupied unlawfully.82.	Canada regrets the extension to Central America of East-West confrontation and the related militarization of the area. We applaud the initiative  skill and tenacity of the countries of the Contadora Group in their efforts to build a framework of reconciliation in the spirit of the Charter. We also welcome the opening of a direct dialogue between the United States and Nicaragua.83.	We need a negotiated settlement to end the suffering and destruction of the war between Iran and Iraq. We support the Secretary-General in building upon his recent success in obtaining the agreement of the belligerents to cease attacks on civilian population centres. His sending of a team to investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons was also a useful action.84.	Canada hopes that the current efforts of the Government of Lebanon to restore peace and stability in that tragic country will be rewarded. We support Lebanon's territorial integrity and maintain that all foreign troops should withdraw unless present at the request of the Lebanese Government. Canadians have been appalled by the latest act of terrorism in which so many people were killed and wounded at the United States Embassy in Beirut.85.	We strongly support a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which provides for the right of all States  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized boundaries. We also support the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to a homeland within a clearly defined territory  the West Bank and Gaza Strip.86.	We should remind ourselves that United Nations peace-keeping forces and observer missions continue to be essential in a number of troubled areas of the world. All Member States have a responsibility to contribute to the support of these operations. In particular  we ask Member States to respond positively to the appeal by the Secretary-General for additional voluntary contributions to UNFICYP. While peace-keeping forces can help to reduce the risk of open conflict  lasting peace can be achieved only through reasonable political compromise. In that spirit  we applaud the constructive participation of the leaders of the two Cypriot communities in the proximity talks held during the last two weeks under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We welcome the announced renewal of those exchanges next month  and we urge the parties to seize this opportunity for progress towards a just and lasting settlement.87.	We are all painfully aware that political and economic forces now at play in the global environment are interrelated. It is worth asking: What is the record of the multilateral system on the economic front?88.	The debt crisis has severely afflicted many developing countries. The effects of severe indebtedness on the economic prospects of so many developing countries  on the well-being of their peoples and on the health of the international financial system as a whole must remain a major preoccupation of the international community. Continued efforts will be required by the industrialized countries to ensure that the recovery strengthens and persists and spreads to all countries  developed and developing alike.89.	Canada will support expanding multilateral efforts to stabilize the debt situation  in line with the decision of major industrialized countries  at the London Economic Summit  held from 7 to 9 June 1984  to confirm their strategy on debt and to implement and develop it flexibly case by case. The Commonwealth  too  has been doing important work in this area. My colleague  the Minister of Finance of Canada  was invited by Commonwealth Finance Ministers  at Toronto last week  to recommend to this week's annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF that issues of special importance to developing countries  including debt  be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Development Committee. I am encouraged by the agreement of the Interim and Development Committees  in Washington over the weekend  to devote special attention at their meetings next spring to such matters as debt  adjustment and financial flows in the medium-term perspective.90.	The courageous adjustment efforts of many developing countries must be continued  but it is also important that adequate financing be provided by the international community. In this respect  the important role that could be played by private investment should not be overlooked.91.	As a country heavily dependent on foreign trade and foreign investment  my Government is pledged to maintain close co-operation with its economic partners and to uphold the principles of the open and just multilateral system under which all countries  developed and developing  can prosper. Effective multilateral institutions are essential to prevent parochial responses to economic problems that require common action.92.	National and international action will be needed to stem protectionist tendencies  which are still strong and could threaten trade prospects. The major Western industrialized countries rededicated themselves at the London Economic Summit to resist protectionist pressures and to accelerate the work programme of GATT. Our collective ability to fulfil these pledges and to move towards a new round of multilateral trade negotiations will be critical in halting the erosion of the open trading system and ensuring that trade shall continue to be one of the motors of growth in the world economy. Developing countries  as well  must play their full role in this process.93.	Meanwhile  there are the urgent questions of human suffering that must be addressed. Our new Government intends to maintain Canada's commitment to reach by 1990 the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product in official development assistance. Despite serious economic problems at home  we shall not turn our backs on the world's disadvantaged peoples. A greater share of our aid budget will be spent by non-governmental organizations  which have proved their effectiveness in community development programmes.94.	The record of the international community on economic issues is one of achievement  although it is far from perfect. We must ensure that the specialized institutions that we have created shall prove capable of coping with current and future challenges. There is growing support for a pragmatic  issue-oriented approach. Organizations such as the IMF/World Bank  GATT  UNCTAD and others which have specific mandates within the multilateral system are being encouraged to get on with their jobs with a renewed sense of commitment and co-operation.95.	As the Secretary-General has emphasized  no-where is human need greater today than in Africa  where many countries face drought and starvation. The problem of refugees remains of special concern there. So do the debt and balance-of-payments problems. This year Canada is devoting over 40 per cent of bilateral aid to Africa. We have sharply increased our food allocations and raised our contributions to humanitarian relief organizations.96.	The struggle for freedom and equality in southern Africa is also our common cause. Canada joined with other Commonwealth countries in adopting the 1979 Lusaka Declaration of the Commonwealth on Racism and Racial Prejudice. We stand by that Declaration  which reflects our commitment to work for the eradication of the evil of racism. We reject policies designed to perpetuate apartheid and continue racial discrimination.97.	We are also grieved that the people of Namibia are still denied their independence after a century of colonial rule. South Africa must set a date to implement Namibia's independence under Security Council resolution 435 (1978).98.	I speak here today as a Foreign Minister conscious of the frustrations of the United Nations and the limits on its actions. But I first encountered the United Nations as an idea  not an institutionâan idea that reached into the comfortable comer of the world where I was born  let me know that famine and war and disease were part of daily life in most of the world  and' gave me hope that there was a way we could fight those evils. Viewed from that perspective  the United Nations can be judged not by volumes of repetitive debates but by the millions of children who are fed and clothed and are living; the wars that were averted or limited or postponed; the hundreds of millions of human lives that have been protected or improved because the idea of the United Nations connects people who can help with people who need help.99.	The idea of the United Nations is as important now as at any time in our history. It forces the comfortable out of complacency. It lifts the desperate beyond despair. It allows today's frustrations to be seen in the light of four decades of lives improved  conflicts reduced  perspectives enlarged.100.	Support for the United Nations must be based on a clear-sighted view of current realities. When we list the things that have gone wrong with the United Nations  we should not forget the things that have gone right  and when we rejoice in the things that have gone right  we often underestimate the political and economic problems that lie ahead. We must avoid the trap of blaming the United Nations for our own sins and omissions. If we collectively are unable to revitalize the United Nations system  we shall have to resign ourselves to watching it wither away. That must not happen.101.	The year 1985  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  can be a turning-point in the life of the Organization. A broad coalition of ""friends of the United Nations"" must join forces to renew the effectiveness of global institutions. My Government will do its utmost  working with other States and with the Secretary-General  to make these institutions flourish. This is the fortieth birthday present our peoples deserve. Let us prove that life begins at forty.102.	Last week in Canada  Pope John Paul II called for ""a new vision of humanity"" to inspire nations and individuals in the pursuit of peace and well- being for all. He asked Canadians to do more. Let us all do more."
"26",1258,"CHL",39,1984,"ï»¿Sir  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your election as Vice-president of the General Assembly. Please convey to Mr. Lusaka our congratulations on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. We wish him every success.278.	I also wish to express our gratitude to the President of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for the outstanding way in which he guided the debates of that session.279.	I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary General for his tireless efforts and dedication m meeting the responsibilities of his important position.280.	On behalf of the Government and people of Chile  I cordially welcome Brunei Darussalam  a new Member State which recently joined the United Nations.281.	Thirty-nine years have passed since the San Francisco Conference and four decades since our representatives met at Bretton Woods. We note with sorrow that the great expectations which were born then are not reflected in today's world.282.	The crisis in multilateralism is evident in all the fields of action of the international system.283.	States entrust their security to the creation of steadily growing arsenals  together with their will to use them unilaterally instead of relying on the rule of law  which is suffering an alarming decline.284.	The institutions which emerged from Bretton Woods have been displaced by events and  in the most serious economic crisis to affect the world economy since 1930  unilateral decisions  of which protectionism is the most accentuated expression  are once again taking the place of cooperation and joint action.285.	The concepts of integration have vanished. International order appears to be in a precarious situation. A joint destiny appears not to exist for us. Peace has not established its authority in the world. We are moving towards the year 2000 in the midst of dangerous tendencies which point to chaos and anarchy in the international system  which we must avoid.286.	The long and distressing war between Iran and Iraq  the guilty silence in the face of the tragedy of the Afghan people  the justified desperation of the Palestinian people  the dangerous and unstable situation in the Middle East  and the economic crisis affecting the international community are only some of the manifestations of the deterioration of coexistence that we are witnessing today.287.	Compounding this state of affairs  which is serious enough in itself  is the incapacity of the United Nations to act and create a climate of minimum consensus suggesting some real and just solutions. All of us are responsible for this situation  some for excessive politicization in our debates and others for believing that  to resolve it  a solution must be sought outside the institutions we created precisely to deal with the type of difficulties we face today. Instead of seeking a solution to these mistaken tendencies  new steps are taken  actions which disregard all the accumulated experience of the existing organizations. These new measures prove to be failures within a short time since the root of the problem is the lack of political will to apply them. 288.	A dangerous feeling of disenchantment with the United Nations and discouragement because of the impotence of international organizations invade our peoples. They see no signs of definitive contributions to ensuring peace.289.	We must recognize the fact that there is a reason for this feeling of discouragement. Through our speeches  through our agreements and resolutions  we have been creating an imaginary world of solutions which have nothing to do with the torrent of actions which reality precipitates around us.290.	Peace is spoken of  but there is no action to bring it about; the law is mentioned as the basis for our coexistence  but it is not upheld in action; the principle of non-intervention is proclaimed  but in practice there is outright intervention; we mention the word progress  but we do not create international conditions conducive to attaining that goal; we emphasize international cooperation in words while we observe clear demonstrations of the fact that it is entering a twilight period.291.	In this general debate we have the obligation to reflect on this failure and to ask ourselves some questions. Are the principles of the Charter of the United Nations no longer applicable? Can we obtain peace without universal respect for them.292.	My Government is convinced that the problem lies not in the field of principles but in the political incapacity to give them meaning and in the poor use made of the possibilities which the United Nations system offers. The problem is the lack of political will and appropriate conduct to implement the possibilities offered us by the Charter.293.	I mentioned earlier that the deterioration of international cooperation was a symptom of the current situation  a grave process in the face of the accentuated turbulence observed in the world economy.294.	The 1980-1983 recession has been the most protracted and perhaps the most profound of the last 50 years. Trade and international finance have undergone tremendous pressures. Signs of recovery are now being noted in the economies of the industrial nations. However  the lack of international cooperation not merely hinders the extension of this recovery to the developing nations  but contributes to the persistence of the crisis among them with serious implications for their social and political stability.295.	This situation has particularly affected Latin America. The crisis in our region is to be seen in the contraction of productive capacity  in the deterioration of the terms of trade  in the enormous increase in unemployment  in the squandering of the region's economic potential  in the inflationary tendencies which have spread in some countries and in the net decline in the inflow of capital.296.	Nevertheless  the symptom and the cause which contributed to provoking the crisis are embodied in the overwhelming foreign debt affecting the greater part of the region.297.	The Latin American countries have made an enormous readjustment effort to overcome the crisis. They have assumed  at great sacrifice to their peoples  their responsibility to initiate a process of economic recovery. But external factors predominate in the crisis  imposing impossible constraints on their efforts to overcome the economic situation in which they find themselves. We are limited by factors that are beyond our control.298.	The high interest rates and the stiffening of the financial terms for credit have produced a substantial change in the nature of the debt previously contracted  resulting in a decapitalization process in Latin America which threatens our development and progress.299.	In order for Latin America to continue to honour its commitments it must  through international cooperation  find solutions that respect the interests of all and prevent the responsibility for solving the crisis from falling back solely upon the peoples of Latin America. In this regard  international trade represents an irreplaceable element. The reiterated manifestations of protectionism which have occurred in the industrial nations constitute a grave threat which not only conspires against the recovery of the international economy but also adversely affects harmony among peoples.300.	There is little room for optimism in view of these realities. The signs we perceive in the world panorama are rather pessimistic. However  we want to overcome this state of affairs. We trust that rationality will finally prevail for the good for all.301.	In addition  we believe that to surmount the present difficulties we must act with objectivity and draw inspiration from the great principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations  as noted by the Secretary General in his report on the work of the Organization.302.	In this hour of international uncertainty  my Government reiterates its unreserved support for these fundamental principles and calls upon all to join in defining the routes which could bring us closer to a renewed role for multilateral diplomacy and for the United Nations. In this regard  I wish to express my country's support for some measures which I consider are inspired by the principles contained in the Charter  such as the continuing activities of the Secretary General on behalf of peace and  more particularly  his action with regard to the conflicts affecting the Persian Gulf  the Middle East  Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea. These are activities which my country considers of outstanding importance and which it supports.303.	In this connection  my country wishes to refer to some aspects of the international panorama which cause concern to the international community and are of particular concern to Chile.304.	As an active and longstanding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  we see with some uneasiness the perpetuation a situation which the entire international community  without exception  has condemned. Again we associate ourselves with those who call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).305.	In the Middle East  it is essential to promote realistic initiatives for peace. In order to create an atmosphere conducive to a resolution of the problem  it is necessary to take a realistic and moderate approach  discarding heightened rhetoric. Chile maintains that it is essential to recognize the right of all States in the region to exist within secure and recognized borders; it is essential to make the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination effective  including the right to establish a State  and  in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  it is essential to ensure that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories. 306.	The conflict afflicting the Middle East is of special concern and grief to my country. The friendly relations existing between my Government and the States of that region are not the only link that keeps us close. We are also bound  with a special feeling of affection  to the numerous children of the Jewish and Arab peoples who  having established themselves in my country  have come to form part of Chilean society and have enriched it with their culture  traditions and enthusiastic contribution to the nation's development.307.	The cases of Afghanistan and Kampuchea constitute painful examples of the arbitrary use of force and failure to recognize the political independence of those two nations. We join in the international community's condemnation of the violation of the essential rights of those peoples and the resulting mockery of express provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. The violations are all the more serious in that attempt are being made to transform them into	and irreversible situations.308.	Those of us who firmly believe in the freedom of man  in respect for the sovereignty of nations and in independence  equality and the self-determination of peoples have the duty to denounce the persistent violation of those rights with a firmness arising from a conviction of their inherent validity and to condemn the flagrant aggression to which those peoples have been subjected"" We must unite our efforts to prevent an unacceptable increase of these imperialistic actions. Chile reiterates once again its unlimited support for those nations in their effort to establish full sovereignty and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces.309.	Central America is another region where the principle of non-intervention is openly breached. We are witnesses to a drama which feels to us as if it were our own  since it involves sister nations with which Chile is proud to have had a long tradition of friendship. We deplore the fact that that noble principle of the Charter is ignored by those who support actions and ideologies which an extra continental Power is seeking to introduce into our hemisphere against the wishes of the inhabitants. For that reason we have expressed our determined support for the efforts of the Contadora Group  an initiative which we are certain will find the formula for preserving the values of peace  freedom and human dignity for the region.310.	The peaceful settlement of disputes is another basic principle. Justice and law are the only means available to the international community for adopting just  equitable and honourable solutions for the parties involved when international conflicts arise. It is in that sense that we look forward to the success of the negotiating effort entrusted to the Secretary General in regard to the South Atlantic conflict between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom.311.	Also in connection with our concern for peace  we wish to create with our neighbour and sister republic  Argentina  all the conditions that will permit us to live in peace  while developing and expanding our respective potentials. Impelled by Chile's traditional devotion to law and justice  we had recourse to the mediation of Pope John Paul II to obtain a final solution to our southern dispute. With the aid of the Holy Father  we have made important progress towards the happy termination of those differences. I am confident that the historical imperative of peace  something never refuted by the facts  will once again prevail among us. The people and the Governments of Chile and Argentina share this sentiment of brotherhood very profoundly. At the current concluding stage of papal mediation  it is now for us to develop and safeguard this general pacifist conviction  which is so deeply rooted on both sides of the Andes and which is the fruit of a glorious shared history. Two neighbouring nations  possessing one of the longest frontiers in the world  have not had a war in 170 years. Is this not a living example of the fact that peace is a matter of political will and historical responsibility.312.	If we wish the actions of the United Nations to be of assistance in strengthening universal peace  we must concern ourselves with guaranteeing within the Organization the full applicability of the principle of universality. Therefore  in conformity with the Charter  we believe that all countries that wish to participate in the General Assembly should be able to do so. We hope that in the near future both Koreas will be present in this Hall as full Members. We also champion a dialogue between those nations  free from foreign intervention  that will permit resolution of the difficult situation in the Korean peninsula  thus contributing to peace in the region.313.	Chile  an Antarctic country  exercises sovereignty over part of that territory by virtue of legal and historical titles  geographical proximity and the longstanding presence and activities of its people. We view with special concern diverse measures tending to weaken the Antarctic Treaty. This instrument has proved in the course of its implementation to be one of the most effective multilateral agreements ever reached. The Treaty and the system it generated have made possible the maintenance of that continent as the only one that is free of nuclear arms and where peace  ecological purity and scientific cooperation among different countries can prevail.314.	Initiatives which could lead to the dismantling of the Antarctic system would constitute a disastrous precedent for the United Nations  one which would open the doors to penetration of the region by ideological  political  economic and military disputes which now cast so many shadows over the future of mankind. My Government is convinced that the Antarctic Treaty itself and its complementary conventions possess sufficient amplitude  flexibility and openness to allow for adequate improvement of its performance.315.	Everything relating to nuclear weapons and tests is of serious concern to my country. We belong to a region which has lived free from the scourge of atomic weapons and the danger of nuclear stockpiles. We wish to maintain this situation  which is in keeping with our peaceful objectives and which serves to obviate the need for tests of that kind. For that reason we reiterate here the declarations we made in February and March of 1984  together with Colombia  Ecuador and Peru  member countries with Chile of the South Pacific Permanent Commission.316.	Turning to other matters  my country attaches equally outstanding importance to the treatment of terrorism  a scourge of this era  which gravely endangers the lives and security of individuals  reaping a growing toll of innocent victims  flagrantly violating the most fundamental human rights and threatening the internal peace of States. It is the inescapable duty of the Members of the United Nations to lend their firmest support to all internationally agreed measures which seek effectively to counteract this despicable and criminal method of warfare and to prevent the propagation or facilitation  from within their own borders  of terrorist activities in other regions. Those who commit or support the commission of such criminal acts deserve exemplary punishment. We believe that international condemnation of terrorism must be absolute and punishment universal. Equivocal positions support and stimulate violence. Terrorism is terrorism; there is no distinction and there are no extenuating circumstances. It is a criminal and mad device that makes use of the lowest instincts of man.317.	In this regard I cannot fail to mention the despicable crime against humanity committed at the United States Embassy in Beirut.318.	We reiterate that each country has the sovereign right to enact the legislation it deems most suitable for protecting its people against this threat. At the same time  we maintain that the community of States has the right and the duty to promulgate international norms to facilitate the eradication of this scourge and the punishment of the guilty.319.	Having reviewed the principles which inspire and shape Chile's activities in the international Held as well as the problems of the world community and of our region which are of particular concern to us  I should like to say a few words about the constitutional situation in my country.320.	The Chilean Government is committed to a clear and definitive process of democratic consolidation. The different steps to be taken are provided for in the existing political Constitution  which was approved by a great majority of the Chilean people and came into effect on 11 March 1981. Our goal could be no other  because devotion to the rule of law and to democracy constitute an essential ingredient in the character of Chile and the Chilean tradition. That democratic system of government  which we must endeavour to improve and strengthen in the light of the needs and threats of the modem world  is firmly rooted in the soul of all Chileansâour armed forces  our workers and intellectuals  and the young people who will constitute the nation of tomorrow.321.	We are constantly receiving messages expressing anxiety for Chile to accelerate its process of institutional evolution. Those who offer us such counsel forget that Chilean democracy  a model in America  was destroyed by totalitarian forces which took advantage of precisely those characteristics which are today debilitating the Western world. Experience has demonstrated to us how defenceless democracy can be if those who do not believe in it and are prepared to undermine it by their every action are permitted to operate freely from within.322.	We do not want this to occur again. That is why we are taking a gradual  firm and sure path in a process which we consider the most suitable for the consolidation of a democracy properly  protected from those disruptive agents which acted in the past. We do not wish to repeat the experiences of other countries which in their haste failed to ensure solid foundations for the system they desired and ended up with an ephemeral dream. That is not the fate we wish for our country. The Chilean approach has been determined by the Chilean people and therefore constitutes the only prerequisite which the Government has to fulfil in order to attain solid and permanent results.323.	Clear manifestations of our progress are the press freedom that exists in the country  the organization of labour and its active participation in national affairs and the forthcoming promulgation of political laws which will consolidate this process.324.	On behalf of the Government and people of Chile  I ask this world Assembly for the respect merited by the process which our people  pursuant to their sovereign right  freely chose to adopt in order to establish a renewed  modern democracy  a democracy which is not an empty word but a real element in the preservation of our national identity  thus contributing to international peace and security."
"27",1304,"CHN",39,1984,"ï»¿72. First of all  please allow me  Sir  on behalf of the Chinese delegation  warmly to congratulate you  the outstanding representative of Zambia  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I believe that the current session will fulfil its mission successfully under your presidency. I also wish to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for his contribution to the thirty-eighth session. At the same time  I should like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to China's close neighbour  Brunei Darussalam  on its admission to membership in the United Nations.73.	As representatives of the Governments of various countries of the world  we meet here every year to hold extensive exchanges of views on the international situation and to explore ways to maintain world peace  ensure international security and promote human welfare. This fact itself testifies to the importance of the United Nations and its historic mission.74.	Reviewing international developments over the past year  people cannot but feel worried. With the suspension of their disarmament negotiations  the two nuclear superpowers have stepped up their deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe and adopted confrontation measures  thus further escalating their nuclear arms race. This poses a new threat to all European countries and deeply disturbs all countries in the world. Over the past year  while the two wars of aggression in Asia went on unchecked  a new armed invasion occurred in Central America. The Middle East is still fraught with crises  and the flames of war in the Gulf region are spreading  causing widespread concern. Basically  the tension and sharp contradiction in southern Africa are not yet relaxed.75.	Meanwhile  the serious economic difficulties of many developing countries show clearly that the global North South contradiction is sharpening and the gap between the rich and the poor widening. Therefore  I think no one will deny that peace and development  generally speaking  remain the two fundamental questions bearing upon the interests of all the peoples in the world today. I should like to take this opportunity to offer some observations on the two questions on behalf of the Chinese Government.76.	At present  what concerns and disturbs people most is the threat of a nuclear war. Despite innumerable rounds of talks on nuclear disarmament and a variety of proposals to this end  nuclear weapons have continued to increase and nuclear stockpiles have reached extremely dangerous proportions. As is universally recognized  the two superpowers ought to bear the main responsibility on this question. It is they that possess over 95 per cent of the world's total nuclear weaponry  and it is they alone that are in a position to fight a nuclear war. Should they choose to use only a small portion of their nuclear arsenals  not only would the people of these two nuclear Powers suffer  but the people of the whole world would be plunged into an unprecedented holocaust. For this reason  the numerous small and medium sized countries and people throughout the world are fully justified in demanding that they immediately halt their nuclear arms race and take the lead in drastically cutting back their nuclear weaponry.77.	The arms race between the two nuclear Powers is extending to outer space. Both sides are stepping up the development of antiballistic missile weapon systems so as to reinforce their strategic offensive capabilities through improved strategic defensive means. Recently they have made some gestures on the question of outer space weapons  each mounting negotiation offensives against the other. However  as people can see  negotiations have not really started and yet each of the superpowers is busy shifting the responsibility for obstructing and sabotaging the talks on to the other. This cannot but arouse suspicion. Do they really intend to hold talks or just to use them to cover up their arms race in outer space?78.	As the arms race between the two nuclear Powers escalates  the danger of a nuclear war will increase with each passing day. Though already possessing an oversaturation and overkill nuclear capacity  each of the superpowers is doing its utmost to gain supremacy over the other on the pretext of maintaining parity and equal security  lest the other side should surpass it in terms of quantity and quality of nuclear weapons. This practice of progressive escalation of nuclear armaments cannot but arouse doubts as to whether or not they truly have a sincere desire for disarmament. What the people of the world want is genuine and effective disarmament to ensure that people can live in peace and security.79.	The Chinese Government and people always stand for nuclear disarmament. We hold that efforts should be made to promote progress in conventional as well as nuclear disarmament. The small quantity of nuclear weapons China possesses is solely for the purpose of self-defence. We have solemnly declared time and again that at no time and in no circumstances will China be the first to use nuclear weapons and that it unconditionally undertakes not to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear States and regions. China has never participated in the nuclear arms race  nor does it intend to participate in that race or to shirk its responsibility in regard to nuclear disarmament.80.	China's position on nuclear disarmament can be summed up in the following three basic points. First  our fundamental position is the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all nuclear weapons. Secondly  as a practical step towards nuclear disarmament  we propose that  after the Soviet Union and the United States have taken the lead in putting an end to testing  improving and manufacturing nuclear weapons and have agreed on substantially reducing their nuclear arsenals  a broadly representative international conference should be convened with the participation of all nuclear States to work out together concrete measures for further nuclear disarmament. Thirdly  before all this materializes  for the sake of reducing the threat of nuclear war and showing good faith in nuclear disarmament  all nuclear States should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and unconditionally pledge not to use  or threaten to use  nuclear weapons against nonnuclear States and nuclear free zones and should reach agreement on mutual non-use of nuclear weapons.81.	We support the just demand of the people of the world for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the prevention of a nuclear war  and we appreciate all reasonable proposals conducive to nuclear disarmament and the maintenance of world peace. To promote progress in nuclear disarmament  we are ready to exchange views  within the United Nations or in other forums  on such issues as the prevention of nuclear war  the cessation of the nuclear arms race  and nuclear disarmament  provided all the other nuclear States agree to do so.82.	As things now stand  we cannot but emphasize that it is of great urgency to demand that the two nuclear Powers stop their nuclear arms race  halt the deployment of new intermediate range missiles  resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament and reduce and destroy those nuclear missiles already deployed in Europe  Asia and elsewhere  and immediately stop extending their arms race to outer space. We stand for the early conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the arms race in outer space and a ban on research  testing  development  manufacture  deployment and use of all weapons designed for outer space warfare  as well as destruction of all the existing outer space weapon systems. AH this is highly necessary for demilitarizing outer space and ensuring the peaceful use of outer space by mankind.83.	China has always opposed the development  production and use of all biological weapons detrimental to mankind. The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress has already adopted  on 20 September 1984  the decision on China's accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. From now on  China will join other countries to combat all acts that violate this Convention and to work hard for its further improvement so as to advance the whole process of disarmament.84.	A major cause of the turbulence and tension in the world today is the commission in international relations of such acts as infringement of the sovereignty of other countries  invasion and occupation of their territories  interference in their internal affairs and the use of force against them in violation of the basic principle of the sovereign equality of all States as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.85.	We are of the view that all nations  big or small  strong or weak  rich or poor  should be treated as equals and that they should respect one another  live in harmony and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. The affairs of a country should be determined by the people of that country themselves. External interference of all kinds is illegal and impermissible.86.	In pursuing their foreign policies  all countries should observe the norms guiding international relations and abide by the Charter. However  the superpowers  on the strength of their size and power  often try to impose their own will on others  thinking they may do whatever they please. Instead of respecting the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of other countries  they have pursued hegemonism and power politics and even carried out armed aggression against weak and small countries. With their support  certain regional hegemonists do not scruple to play the tyrant and have tried to annex territories of their neighbours by force. At this important rostrum of the General Assembly we have condemned more than once the big and small hegemonist Powers for their acts of aggression in violation of the Charter and in breach of international security. Today we once again strongly condemn these acts. People throughout the world will go on denouncing the hegemonists  with full justice  so long as they persist in such acts of aggression.87.	At present there exist many ""hot spots"" in the world. Some areas may become ""hot spots"" tomorrow. Kampuchea is still being trampled upon. The war of aggression against Afghanistan is being intensified and expanded. The situation in the Middle East and Central America remains complex  tense and volatile. In southern Africa  the racists and colonialists are obstructing national independence and threatening the security of neighbouring countries. Some of these ""hot spots"" have resulted from direct aggression by the superpowers; others have turned into international crises because of their meddling  intervention or behind the scenes support and manipulation. To cool down the ""hot spots""  relax tensions and resolve contradictions  the prerequisite is to stop interference  control and infiltration by the superpowers and their followers so that the parties concerned in each country or region may seek reasonable solutions to their respective internal problems through peaceful negotiations.88.	As an old Chinese saying goes  ""Common fear leads to unity; common greed leads to rivalry."" This is how the world situation stands today. On the one hand  the two superpowers are in rivalry for world hegemony; and on the other  the large numbers of small and medium sized countries are steadily strengthening their unity and supporting one another in the struggle against hegemonism. It is our belief that  in the face of unjust action where the strong bullies the weak and the big oppresses the small  the international community has the responsibility and obligation to speak out for justice and struggle against such acts in order to uphold the norms governing international relations and the principles of the Charter. Far from helping world peace and stability  tolerance towards aggressors will only inflate their arrogance.89.	The struggles of the world's people against hegemonism  imperialism  colonialism and racism are all just struggles  to which the Chinese Government and people will  as always  give firm support.90.	We support the position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in favour of the holding of tripartite talks  the easing of tension in the Korean Peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  and calling for the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea.91.	We support the people of Afghanistan in their heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and resist foreign aggression. We oppose the efforts of the Soviet Union to intensify its aggression against and devastation of Afghanistan  and we demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.92.	We have always stood by the Arab people and supported their just struggle against Israeli aggression and expansion and the just struggle of the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights; and we demand Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and from all the other Arab territories it has occupied since 1967.93.	We support the just struggle of the people of Namibia for national independence and that of the people of South Africa against apartheid and racial discrimination  and we demand the withdrawal of the troops of South Africa from Namibia and the cessation of military threats to the neighbouring countries.94.	We support the Latin American people and the Contadora Group in their endeavour for peace and stability in Central America and demand that the outside forces stop their acts of military intervention and infiltration in this region.95.	Here I would like  in particular  to say a few words about the question of Kampuchea. Almost six years have passed since Viet Nam invaded and occupied the independent and sovereign State of Democratic Kampuchea by armed force. Viet Nam refuses to give up its wild ambition of annexing Kampuchea despite repeated setbacks on the battlefield in its successive ""dry season offensives"". It has time and again played the trick of the so-called partial withdrawal in an attempt to cover up its refusal to withdraw its troops. Its demand to make its troop withdrawal conditional upon the exclusion of one of the patriotic resistance forces of Kampuchea has revealed all the more clearly that to this day it lacks the sincere desire to solve the Kampuchean question.96.	We hope to see a fair and reasonable solution to the question of Kampuchea at an early date. But a political settlement of this question must be predicated on the withdrawal of all the Vietnamese aggressor troops from Kampuchea. In our view  whether one firmly opposes aggression by Viet Nam and demands the withdrawal of its troops is a fundamental test as to whether one gives resolute support to the just struggles of people subjected to aggression  safeguards the independence of sovereign States  works for the maintenance of world peace and security and upholds the basic norms of international relations. We support the legitimate status and authority of the tripartite Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We believe that  after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops  the various Kampuchean political forces will become united on a broad basis and that the Kampuchean people will be able to decide their own future through a United Nations supervised general election  free from outside aggression and interference. We hope to see Kampuchea become an independent  peaceful  neutral and nonaligned State.97.	The Chinese Government pursues an independent foreign policy  firmly opposes hegemonism and resolutely stands by all peoples who are subjected to oppression and aggression. China will never attach itself to any big Power or group of Powers  nor yield to any outside pressure. We support the Movement of Non Aligned Countries and will not enter into alliance with any big Power. We do not practise the so-called equidistant diplomacy  or play cards or ally ourselves with one big Power against the other. In our external relations we have always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated jointly by China  India and Burma 30 years ago. They are: ""mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual nonaggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence"". In accordance with these principles  China has improved relations with neighbouring countries  concluded a number of boundary treaties and treaties of peace  friendship and cooperation  and developed friendly relations with many countries in Asia  Africa  Latin America  Europe  North America and Oceania. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have long been written into China's Constitution and are the basic norms China follows in handling its relations with all countries.98.	We want to live in peace and to develop normal relations with all countries. Even though some countries have differences of one kind or another with us for this or that reason  we are ready to seek a settlement of the differences in a spirit of mutual understanding and consultation so that our relations with them may gradually improve.99.	Over the past three decades  the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have stood the test of international vicissitudes and have shown great vitality. Experience shows that they are the basic norms governing relations between States and that they constitute an important weapon against hegemonist interference and aggression. In line with the trend of history and in response to the call of our time  they reflect the aspirations and interests of the people of all countries and have thus won their appreciation and support. Whether relations between countries are good or bad depends on whether or not those countries adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. If those Principles are adhered to  countries with different social systems can live in amity and engage in friendly cooperation. But if they are not adhered to  even countries with similar social systems may fall out and enter into confrontation or even conflict. We stress the importance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence here because they are in accord with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. So long as all countries strictly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in their mutual relationsâwhether between big Powers  or between big and small countries  or between small countriesâit will not be difficult to have international tensions relaxed  and world peace will surely be preserved.100.	The peace and stability of the world depend on the sustained growth of national and international economies. The development of the third world has become one of the biggest challenges mankind faces today.101.	This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  which were adopted by the General Assembly on 1 May 1974  at its sixth special session. At that session 10 years ago [2209th meeting]  Deng Xiaoping  Chairman of the Chinese delegation  pledged China's support for the just position of the third world countries calling for the restructuring of the inequitable and irrational international economic order. Despite the persistent efforts made by the developing countries to remove external constraints imposed on their economic development and improve North South relations  the actual results are far from satisfactory. Up to now  global negotiations have not been launched  and the immediate measures for solving the current urgent problems affecting the developing countries have failed to materialize. That this is still a far cry from the objectives set forth in the Declaration and the Programme of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly is the result of international obstacles from certain quarters.102.	At present  economic recovery in the West is still very unsteady  and the economic prospects in developing countries remain grim. These countries are faced with such difficulties as economic stagnation  lack of funds  export restrictions and a heavy debt burden. Their development is being seriously hindered.103.	The grave difficulties of the least developed countries  particularly the desperate plight of many such countries in Africa  ought to receive close attention and deep sympathy from the whole world. In the areas south of the Sahara  more than 100 million people are plagued by famine  with vast numbers of women and children on the verge of death  as a result of long years of economic stagnation and a drop in per capita income for years running  coupled with the threat of continued drought and reduction of grain output. It is urgent that the international community take concerted action in response to their appeal for help in coping with the difficulties. All developed countries have the obligation to give them adequate aid of all kinds and to help them to overcome their economic difficulties and alleviate the people's sufferings.104.	The grave debt problem is an urgent issue facing developing countries  Latin American countries in particular. The total volume of external debt incurred by the third world as a whole has reached a staggering figure. Recently  the continued rise in the interest rates of United States banks has further increased the burden on debtor countries. In our view  settlement of the debt problem is a responsibility which the creditor countries  commercial banks and international financial agencies should shoulder together with the debtor countries. The principle for settling this problem should be the promotion of debt service through development. The debtor countries should be asked to adopt readjustment policies aimed at promoting their economic growth  and not to impose a recessionist policy. The creditor countries should take such measures as lowering high interest rates  improving terms of payment  reducing trade restrictions  increasing governmental development aid and providing adequate credits and loans so as to reduce the burden of the debtor countries. We appreciate and support the reasonable proposals put forward by debtor countries for settling the debt problem  and the responsible attitude they adopt. We hope that  through their own sustained efforts and with the attention and help of the international community  the debtor countries will be able gradually to extricate themselves from their difficult position so that the current debt crisis may be eased and overcome.105.	Protectionism is another urgent problem that affects the economic growth of the developing countries. We have noted with concern that  with the gradual recovery of the economies of developed countries  protectionism is on the rise rather than on the decline. This has become a major obstacle to the economic recovery and development of the developing countries. We call on the major developed countries immediately to adopt effective measures to honour their promises made at various international forums and to halt and reverse the trend of increased protectionism against the developing countries so that the latter may increase their export earnings and create conditions for the expansion of their imports and the growth of their economies.106.	The world economy is an integral whole. Its stability and growth cannot be based on the affluence of the few and the impoverishment of the many. Without the economic growth of the developing countries  it will be difficult for the developed countries to achieve sustained economic recovery and expansion. The truth is quite obvious and has come to be appreciated and supported by more and more persons with breadth of vision in the West. It is regrettable that some major developed countries have thus far failed to consider in earnest the practical difficulties and urgent demands of the numerous developing countries. These developed countries have remained indifferent to the North South dialogue and global negotiations and have opposed a restructuring of the old international economic order. Theirs is a short-sighted policy.107.	The Group of 77 has already put forward a series of practical proposals that have taken into consideration the interests of all countries concerned. In order to remove the obstacles in the way of launching global negotiations  they have time and again made major efforts and proposed that the global negotiations be carried out in two phases. The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  adopted by the General Assembly in 1980 also gives expression to the common desire of the international community to establish the new international economic order and to revitalize the world economy.108.	The midterm review and appraisal of the implementation of the Strategy should mainly be aimed at ensuring the full implementation of the series of policy measures set forth in the Strategy. The developing countries have proposed the convening of another international conference on money and finance with the object of promoting development. We hope that all countries concerned will strive to create conditions for the early convocation of that conference. It has been our consistent view that the solution of the immediate problems facing the developing countries should be closely linked with the effort to achieve the long-term objective of establishing the new international economic order. We support all proposals that proceed from the overall interests of the world economy and that help to improve North South relations and promote development in the third world. We are ready to join the other developing countries in making unremitting efforts to establish the new international economic order.109.	There is great potential for increased cooperation among third world countries with their vast territories and rich resources. While North South negotiations are at a stalemate  South South cooperation among developing countries is making further progress. South South cooperation is not only an effective way for the developing countries to strengthen collective self-reliance in overcoming difficulties and developing their economies  but also an important impetus to the North South dialogue and a booster to their negotiating positions. The Chinese Government is ready to play its part in promoting South South cooperation in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit  stress on practical results  diversity in form and common progress.110.	Peace and development are two major issues in the world today. They also constitute the primary objectives of China's domestic and foreign policies. The Chinese people are now engaged in a large-scale socialist modernization drive. Their goal can be attained only through long years of efforts in a peaceful international environment.111.	This year marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We have scored great achievements in these 35 years  particularly in the years since 1979  which have witnessed the sustained growth and coordinated development of China's economy. True  we made detours and paid our price  but we gained experience as well. It is our basic experience that economic development must be based on the actual conditions of one's own country: there is no readymade model to copy and one has to blaze one's own trail. A period of 35 years is far too short for us to turn China  with its large population and vast territory  into a modernized  prosperous and strong socialist country. Thirty five years are not enough  not even another 35 years. China will continue unswervingly to pursue its foreign policy of peace and will make every possible endeavour for the maintenance of world peace.112.	Based on the idea of ""one country  two systems""  the Chinese Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and establish a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. That is to say  in view of the history of Hong Kong and its realities  a special administrative region where the capitalist system will remain unchanged for 50 years is to be established in a socialist country. This idea  based as it is on China's actual conditions  conforms to a common aspiration and the interests of the 1 billion Chinese people  including our compatriots in Hong Kong. Thanks to their joint efforts  the Chinese and British Governments have reached and initialled an agreement on the question of Hong Kong. The settlement of this question will contribute significantly to the lofty cause of the reunification of our great motherland and to stability and peace in Asia.113.	China's foreign policy remains firm and consistent  as it is based on the fundamental interests of the people of China and of the rest of the world. We support the people of all countries in their struggle to safeguard sovereignty and independence and develop their national economy and in their struggle against the arms race and the threat of war and hegemonism and in defence of world peace. China wishes to live in peace and develop normal relations with all other countries in the world  including the United States and the Soviet Union. China stands for the easing of world tensions and the settlement of all international disputes through peaceful consultations and earnest negotiations. China also hopes to see the two superpowers  the United States and the Soviet Union  end their nuclear arms race and global rivalry and improve their bilateral relations in the interest of world peace and international security.114.	Only with peace can there be development. Without development  there can be no stability; and without stability  peace is out of the question. Peace and development are inseparable. They are the two major objectives which the world's people have most at heart and to which the United Nations is committed. We must march towards these two major objectives  however numerous the difficulties and obstacles may be. We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of the people all over the world these objectives can definitely be attained.115.	It is nearly 40 years since the founding of the United Nations  which  having traversed a path by no means smooth and uneventful  today shoulders an even heavier responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and international security. We appreciate and support the Secretary Generalâs statement in his report on the work of the Organization expressing the desire and demand to make the United Nations work better. As one of the founders of the United Nations and one of the permanent members of the Security Council  China is determined to make the greatest endeavour possible  together with other countries  to uphold the Charter and strengthen the role of the United Nations."
"28",1384,"CMR",39,1984,"ï»¿At such a critical crossroads in history  when international peace and security are threatened by illusions created by advancements in science and technology  when preoccupation with conflict among the powerful nations of the world creates a leadership vacuum in the international community  the- well-deserved election of a son of Africa to the presidency of the General Assembly is singularly important. There are signs that from Africa  the cradle of creation  a peace- sustaining wisdom may light the darkness of misunderstanding  of belligerency and of underdevelopment.65.	Mr. President  you have been a source of pride for Africa as a result of your activities in the United Nations. Your election is also a tribute to your great nation  Zambia  and its noble leader  President Kenneth Kaunda  whose dedication to productive humanism brings distinction to our continent and to contemporary thinking. In sharing this great moment of opportunity  the Cameroon delegation extends fraternal wishes for your success in providing inspired leadership in the months ahead.66.	We also share the sentiments of gratitude and the felicitations expressed to your illustrious predecessor in office  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama. By bearing with such distinction the dual burden of President of the General Assembly and President of his nation  he demonstrated the traditional Latin capacity for dedication at its qualitative best.67.	Permit me to pay a tribute also to the Secretary- General  whose person and office symbolize the lofty ideals that launched the Charter of the United Nations. In spite of the grave odds he must face in trying to promote the harmonization of the actions of States for peace  we would encourage him never to be frustrated in that noble cause. We feel sure that it will inspire him to know that there are many nations  including Cameroon  which seek to provide sustenance for the quest for lasting peace as a matter of national policy.68.	The Cameroon delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to welcome Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations. 69.	It is a matter of grave concern that we have today arrived at the point where the very raison d'etre of the United Nations is continually being called into question by the incessant arms race in all its various aspects  which constitutes the most pernicious factor of instability and global insecurity but to which  unfortunately  the international community seems to have become accustomed. As a result  our generation is living through the most highly militarized period in time of peace in the history of mankind. Paradoxically  this growing militarization in no way helps strengthen world security and stability; on the contrary  it constitutes a major factor of destabilization in contemporary international relations.70.	It is encouraging additional military expenditures  increasing suspicion and mistrust between States  stimulating war preparations  exacerbating political tensions and endangering social and economic structures that are already highly precarious  in particular those of the developing countries.71.	As we hold this session the international situation continues to be marked by violence or the threat of violence  and the storm-clouds of a nuclear holocaust constantly hover over us because of the qualitative and quantitative proliferation of nuclear weapons. This alarming situation  added to the absence of progress in disarmament efforts and the limitation of arms  is casting considerable doubt on the deliberations of the Assembly.72.	The United Nations was  I have no need to remind the Assembly  created following the massive destruction caused by the Second World War  with the primary objective to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Those who drafted the Charter of the United Nations  witnesses of the agony of the world as a result of that tragic conflict  clearly understood that  without peace and security  no constructive activity was possible in any field.73.	In other words  disarmament is the essential path we must take in order to attain the primary objective of the United Nations  the maintenance of international peace and security; it is therefore easy to understand why  ever since its founding  the Organization has devoted particular attention to this goal. In so doing  it has always provided a forum for deliberations and negotiations  as well as a focal point for proposals  recommendations and other initiatives by the international community  aimed at contributing to disarmament and awakening public opinion in a greater number of Member States and in the world in general to the dangers of the arms race and the benefits of disarmament.74.	In the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was adopted at the first special session devoted to disarmament  in 1978  and confirmed in 1982  at the second special session devoted to disarmament  the General Assembly stressed the central role and primary responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. Such initiatives served to enhance the authority of the Organization even further and to expand the range of multilateral activities related to disarmament.75.	Notwithstanding their scope  such actionsâand this includes the series of partial agreements on disarmament that have already been concludedâ represent no more than a few very limited first steps. In fact  they have neither done away with the arms race nor reduced the military capabilities and potential of States. On the contrary  that race has been stepped up to a dangerous degree and is now being extended to space itself. States have continued to stockpile weapons of increasing deadliness and to carry out military research to produce even more sophisticated weapons  to the point that nuclear weapons now represent the most serious peril facing mankind. All this means that genuine efforts must be made to reverse and halt the present trend in the arms race.76.	Unfortunately  neither in the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva  which embraces 40 nations  or in bilateral negotiations in the East-West context has any noteworthy result emerged to give promise of a better future. The arms race is worsening  threatening the security of States and hindering social and economic development  particularly that of small and medium-sized States. Never has the need for disarmament been so acutely felt; never has effective disarmament been so remote. In spite of the sustained efforts of the international community  progress in the disarmament field has for years been extremely limited  and we now seem actually to be sliding towards the abyss without any glimmer of hope that the situation can be resolved.77.	It is impossible to overemphasize that disarmament is an essential element of any arrangement for true world security.78.	We therefore think that the celebration next year of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  four decades after the end of the Second World War  should provide a good opportunity to undertake an exhaustive examination of the Organization's role in disarmament. Such an analysis would make it possible to identify new ways and means of strengthening the central role and responsibility of the United Nations in disarmament and of promoting substantial progress in this field. We propose  therefore  that at this session the General Assembly call upon one of its competent subsidiary organs to examine the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament and to submit a report on this subject at the fortieth session  next year.79.	This proposal reflects our profound conviction that  in a world that is today threatened with a nuclear holocaust  the United Nations alone constitutes the ideal framework for global negotiations in the interest of our collective security. For the small countries in particular  the Organization represents a genuine ray of hope.80.	Throughout the world  agriculture  animal husbandry  education  health and so on are in tremendous need  while at the same time countries are spending vast sums on armaments. I am thinking not only of the economically and militarily powerful countries  but also of small countries that are forced to purchase armaments for their own security  to protect the integrity of their territory and to stand firm against all kinds of destabilizing factors. In so doing  they are forced to divert their attention from productive goals.81.	In Africa  urgent measures are needed to eliminate the growing threat posed by the South African apartheid regime not only to the region but to international peace and security as well. We note with concern the facts set forth in the report on South Africa's nuclear capability  which again confirm South Africa's ability to manufacture nuclear weapons and its determination to increase that capability despite the solemn Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  adopted in 1964 by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  and the repeated demands of the General Assembly that South Africa refrain from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons. We would like here to express our appreciation to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research  the Department of Political and Security Council Affairs  the Department for Disarmament Affairs and the OAU for the quality of that report. We would also like to express our appreciation to the IAEA for the recent intensification of its efforts to determine the implications of the development of South Africa's nuclear capability. That is a very urgent problem that could  if not solved  dangerously undermine the steps now under way in favour of nuclear non-proliferation and could fuel the arms race in Africa.82.	We appeal  therefore  to all countries  and in particular to the nuclear Powers  as well as to the United Nations and the IAEA  to co-operate with the OAU in combating nuclear proliferation in South Africa.83.	At this moment of grave international concern  there is no need to stress the importance of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. That Declaration testifies to Africa's firm determination to protect world peace through disarmamentâfirst and foremost  nuclear disarmament. We therefore support the recommendations of the National Seminar on Peace and Disarmament  held at Lome from 6 to 9 August 1984  which include the establishment of a regional institute for research on peace and disarmament and the convening in 1985 of a regional seminar on peace and disarmament  with the participation of the States of Central and West Africa.84.	We believe that all these initiatives can help to arouse and focus public interest in our region on the dangers of the arms race and  at the same time  serve to promote efforts to strengthen security and development at the sub regional level.85.	We are convinced that disarmament should be at the epicentre of any collective effort aimed at promoting security and development. In order to achieve that goal  we must have a comprehensive strategy bringing together at one and the same time a commitment on the part of the international community to attack the problem of the arms race at its roots by combating fear  suspicion  distrust  oppression  racism  colonialism  inequality  injustice  hunger  ignorance and disease; by strict respect for the non- use of force in international relations; by the establishment of a system of collective security based on the Charter of the United Nations; and by the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of all military arsenals to the strict minimum necessary for the maintenance of internal order and the protection of territorial integrity. In this connection  the nuclear Powers should formally and unconditionally undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against countries that do not possess them. We therefore support the conclusion of a formal international legal instrument on this subject  as advocated by the non-aligned countries.86.	At the same time  the great Powers that bear particular responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security must renounce escalation  the race for supremacy  hegemonist ambitions and the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. It is also imperative that they resume dialogue  both bilaterally and within the framework of the United Nations  with a view to bringing about the quantitative and qualitative limitation of their nuclear weapons with the final goal of general and complete disarmament. All States must abide by the purposes  principles and provisions of the Charter.87.	The characteristic of our age is clearly the increase of tension in international relations. Without risk of error  I think we can say that everyone is aware that the present world crisis is due to the policies of expansion and force practised by blocs and that this crisis calls for determined  global and  above all  urgent action to eliminate the risks of violence and to bring about a negotiated settlement of major international issues.88.	We have here a crisis of detente. This is accompanied by the intensification of confrontation in the old hotbeds of crisis and the expansion of tension to all parts of the world  which entails the emergence of new hotbeds of conflict. Moreover  the deepening of the world economic crisis and the persistence of injustices which are prejudicial to economic relations among nations are exacerbating the already grave difficulties affecting the developing countries. The security and independence of many States have been threatened by interference in their internal affairs  military intervention and attempts to impose different social systems.89.	In the face of these dangers besetting the world  there is a need to bring about global solutions  while taking action  as a matter of urgency  to halt the arms race  to put a brake on the use of force  to prevent intervention and interference in the internal and external affairs of sovereign States  and to co-ordinate efforts to free peoples from colonial oppression and foreign domination.90.	Thus  in Namibia it has become quite clear that one more year has elapsed while the prospects for the independence of that international Territory are just as remote as ever. South Africa continues to resort to new stratagems to prevent the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In the view of my Government  any policy tending to create a link between the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is unacceptable. Cameroon  a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  wishes to reassert its unswerving support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] in its struggle for the liberation of Namibia. The Security Council must take the urgent and decisive measures called for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations in order to enforce respect for resolution 435 (1978)  which remains the only acceptable framework for the accession of Namibia to independence.91.	In South Africa itself  we are witnessing with culpable indifference the worst extremes of brutality  massacre and imprisonment of those brave enough to oppose an odious system. That inhumane system has strained its efforts to combine so-called constitutional reformsâwhich  incidentally  were flatly rejected by their alleged beneficiariesâ-with a policy of satellization of neighbouring countries through military pressure and economic intimidation.92.	The application of oppressive laws is being pursued tirelessly. We condemn this illusionary reformism  and we are gratified to note that the Security Council did the same in its resolution on the subject adopted on 17 August. We call for the immediate liberation of ail those imprisoned by the South African racist authorities during the most recent electoral masquerade. There can be no compromise as regards the principle of equality of all human beings or the need to enforce respect for this principle in practice. That is why the Security Council must continue its consideration of measures to increase international pressure on South Africa to make it change its attitude. Cameroon  which is a member of the OAU Liberation Committee  will continue to help the liberation movements in their struggle against apartheid and to promote in South Africa a democratic society respectful of the dignity and equality of all its citizens.93.	In our view  the racial problem in that country seems more and more to transcend the simple concept of respect for human rights and to have become a genuine aspect of the whole problem of liberating an oppressed people. Our resolute support for the liberation movements of South Africaâthe African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azaniaâfinds here its political and ethical foundation.94.	With regard to Western Sahara  where the situation remains a matter of concern  we think that this problem should be dealt with on the basis of the principle of the self-determination of peoples. A solution can be found by the application of resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX)  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983.95.	With regard to the situation in Chad  the position of Cameroon was recently reaffirmed by Mr. Paul Biya  President of the Republic of Cameroon: our Government is encouraging the efforts of the regime in N'djamena to promote national reconciliation and unity in Chad  with a view to the reconstruction and development of the country. As in the past  Cameroon is ready to contribute to all efforts  bilaterally  sub regionally or on the African level  with a view to safeguarding the independence  territorial integrity  stability and peace in Chad.96.	The recent evolution of the situation in that country marked by the withdrawal of foreign troops  while removing a political-ideological impediment to the opening of dialogue among the Chadians  at the same time also highlights the fact that the solution to the Chadian problem cannot be a military one but is essentially political.97.	It is up to the Chadians themselves to make an effort to rise above individual  ethnic or racial differences  personal ambitions and ideological in-transigence  in order that the supreme interests of the Chadian nation may prevail. Having said this  we fear that the disengagement of foreign troopsâthe presence of which  like it or not  did  in fact  preserve a ""no war  no peace"" situationâis leaving a dangerous void  which may very well exacerbate the state of belligerence in a climate of ambition  conquest or territorial reconquest. We would venture to hope that all possible precautions have been or will be taken to prevent any possible violations of this disengagement agreement.98.	In the final analysis  it seems to us that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Chad should have been preceded or followed by the setting up of a neutral force which could have intervened. Why not a United Nations peace force capable of facilitating the process of dialogue with a view to national reconciliation?99.	We are following with the same concern other regions of the world where conflicts and tensions which may threaten international peace and security are developing in a dangerous way.100.	In the Middle East  the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland  the sovereignty of Lebanon and the Iraq-Iran conflict are key issues upon the solution of which depends the advent of a just and lasting peace throughout the region.101.	With regard more particularly to the Palestinian problem  we would hope that the Arab countries would help their friendsâwho consider the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian peopleâand not pose problems as regards their cohesiveness or the mobilization of their peoples to the banner of Palestinian resistance.102.	In Cyprus  Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Central America  no solutions can be found without strict respect for the sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity of States and non-interference hi the internal affairs of States  as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations.103.	The deterioration of the international climate has had very grave repercussions on the already highly alarming economic crisis. Indeed  in spite of the projections of the developed countries during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly with regard to the end of the present economic recession  the advantages resulting from the so-called recovery have not extended to the whole of the community of nations  particularly the vast majority of the developing countries  which continue to languish in poverty.104.	The economic asphyxiation confronting most young countries and the dangers and disorders to which the international monetary and commercial system is prey constitute disturbing factors which add to an already stormy international climate the prospect of generalized instability.105.	This inadmissible situation is not simply the result of cyclical fluctuations in the international economic system. It reflects the inadequacy of the structural balances inherent in me current economic system.106.	The experience of recent years proves that the world economy cannot be healthy if the development efforts of the developing countries continue to come up against ever-increasing protectionism  high rates of exchange  lower prices for their products  high interest rates  a deterioration of the terms of trade  severe balance-of-payments problems  a decline in financial capital and a swallowing up of vast resources in arms programmes.107.	The accumulation of these problems has drastically reduced the capacity of the developing countries to undertake important investment projects or to continue to support projects and programmes that are necessary for economic growth. Furthermore  it has obliged those countries to reduce the volume of their imports from the industrialized countries. That in turn has adverse consequences for the recovery process. In addition  it gives the clearest proof that there can be no lasting economic recovery in the developed countries without the simultaneous economic development of the developing countries. The stability of any sustained global economic growth is inextricably linked to the interdependence of developed and developing countries. Although this interdependence has often been reaffirmed  as in the Declaration of the London Economic Summit of the industrialized countries  held last June  the fiscal and monetary policies followed by those countries continue to impede the effective participation of the developing countries in the process of recovery and economic growth. This policy of obstruction is also continuing to block most of the negotiations under way in various international bodies.108.	This is the right place to deplore the feeble results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. That session unfortunately did not make possible the establishment of a new consensus which would have put the world economy on a new path. I must also express our disappointment at the failure of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna last August; its conclusions clearly failed to live up to the hopes of the international community. We hope that  during this session  the General Assembly will do everything possible to reach a consensus on two matters of vital importance to the third-world countriesâindustrial restructuring and the financing of development projects in those countries.109.	The solutions to these numerous problems lies in dialogue and co-operation within a broad framework which takes account of the links between the various factors in economic development. It is in this spirit that the General Assembly  in so many resolutions adopted since 1979  in particular resolution 34/138  has called for the launching of global negotiations on the establishment of a new  more just and equitable system of international relations. Despite the praiseworthy efforts of Mr. Illueca  President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  to secure a consensus on the procedure and agenda for such negotiations  the deadlock on this issue continues. We are convinced that the present economic crisis makes it more necessary than ever that these negotiations be launched immediately. We continue to believe that the two-phase approach advocated by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  and reaffirmed by the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires from 28 March to 9 April 1983  can give a new impulse to the search for ways and means to break the current deadlock.110.	In Africa  a continent rich in natural resources and development potential  the persistence of the economic and social crisis continues to cause the international community grave concern. For some years  our continent has suffered an unprecedented and prolonged drought and the most adverse effects of the world economic recession. This critical situation is aggravated in particular by the acute food crisis in most of the African countries. In this context  the recent initiatives taken by the Secretary- General and other heads of organizations in the United Nations family deserve our appreciation and support. These initiatives in support of the efforts of the African countries themselves should be based on permanent resources available in the long term if they are to bear fruit. It is therefore desirable that the various institutions concerned take the necessary measures to give the various African programmes in the system the appropriate scope  priority and resources.111.	Solving the economic problems cannot of itself lead to development. We must harmoniously integrate the multi-dimensional aspects that are characteristic of man  for the benefit of whom all true development efforts must be organized. Human rightsâcivil  political  social  economic and culturalâare among these aspects.112.	This year the United Nations has been very active in all the fields that I have just mentioned. I could give as examples the meetings of the Commission on Human Rights  at Geneva  and of the preparatory body for the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  at Vienna; the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  at Geneva; and the International Conference on Population  at Mexico City. Cameroon actively participated in all those meetings.113.	My country  which has put man at the centre of its concerns  has laid down a body of legislative measures  supported by judicial machinery  making truly effective the protection of human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. For seven years  Cameroon has been working to promote understanding of  research into  education in and popularization of human rights  through seminars organized in collaboration with the Henri Dunant Institute  at Geneva  and with UNESCO and UNITAR. Moreover  in recent years we have acceded to many international instruments on human rights.114.	The status of women is of prime importance to my country. This means that women must be closely linked with all stages of the economic and social development process  particularly in preparing plans and formulating policies and in decision-making. The establishment of a ministry dealing with the status of women and of a consultative committee to improve the status of women in Cameroon stems from this humane concept of development  which centres its efforts on all sections of our society.115.	I must mention the fate of a category of people who have been pushed out of their own countries by hazards and uncertainties of all kinds. I refer to refugees. They benefit from the great concern shown by our Government  which recently submitted to the UNHCR three projects whose implementation would contribute greatly to improving the position of refugees in Cameroonian territory.116.	In December 1982  a document of historic scope created a new milestone in the achievements of the United Nations. The new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  certainly the most important and most complete juridical instrument to be adopted since the Charter of the United Nations  represents the first universal recognition of the rule of law with regard to the oceans.117.	We are happy that a growing number of States are signing or ratifying the Convention. The results of the meeting of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  held at Geneva from 13 August to 5 September 1984  are very encouraging. They will surely open the way to the signing of the Convention by a number of industrialized countries. We believe that all countries with the means or potential should have the opportunity to join the group of pioneer investors in the exploration of the sea-bed.118.	The purpose of part XI of the Convention  whose text was patiently negotiated  is to allow for a wise exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed under a well-ordered juridical regime. This legal framework remains crucial for international peace and security.119.	We shall continue to make our modest contribution to ensuring that the Convention and its related resolutions are properly implemented. As the delegation of Cameroon emphasized at the end of the second session of the Preparatory Commission  held at Kingston from 19 March to 13 April 1984  we must resolutely and unequivocally implement the relevant provisions of those instruments. It is against this background that Cameroon shares in the concern recently expressed at Geneva by the Group of 77 about the provisional agreement on the exploration of the sea-bed to which certain industrialized countries have subscribed.120.	Moreover  holding the sessions of the Preparatory Commission must no longer give rise to the same problems as in the past. Resolution I  adopted by consensus at the same time as the Convention  requires that those sessions be held at the headquarters of the future International Sea-Bed Authority. Therefore  the Secretary-General should take all the necessary measures to establish a viable secretariat at Kingston  in accordance with the relevant decisions of the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to express to the Government of Jamaica our appreciation of the excellent facilities and hospitality offered for the meetings of the Preparatory Commission there.121.	Nearly 40 years after its creation  the United Nations today is the target of serious doubts on the part of the international community; many  apart from the public at large  are increasingly wondering about the raison d'etre and the future of the Organization. Its authority is becoming weakened; its resolutions and decisions are not being implemented  particularly those of the Security Council  the collective body which was supposed to represent our common desire to act decisively whenever international peace and security are threatened. If almost four decades of existence have paralysed the structures of the Organization  it is particularly the lack of political will of Member States that has considerably eroded its credibility. As a corollary  multilateralism is dangerously declining; there are clear signs of this  mainly the current decrease in the resources made available to institutions such as UNDP  the fact that many States  particularly the more powerful ones  do not hasten to resort to the machinery offered by the United Nations to resolve issues of world-wide interest and  to some extent  the difficulties experienced now by UNESCO. We support the appeal launched by the Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  for a strengthening of multilateralism  renewing the position of his colleagues on the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination in its overview report for 1983/84.122.	We are living in an era in which problems tend to take on global proportions because of the interdependence of nations  which is being consolidated by daily advances in science and technology. Thus we must use reliable international mechanisms in order to derive the greatest profit for our common destiny.123.	We must therefore strengthen our faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations and constantly see to it that the structures and functioning of its organs are kept up to date and made more democratic. Along these lines  there is an urgent need to pursue the present revitalization of the Economic and Social Council. We also hope that consultations on improving the functioning of the Security Council  begun in this body  will find an early solution in terms of concrete proposals  taking into account the various views expressed by the political groups in the Assembly.124.	With regard to innovations or reforms under-taken in the structure and management of the Secretariat  these must be carried out in accordance with guidelines given by Member States in various deliberative bodies. Cameroon  which attaches great importance to the equitable geographical composition of the Secretariat and to its efficient functioning  supports the Secretary-General in that regard.125.	We should like once again to express our dedication to the United Nations and to multilateral institutions. We hope that they will continue to have the strong support of Member States  particularly the wealthier countries  in order to become the defenders of the higher common interests of mankind  of which peace  collective security and access to well-being for all are the main elements.126.	We are taking part in this session  as in so many other sessions  in a spirit of dialogue  tolerance and concord. As was recently stated by our President  Mr. Paul Biya:""Cameroon  land of peace and openness  continues to practice a policy of friendship  co-operation without boundaries  and non-alignment  with full respect for its independence  sovereignty and fundamental options.""This policy applies to all sister countries of Africa  neighbours as well as distant countries  with which we seek active solidarity for the total liberation of Africa  the consolidation of the Organization of African Unity and the solution of the problems of the continent. It also guides our relations with many other States in the world  as well as with many international organizations.""Cameroon will continue its development through an active and realistic presence on the international scene and will continue to offer the world the reassuring and edifying picture of a young  united  peaceful  stable and prosperous nation  which is making a modest contribution to the maintenance of peace  the strengthening of understanding  friendship and co-operation among nations and the promotion of civilization throughout the world."""
"29",1426,"COD",39,1984,"ï»¿My delegation is pleased to join preceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Paul Lusaka on his very well deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We welcome this election on more than one count: first  because of the personal relations of friendship that we always had when he was still in his country  carrying out ministerial duties; secondly  because of the blood relations that exist between Zaire and Zambia; thirdly  because he represents Africa  our continent; and  finally  because he has always served the United Nations with great competence and dedication. Is there anyone who is not aware of the stubborn determination with which he has presided over the United Nations Council for Namibia? Is there anyone who is not aware of the outstanding way in which he served as representative of Zambia to the United Nations for many years? Thus  his election to the presidency of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly is a felicitous recognition of his qualities of heart and mind. It cannot but be a guarantee of the success of our work.243.	We congratulate also the other officers of the Assembly. The outstanding talents of each of them will be of valuable assistance to the President in the successful conduct of our deliberations.244.	We take this opportunity also to thank the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge E. Illueca  of Panama. His deep knowledge of the ins and outs of the Organization made it possible for the work of the thirty-eighth session to reach a happy conclusion. Indeed  all the Members of the United Nations remember the gloomy and unhealthy circumstances surrounding the opening and development of the work of the thirty-eighth session.245.	Before going into the substance of its statement  my delegation wishes to express its wholehearted appreciation to the Secretary-General. We could not  in fact  fail to mention all his qualitiesâ not least  his discretion  his courage  his dedication and his readiness to serve the United Nations. Every time an important problem has faced the world and the Organization  the Secretary-General has tackled it with the clear-mindedness  the competence  the thoroughness and the skill so necessary for his lofty and delicate task. We assure him of our support as he serves the Organization.246.	And  speaking of the Organization  we think it is time for us to dwell on some aspects of its functioning and its methods  and in particular its role and its effectiveness.247.	Apart from the work done by its specialized agencies  which have been entrusted with tasks that are more sectoral and operational  the only function in which the United Nations can still take pride is that of being  as it were  the conscience of the world. But even in that respect  the claim to universality is dented when one considers the omnipotent role of the veto exercised by the great Powers in the Security Council.248.	Be that as it may  the essential function of preventing hostilities and maintaining peace is carried out only in the rare cases when the great Powers  or simply the rich  are not involved. In a word  the Organization  especially at the level of the Security Council  is floundering. Consequently  the Security Council has obviously lost its prestige and the General Assembly has become a machine turning out resolutions  often automatically.249.	On another level  the Organization must abandon this unfortunate trend of establishing more and more committees and subsidiary bodiesâad infinitumâwithout prior co-ordination with the Secretary- General. Such bodies raise issues of competence visa-vis the Secretary-General  to whom the Charter of the United Nations entrusts the task of administering all the staff of the Organization. And I am not even speaking of the fact that the establishment of these committees raises budgetary problems  since the expenses involved in their activities are not foreseen at the time when the budget is drawn up.250.	It is therefore imperative for the General Assembly  and not committees of experts  to study carefully the new directions that should be given to our methods. The Organization will commemorate its fortieth anniversary next year. That will be a very good opportunity for us to establish these new directions and methods to make United Nations actions more credible.251.	Similarly  in regard to the recruitment and promotion of personnel  the principle of balance seems to be becoming a dead letter. It is not fair for a single nation to hoard as many as six posts of Undersecretary-General and Assistant-Secretary-General. That cannot be called universality.252.	Despite the continued existence of hotbeds of tension in many parts of the world  this session of the General Assembly is opening in more auspicious circumstances than its predecessor. Let us not be pessimists or prophets of gloom. Let us rejoice at this trend and express the hope that  far from being weakened  it will be confirmed.253.	It is true that  contrary to common sense  the Iraq-Iran war continues  causing ruin and destruction. But that war was already raging in 1983. Indeed  for the very reason that the belligerents are stubborn and deaf to the pleas of the world  this war  despite the ferociousness with which it is waged  would have been forgotten by now if it did not pose such grave threats to the oil routes and sources of supply.254.	It is true  too  that there has been not the slightest progress in settling the thorny Middle East question  which is almost as old as the United Nations itself. But that failure to find a solution is not the result of any lack of imagination  perseverance or interest the part of the international community. It seems to us that everything has been said about this human and political tragedy  as heartrending as it is complex. But frameworks and plans for settlement do exist. They are not perfect  but they constitute the least of the evils when compared with the extremist solutions some have proposed.255.	If the entire problem is still with us  it is because of incomprehension and intransigenceâwe would even be tempted to say the political blindness and arrogance of one side or another. However that may be  this problem is still a very burning one and it has all the elements of a quagmire. That is undoubtedly very unfortunate because of the high stakes.256.	With regard to the Lebanese tragedy  it could be said that in some way there has been positive development. The Government of National Unity is taking increasing control  even if it is doing so slowly. And it seems to be confirmed that certain foreign occupation troops could be withdrawn; if that were to happen  the risks of a major confrontation would also be reduced.257.	Nor can it be said that Central America  the object of so much covetousness and so many threats of intervention  has become a haven of peace. There are still confrontations  and they are not engaged in with kid gloves. Nevertheless  it cannot be said that during these months of September and October there has been any dramatic development one way or the other.258.	These cases suffice to indicate that tensions and conflicts still exist. The demons of suspicion and confrontation are not deadâfar from it. But  compared to 1983  at the same time of the year  the climate seems to us to be less fraught with fear. We hope that this is not merely the calm before the storm  but it does seem that the confusion  the shock and the fear raised in 1983 by the destruction of the South Korean aircraft and the assassination at Rangoon of some members of the South Korean Government are now only bad memories  even if we must recognize that the consequences of those acts cannot be erased so quickly.259.	Whatever the case  we must look towards a better future and calmer skies.260.	We note  first  that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko  who was not in New York in 1983  was indeed here in 1984. Even betterâwhereas there was no Soviet-United States dialogue for several years  attempts should not be made to conceal the approaches currently being made. No  the Soviet Union and the United States are not the only two countries in the world. But things being what they are  everyone will agree that detente between the two super-Powers would greatly help matters. Whether their current approaches are dictated by internal considerations or not  the fact remains that dialogue is the only hope. For our partâand this seems to be the desire of the peace-loving nationsâwe express the wish that these contacts will lead to an understanding and a relaxation in international relations and not to a conspiracy based on dividing up the planet.261.	In Chad  which was considered the very prototype of the strategy of tension  the recent Franco-Libyan agreement for withdrawal of their respective troops seems to confirm the impression of reduced tension.262.	Whatever scepticism may be shown by certain observers with respect to the viability of such an agreement  Zaire applauded the announcement of a withdrawal. There is no reason to believe indefinitely in the falseness or the fickleness of a head of State who solemnly commits his country before the world. Nor can we believe that the foreign troops that are in Chad for various reasons intended to stay there for long. Once we have preserved and guaranteed the identity  independence and territorial integrity of Chad  we must make the Chadians face up to their own responsibilities. Only they are in charge of their destiny. Our role is to help them. Even if  as has been said  victory comes from the mouth of a gun  it is still a matter of common sense that in this case the ideal solution can be found in national consensus and a legitimate government.263.	As regards the Zairian troops in Chad  Zaire  which was not involved in the Franco-Libyan agreement  will settle this question independently with N'Djamena. Its troops are in Chad at the request of N'Djamena  and a minimum of courtesy requires at least some prior consultation. We do not intend to stay in Chad for ever  especially since new factors are involved. We are for peace  dialogue and concord.264.	In the same vein  we hope that henceforth the Western Sahara conflict  which has long divided the OAU  will meet with a peaceful solution as a result of the recent developments shaping up in northern Africa. For our part  we have always regarded the Frente POLISARIO as a liberation movement and not a government. Those who wished  under the cover of principle  to use the Western Sahara issue to settle personal or national questions must now come out into the open and defend their rights  if they have any. That is more worthy and more courageous.265.	If the impression of quiet and relaxation of tension is right  tensions would have to come down a notch. And if tensions come down  there will be less suspicion and thus there should be a slow-down in the arms race and increased co-operation and solidarity.266.	I shall first speak about the problem of the arms race and then about solidarity and international mutual assistance.267.	The problem of over-armament is crucial because it raises questions that involve the very survival of mankind. Whether we consider the question in its deadly and devastating aspects or in the way in which it diverts major resources from the development of less wealthy peoples  the conclusion is the same. The Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva  has studied this problem in great depth. The Secretary-General and others aware of the problem have often drawn the attention of those responsible for over-armament to the dangers they are placing before mankind. But anyway  those responsible are in a better position than anyone to know about that. Our planet is already saturated with weapons  but their production continues and their devastating power is refined. It would appear that our world was prey to collective indifference and folly. If those weapons could strike only their inventors we could perhaps shrug our shoulders and sleep in peace  thinking that after all they will get only what they deserve. But no  we are all concerned by the holocaust. Disarmament or arms reduction must concern all the protagonists. It is meaningless to claim or demand unilateral disarmament. That would smack of naivety and manipulation and would mean the reign of blackmail.268.	In the final analysis  it would be better to tolerate a certain balance of terror if we know and proclaim our rejection of any kind of world condominium.269.	The Charter of the United Nations expressly prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other States. World despotism would lead to a huge empire in which we would be swallowed up and where we would lose our own personality and identity.270.	Each State must be able to organize itself as it wishes without a would-be godfather or protector.271.	Therefore  as regards the problem of Korea  for example  we have always affirmed that we should aid the North and the South to achieve their great design  following their respective wishes  in negotiation and in dialogue. It is not for other States to tell the Koreans what they should do. Nor does this concern only the North or only the South. The real wishes of the Koreans themselves must be brought into the foreground. This is not a taboo subject. If one of the two Koreas submitted its candidacy for admission to the United Nations  Zaire would not oppose it. Perhaps  in the final analysis  this would contribute to reducing tension in the area. After all  the two Germanies are Members of the United Nations today. That does not mean they are abandoning their unity.272.	To conclude our consideration of the problem of the arms race  it is obvious that an effort in this field would open the way to increased exchanges and would free resources for development and for the fight against ignorance and disease.273.	The distinction and the dichotomy between rich and poor nations is an undeniable fact. We do not intend to determine how and why some are rich and others poor. Let us merely state the fact and try to organize ourselves in a spirit of justice and equity  all the more so because rich and poor are interdependent. I could not better describe that interdependence than with reference to the author of Le Defi mondial  who quotes a report drawn up in the Federal Republic of Germany. I shall spare representatives the text  but  to sum up  this report  which was commissioned by Chancellor Schmidt ""calculates at several million the number of jobs that would be lost in the steel industry  the automobile industry and the aeronautical and shipping industry if the supply of just five minerals that Germany imports from southern Africa was suddenly to be cut off.""These are: chrome  irreplaceable in the production of special steels; molybdenum  for the production of refractory alloys used in the building of jet engines; vanadium  essential for the sheathing of nuclear fuel rods; asbestos  for insulation in space vessels and also for brake shoes  battery covers and oil pipelines; and manganese  used in metallurgy for all aluminium alloys.""The same report estimates that""a 30 per cent reduction in chrome imports for just one year would bring to a standstill the activities that depend on it and result in a 25 per cent fall in the gross national product."" It also states that:""If just one of the five producer countries cut off its supply of manganeseâGabon  South Africa  Australia  India and Brazilâthis would create 'major troubles for the Western economy'  according to another report commissioned by the British Government at the request of the Industry Minister.""The same author continues:""The industrial world is discovering that its survival depends on the third world just as much as that of the third world depends on it. It is the third world that has supplied it with the material means for its unprecedented expansion in the third quarter of the century  the fruits of which it could not share. While its living standard has doubled and its average per capita income went up by 100 per cent  that of the third world went up by three dollars a year per capita.""274.	However  despite this interdependence  in present circumstances the poor countries are too weak to hope to bring lasting and effective pressure to bear on the rich countries. The case of the oil- exporting countries exposes their weakness and pre- cariousness. But is this a reason to go on crushing the weak? However rich one is and perhaps because one is rich  one should not be exonerated of his duties of solidarity and assistance. In this connection  President Mitterrand's statement here at the Assembly's thirty-eighth session can from certain points of view be considered as a hymn to solidarity with and assistance to the least favoured countries.275.	Apart from several examples of structured multilateral co-operationâsuch is the case with the European Economic Communityâand apart from some cases of bilateral co-operation varying as bilateral interests vary  assistance for co-operation is generally lagging. In most cases  it barely amounts to 0.7 per cent of gross national product  far short of the 1 per cent target which was considered a worthy objective.276.	These figures deserve to be brought out. In this concern for solidarity  special mention should be made of the Scandinavian countries  such as Norway  Sweden and Finland. My country  while not among the fortunate beneficiaries of the generosity of those three countries  must still recognize their gesture and their efforts.277.	While the prices of raw material are arbitrarily fixed by the rich consumer countries in a precarious manner  the financial market offered to us is equally precarious  for our countries are obliged to borrow in order to acquire the goods needed for their small industries and their development. The conditions offered us  which we have to accept no matter what we wish to do  are such that the non-oil-exporting developing countries are often in no position to pay. Yet they must pay  in justice and equity.278.	Zaire  for its part  has undertaken a rigorous policy of honouring its commitments to its creditors  which have shown confidence in it. My country is thus rigorously adhering to the programme established by the IMF. We will continue with that rigorous policy because it is a sound one and we are reaping its fruits. It would be wrong to decide unilaterally that we would no longer pay our debts. The world knows that this is not a sinecure.279.	The creditors must understand the difficulties of the debtor countries  for goodwill alone does not always suffice. Clearly what would be ideal would be to pay on time; but even after scheduling and rescheduling  these countries will not be able to continue to meet their commitments unless they are given a minimum of flexibility  allowing them breathing space so as to begin minimal recovery. Otherwise those countries will be bled dry and ruined  and they will not be able to pay back their debts  which of course will benefit neither the debtors nor the creditors. There is a popular saying in my country to the effect that if a hernia kills a person it should not feel any satisfaction  for it will accompany that person to the grave. This  we think  shows the situation of the creditor countries and the debtor countries and how they are in the final analysis linked.280.	No sound and genuine co-operation or solidarity is possible in relationships of subjection. Such co-operation can be conceived of only if the partners involved are free. When they are not  even when there is some kind of understanding on the part of the master  it is not solidarity but mere condescension.281.	Since the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  no nation on earth should be deprived of its freedom and sovereignty any longer. Indeed  the colonial phenomenon  in principle at least  has disappeared from the world  except  of course  in Africa  which is still marked by poverty  disease  misery and underdevelopment. Must it  in addition to all this  continue to be humiliated by an inhuman regime whose philosophy of power has been declared by world conscience to be a crime against humanity?282.	To maintain itself in power  South Africa has adopted  towards its neighbours  a policy of terror and aggression. When there was talk of glimpses of peace in southern Africa  we were sceptical. Nevertheless  Zaire has not condemned Pretoria's approaches a priori because it felt that everything should be tried  even at the price of an alliance with the devil  to speed the liberation of the African majority and of Namibia. After all  lions and tigers  fierce as they are  can sometimes be tamed  but we must always remember that they remain lions and tigers.283.	Thus  on condition that these initiatives and these peace pacts do not harm the rights of the black majority  we have taken note of them.284.	The present developments in South Africa and Namibia confirm our fears  however  because in the final analysis no neighbour of South Africa has ever committed aggression against the Pretoria regime  lacking the means to do so. Therefore  it should suffice for South Africa to make a unilateral declaration that it would no longer commit aggression against the neighbouring countries  which are  after all  defenceless.285.	In fact  what South Africa has always tried to obtain through these agreements is a blank cheque to enable it to carry on its policy of oppression and humiliation of blacks in South Africa itself and in Namibia.286.	Let us hear nothing about interference on the part of neighbouring countries in the internal affairs of South Africa. Helping the black majority to achieve liberation is not interference. Fighting crime is not interference  for apartheid is an international crime. This is legitimate self-defence. As far as Namibia is concerned  everyone knows that South Africa is remaining there illegally.287.	There is a category of citizens whose situation is sometimes as terrible and precarious as that of dependent peoplesânamely  refugees. Whatever the causes of these mass exodusesâwar  political or religious intolerance  natural catastrophes  over-population and so onâthis phenomenon must not be encouraged.288.	Fortunately  the international community is sensitive to the situation and is dealing with it by taking the necessary measures  as it has just proved through the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva in July of this year. However  the best remedy remains to ensure that there are as few refugees as possible and  in fact  that there are no more refugees. It is always best to be in one's own home.289.	Zaire  true to its traditions and its policy of solidarity  has on its territory more than half a million refugees  with whom it shares without discrimination the few resources it has availableâhospitals  schools  food and so forth. One can easily measure the sacrifices that this entails. As much as possible  when the refugees agree to do so  we encourage them to return to their home countries.290.	In dealing with disarmament  international co-operation  decolonization or the refugee question  we cannot forget that  whether we are white  yellow  black or red  rich or poor  we are on the same earth for the same purpose  namely  to live together harmoniously and in happiness. As a great British thinker has said: ""Only those who act together can act successfully; only those who have trust in one another can work together in harmony; those who are not bound by common affection and common interests cannot act successfully."" I note with pleasure that we all have common interests. To be successful  let us work together and with trust in one another  for the good of all mankind."
"30",1472,"COG",39,1984,"ï»¿As I speak in the General Assembly  the people of the People's Republic of the Congo is in the course of giving effect to the directives of the third regular congress of the Congolese Labour Party  which was held at Brazzaville from 27 to 31 July 1984. The meetings of that Congress constitute a historic turning point for the Congolese revolution. The results of the Congress have enabled our people to acquire new institutions and to embark on dynamic action in all areas of national life  in particular the area of international policy.2.	While welcoming the outstanding successes achieved during the Congress  the Congolese people is more than ever concerned by an international situation of insecurity  injustice and underdevelopment  whose consequences for the future of mankind demand the attention of the entire international community.3.	On behalf of our Government and of the President  Denis SassouNguesso  the delegation of the Congo is pleased to make  through me  its modest contribution to consideration of the problems that face the United Nations and the international community as a whole.4.	In entrusting Mr. Lusaka with the task of presiding over the work of its thirty-ninth session  the General Assembly has recognized that he is not only one of the most experienced African ambassadors  but also the outstanding President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  a man whose dynamism and devotion have always been commensurate with the cause championed by that important United Nations body. I congratulate him wholeheartedly; the delegation of the Congo  which I have the honour to lead  is very gratified at this choice and assures him of its full cooperation. The People's Republic of the Congo and Zambia have very friendly relations  recently reaffirmed by an exchange of visits between our two heads of State and by the election of President Kenneth David Kaunda as honorary President of the third regular congress of the Congolese Labour Party.3. I pay a well-deserved tribute  also  to Mr. Lusaka's illustrious predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  a distinguished Latin American statesman and an ardent champion of the inalienable rights of exploited nations. We are particularly grateful to him for the calm and efficient way in which he conducted the meetings of the thirty eighth session.6.	In considering the report of the Secretary General on the work of the Organization  we are pleased to note that he quite appropriately reminds the international community of the urgency of the tasks and the weight of the responsibilities that devolve upon us pursuant to our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations. We are most grateful to the Secretary General for all the efforts and all the means described in that report. Their aim is constantly to renew the spirit of our shared ideals through the application of appropriate solutions to the ills plaguing the world.7.	When we commemorate  next year  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the time will be ripe for mankind to take stock and to envisage  in a new  global and  we trust  optimistic context  the outlines of the world of tomorrow  whose features still seem so vague to us today.8.	In the meantime  we are obliged to note that the eloquent and benevolent statements of intention made here do not always reflect the political practice of certain Member States. In fact  it has in no way been proved that those who speak the most about peace and freedom are the best craftsmen of those noble ideals in their own countries and throughout the world. Quite often  on the contrary  the warmongers  who are responsible for the most blatant social injustices and the most serious manifestations of the exploitation of man by man  could very easily be mistaken for the staunchest champions of human rights.9.	Tried and tested couriers of dubious policies or mere links in a chain of selfish interests  the major instigators of policies opposed to the fundamental interests of mankind no longer hide their intentions. They are the gravediggers of peace; they are the ones who are truly starving the world through the debt of the third world and the deterioration of raw material pricesâto sum up  through the relations between the industrialized and the developing countries  relations characterized by the thirst for profit at any cost: the primary motivation of the behaviour of the countries of the North  even if it be to the detriment of the countries of the South. Finally  it is these countries which persist in voluntarily supporting colonialist and neo-colonialist desires designed to enslave peoples weakened by exploitation by the imperialist Powers. 10. That reference to reality suffices to bring us to the core of the true problems on whose solution true peace and freedom as well as solidarity among peoples depend. Unfortunately  those problems confront all continents  particularly the African continent. The United Nations must analyse the underlying causes and propose effective cures. Otherwise  our meetings will have few concrete results  given the real problems undermining our societies.H. If one really needs an illustration of the problems whose persistence and deterioration jeopardize the present approach to questions of universal importance  one can begin by referring to the social and economic situation of the African continent. Under the joint effect of natural disasters  such as drought  and temporary factors of the moment  a considerable part of our continent is moving dangerously towards economic uncertainty; it is at the brink of stagnation. Despite the courageous actions of States involved  such as those in the Sahel  desertification continues to increase inexorably  bringing with it hunger  starvation and a rising death rate  and severely affecting plant  animal and human life.12.	On the initiative of the Secretary General and of the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  Mr. Edouard Saouma  the problem has received particular attention this year from the international community. But a solution to it has been blocked by insufficient mobilization of the necessary means and resources as well as by the emergence of other social and political problems  such as that of refugees  the seriousness of which was highlighted by the Second International Conference of Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July of this year.13.	Such a concatenation of tragic circumstances requires  at the least  an overall review of the criteria for granting assistance and for programming action. Only in that way can we hope to alleviate  fairly soon  the most immediate effects of these scourges.14.	In the same context  the effective implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] at its second extraordinary session  held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980 ' seems more than ever before to be the essential reference point for all those  be they Africans or not  who wish to bring an end to the spectre of underdevelopment in Africa.15.	During the second regular session this year of the Economic and Social Council  held at Geneva from 4 to 27 July  the particularly critical economic situation of the African continent was given priority consideration. My delegation  however  cannot hide its concern about the specific results of those discussions: the Council was not able even to adopt a simple declaration on the subject by consensus.16.	Clearly  given the lack of genuine  self-generated development  which alone can create the bases for true economic complementarity between developed and developing countries  it is always inadvisable to subscribe to actions that are not consistent and that  in fact  support an ideology of alleged economic freedom  of which  however  underdevelopment is unfortunately one of the fundamental elements.17.	Moreover  1984 is the tenth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  an instrument of great scope which is rightly considered by the Movement of Non-aligned Countries as the indispensable complement to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.18.	The new international economic order  for which that Charter laid the bases  seems to us to be the basic pivot around which should turn all policies that are truly aimed at improving the lot of many States and communities throughout the world Seen in that light  the new international economic order is a moral imperative that can serve to organize the world's economy equitably and rationally.19.	To be sure  aware of the stakes  we have no illusion regarding the readiness of the developed countries to accept changes for the sake of justice  in existing situations which guarantee them power  domination and exploitation of the weakest countries. The rejection by certain countries of the launching of global negotiations irrefutably demonstrates the extent of the cynicism governing the acts of many powerful States designed to distract international opinion and to set up a smokescreen against those who are determined to eliminate all types of suffering with which the peoples are faced today.20.	For our part  we believe that it is high time to establish true relations of solidarity in each country and on the international level. This is the price for the coming of peace  freedom and prosperity. These are the concerns which must determine the activities of the United Nations and of Member States and which guide the People's Republic of the Congo and the actions carried out by the Congolese Labour Party and its head  President Denis SassouNguesso  to protect the interests of the various social strata of our country.21.	Our political objectives and our social practice are designed to make the Congolese people the master of its destiny and to assist it in acquiring the means which it now lacks to consolidate its political independence and to hasten its economic and cultural liberation.22.	Thanks to these commitments  the Congolese people today is able to exercise political power through the systems of the Party and the State  which have been democratically set up and inspired by the country itself in order to solve the problems on which its existence and the future of the country depend. It is in this context today that our people has achieved outstanding progress in the economic and socio cultural spheres.23.	On the economic level  our programme aims at the mastery and rational utilization of natural resources for the benefit of the people  a reorganization of the national territory  which was disorganized by the colonial system and its follow-up  the unification of the national territory through the building of a road network which can help revitalize the rural areas and ensure the complementarity that is so badly needed between the economic activities in the urban areas and in the countryside. We wish to improve the living conditions of the people by rationally organizing a system  based on the interests of the people  to ensure mod self-sufficiency  which is an objective to be achieved by the year 2000  with  of course  the assistance of all those who  in the context of bilateral and multilateral cooperation  are ready to participate with us in building a free and prosperous nation in the Congo. 24.	The aim of our social policy is to resolve the problem of unemployment by organizing a centralized and dynamic national economic system.25.	In the field of education  the democratization of the teaching system has resulted today in a 100 per cent enrolment rate  and now we require vigorous action in order to improve the quality of school education  to expand literacy programmes for adults and to integrate into national socioeconomic sectors high school and other students at the end of their training programmes.26.	Aware of the importance of these questions  we have established a climate of peace and harmony in the country favourable to ensuring the consolidation of unity and national construction. Thus  we shall be able to achieve the national solidarity and prosperity which our people need in order to enjoy the fruits of its labour and to profit from the resources of its country.27.	These concerns are well known and their implementation has been verified by all those who follow the internal and foreign policy of the People's Republic of the Congo  and particularly by those of our friends and brothers who have followed the work of the third regular Congress of our Party.28.	It can be noted that  rather than a fragmented approach to the problems of mankind  we prefer an approach which looks at man as a whole in his natural environment and in the world and which makes it possible to envisage and implement global policies aimed at ensuring harmonious relations among Governments and peoples  for without such relationships it would be impossible to establish peace and freedom throughout the world.29.	In thus expressing our faith in solidarity and international cooperation built on an equitable and just basis  we  the people of the Congo  proclaim our conviction that peace and the conditions for maintaining peace deserve the better part of our energies and our resources.30.	The foreign policy of the People's Republic of the Congo as laid down by the Congolese Labour Party  inspired and championed by the President  Denis SassouNguesso  bears ample witness to that. For my country has always had with all peace and freedom loving countries  regardless of socioeconomic distinctions  relations based on mutual respect and a policy of mutual advantage. We are also involved in establishing and continuing  on the regional level  peaceful and good neighbourly relations with other countries.31.	It is within this context that we see the efforts of the Congolese Government to restore peace and harmony to Chad. In fact  my Government has for several months now proposed bringing together at Brazzaville all of our Chad brothers  who for too long have been divided by a fratricidal struggle.32.	We sincerely appreciate the readiness which the various parties to the conflict have demonstrated up to now regarding the principle of their return to the fold  and we urge them to avoid any behaviour which would have discussion depend on prerequisites of no crucial importance.33.	From this rostrum we reaffirm the determination of the Congolese Government to do all in its power  with the valuable assistance of other Governments  and in particular those of central Africa  to ensure the success of the conference on Chad to be held at Brazzaville.34.	This is the place also to express the satisfaction of the Congolese Government at the announcement of the imminent withdrawal of the French and Libyan forces from Chad. That withdrawal of foreign forces is  in our view  a positive factor that may facilitate the process that will lead to reunion and reconciliation at Brazzaville.35.	Along similar lines  we have been following the situation m Western Sahara  which continues to deteriorate  despite the appeal made to Morocco and to the Frente POLISARIO by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983.36.	In this regard  my delegation would like to express the hope that the treaty concluded on 13 August 1984 between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will in no way prejudge the outcome and legitimate rights of the Saharan people. We should like to take this occasion to appeal to the brotherly countries of the Maghreb to make a positive contribution to finding a just solution to the crisis in Western Sahara  based on the norms and principles of international law.37.	There is a close relationship between peace  detente and the right of peoples to self-determination. In this respect  we consider the admission of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations as an event that will bring us closer to the attainment of one of our most cherished ideals  that of universality. While warmly welcoming the admission of this new State to the group of nations  we should like to assure its people and leaders of the readiness of the Congo to cooperate with them.38.	In contrast to that encouraging event  the situation in Namibia presents a very gloomy picture. For a long time now we have been waiting with ever-growing impatience for the coming of freedom for the people of that country.39.	Even today  South Africa and some of its allies continue to set up all kinds of obstacles to the implementation of the United Nations plan of action for the independence of Namibia  as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which can be the only valid basis allowing for the accession of Namibia to national sovereignty without any subjective preconditions.40.	Cuba and Angola are two sovereign States and therefore we can in no way sanction an operation which would subordinate the implementation of the provisions of resolution 435 (1978) to the annulment of a freely concluded agreement between the two States Members of the United Nations  for that would seriously affect the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other States.41.	The sole request that we would make therefore to the members of the Western contact group  if that group still exists  is to return to the spirit and letter of resolution 435 (1978) in order finally to give the Namibian people justice.42.	The refusal of South Africa and of certain Western Powers to conform to the demands of resolution 435 (1978) and of other relevant decisions of the United Nations in fact hides their unspeakable plans.43.	The first aims at the exploitation and frenzied plundering of the natural resources of Namibia  a lucrative activity which well-known transnational corporations do not intend to give up  and thus they are deliberately running counter to the provisions of Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  enacted on 27 September 1974 by the United Nations Council for Namibia  the legal authority for the territory.44.	The second motive is the policy of which the South African Government intends not only to consolidate within South Africa itself but also to expand to Namibia and then to the rest of the world.45.	The welcome which some Western Governments gave to the South African Prime Minister when memorial services were being held commemorating the struggles against Nazism confirms this acceptance of apartheid as a ""respectable"" doctrine by the Western Powers to which it owes its survival.46.	The policy of apartheid is merely another name for Nazism and fascism  and this is no longer new to us. It is a crime against humanity. It has already been rejected as a shameful scar by international public opinion. Reacting to its inevitable isolation  the Government of Pretoria has simply contented itself up to now by adapting apartheid to give it the kind of countenance which it can call presentable. After the suicidal policy of bantustanization  which denies the majority black population the right to citizenship in the country  the minority power is now trying to divide the South African people by asking Indian and Coloured groups to sanction white power.47.	The racist Government of Pretoria knows perfectly well that it will never reap the fruits of its criminal policy. Not only has the electoral sham which it organized been largely boycotted by the Indian and Coloured communities  but the majority population has risen up  showing its determination to struggle regardless of the cost. The international community must step up its struggle against this regime  or history will one day reproach us for having tolerated it so long and so much.48.	The support which the People's Republic of the Congo lends to freedom fighters and to the frontline States is a constant factor in our foreign policy. Nevertheless  as is already stated in the Manifesto on Southern Africa  issued by the leaders of East and Central African States  meeting at Lusaka on 16 April 1969  we do not rule out negotiations as long as the enemy also recognizes that they are necessary.49.	""The development of the revolutionary struggle on the spot is always complex  and the path to victory is tortuous""  said President Denis SassouNguesso at the opening of the third regular congress of the Congolese Labour Party. The head of the Congolese State added:""That is why we believe that the major diplomatic activity observed in recent times at the level of the frontline countries is naturally part of the process of the long and complex struggle which the peoples of southern Africa have been waging against the white minority regime in power in Pretoria. We are deeply convinced that Africa will not betray the African cause."" This identification of the Congolese position with the African cause justifies in many ways the active solidarity of the Congolese people with other peoples struggling in other regions of the world. This applies to the Middle East  where the Congo reiterates its support for the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  which  we are certain  will overcome the passing difficulties which have arisen within it and will continue to defend the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.52.	Certain Western Powers which are allies of Israel thought they could impose a ""final solution"" on the Palestinian problem by awkwardly interfering in Lebanon. The more than negative results of that operation show the inanity of solutions based on force and the correctness of the negotiated solution which the international community has always advocated.53.	In like manner  we assure the heroic and constantly victimized people of Nicaragua of all our sympathy  and we continue to believe that it is scarcely in terms of East West rivalries that the problems of Central America can be explained. The struggle of the peoples of that region  like the struggle of the peoples of the Caribbean or of Latin America in general  is above all the result of the profoundly unjust economic and social conditions which some privileged persons supported from abroad have attempted to perpetuate to the detriment of the overwhelming majority of the population.54.	It is vital for everyone that the deep-rooted causes of those crises should be eliminated and that a climate of peace free from ail threat of intervention or economic coercion  a climate essential to respect for the it of peoples freely to determine their future and to dispose of their resources  should be established in the Caribbean as well as in the Central American sub region.55.	If that principle were respected  peace would find a place in the Korean peninsula also and we would no longer witness the sad and continued division of the people of Korea  for whose benefit a process aimed at the reunification of the two parts of the country must be undertaken  eliminating a very serious source of tension in that part of the world.56.	As to the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula  my country unreservedly supports the desire for peace expressed so often by the Governments of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea in order to end the state of belligerence which has been artificially maintained from outside. No one wants peace more than the Kampuchean people  who alone know the price that they have had to pay after the cruel tyranny of Pol Pot  whom some are actively seeking to return to power.57.	Finally  the Congolese delegation must mention the tragedy in the Persian Gulf  which day by day is making Iraq and Iran weaker. And yet  those two countries should derive from their history  their geography and their religion more reasons for unity and cooperation than for hatred and death. We urge them to end their hostilities  which in no way serve the immediate or long-term interests of their respective peoples.58.	A few moments ago  when we expressed the wish to see all resources of the spirit and of human knowledge placed at the service of ends other than death and destruction  we were obviously thinking mainly of the $800 billion which are spent every year to make weapons  fuel hotbeds of crisis and carry on the crazed arms race even in outer space.59.	Several years ago a great deal of hope was placed on the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. We encourage any effort that is likely to lead to complete disarmament under real and effective control. 60.	With the end to the policy of detente clearly shown by the concern in Europe over the strengthening of the destructive potential in that continent  we must fear the consequences for the entire world of a prolonged deterioration in the relations between the blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.61.	The widespread distrust due to that state of tension characterized by the persistence and outbreak of localized conflicts is compounded by the trend to the proliferation of nuclear weapons  a trend supported by certain questionable theories on the possibility of a limited nuclear war.62.	In this area more than in others urgent action is required; and action means above all negotiation in order to bring about detente without waiting to reach an unlikely position of strength.63.	The responsibility incurred by the generation of this last quarter century is all the more serious since it is borne by men who have the necessary means of improving the living conditions of all the inhabitants of the earth and who have rules of international conduct excluding the use of force as a means of settling disputes.64.	The essential function of the United Nations system is to ensure the realization of man's aspirations through these means and rules. Therefore  we should everywhere encourage those ideals that are likely to bring peoples closer together and ensure mutual understanding and the adoption of confidence-building measures.65.	The Congo's understanding of the establishment of a new information and communication order is based on this concept of an increasingly shrinking world  a world of solidarity. The policies and activities carried out in this connection in UNESCO  under the competent leadership of its Director-general  Mr. Amadou Mahtar M'Bow  enjoy the full support of my country. Itâs regrettable indeed that lately UNESCO should have been subjected to intolerable pressures. The universality of UNESCO and the at times impassioned tone of its debates do not  in our view  run counter to its basic commitment to be fully at the service of mankind. It is that faith in mankind that prevents us from losing hope in institutions such as UNESCO or the United Nations itself.66.	On the eve of the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  one cannot fail to recall the curious fate of man today: prey to disorders of all kinds and victim of his own works. This anniversary of the Organization willâperhaps as an accident of historyâcoincide with the one hundredth anniversary of the Balkanization of Africa by the 1885 Berlin Act and the thirtieth anniversary of the Asian African Conference  held at Bandung in 1955. The time has thus come for us Africans to take stock of what has been achieved by the OAU in its struggle for the total liberation of our continent  and for the rest of the world to assess the efforts that have been made in the search for the peace and wellbeing of peoples.67.	These various landmarks in the history of peoples should  among other things  lead the United Nations to ponder upon the future evolution of mankind  Such an approach to the international situation  including national concerns and actions for the benefit of mankind as a whole  should give food for thought to all those whose activities at the national and international levels are in flagrant contradiction with lofty statements of intent made in various places on questions of vital importance affecting mankind. We believe that it is necessary for attitudes  behaviour and actions everywhere in the world to be in keeping with the ideals of peace  freedom and prosperity without which the United Nations would be an institution without purpose.68.	But we all know that mankind still needs the United Nationsâprovided  of course  its actions in practice produce the beneficial effects and the positive impact peoples need to live in peace"
"31",1519,"COL",39,1984,"ï»¿It is a good omen indeed  and Colombia is very pleased  that the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly should be presided over by so distinguished a person as Mr. Paul Lusaka  one of the most eminent leaders of African unity. From the very beginning  Zambia and Colombia have shared the ideals of independence defended by the United Nations Council for Namibia  so wisely guided by Mr. Lusaka.219.	We should also like to congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca  who worked so excellently during the last session of the General Assembly. We agree with him on the ideals of peace which have taken shape in the Contadora Group.220.	I take this occasion to welcome the State of Brunei Darussalam as a new Member of the United Nations.221.	I also congratulate the Secretary-General on the report on the work of the Organization which he has presented to the Assembly for consideration  in fulfilment of the guiding role entrusted to him by the Organization.222.	Only 15 years remain before mankind embarks upon the third millennium of our era. This century has been characterized by sharp confrontations and by wars  but also by the most dynamic technological and cultural progress. Yet  equitable development and peace still elude vast segments of the world.223.	Many of the political problems we are now experiencing stem from the distribution of power since the Yalta agreements  which established spheres of influence that have often clashed with the national interests of States. This situation still persistsâin essentially the same guiseâin Europe  Asia  Africa and Latin America.224.	Indeed  the American continent has not been immune to the effects of this theory of world power. Over the past several decades we have witnessed the imposition of dictatorships against the popular willâtotalitarian regimes that have disregarded lawful means of expression. As is well known  the advent of such regimes  of the left or of the right  has invariably been the prelude to constant violations of human and other basic rights.225.	We must  therefore  establish a policy which will protect mankind from ideological polarization involving violent confrontation. This can be done only by advocating the sound principle of pluralism as the essence of dialogue and as recognition of differences of opinion.226.	It was that concept which prompted my country  in all good faith  and in co-operation with Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  to strive to prevent open confrontation in Central America and thus avert the social and economic upheaval that would result from a fratricidal war bound to have grave consequences for the stability of our continent.227.	What we advocate for the region is the promotion of democratic systems  free interplay of political parties  respect for the rights of others  and tolerance as the corner-stone of the political process. This position stems from the fact that by peaceful means we have overcome our temporary differences with our sister States of Latin America. Hence  we cannot believe that armed confrontation or an internationalization of the problems of the region is the way to a brighter futureâone which we truly desireâfor a continent made up of countries characterized more by similarities than by differences. That is why we ask the nations gathered here to give their political backing and support to the current peace efforts of the Contadora Group.228.	Twenty days ago  the Foreign Ministers of Mexico  Panama  Venezuela and Colombia submitted Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  the main sections of which emphasize the non-use of force  non-interference in internal affairs and respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty. The Act proclaims the need to restore peace and confidence in the region by means of the right of peoples freely to select the kind of political  economic and social system best suited to their own interests.229.	To that end  the Contadora Act establishes that no territory shall be utilized for acts which violate the sovereign rights of other States. We advocate the creation  promotion and strengthening of democratic systems by means of efforts at national reconciliation  with a view to achieving lawful popular participation in political agreements.230.	In that document on peace and development we also advocate the implementation of agreements by means of a relaxation of tension and the promotion of confidence. Hence we have specified the functions of the Verification and Control Commission for Security Matters  composed of four commissioners  representing States known for their impartiality  who will verify the dismantling of foreign military installations. Furthermore  we ask for the immediate withdrawal of the foreign advisers involved in training and in operations. In addition  the signatory countries are requested to abstain from conducting within their territories activities designed to destabilize Governments in the region.231.	There is now a real possibility of an agreement that will make it possible for the Central American States to tackle their own development problems without internal or external threats of war. We have come before the United Nations in the hope of finding support from the Organization  which was established precisely to preserve peace.232.	It would be naive to deny that the serious economic problem affecting the entire region of the continent is at the root of the crisis gripping Centra! America. One of the objectives of the meeting to be held at San Jose  Costa Rica  at the end of this week is the convening of the Foreign Ministers of the member countries of the European Economic Community [EEC]  Spain and Portugal  together with their counterparts from Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras  Nicaragua  Mexico  Panama  Venezuela and Colombia  to discuss possible formulas for direct economic assistance and other forms of co-operation so that this region of Latin America may have better prospects of development.233.	I cannot let pass this opportunity to commend the attitude adopted by the 10 member countries of the EEC  along with Spain and Portugal  in their desire to participate in a solution based upon the support of all nations of goodwill in the search for genuine political balance and for the diversification of economic opportunities.234.	The countries members of the Contadora Group  in compliance with the mandate entrusted to them last year  have this afternoon reported to the Secretary-Genera! on the work they have accomplished and on the progress of their talks. We have submitted the revised Contadora Act to be circuited as an official Assembly document. We also intend to inform the Security Council  in compliance with the provisions of its resolutions.235.	In addition  the Contadora Group will submit a draft resolution for discussion by the General Assembly  thereby complying with the provisions of the resolution adopted by the Assembly at its last session entitled ""The situation in Central America: threats to international peace and security and peace initiatives""236.	Once the Contadora Act  which has met with broad support from the countries of Central America  has been signed  and once we have received the final comments from those Governments  an additional protocol will be opened for signature by all countries. It will reflect in concrete legal terms the unanimous support the international community has given to the Contadora process from its very inception. The adherence of the super-Powers and the industrialized countries to the Act is especially necessary in order that our objectives may be successfully attained. Nor is it superfluous to add that it will be solely and exclusively the political will of the signatory States  free from any interference  that will decide the fate and future of the region.237.	In this same context of the constant search for peace on all levels  the Government I have the honour to represent here  headed by its President  Belisario Betancur  has embarked with special resolve upon a labour of peace for the benefit of all its citizens.238.	It is a special characteristic of my country's present Administration that we are practising at home what we preach in the international arena as a solution for Central America. It is fitting that this should be so  since political leaders are often subject to criticism for the lack of consistency that is perceived between what is preached at the international level and the actions that their Governments in fact take.239.	Colombia is confident that  as the very essence of democracy  dialogue is better suited to national interests than confrontation and unbridled struggle. We have carried out a policy based on ""national dialogue"" in which our political system has never been threatened  much less our institutions and our legitimately established authorities  which have rightly been praised on all sides.240.	I should now like to draw the Assembly's attention to one of the issues that is of greatest importance to the international community  namely  foreign debt. At a recent meeting we discussed the difficulties of strengthening the democratic system if the adverse consequences of indebtedness were allowed to persist and if Latin America remained subject to a constant drainage of its resources that are being transferred to the creditor countries and thereby creating effects that are clearly disastrous for employment  production and growth.241.	The Latin American region  far from having progressed  has in 1983 and thus far this year regressed to 1976 levels. In other words  all the political. financial and social efforts of the past eight years have been in vain. The widely publicized recovery of certain industrialized countries remains confined to their economies. The passage of time has thus confirmed that we were right when we stated in 1981 that recovery in the North would not automatically generate recovery in the South.242.	We are forced to reflect on the futility of the efforts of the Organization in sponsoring the first and Second United Nations Development Decades  six sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the development of the new international economic order  and the promulgation of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which today  given the crisis in the developing world  seem to be mere historic facts.243.	Latin America now transfers 3 per cent of its gross national product to the developed countries. Over the past three years  this has represented a capital loss of almost $50 billion. How paradoxical this seems when we read the commitments made in the 1960s by which the industrialized countries were to transfer 1 per cent of their gross national product to the developing countries. We have rechanneled and rendered futile the real efforts of eight years and have derogated the political efforts of a quarter of a century.244.	Hence  and for good reason  on 21 June of this year  11 Latin American countries met at Cartagena de Indias to consider carefully and effectively the political and material consequences of the heavy burden of a $350 billion indebtedness and in order at the same time to find  for the purpose of individual renegotiations  areas where problems converge and where solutions might be shared  to evaluate them together  not to propose either a unilateral moratorium or the oft-mentioned debtors' club  but rather to work out the best way to fulfil our financial commitments and meet our financial obligations through the reinitiation of a development process that has been allowed to stagnate in our region.245.	The validity and timeliness of the Cartagena Consensus	will be proved either by success in dialogue or by the bankruptcy of debtors and creditors if that dialogue is not achieved. It highlighted as main points of analysis and discussion the need to find real levels of interest rates consistent with the growth of the world economy and the ability of the debtors to pay; the need to establish special compensatory facilities to cover the overhead caused by present financial conditions; the need to make the credit terms of the multilateral financial agencies more flexible; the urgent need for the IMF to contribute to the creation of a new world liquidity aimed at alleviating the debt burden and opening markets through the elimination of protectionist barriers.246.	The first follow-up meeting to the Cartagena Consensus was held at Mar del Plata just two weeks ago. There  in spite of the optimism of the communications media and of some Governments of developed countries over the temporary success of some individual renegotiations  we concluded that no substantive solution had yet been found to the indebtedness problem. As was stated by the negotiators themselves  the rope has loosened a bit but the knot is still not untied. In these circumstances  we find ourselves faced with the need to invite the developed community to establish a direct political dialogue with the Governments of the debtor countries. Only governmental decisions on all sides with great foresight can save the world economy from strangulation in the near future. 247.	My country wishes to reiterate in the Assembly its interest in the proposed dialogue. We cannot imagine that this mechanism  which has so often saved mankind from its deepest crises  might through fear or lack of understanding be disqualified as a means of achieving lasting solutions to the problem. Recent rises in the rate of the dollar demonstrate that it is urgent for all countries  including the industrialized countries  to study the international financial problem together.248.	On 10 August 1984  at Quito  as was very eloquently stressed this morning by the President of Venezuela  the Presidents of Bolivia  Ecuador  Venezuela and Colombia and the Vice- Presidents of Nicaragua and Panama declared that the traffic in and illicit use of narcotic drugs was a threat to the public health of peoples  affecting their development and posing a constant danger of subversion.249.	They also recognized that the narcotics traffic is an activity planned and carried out at the international level through organizations having vast resources and that the struggle against it must be waged equally by producer and consumer countries and must include concerted international action. Towards that end  there is a need for a specialized international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  which would declare narcotics traffic to be a universal crime  establish action at the world level to combat it and create an assistance fund for the producer countries that are endeavouring at great cost to eradicate it.250.	Colombia has suffered from this scourge at an incalculable cost  to the extent that this year it brought about the death of its Minister of Justice  cruelly assassinated by the drug underworld  which he was valorously combating.251.	My Government is continuing that combat  but it knows full well that that trade would not exist if the consumer countries were to tackle it with equal energy. This is why we propose to the Assembly that a pitched and universal war be waged against traffic in narcotics.252.	At the thirtieth session of the General Assembly  in 1975  Colombia for the first time referred^ to the need for a legal definition of outer space  and in particular the need to ensure the rights of the equatorial countries to the limited natural resource of the geostationary orbit  which has assumed extreme importance as a result of accelerated technological and scientific advances  the new industrial potential of outer space and the risks of its militarization.253.	In the Legal Sub-Committee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  meeting at Geneva from 19 March to 6 April 1984  we submitted  on behalf of the equatorial countries  draft general principles governing the geostationary orbit  which the Group of 77 consider to be a good basis for negotiation. The draft principles represent a serious legal statement having broad scientific support; they urge that the resource be placed at the service of mankind and that the present situation of monopoly and inequity be redressed. In 1982  at our initiative also  the new International Telecommunication Convention  adopted by the Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union  held at Nairobi  included recognition that there are countries such as ours that have a special geographical situation.254.	The growing concern of the developing countries over the prevailing congestion of frequencies and in certain orbital positions has led to the convening of a World Administrative Conference of Space Radio communications  which we hope will deal with all these issues in a spirit of justice.255.	Just as we have contributed to the definition of the law of the sea  a successful endeavour of the international community  we believe that at present we must in the same spirit establish the laws of outer space  taking duly into account the special circumstances of the equatorial countries and recognizing the needs of the developing countries.256.	In the effort to strengthen peace and avoid the destruction of civilization  Colombia believes it is making a concrete contribution with its proposals on the regulation of the geostationary orbit  and we invite the spokesmen of the space Powers to explore the path towards harmony and consensus formulas. We want outer space to be a way of reaching our shared destiny and never a springboard for destruction  hatred and war.257.	We have repeated  almost to excess  the way in which my country understands and puts into practice its belief in the ideology of the purest humanism. We have never taken up arms except in defence of our territorial integrity. None of the sister countries bordering oursâin the Caribbean as in the Pacific  on the Orinoco as on the Amazonâcan say that we have called into question the sanctity of treaties and good faith in their fulfilment  Today  as in the past  we advocate acceptance  urbi et orbi   of the express commitment of a State.258.	That is why we strongly reject interference or military intervention by one country in the affairs of another  whether in Afghanistan  Kampuchea or Namibia  in Mozambique  Angola or Chad  in Nicaragua  El Salvador or Honduras. Wherever such activities have occurred we have seen a succession of countless corpses and injustices  as well as misery  in various continents  leaving a trail of hatred  pain and insecurity for the human race.259.	We must affirm here that foreign troops and military advisers must return to the camps from which they came. If we want every State to be the master of its own wealth  the architect of its own economic development and the creator of its own cultural identity  each must be able with complete autonomy to follow its own course towards peace  justice and progress.260.	We have defended the right to be different  without affecting the universality of international organizations.261.	We are concerned about the situation in the Middle East  which is why we call for a solution recognizing the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State  without calling into question the existence of the State of Israel and its desire to live in peace within its own borders. That is what we also hope for Lebanon  where we should like to see the restoration of the peace and harmony that characterised that nation for so many years  so that there may be no more bloody acts against humanity such as those that we have witnessed with horror recently.262.	Similarly  we stress that Great Britain and Argentina should once again sit down at the negotiating table to resume the dialogue  unilaterally interrupted  which will make it possible to reconcile Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands with the interests of their inhabitants.263.	We welcome the resumption of relations between Spain and Guatemala  announced on 22 September in our capital  Bogota  after the successful mediation of the President of Colombia.264.	It has rightly been said by representatives of all the schools of thought into which today's international politics are divided that the arms race between the two major Powers has gone beyond the bounds of rationality. Simple logic would prompt us to reflect on the madness of stockpiling enough weapons to destroy the enemy 10 times over. Where can this frenetic and absurd race lead  if not to total destruction?265.	Let us pause to reflect on many reasons to celebrate in the near future the triumph of life over death  to sow peace in fields now devastated by war and to guarantee the existence of the millions of human beings who share this planet with us  so that the intelligence of man shall never be so evil or perverse as to prefer nuclear holocaust over the expectations of progress and fraternity among all the peoples of the world.266.	A year ago  in this same Hall  at the Assemblyâs thirty-eighth session  President Belisario Betancur stated that: ""Peace is not achieved solely by the abolition of the arms race; it is necessary for us to disarm in spirit and in action""267.	We do not want mankind of today and the future to awaken to a nuclear threat that has become an obvious  unchangeable fact. That is why  together with Chile  Peru and Ecuador  we protested against the nuclear tests carried out in the South-East Pacific  tests that endanger the marine ecosystem of those regions of the southern seas. If  as we were haughtily told  those tests have no effect on the marine environment of those regions  why were they not carried out in the seas near the coasts of those conducting them? My country is sure that it is joined by the overwhelming majority of those represented here in supporting the idea of a nuclear agreement  as mentioned by President Reagan in his statement here giving the world hope of arriving safe and sound in the third millennium of our era.268.	We express the following thought against all types of injustice. How can we not support the rights of the Namibian people in its struggle for independence? Or how can we not support the black race  which has not given up its legitimate appeal for an end to the unnatural practices of apartheid in South Africa? How can we forget the millions of innocent refugees who die at the hands of mercenaries of authoritarian  violent regimes or who are defenceless victims in the waters of the Pacific?269.	Colombia supports everything that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees can do in this regard  in the hope that his work will help millions of human beings throughout the world. We must study means that will guarantee them a return to their own countries  with respect for their personal integrity and with no danger to their lives.270.	Likewise  we ask that the question of the Korean peninsula be resolved by peaceful means  through dialogue between the parties directly concerned  so that negotiations may be resumed without hostility.271.	The world today is on a razor's edge  threatened on all sides by the military confrontation of the two blocs. That is why the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries is necessary. The Movement  of which Colombia is a member  is needed in order that the world shall no longer be a battlefield for those vying for supremacy. We welcome the policy that stems from the foresight of Marshal Tito  Prime Minister Nehru and President Nasser  which inspired dozens of newly-independent countries to think for themselves  to struggle for their freedom  to define their own political  economic and social system with universal values.272.	It has rightly been said that the United Nations was established on the basis of two principles involving the very fate of the human condition  principles intended to save mankind from annihilation. The first concerns the right of States to have their territorial integrity respected  as a basis of international law  together with recognition of their autonomy and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The second principle concerns the progressive development and improvement of the standard of living of the various nations of the world.273.	There can be no doubt that the Organization has partially fulfilled its purpose in respect of decolonization; in affirming the principles of economic and social justice; and in serving as a political forum  so that all ideas may be heard  since politics consists to a large extent in reaching understanding with the adversary. My country  as a peace-loving country  as a signatory at San Francisco of the Charter of the United Nationsâwhose principles continue to inspire us to seek agreements such as those sought by the Contadora Groupâwould like to propose a return to those principles. We would like to propose that we make of them a constant practice  a daily endeavour  an imperative for all men of good will.274.	A return to principles is a sound policy  above all at a time when  in the midst of grim expectations  we lose our way and no longer find the compass at hand. There is no doubt recognition of the fact that this community of nations  based  as is any other  on respect for the rights of others  as was emphasized by Juarez  and on tolerance for other ideas  remains a valid system for the airing of disputes among States. Never before have we found such validity in the words of the French philosopher who described a decent way of life and of thinking which  if applied strictly and with understanding  could be a way of shared existence for all countries: ""I disapprove of what you say  but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""275.	In this statement  my country has endeavoured to share with the Assembly its highest ambitionâpeace; but we fear that we may be alone  that in this tower of Babel  this confusion of languages  not only are words different but also the concepts that they express. We must recognize that for the developed world  the socialist and capitalist countries  peace is a concept closely related to disarmament and the need to prevent a nuclear holocaust. It is  in a word  the solution of the East-West conflict. For the developing world  however  that third world which includes three quarters of our planet  peace is a concept which is inevitably linked to those of poverty  hunger and injustice â in other words  it means a solution to the North-South conflict. 276.	Colombia wishes to invite the international community to work together to find a common denominator for the East-West and North-South conflicts  so that we may all arrive at the same idea of peace and therefore unite all our energies in order to achieve peace  in progress and justice  for all peoples."
"32",1560,"COM",39,1984,"ï»¿I wish first of all to join all the speakers who have preceded me in sincerely congratulating Mr. Paul Lusaka on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is convinced that his eminent qualities and long diplomatic experience at both the national and the international level guarantee the success of our work. My delegation rejoices at the choice of a worthy representative of our African continent and of a brother country  Zambiaâwith which my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  maintains close and friendly ties of cooperationâas President of the present session. We wish him every success in carrying out his heavy but inspiring task and assure him of our full co-operation.157.	We also thank his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for the skill and wisdom with which he carried out the functions of President of the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session.158.	I wish to pay a special tribute to the Secretary- General  for his tireless  unceasing efforts to defend the sacred principles of the Organization and to preserve peace in the world.159.	My delegation welcomes to our midst the State of Brunei Darussalam  whose admission to membership strengthens the universal character of the Organization. We assure its people of our friendship  wish them every success as an independent nation and are ready to establish with them frank and mutually beneficial co-operation in all areas.160.	We meet here again in this forum to reassess  as we do each year  the work done by the Organization since the thirty-eighth session and also to sketch out a picture of the world political and economic situation.161.	To our great regret  we are forced to acknowledge that not only have our efforts been slow in yielding results but that  far from having improved  the international situation  both political and economic  has considerably worsened. Indeed  all over our planet  hotbeds of tension persist and in some instances show a tendency to spread. The increasing super-Power rivalry as well as the unbridled arms race do not contributeâquite the contraryâto relaxing the climate of tension that prevails in international relations. Any hope we might have had of the abatement of the economic crisis was quickly dashed. And  as always  it is the weakest countries  in particular the countries of the third world  that are bearing the heavy cost of this tragic situation. In one place and another  might prevails over right  and fait accompli replaces dialogue and joint effort. In other words  in a world in such turmoil  the role the Organization must play is even more important. It must play a primordial and capital role if we want to avoid our planet being subjected to a new warâwith consequences that everyone agrees would be disastrous for the very survival of the human race.162.	In Africa  certain hotbeds of tension remain explosive and are of the greatest concern to the OAU  as well as to the international community as a whole. In southern Africa  although certain recent eventsâ such as the Nkomati Agreement 8 the motivations for which we can understandâhave contributed to lessening the tension to a degree  the overall situation in that region none the less remains very precarious. Indeed  Namibia has still not attained its independence  despite the relevant resolutions of the Organization  and that country is still being illegally occupied. My country  which categorically condemns the inhuman system of apartheid  reaffirms its total support for the struggle being waged by the Namibian people for their independence under the leadership of their sole  legitimate representative  SWAPO. We remain convinced that only a prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will make it possible to achieve the peaceful decolonization of Namibia.163.	For the time being  it is up to the international community to take the measures necessary to guarantee the existence and independence of the front-line countries that are experiencing a constant threat of destabilization.164.	The situation in Chad calls for very special vigilance. Indeed  that country  a founding member of the OAU  has for 17 years been living through the tragedy of a civil war that is leaving it torn apart and in ruins. That is why my country welcomed with great satisfaction the agreement on complete and simultaneous disengagement that was signed by France and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We dare to hope that  once foreign forces have left Chad  the leaders of N'djamena and the opponents of the regime of President Hissein Habre will manage to evidence reason and wisdom in sparing the people of Chad further futile suffering in order to begin rebuilding their country.165.	With regard to Western Sahara  my country fully subscribes to the decisions taken at the eighteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Nairobi in June 1981  and that it remains convinced that a satisfactory solution to this serious problem involves the implementation of the resolution calling for the organization of a referendum on self-determination by the people of that country. In that connection  my country welcomes the commitment made here at this very rostrum on 27 September 1983  at the 8th meeting of the thirty- eighth session  by King Hassan II of Morocco to abide by the results of such a referendum.166.	My country remains concerned  as do other countries in the region  over the continued strengthening and increase of the military presence in the Indian Ocean. Such a situation  further exacerbated by the continuing rivalry between the great Powers  is creating a climate of explosive tension that is of concern to the littoral countries. Desirous of preserving peace and security in that region  my country unreservedly supports the idea of establishing a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean  in keeping with the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  and we reiterate our hope that the international conference scheduled for that purpose will be convened at Colombo.167.	For more than 30 years  the Middle East has frequently been shaken by murderous wars and no end is yet in sight. As we have already stated many times in the Assembly  there can be no doubt that it is Israel's intransigence  dictated by its annexationist and expansionist plans  that stands in the way of a lasting solution to this problem.168.	The Israeli Government's policy in the occupied Arab territories and the mistreatment daily meted out to the indigenous population of those territories clearly demonstrate that the Zionist entity has no intention of implementing the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations. So long as Israel persists in its attempts to destroy by any means available to it the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  there can be no lasting peace in that region. I should like to reaffirm here once again my country's unswerving support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the PLO.169.	Despite the many problems that still persist in Lebanon  problems that are the consequences of a lengthy civil war  the situation in that country has improved greatly  and once again there is every reason for hope. We feel that the plan adopted by the new Israeli coalition Government for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon  if it is translated into deeds  would greatly contribute to the establishment of peace in that country. My country hopes  therefore  that that plan will be rapidly implemented so that there may be a return to normal life in the tortured land of Lebanon.170.	My country watches with great sadness the continuing fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  two neighbouring Muslim and non-aligned States. Tens of thousands of men  women and children have already fallen on the field of battle in that bloody war. We appeal once again  solemnly and urgently  to both belligerents to cease hostilities forthwith and to replace hatred and intransigence with wisdom and reason. In this connection  we hail the offers for a cease-fire that have been made many times by the Iraqi Government  and we urge the Iranian Government to accept them  convinced as we are that in that war  which is as futile as it is absurd  there can be neither victor nor vanquished.171.	The question of Cyprus continues to be included in the agenda of the General Assembly. My country  for its part  has always been m favour of a just and lasting solution that can preserve the peace  unity and sovereignty of Cyprus. We believe  nevertheless  that such a solution  in order to be acceptable to all  must of necessity take into account the legitimate aspirations of both the Greek and the Turkish communities. We encourage the two Governments  Greek and Turkish  to persevere with their negotiations in order to reach a satisfactory solution that will preserve the interests of both communities affected by this problem.172.	In Asia  foreign interference is continuing and hinders solutions to the problems presented by the hotbeds of conflict that have for many years shaken that region. In spite of the numerous resolutions adopted by the United Nations  foreign armed forces continue to occupy Afghanistan illegally  thereby forcing more than 3 million people to flee into exile. If this situation were to continue  it could seriously threaten world peace and security. We appeal urgently for the withdrawal of foreign troops from' Afghanistan and reaffirm once again our support for the brotherly Afghan people.173.	With regard to Kampuchea  we note with deep disappointment that the States involved in the occupation of that country continue to ignore the appeals made by the international community and the decisions of the General Assembly calling for the immediate  unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. The people of Kampuchea must be able to choose in complete freedom the system of government they desire and finally to achieve peace and freedom.174.	The situation in the Korean peninsula has not yet been resolved. My country notes the commitment of the States of the North and of the South to reach an agreement on the independence and peaceful reunification of the country. In this regard  we support the idea of direct negotiations between the two Governments as essential for the attainment of a happy and successful solution of this serious problem. We also feel that the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Korea  and even of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  would greatly contribute to the search for the desired solution  namely  the reunification of the country.175.	The world economic situation is not much more promising than the international political situation  which I have briefly outlined. Indeed  beset on all sides by many problems which are both cyclical and structural  the developing countries  in particular the non-oil-producing developing countries and  among them  the weakest in the world  the least developed countries  face a situation which is often desperate.176.	Indeed  the developing countries face a continued fall in the prices of their raw materials  thus reducing their export income and thereby the resources available to the State at a time when the burden of indebtedness  made heavier by the skyrocketing dollar  is becoming less and less bearable. This crisis does not spare the fragile economies of the least developed countries. It seriously accentuates their underdevelopment and makes more difficult their access to international financial markets  where there is an ever-greater tendency to lend only to the richest.177.	My country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  which is one of the least developed countries  suffers particularly from the harmful effects of this crisis. Indeed  an island country with very limited resources  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  in spite of the efforts at rehabilitation which have been undertaken since 1978  has suffered a continued fail in its export income  which has clearly involved a very substantial drop in its purchasing power. In order to overcome those difficulties  to get back to the path of growth and to improve the living standards of the population  the Comorian Government  under the enlightened leadership of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane  has drawn up a development plan based on the recommendations of the new programme of action  the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos. The fundamental purpose of that plan is both to improve as quickly as possible the living conditions of the population and to reduce the dependence of the country as regards food  technology and finance. Therefore  the plan envisages accelerated  balanced growth of national production through the rational and intensive use of the resources of the country. Within the framework of the liberal option chosen by the Government  that task will be entrusted mainly to private enterprise and the State will be responsible for providing the infrastructures and the basic studies and establishing appropriate structures and institutions.178.	The major priorities are still those defined in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s  which the Government presented to the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris from 1 to 14 September 1981  namely: food self-sufficiency  ending economic isolation  reducing energy dependence  satisfying water needs and developing human resources. Those same goals are contained in the national document which the Comorian Government prepared and submitted to the countries and international organizations which participated in the first international solidarity conference for the development of the Comoros  which was held at Moroni  our capital  from 2 to 4 July 1984.179.	By the overwhelming response to our appeal  the many countries and bodies which were kind enough to participate actively in that conference not only showed their solidarity with and confidence in the Comorian Government and people  but also acted in line with the resolutions of the Organization regarding assistance to the Comoros. This is thus a happy opportunity for me today to offer them once again  on behalf of the Government and people of the Comoros  our sincere thanks and our deep gratitude for their contribution to our development effort.180.	The first international solidarity conference for the development of the Comoros was a great success in terms of the quality of the documents presented. The credit for this must clearly go to the international bodies  especially UNDP  and to the many friendly countries for their unstinted efforts. The very positive results of that conference encourage us to redouble our own development efforts. A great step has just been taken  but an enormous amount remains to be done.181.	The Comoros  which are peaceful and stable islands  will not be able to go forward without increased and sustained assistance from the international community. The Comorian Government  firmly committed to the spirit of enterprise  appeals to all those who can make a contribution to our work of reconstruction.182.	I cannot conclude my statement without referring before the Assembly to a question which is of the greatest concern not only to the Comorian people and Government but also to the entire African continent  and even to the entire international community. I am of course referring to the problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte. As members know  this question is still on the agenda of the General Assembly and will so remain until it is satisfactorily settled. This year again it will be the subject of a specific debate. We shall return to that subject in detail when the time comes.183.	Today  without going into too much detail on this subject  I should like to inform members that the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization and by regional organizations involved in this question have not been implemented. That explains the deep concern of the Comorian people  because this problem has lasted too long and while it persists the Comorian people will be in the tragic situation of a divided nation  a nation that cannot develop and flourish in perfect harmony.184.	We believe that  because of the age-old links of friendship between France and the Comoros and the goodwill which the Comorian side has constantly shown  this problem should already have been solved. The situation in Mayotte today benefits only those sad  nostalgic individuals for whom the return of Mayotte to the midst of the entire Comorian nation would signify a loss of their grip on and their political and economic domination of the island. There is no doubt that the interests of those people are diametrically opposed to those of the local population of Mayotte. Those people  in our view  must be denounced  just as their ambitions and their domination must be ended.185.	In this connection  we welcome the statement made recently by a senior official of the French Government in which he publicly and explicitly recognized the soundness and legitimacy of our claims. That statement  like other statements made by French officials at the highest level  confirms  if confirmation is needed  the justice of our cause. That is why we feel that it is time to go beyond short-term measures and take the decisive step that will lead to the settlement of this problem.186.	The Comorian people  for its part  remains determined to press its claim  strengthened by the unanimous support of the international community. No argument  legal or strategic  can shake its determination  because for it this is a question not only of right but also of justice.187.	At a time when we are preparing to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Organization  my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  solemnly reaffirms its faith and confidence in it. Naturally  there are conflicts with regard to which the Organization can only admit its impotence when faced with national selfishness and ideological intransigence. Nevertheless  we have every right to say that for us it constitutes the last bulwark against a widespread war the incalculable consequences of which would be fatal for the future of the whole of mankind.188.	My country  for its part  always remains faithful to the great principles of peace  freedom and justice that characterize the charter of the United Nations. It is in this spirit .he Comoros will continue to make its modest contribution to the Organization  so that it can effectively fulfil the noble mission we expect of it  namely  the safeguarding and preservation of world peace and security."
"33",1600,"CPV",39,1984,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure that  on behalf of the delegation of Cape Verde  I extend to Mr. Lusaka our warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His experience in the sphere of diplomacy and  in particular  his deep understanding of the United Nations system and his known competence are for us a guarantee that he will successfully guide the General Assembly in the conduct of its work and the discussion of the items on its agenda  some of which are extremely complex and of vital importance for the harmony of the international community and for the very survival of mankind. His election is a cause of special satisfaction and pride for the African continent and  in particular  for Cape Verde  which maintains ties of solidarity and brotherly co-operation with his country  Zambia. We are therefore delighted to be able to assure him of the co-operation of our delegation in the fulfilment of his delicate task.329.	We should like also to convey to his predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  our full appreciation and our gratitude for the capable and intelligent manner in which he guided the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly and for the sense of balance which he brought to the analysis of the questions debated by the Assembly during his term of office.330.	To the Secretary-General we reiterate our deep appreciation of his commitment and dedication to the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations and for the dynamism which has inspired his action. This has contributed greatly to the strengthening and the effectiveness of the United Nations. We also want to thank him for the enlightened and responsible way in which he has undertaken new initiatives for the peaceful promotion of just solutions to the problems raised by the important questions of our time.331.	Similarly  the admission of Brunei Darussalam as a Member of the United Nations is another step towards the achievement of the Organization's goal of universality. In welcoming this new Member  we are certain that our capacity for collective analysis in the search for peaceful solutions to problems will be enhanced.332.	Cape Verde has been following with deep concern the systematic deterioration of the political climate and the progressive worsening of the international situation. The present climate m international relations and the recent alarming increase in tension between the major Powers have made the international political situation very precarious and disturbing. In several regions of the world we are witnessing the use of force as a means of resolving conflicts among States; military intervention and interference in the internal affairs of States are proliferating  in flagrant violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations; and attacks are being made on the right of peoples to decide freely on their own socio-economic system. The extreme gravity of the situation  which is reaching alarming proportions virtually everywhere  and its inevitable social and political consequences are threatening stability  progress and peace in the world.333.	The arms race  especially the nuclear-arms race  is ever more increasing the possibility of a nuclear confrontation. At the same time  partly as a consequence of that situation  the economic and social gap between the developing and developed countries is widening. The enormous material and human resources consumed every year by the war industry could be used to contribute significantly to alleviating the hunger and underdevelopment affecting the majority of the world's population were they put at the service of the well-being and development of peoples. Given such a situationâwhich has not been experienced since 1945 and which some have likened to real anarchyâit is becoming more evident that in today's world there can be no alternative to the policy of peaceful coexistence  detente and co-operation among States  regardless of their economic and social systems  region or geographic location.334.	Faithful to the principle of peaceful coexistence  Cape Verde has been advocating the practice of dialogue and entente as the only way to solve international conflicts  and it has been categorically and firmly rejecting the positions and attitudes of those who would build a system of international security based on strength.335.	The current crisis situation has also contributed in large measure to the weakening  and now the vulnerability  of international institutions. The idea of an organized world  where war would no longer have a place  was at the root of all the declarations and all the plans developed since 1941  culminating in the San Francisco Conference. The hopes and aspirations of mankind  based on the will to avoid the catastrophe of a new war  led to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations and gave birth to the idea of a collective security system which  in turn  presupposed the renunciation of force by individual States whose protection against foreign aggression would continue to be guaranteed by the United Nations through its enforcement machinery.336.	We are witnessing a blocking of that system by the unjustifiable use of the right of veto  with the consequent bipolarization and political instability of the world. In practice  the Security Council has been rendered incapable of meeting its responsibilities as the guardian of international peace and security.337.	Ineffectiveness in the use of institutional machinery has led to an increase in criticisms recently directed against the United Nations  stigmatizing its incapacity  often even its paralysis  in resolving the great problems facing the international community. While some of these criticisms from certain sectors are meant to denigrate the role of the United Nations and to justify activities contrary to the Organization's goals  others legitimately voice the concerns and questions of a large part of the international community about the proper functioning and effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument for development  co-operation and international peace and security.338.	These criticisms reflect the difficulty and complexity of the present situation and show that  in spite of the difficulties and listlessness  the process of adaptation of the United Nations to new circumstances and requirements is of concern to all those who see in the Organization the best possible  if not the only  instrument for establishing a permanent political dialogue maintaining and strengthening international peace and security.339.	Indeed  in spite of the difficulties and obstacles the United Nations faces  it has demonstrated its usefulness as an instrument available to the international community for pursuing collectively objectives; and it is through the United Nations that for the first time in history small countries have an input in the discussion of world issues.340.	As the international community is preparing to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we think it is time to carry out an in- depth analysis of the system of international institutions. We are convinced that the United Nations constitutes the most valuable instrument for the creation of a climate of peace and co-operation among peoples. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. Its role in this area  in spite of obstacles  has been crucial. Indeed  the results thus far show that the United Nations has become in today's troubled world an irreplaceable instrument for dialogue on the maintenance and strengthening of world peace.341.	It is in that context that we view with concern the present trend to abandon the United Nations as the main instrument in seeking solutions to world problems  for there can be no doubt that the Organization is the appropriate framework for joint efforts and for harmonizing the interests of all  provided we accept the implications of our interdependence. For us  a world without the United Nations would be a set-back for international morality and legality and would give licence to the strongest to rule as they pleased.342.	The survival of mankind and the acuteness of international relations at present make it incumbent upon all of us  without exception  to do everything possible to strengthen our commitment to the United Nations system. Common sense and the need to preserve peace in the world require all countries and the international community in general to be unyielding in defending the United Nations system.343.	The fragility of international relations at present is having an impact on the African continent  worsening conflicts the solution of which must be found within a regional framework without foreign interference. Cape Verde  which is an integral part of that region  is making every effort  along with other African countries  to promote negotiated solutions to conflicts and to preserve our regional unity.344.	The situation in the southern part of the continent remains especially sensitive. With regard to Namibia  South Africa is continuing to defy the international community and United Nations decisions relating to the independence of that Territory.345.	Given its constant concern to make its contribution in the search for negotiated political settlements to international conflicts  the Republic of Cape Verde has done everything in its power to assist interested parties in finding a just and peaceful solution leading to the independence of the Territory of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 433 (1978). It is within this framework and in this spirit that the efforts that Cape Verde has made to facilitate dialogue between South Africa and SWAPO must be understood.346.	Recent developments in the situation in southern Africa can be analysed correctly only if we consider the impasse in the process of independence for Namibia and the attempts at destabilization that must be faced by the countries of the region  with resultant risks to their sovereignty and territorial integrity.347.	Nor can those developments be dissociated from the sincere desire for peace and development on the part of the peoples and Governments of the frontline countries or from their urgent economic needs  which demand action now. The developments also reflect the acute sense of responsibility that motivates the peoples and Governments of those countries.348.	We repeat our condemnation of the system  the baseness of which is repugnant to human conscience and dignity. The denial of their rights on the basis of race  which is the fate of most of the population of South Africa  can only get worse from day to day and lead to further violence such as that which recently brought grief to the martyred South African people.349.	We think that any measure that does not have as its aim the eradication of apartheid and the creation of institutional conditions that would guarantee equality of rights and opportunities for every South African citizen  regardless of race  should be rejected by the entire international community.350.	Decolonization will go down in history as one of the most valuable contributions of the United Nations to the building of a world of freedom and justice. History  none the less  also records in several regions of the world attacks upon the right to self- determination of peoples which have thus far been subject to foreign domination.351.	We would like to express our concern over the situation in other parts of our continent  especially because of the repercussions those events have on regional solidarity.352.	With regard to the situation in Western Sahara  the spirit of consensus which prevailed at the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  must be maintained as the only way to achieve a just solution. Cape Verde renews its appeal to the two parties to the conflict  Morocco and the Frente P0L1SAR10 to join as soon as possible in the search for a satisfactory solution on the basis of respect for the principle of self-determination of the Saharan people.353.	With regard to Chad  we still firmly hope that the urgent need for peace for the martyred people of that country will triumph over external influences and internal dissensions  regardless of their origin or reason. Cape Verde encourages every effort under way in the African context to find understanding among the different parties to the Chad conflict.354.	The Middle East remains one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension in the world because of the continuing bellicose and expansionist policy of the Government of Israel. Cape Verde reaffirms its conviction that peace can be found in that region only if we take due account of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and only if Israel withdraws from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem.355.	In Lebanon  despite recent developments  there has as yet been no possibility of putting an end to the instability and violence that prevail throughout the country. We hope that the Lebanese people will succeed in overcoming that situation and return to a normal life.356.	A war between fraternal peoples continues between Iran and Iraq  the grave consequences of which are reflected in the loss of thousands of lives and the destruction of goods and property acquired with such great effort by the peoples of those countries. Unfortunately  persistent efforts at mediation  which have taken place because of this war  have not yet achieved appreciable results. On the contrary  we see a trend towards the internationalization of the conflict  in view of the fact that it is taking place in a very sensitive region of the world.357.	We view with concern the situation that has developed recently in Central America  and we therefore support the efforts of the Contadora Group to establish conditions that will permit the people of that region to come up with the best formulas for restoring peace and promoting economic and social development.358.	With regard to Korea  it is our opinion that replacing the armistice agreement by a peace agreement would open the way to a negotiated solution between the parties concerned with a view to the peaceful reunification of the territory and re-establishment of the national unity of the Korean people.359.	The situation in East Timor is a typical case of a people deprived of freedom. The territory continues to be occupied by Indonesia in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law. The occupation of the territory  which is an obstacle to the free exercise of the right of self-determination of the Maubere people  should be rejected by the entire international community. Many of us here have in the past experienced the situation which the fraternal people of East Timor are now going through. The most elementary rules of justice impose t n us the moral duty to co-operate in the creation of the necessary conditions for the free exercise of the right to self-determination in this territory. We would like to reaffirm our firm support for the cause of the Maubere people and its avantgarde  the FRETILIN  which has managed  at enormous sacrifice  to maintain a firm and courageous position in the face of the forces of occupation. We would like also to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for the efforts he has made to carry out the mandate given to him by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/30. It is still our hope that in continuing his efforts with the parties concerned  especially with regard to Portugal  which has a special responsibility vis-a-vis the Maubere people and the international community  he will be able speedily to find ways of restoring justice and the rights of people which have been trampled upon by the invasion and occupation of the territory of East Timor by Indonesia.360.	The present international economic situation is the consequence of structural unbalances the repercussions of which have a negative effect on the economy of the developing countries  especially the least developed among them. This situation is reflected in a whole range of negative manifestations which work against the growth and economic development of all countries and increase the vulnerability of the developing countries.361.	This discouraging picture  to which the wide-spread deadlock in the North-South dialogue is no strangerâconstitutes a harsh reality for the developing countries. The efforts of those countries to establish more just economic relations and to build a truly interdependent world have unfortunately not found a response in the attitude of some industrialized countries  which have not shown the political will that is desired in the situation.362.	The most recent manifestation of this absence of political flexibility was found during the negotiations this year within the Committee on the Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and during recent activities in the process of launching global negotiations.363.	The Group of 77  on the basis of the proposal of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  guided by a spirit of cooperation and wishing to contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for launching those negotiations  proposed a two-phased approach. We deeply regret that despite this new demonstration of good will and flexibility on the part of the developing countries  no progress was made during the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly.364.	None the less  we have confidence in the sensitivity of our partners of the North so that we can work together in this difficult but indispensable process of negotiations  of which the North-South dialogue is a part. All of us need to find a common solution to the common problems which affect us all.365.	As a representative of a developing country  I could not fail to express our deep concern over the low level of growth of the economies of the third world countries. The imbalance between economic reality in the developing world and the objectives laid down in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is a challenge to our collective capacity to resolve economic problems which affect a great part of the world population.366.	Africa is the continent which is most dramatically undergoing the effects of the prolonged crisis affecting the world. It is immersed in internal contradictions which are typical of a phase of accelerated change. Africa is undergoing a phase in which it is laying foundations for an economy which will be in keeping with national realities and objectives and will satisfy the aspirations of its peoples. It is therefore no surprise that the crisis should be felt in Africa with special intensity.367.	We are deeply concerned at the alarming proportions of the economic and social deterioration in the African region. It is becoming urgent to seek solutions to meet this situation. Although the main responsibility for solving these problems lies with the African countries themselves which are affectedâ because we are aware that realizing national objectives for economic development is a task which first of all lies with our countriesâwe think that  bearing in mind the collective effort required in the search for a global solution to the most acute problems in the underdeveloped countries  the international community as a whole must give them the necessary support so that they can  within the framework of their own development plans and priorities  get through the critical phase.368.	The emergency situation  particularly in terms of food  requires joint action by the international community. The initiative of the Secretary-General and the appeal of the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to alert world opinion to the critical food situation in Africa are praiseworthy measures and deserve an adequate international response.369.	The profound economic crisis in which the African continent has been plunged requires firm  coherent and immediate action at the national and regional levels  as well as at the international level  with a view to finding integrated solutions to the urgent problems and the development problems.370.	There is no doubt that several factors which have given rise to the present difficult situation in Africa are to be found within Africa itself  but it is no less certain that the international situation has a profoundly negative impact there. We are thus witnessing in our continent an attempt to impose the strategic interests of countries or groups of countries in order to perpetuate relations of domination which are incompatible with the interests of the African countries.371.	In the conviction that the present situation threatens peace and hinders the economic and social development of our countries  we think that Africa must grow stronger in order to overcome the crisis through a collective effort to make co-operation and dialogue the essential instruments in relations between States. But for this effort to be fruitful it must include above all a reduction in the intimal imbalances and distortions which affect the economic and social system of each African country.372.	Last year  at the thirty-eighth session  the President of the Republic of Cape Verde  Mr. Aristides Pereira  in his capacity as Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  made an appeal to the international community to increase its collaboration with the member counties of that regional organization in carrying out programmes for development and to combat desertification. In his statement  the President of Cape Verde hastened to point out  given the extent of the consequences of the drought and the extension year after year of the phenomenon of desertification  the serious dangers threatening the survival not only of the populations of the Sahel area but also  and more and more  of those countries in the peripheral zone which thus far had not suffered such disasters.373.	Over and above an awareness and limited or sporadic interventions  the international community must acquire the necessary means to act effectively and in concert and to assist the peoples and countries affected to face these calamities and to protect other areas from their effects. This should be done by finding global  simultaneous and permanent solutions.374.	In this context  there is clearly a need for the States concerned to define coherent development policies  to find adequate formulas for more active participation by the people  to adapt structures to development needs and  finally  to undertake important actions in the fields of training and research. These measures are necessary because they are decisive factors for diminishing the food shortage  which is going to increase  and also for favouring agricultural production  which has now become a priority for the Sahelian Governments.375.	Several actions have begun for the purpose of mitigating the effects of drought and desertification. Resources have continued to be mobilized by the Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel and the Club of Sahel. Considerable efforts have also been made at the national  regional and international levels. Recently  more sustained attention has been devoted to the question of combating drought and desertification through the work of international meetings held at the initiative of FAO. Moreover  coherent food strategies  as well as integrated development plans  are being progressively implemented.376.	The Inter-State Committee  the Institute of the Sahel  the Agrymeht Centre and other regional bodies are in this sense useful instruments for co-ordination  support and common thinking. They have been called upon to play a more and more important role in integrated regional development and in establishing the necessary conditions for food self-sufficiency and restoring the ecological balance in the Sahel.377.	We firmly believe that  through a united will and solidarity at the local  regional and international levels  we shall succeed in breaking the circle of desertification and drought and bringing about a favourable change in the present situation.378.	In Cape Verde  since independence  we have worked in this area to pursue a policy in harmony with our own concrete reality. To meet drought  which has now become endemic  our efforts have been directed not only towards the preservation of the soil and a systematic reafforestation policy  but also towards the development of our human resources. Popular participation in the fight against erosion and for reafforestation in our country has become a satisfactory approach  in spite of the difficulties created by the persistence of the drought.379.	In this huge effort to overcome the great difficulties imposed by a hostile nature  international assistance has been a fundamental and an indispensable component. We are sure that this effort will continue to find generous support and international solidarity.380.	The world today is a world of glaring paradoxes. One of the paradoxes is characterized by the persistence of hunger and underdevelopment at a time when world production is capable of meeting the needs of the population of the entire earth.381.	The survival of mankind demands a peaceful  unified world in which man is the centre of the great political decisions and the ultimate beneficiary of the moral and material progress which all aspire to. The creation of this world requires the active participation of all."
"34",1644,"CRI",39,1984,"ï»¿It is an honour and a great pleasure for me to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. Your well- known integrity and efficiency  your vast experience and tireless dedication to the United Nations and your excellent work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia ensure the success of this session of the General Assembly  presided over by a distinguished son of the great African continent.40.	Thirty-nine years of commitment and tireless work by the United Nations to wipe out colonialism and promote the self-determination of peoples is reflected at this session by the presence here of Brunei Darussalam  the newest Member State of the Organization. We greet that country and warmly welcome it to the family of sovereign nations.41.	The Secretary-General's work  his concern over the problems of international peace and security and his dedication to the complex duties of his post  as evidenced by his report on the work of the Organization  are internationally recognized and a source of justified pride on the part of the Latin American countries.42.	I have read the Secretary-General's report with real interest. As the representative of a country located in a region threatened by instability and war  I value the ideas and suggestions it contains with regard to matters affecting international peace and security. It is a source of satisfaction and encouragement to Costa Rica to find the Secretary-General  with his high authority  mentioning the original tenets of the Charter of the United Nations in order to confirm the commitment to settle disputes among States by peaceful means and to renounce the use or the threat of the use of force in international relations.43.	The Charter that was signed at San Francisco established  without any doubt  a new international order based on the obligation of all States to stand in solidarity for the maintenance of peace and security. The obvious conclusion is that peace-keepingâas the Secretary-General points outâis an expression of international political consensus and will  without which peace-keeping operations are weak and uncertain.44.	Both out of devotion to the principles of the Charter and because they protect the fundamental aspiration of nations to continue to exist  a small and unarmed nation such as the one I represent has the duty to support the Charter in order that its own security may be safeguarded.45.	When international conflicts are not dealt with in the framework of the solutions envisaged in the Charter  but are the subject of bilateral or unilateral action in which force prevails  there is a serious erosion of the international system  which does great harm to all countries and  above all  to countries such as Costa Rica  which have entrusted their security to internationalism.46.	Hence  I fully share the Secretary-General's concern about the consequences of the failure to observe the principles of the Charter  when the framework they provide are replaced by methods that give priority to the threat or the use of force  so detrimental to the countries that are the victims of it as well as to the international system based on the Charter. The result is that the Charter is irreparably violated.47.	On the basis of those ideas taken from the Secretary-General's report  and because I cannot now refer specifically to each of the serious problems facing the General Assembly at this session  I shall confine myself to stating my country's position on some of those problems  which illustrate the tensions making it impossible to view the international situation with serenity.48.	First  I shall refer to the problem of the Malvinas Islands. The echoes of a war that would never have taken place if international negotiating machinery had been used effectively have died down. Nevertheless  the inter-American system  relations between the Americas and Europe and relations in the Organization require that the parties continue their efforts to deal in a rational and friendly way with the problem dividing them. It should not be difficult for two civilized nations and two democratic Governments to find a solution to their differences that does not prejudice their dignity  their legal position or their history.49.	Costa Rica is particularly concerned at the struggle being waged by the people of Namibia for its independence  which must be granted to it under Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We regard as completely unacceptable and anachronistic the doctrine of apartheid  which the South African Government persists in applying.50.	We regret also that the Korean nation  with an age-old culture and rich traditions and with such a promising future  has not yet been able to overcome the obstacles to its reunification. We believe that it is time for that countryâpreferably reunified  but even dividedâto take its rightful place in the Organization.51.	Of course  our main concern must be for the fate of our own region  Central America. In this respect  we Costa Ricans must bear witness to our commitment to peace and our desire that democracy  well-being and freedom should be promoted in our region.52.	We feel sorrow and pessimism  on the one hand  and hope and optimism  on the other. Since the thirty-eighth session  Central America has experienced more crises  more hatred  more death than in previous years. But  at the same time  the democratic frontier has advanced in Latin America and has reached Central America. The commitment to democracy is deeply rooted in our continent  and Central America is no exception. We rejoice in the fact that today  for the first time in the history of our sub region  there are three civilian Governments that have been elected by the people  and there is talk of holding elections in the other countries.53.	Jose Napoleon Duarte became President of El Salvador as a result of two free processes of consultation with the people. Those processes  held under the critical eye of a large number of observers  represent an advance towards democracy and an unquestionable reaffirmation of Central America's will for democracy  bearing in mind the very difficult circumstances in which they took place. On Monday  the Assembly heard President Duarte put forward the most positive proposals so far for the national reconciliation of a Central American country. That initiative should be welcomed by all Governments and peoples concerned about peace in Central America and the future of that region.54.	The newspapers today carry the news that representatives of the guerrillas have accepted President Duarte's invitation  effectively opening up the possibility of domestic peace for El Salvador.55.	The Government of Costa Rica supports the proposal made from this rostrum yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras that the Central American countries should meet at Tegucigalpa before next week's Contadora meeting. To the extent that  within the spirit of Contadora  we Central Americans regain the initiative in settling our problems among ourselves  we shall have taken steps towards peace and made it possible to take action ourselves  without the need for mediators.56.	The hopes of Central Americans have been raised by the progress of the Contadora effort. Since January 1983  with the co-operation of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  we  the five Central American countries  have been trying to find a remedy to the problems besetting the region. No one could be better fitted to endorse our efforts than our immediate neighbours  who are familiar with the nature and scope of the crisis  are far removed from all claims to hegemony and share the same historical and cultural roots.57.	We have made great progress  culminating in the revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. The Act was a comprehensive effort  and never before had a regional crisis been examined in its political  military  economic and social aspects. The Act is also a bold effort  because it aims not only at reducing the sources of conflict in our region but at promoting the political  economic and social development of our peoples. It is innovative  because it proposes verification of compliance with the commitments entered into when it is signed and because it places the fate of our peoples above the old  narrow concepts of the internal sovereignty of States. In sum  the Contadora process  carried out with full awareness of our history  has looked towards a peaceful  richer and freer future for the peoples of Central America.58.	We said last year that Costa Rica was not a part of the problems of Central America  but that Central America was a part of the problems of Costa Rica. We are continuing to build our nation in peace and democracy. But the peoples of Central America are prey to political instability  war and economic crisis and the painful consequences are felt by us Costa Ricans. This gives us another reason to participate actively in the Contadora process and to fight there  as we have fought throughout our independent life  for institutionality  democratization  respect for human rights and the economic and social development of the whole region.59.	I reiterate from this rostrum our readiness to comply with the obligations imposed upon us by the Contadora Act. Furthermore  I can state that Costa Rica already complies with those obligations  because they are a part of the pacifist and democratic tradition of the Costa Rican people.60.	We believe  however  that the verification and control mechanisms provided for in the Act should be improved and strengthened. We hope that the foresight of the Central American Governments in voluntarily submitting to international verification will have as its reward verification that in all the countries of Central America there is strict observance of the spirit and letter of the Act. We understand clearly  as we are sure the other Central American States do  that the commitments we shall make upon subscribing to the Act are binding and enforceable. The very nature of those commitments explains the need for effective and reliable verification and control.61.	We Costa Ricans are aware that a comprehensive agreement on peace and co-operation in Central America is a fundamental step. But we are also aware that the great harm caused to our region by the international economic crisis  political upheavals  underdevelopment and war can only be remedied with the continued support of the international community. That is why when the President of Costa Rica  Mr. Luis Alberto Monge  travelled to Europe last June he extended invitationsâas the spokesman for Central Americaâto the Conference which was held at San Jose  Costa Rica  on 28 and 29 September 1984. We received in our capital the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the European Economic Community  of Spain and Portugal  of the countries of the Contadora Group and of the Central American States. As the host country  we felt that our ideals and realities were being recognized. We are grateful for the friendship and acknowledgement of the Governments represented at San Jose. At that ministerial meeting  we received European support for the process of democratization in Central America  the restructuring of our common market and our development through increased co-operation programmes.62.	Europe's concern about the fate of Central America is now added to Latin America's  expressed in the Contadora process  and that of the United States  shown by the Caribbean Basin initiative. That European concern was demonstrated by the presence in San Jose of 12 Ministers for Foreign Affairs from Western European democracies. This opens up for Central America the prospect of beginning a new period in its history  characterized by well-being and the full enjoyment of freedoms.63.	The presence of members of the European Economic Community in Central America strengthens the ideal of integration  efforts to achieve which we embarked upon 25 years ago. Besides the triumph over nationalism represented by the establishment of the European Economic Community  the readiness of its members to help Central America shows that the old and obsolete concepts of colonialism have been replaced by a modern concept of co-operation. We are sure that this attitude will find expression in the prompt and successful negotiation of an agreement between Europe and Central America.64.	Although the desirability of creating a more harmonious and just international economic order is recognized  there is a remarkable lack of political consensus which is preventing the dialogue that is needed to make the necessary structural changes to bring about that greater harmony and justice.65.	In approaching the end of this century  we realize that many countries are not in a position to meet the most basic needs of their peoples; others hope barely to halt the deterioration experienced in the living conditions of their peoples. Indeed  the situation in Africa  especially with regard to food  is becoming alarming; and Latin America is entering its fourth consecutive year of economic recession  as part of a crisis the most salient manifestation of which is the external debt. That debt exceeds the $300 billion mark; it represents 36 per cent of the gross domestic product of the region and servicing the debt absorbs 65 per cent of its export receipts. To indicate the degree to which the situation has deteriorated  suffice it to mention that in 1975 the debt represented merely 20 per cent of the gross domestic product and used up only 26 per cent of export earnings.66.	The reasons for the problem have been broadly discussed in various forums and I need not dwell upon them here. I wish to emphasize the fact that attempts to solve the problems that countries are facing in isolation and individually are clearly not sufficient. Furthermore  that has led to a very unjust situation in which the cost of the necessary adjustments is borne exclusively by the debtor countries.67.	In the search for solutions  we should bear in mind not only the cost for the world economy of the fact that developing countries are less able to participate in international trade but also the very high social and political cost that will no doubt be incurred if our countries must continue in a process of internal deflationary adjustments.68.	There is no doubt that Latin American countries are facing up to this crisis with proved responsibility. It is now time for the other actors in this drama to make a comparable contribution to resolve a situation which in fact is a shared responsibility and the solution of which ultimately benefits all. The industrialized countries must adopt forceful measures to reduce interest rates and combat protectionism. Multilateral agencies must contribute more medium-term and long-term resources  and on more favourable terms  to support the programmes of external adjustment and structural change  and the international banking system must continue to provide commercial credit because  if it were not to do so  that would jeopardize those resources already committed.69.	Costa Rica speaks on these issues with a certain degree of authority. In mid-1982  the Government undertook a series of adjustment measures aimed at stabilizing the economy. Those efforts meant that the deficit in the public sector in one year went down from 9.3 per cent of the national product to less than 3 per cent  inflation was reduced from 90 per cent to 19 per cent  and the exchange rate which was 64 colones per dollar was stabilized at about 45 colones per dollar.70.	The crisis has taught the Government of Costa Rica a number of lessons: first  to ascertain the degree of maturity of the Costa Rican people in accepting the impact of the adjustment and the strength of its commitment to the country's democratic institutions; secondly  to understand that recovery and long-term stability are beyond our reach when the meagre possibilities of a small country to handle the situation are reduced even more by an adverse international environment.71.	All Latin American nations have learnt an equally important lesson from this crisis: that it is pointless to try to face up to this situation in isolation. We recognize the urgency of concerted political action at the regional level. In this context  the Quito Declaration and Plan of Action and the more recent Cartagena Consensus represent an effort to give a serious and responsible answer by Latin America to the crisis.72.	I wish to take this opportunity to mention in particular the impact of the crisis on what is dearest to our societiesâchildren. Tragically  one of the results of the adverse economic climate in which we live has been a fall in the indicators which measure the well-being of the young population of the developing world. We must commit ourselves to an effort that would enable us to isolate the impact of the economic cycle on our children. I therefore appeal to the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to mobilize the creativity and necessary resources to find ways in which to protect children and other especially vulnerable groups from the harshness and irrationality of the fluctuations of the international economy.73.	I cannot conclude this statement without making a specific reference to the ideal of the protection of human rights  which has been a constant concern of Costa Rica and its Governments. It seems to me necessary since the United Nations  from the moment of its birth  embarked upon an important task in this field. The Charter was dedicated to that major objective and became a point of departure for the task of making fundamental rights become an international commitment. Then came the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and increasingly concrete and specific international covenants. The Legislative Assembly of my country  which was the first one to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol thereto and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  has just approved the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.74.	Nevertheless  we still note a major omission in that field. The United Nations does not yet have a truly effective mechanism for the defence of human rights. The extraordinary number of documents  declarations and treaties on the subject have not yet given the Organization the power to restore the enjoyment of rights to victims of violation. This does not detract from the merits of the work done by the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee; rather  it is a recognition of the limitations placed upon their work. For our part  Costa Ricans have insisted on imbuing the defence of human rights with an effective structure  despite the fact that we must recognize that many Governments lack the political will to do so.75.	Our sincere concern relates to the fate of peace and security in the world. Recently  the President of Costa Rica mentioned before the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Europe  Central America and the countries of the Contadora Group that when violence comes from above it inevitably leads to violence in the opposite direction  thus altering and destabilizing countries and regions. We can infer from that idea that peace cannot be possible so long as the stifling of the fundamental rights of the human being persists. We Costa Ricans have tried in our own land to avoid phenomena of that type. We are a peaceful and stable society  within the convulsed Central American region  because we have been able to build a society based on respect for human rights. We should like that kind of society to be extended now so that we may have a Central America that is an example and not a cause for concern  that contributes to peace instead of giving rise to problems  that provides first the hope and then the reality of human beings working and striving peacefully for development  free from fear.76.	Because this is linked with the subject of human rights  I cannot fail to appeal for international solidarity with respect to the problem of the more than 600 000 refugees who have been displaced because of the turmoil in Central America. They have been treated generously by the receiving States  but not enough is being done  for this is a problem which exceeds their capacity. The dedication and timely aid of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration and other international agencies represent a form of assistance which we Central Americans appreciate for its full worth. However  we require the help of the international community while  within the framework of Contadora  we promote in the nations to which the displaced persons belong the internal conditions conducive to their return to their lands and their work.77.	Costa Rica proposed that the year 1986 be proclaimed the International Year of Peace. It should be a constant task of the United Nations to call for peace  because this has been the great objective of the Organization since its foundation. The International Year of Peace will be devoted to emphasizing this commitment  at a time when  because of world tensions  it is necessary to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter  in which special prominence is given to the maintenance of peace.78.	In a tribute to that concept the President of Costa Rica  in November of last year  recalling our traditional position on the problems of the region in which we live  proclaimed the neutrality of our country in the face of the military conflicts in the region but pointed out that  because of our democratic commitment  we could not in any way be ideologically neutral.79.	I shall conclude by quoting what the President of Costa Rica said in the formal proclamation of our neutrality:""Costa Rica is not an economic Power; nor can it be. Costa Rica is not a political Power; nor can it be. Costa Rica is not a military Power; nor does it wish to be. Costa Rica is a spiritual Power  because the people practise a true faith in the power of common sense  the power of the will and the power of morality."""
"35",1690,"CSK",39,1984,"ï»¿We congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  welcoming in your person a prominent representative of a friendly  non- aligned country with which we have been developing broad  constructive and fruitful relations. We wish you as well as the Secretary-General every success in your demanding work. We also appreciate the work of your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Enrique Illueca.86.	We welcome Brunei Darussalam as a new Member of the United Nations. We extend to that country our sincere congratulations on its accession to independence.87.	This highest forum of the United Nations meets at a time when peoples of the world are getting ready to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the victory over fascism and militarism and the end of the Second World War. The combined will of nations not to allow a recurrence of such a cataclysm gave birth to the Organization. Czechoslovakia  one of the founding Members of the United Nations  has  since the first moments of its existence  been consistently striving for the implementation of the lofty ideals of its Charter in the interest of maintaining and strengthening world peace and developing all-round co-operation among nations. As early as the first session of the General Assembly  we resolutely advocated the very first general control and reduction of armaments and armed forces  the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes and the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of weapons adaptable then or in the future to mass destruction. At that time  in December 1946  the Czechoslovak delegation stated that it supported without reservation or scepticism the entire relevant resolution and expressed its conviction that the state of the world called for disarmament which would promote the necessary co-operation between all countries of the world.688.	Throughout the ensuing four decades  we have been actively supporting the United Nations in its irreplaceable peace-promoting activities and continue to do so.89.	During this year's successful visit of the Secretary-General to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  we expressed at the highest level our commitment to the cause of the United Nations  as well as our readiness to strengthen its activities and confidence in it. We emphasized that in the present volatile international situation  the peoples need the United Nations as a universal institution of a world system of collective security no less than they did at the time of its establishment. We also stressed that the Organization requires the determination of nations to find just solutions to momentous problems because  as history teaches us  there is no other road to peace but peace. Peace itself is the road  and it can be achieved only through patient  collective efforts every day  through gradual  deliberate building of all- round co-operation among States and consistent strengthening of their mutual confidence and security.90.	Seen from this point of view  this year's general debate so far has been a demonstration of justifiable concern about international developments  which are full of adverse tendencies. Within the short period of the last year  the spiral of the arms race has climbed to unprecedented levels. The stockpiles of nuclear weapons have reached such a tremendous quantity that they are sufficient to bring about multiple general destruction; consequently  there is no reason whatsoever for their further accumulation. The remaining disarmament talks have hardly made any progress. The dialogue has continued to falter. Mistrust among States has increased. There has been open interference in the internal affairs of countries; there have been acts of aggression. The pursuit of the policy of proceeding from a position of force has been intensified. International relations have been further destabilized. Liquidation of so many of the positive achievements from the years of detente has continued.91.	It is the most reactionary circles of imperialism  primarily those in the United States  that we hold directly responsible for such a course of eventsâ those circles which reflect most clearly the interests of the military-industrial complex  those which have been asserting  instead of the much-needed preservation of the military-strategic balance and a gradual reduction in its level  a policy of force  hegemonism  diktat  State terrorism  striving for military superiority  fanning hotbeds of tension  imposing their imperialist demands on other countries and non-compliance with agreements which have been concluded.92.	This truly dangerous situation has been particularly aggravated by the installation of new United States intermediate-range missiles hi Western Europe. The reason for this was the fact that these were weapons of a new quality  first-strike weapons with strategic effects. Their deployment has created a completely new military-strategic and political situation. The Geneva talks have been blocked. The prospects for limiting and reducing nuclear weapons have been substantially worsened. If I had to say from this rostrum last year  at the thirty-eighth session  that ""the Pershing II missiles are to be deployed a mere 180 kilometres from our borders""  then  unfortunately  I have to state now  much to my regret  that they have already been deployed. I must also add that there was nothing for us and our allies to do but to adopt appropriate defensive countermeasures in deploying systems of operational tactical missiles with increased rangeâwhich resulted in the fact  for which we are not to blame  that the European continent has only suffered a loss without making any gain. The balance has been restored at a higher and more dangerous level. The presence of new weapons in Western Europe has not brought any increase at all in security; quite the contrary  it has caused a general decrease in security  prompted the growth of mistrust and tension in relations among States  created further complications on the way to agreement and posed a threat to other regions also within their striking radius and  in the long run  to the whole world.93.	International relations have been considerably aggravated by the continued pursuit of plans aimed at achieving strategic superiority and preparing for a nuclear war in outer space  by the programme to develop and produce means for the militarization of outer space. This space project with ""defensive"" or ""preventive"" purposes to be achieved by the envisaged anti-ballistic and anti-satellite systems has in fact shifted the question of war in outer spaceâin that âsixth ocean""  as it might be called todayâfrom the realm of theory to that of practice. However  a war in outer space would not be an alternative to a war on earth  as some people foolishly believe  but rather a prelude to it.94.	The overall state of affairs  furthermore  has been unfavourably affected by the dangerous statements casting doubt on the post-war settlement in Europe in connection with the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. The authors of these irresponsible utterances  which in essence amount to a refusal to recognize the status quo in Europe  have taken an extremely dangerous step  placing in jeopardy the very foundations of European peace. Everybody knows  after all  that any attempt to revise European borders guaranteed by the entire potential of the community of socialist States is in advance condemned by history to failure.95.	Further deterioration in the situation has been caused by the impact of these utterances on those forces that have not reconciled themselves to the defeat of Nazism and the post-war arrangements in Europe. In fact  we could see what an encouraging effect they had on West German revanchism: how it has been conspicuously revived; how it has defiantly raised its head; how  deplorably  contrary to the agreements concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with Czechoslovakia  the Soviet Union  Poland and the German Democratic Republic  it has raised demands at rallies in Munich and elsewhere for a revision of the post-war arrangement of Europe and its borders; how  arrogantly  it claimed a ""right to a homeland"" or the solution of ""an outstanding German question""âall this with the patronage of the highest representatives of State and Government and in conditions marked by the presence of new medium-range missiles  by the growing military strength of the Bundeswehr and the lifting of limitations on the production of certain types of weapons  including strategic ones.96.	What is required is wisdom  far-sightedness  composure and the ability to look at matters not from the position of force and ideological illusions but in the light of political realities in order to restrain such confrontational steps  eliminate their impact and place barriers in their wayâwhether it be the threat of missiles  war in outer space  attempts to question the post-war settlement or the growth of revanchism.97.	Thus  what is needed is not only a change of tone in the rhetoric but a change of approach; not only gestures but actions; not words but deeds. After all  confidence  too  is indivisible. In other words  in the spirit of the best traditions of the anti-Hitler coalition  it is necessary to display an ability to subordinate ideological prejudices and problems in mutual relations which can be solved to the primary objective criterionâthe fundamental concern of mankind as a whole and of one's own nation for a return to the policy of detente  lasting peace and constructive co-operation.98.	Czechoslovakia  in co-ordination with the other socialist countries  is always ready to contribute to such a course.99.	Unfortunately  the situation is such that for the time being we do not see any indications that imperialism is ready to give up its current policy of force; nor do we perceive any readiness on the part of the United States to undertake concrete action for the solution of current problems and for the sake of a policy of stable  mutually advantageous co-operation.100.	Together with Our allies  we have already expressed our willingness and readiness for such negotiations in a wide-ranging set of important peace initiatives aimed at reaching agreement on the most vital current problems.101.	First of all  there are the proposals contained in the Political Declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  adopted at Prague on 5 January 1983  the joint statement issued in Moscow on 28 June 1983  and the Declaration by the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance at their high-level Economic Conference  held in Moscow from 12 to 14 June 1984. As the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak  stated recently ""through their initiatives and proposals  the States of the socialist community are striving for constructive solutions of international problems  for a return to the path of detente and the settlement of crisis situations and hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world  on the basis of honest and equal negotiations  on the basis of equality and equal security"".102.	At the same time  we are ready to consider and accept any idea  any proposal that leads us away from the nuclear abyss. In the struggle against the danger of war  against the arms race  we are ready to ally ourselves with all peace-loving countries.103.	Our approach is based on the well-founded assumption that the international situation can be restored to health only through a serious and creative dialogue imbued with a spirit of responsibility for the fate of humanity. Precisely that kind of dialogue may lead to the fulfilment of the pressing and most vital task of averting the threat of nuclear war  a task in which today the very existence of mankind is at stake. To that end  all States without exception must unite. The entire capacity of the United Nations  too  must be used for the same purpose. What must be achieved is that relations among nuclear Powers be governed by certain principles. Above all  averting a nuclear war must become the principal objective of their foreign policies  as envisaged in the extremely important proposal submitted by the highest Soviet official  Mr. Konstantin Chernenko  on 2 March 1984  which is rightly referred to as the code of conduct for nuclear Powers. Its adoption would contribute to a considerable reduction in the risk of military confrontation and to the strengthening of security and stability in the relations among States possessing those most horrible weapons ever created by man.104.	Czechoslovakia is emphatically advocating an immediate halt to the nuclear arms race and the adoption of effective measures to reduce the stockpiles of nuclear arms until they are completely liquidated. In this context  we also appreciate the appeal made by the Heads of State or Government of six countries  in their Joint Declaration of 22 May 1984  addressed to the nuclear Powers. An exceptionally important step towards reaching those objectives  in our view  would be the freezing of nuclear-weapon arsenals by nuclear Powers possessing such weapons at both quantitative and qualitative levels  as envisaged in the highly topical proposal by the Soviet Union adopted at last year's session of the General Assembly.105.	Also  the adoption by the nuclear Powers which have not yet done so of the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons would constitute a very important measure towards reaching a positive political turn in confidence-building throughout the world.106.	A milestone would be set on the road to nuclear disarmament by drafting and adopting a treaty on a complete and universal nuclear-weapon- test ban.107.	We are in favour of strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of achieving its universality. In this context  Czechoslovakia attaches great importance to the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty  to be convened at Geneva in 1985. We shall work for the success of the Conference  so that it might contribute to the further strengthening of the regime for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.108.	We do not regard as irreversible the situation that has been created in Europe following the start of the deployment of first-strike United States weapons; solution is possible. The deployment of those weapons must be immediately discontinued and the situation must be returned to the status that existed in the fall of last year.109.	We support the proposals for the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world. We are willing and ready to consider any constructive initiatives for their establishment  especially in Europe.110.	Together with nuclear disarmament  an exceptionally timely and truly urgent task  in our view  is to prevent an extension of the arms race to outer space before it is too late and before the space surrounding our planet is filled with new types and systems of first-strike weaponsâconventional  nuclear  laser or beam weapons. The use of force in outer space and from outer space against the earth  as well as from the earth against objects in outer space  must be prohibited once and for all. We are convinced that people throughout the world would welcome with relief a speedy start to Soviet-United States talks on these questions  as proposed by the Government of the Soviet Union in its statement last June. We also give our full support to the new and important Soviet initiative taken at this session by Mr. Andrei Gromyko for the adoption of an historic undertaking by all States to safeguard the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind  which might lead in the future to the establishment of a world organization to that end.111.	At the Conference on Disarmament  at Geneva  we actively advocate the speedy drafting of a convention on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. In that respect  a good foundation was provided by the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union in 19829 at the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second session devoted to disarmament  and supplemented by further constructive Soviet proposals  including the latest one concerning verification of the destruction of chemical weapons. The achievement of a general ban on chemical weapons may also be significantly facilitated by the proposal made by the States members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization addressed to the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] for the elimination of chemical weapons from Europe.112.	We believe it is extremely important to give new impetus to efforts for the limitation of the conventional arms race. The urgency of this task is further increased by the fact that through the fault of the NATO militarists a new generation of conventional weapons is coming into being  whose capabilities are approaching those of the most destructive weapons. For a number of months now  a response has been awaited to one of the important joint initiatives by the Warsaw Treaty countries  namely  to begin talks with the NATO countries on the question of a freeze on military expenditures and the subsequent reduction of such expenditures. It would be useful if States not belonging to either of those two military-political groupings were also to participate in the implementation of the proposed measures.113.	At the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  we are striving in particular to achieve the implementation of proposals relating to important military-political measures. First  there is a draft treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations. The conclusion of such a treaty would provide a legal and political guarantee of an improvement m the strengthening of confidence and security. It was with this in mind that on 7 May the Warsaw Treaty member States addressed an appeal to the member States of NATO to begin multilateral consultations on that proposal.114.	The deliberations at the Stockholm Conference thus far have clearly shown that an agreement cannot be attained without constructive consideration of the basic important questions of confidence and security and without ensuring consideration on an equal footing of all proposals submitted. We are convinced that the Conference can reach positive results. What is needed  however  is better mutual understanding  a responsible approach and political will on the part of all the participants.115.	At the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments  we have endeavoured  together with our allies  to overcome the profound deadlock reached in those talks through the fault of the West. The approach set forth in the proposals submitted by the socialist countries in 1983 provides a simple and mutually acceptable way to implement the mandate of the Vienna talks in its entirety. The appropriate use of that approach would facilitate overcoming the numerical barrier and would speed up the adoption of a mutually acceptable agreement that would make possible a substantial reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.116.	In the interest of progress in the solution of all disarmament questions  Czechoslovakia will continue its efforts of previous years and will also at this session of the General Assembly further elaborate on the ideas of the Declaration on International Cooperation for Disarmament  which was adopted at our initiative in 1979.117.	We believe that the General Assembly should give new encouragement to the efforts aimed at safeguarding the peaceful nature of relations among States and strengthening mutual confidence. Were it not for the policies of States that arrogate to themselves the right openly to destabilize the independent existence of other countries and to subvert their social and political order  the situation in the world would undeniably be more tranquil and less dangerous. It is precisely for this reason that we support the new and most timely proposal by the Soviet Union that the United Nations categorically condemn the policy and practice of State terrorism  which is in total contravention of the fundamental norms of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.118.	The settlement of persisting conflicts and hotbeds of tension is one of the most pressing tasks of the United Nations. In this regard  I wish to emphasize the timeliness and importance of the Soviet Union's appeal of 29 July of this year to resume without delay collective international efforts for a settlement in the Middle East. We view this appeal as a realistic proposal for a comprehensive settlement of the dangerous situation in that region caused by the aggressive expansionist policies of Israel and by imperialist interference. In this connection  we reaffirm our support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people for national self- determination and the establishment of its own independent State.119.	We favour the speediest possible termination of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the settlement of the conflict by political means in the spirit of the relevant United Nations decisions  in particular Security Council resolutions 540 (1983) and 552 (1984). At the same time  we oppose any external attempts at military interference  whether they are undertaken in the guise of ""protection"" of oil routes or under any other pretext.120.	We strongly reject interference in the affairs of Cuba and escalation of aggressive militarist actions against Nicaragua  and we condemn once again the aggression against Grenada.121.	We agree with those who see the cause of the explosive situation in Central America and in the Caribbean not in a global East-West confrontation but in the deep political  social and economic crisis created as a result of the interference and gross exploitation practised by imperialism. It is these causes that must be eliminated. We fully support the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict situation in that region.122.	We value and fully support the proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for an improvement of relations in the region. We believe that the steps taken by the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative will also contribute to finding realistic ways of achieving that goal. A prerequisite is the halting of foreign imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.123.	Czechoslovakia fully supports the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea in the defence of their freedom and independence and in their efforts to restore peace  stability and co-operative relations among States of the region. We demand that the General Assembly assume a realistic approach to the question of the representation of the Kampuchean people in the United Nations by their true representatives  that is  the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which has been consistently pursuing a peaceful foreign policy and striving for the development of co-operation with all States.124.	We support the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis  preceded by the withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the country.125.	We will continue to extend our full support to an equitable settlement of the question of Cyprus so that Cyprus will remain an independent  sovereign  united  territorially integral and non-aligned State  free from any foreign military presence.126.	We continue to feel full solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Namibia  led by SWAPO  for their freedom. Namibia must be granted independence without any pre-conditions or obstructions. We also support all forms of struggle against the inhuman policy of apartheid and racial discrimination carried out by the Pretoria regime.127.	We attach great importance to the activities of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and to its positive role in current international relations. We welcome its stand in favour of the halting of the arms race  the peaceful settlement of conflict situations in the world and the strengthening of peace.128.	We fully support the demands of the developing countries and their efforts aimed at restructuring international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. We condemn the aggravation of neo- colonialist exploitation of the developing countries and the practice of the imperial States of shifting onto the shoulders of the developing countries the burden of the consequences of the economic crisis by means of both political and economic pressure.129.	In the Declaration adopted at the Economic Conference of the member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  held in Moscow last June  the participants advocated the adoption of effective measures designed to do away with any kind of exploitation. We confirmed our steadfast commitment to the development of fruitful economic  commercial  scientific and technological contacts with all States so motivated.130.	It is in this spirit that we continue to develop our relations with the Western countries through all existing channels  while consistently applying the well-tested principles of peaceful coexistence. Under conditions of orderly relations  we continue to conduct with most of them a dialogue which produces undisputed constructive results. We regard this as a positive feature of the overall international climate. At the same time  however  we say quite frankly that the deployment of the new first-strike weapons in certain countries of Western Europe could not leave our relations with them unaffected.131.	The present day demands of us urgently that we rededicate ourselves to all the positive aspects of the activities of the United Nations  that we develop them and defend and strengthen  consistently and tirelessly  the foundations of world peace and security as a prerequisite and condition for the solution of the other pressing issues and problems faced by mankind. For our part  we are ready now as we were before to continue along that road."
"36",1713,"CUB",39,1984,"ï»¿The world situation could not be more alarming and dangerous than it is today  precisely one year after the start of the thirty-eighth session  when so many voices were raised in favour of detente in international relations. The imperialists  far from forsaking the path of the arms race and shows of force  have increased their aggressiveness and today threaten peace and security in the world.The policy of the Reagan Administration  aimed at achieving political  economic and military supremacy  has created new hotbeds of tension and exacerbated those already existing in various regions  turning the use and the threat of force into a State policy and relegating the principle of the peaceful solution of disputes to the status of a subject of verbal gymnastics.145.	Cuba attaches particular importance to the situation in Central America  where the danger of a generalization of the conflict is increasing. Notwithstanding the sincere and reiterated readiness of the Salvadorian revolutionaries to enter into a dialogue without pre-conditions in the search for a negotiated political settlement to the problem of El Salvador and notwithstanding the readiness of the Sandinist Front of Nicaragua to discuss and work for a negotiated solution to the conflict  the situation deteriorates daily.146.	Nicaragua's decision to accept immediately and without amendment the revised Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  presented on 7 September last by the Contadora Group  is irrefutable evidence of its readiness to seek through negotiation a solution to the conflict besetting the Central American peoples.147.	The Contadora Act contains various recommendations designed to open the way to peace. Outstanding among these are those aimed at halting or reducing the dangerous increase in military action in States of the region  such as: prior notification of national or joint military manoeuvres; prohibition of international military manoeuvres on their respective territories; ending the arms race in all its forms; cessation of the acquisition of arms; refusal to authorize the installation on their respective territories of foreign military bases or training establishments; elimination of existing foreign military bases or training establishments; establishment of a timetable for the gradual withdrawal and eventual removal of foreign military advisers; elimination within and outside the region traffic in arms with persons  organizations and irregular forces or armed bands trying to destabilize the Governments of the States parties; refraining from granting political  military  financial or any other kind of support to individuals  groupings  irregular forces or armed bands attempting to overthrow or destabilize other Governments and the use of their territory for such purposes; refraining from organizing  ordering  or participating in acts of terrorism  subversion or sabotage in another State.148.	Nicaragua has asserted that an agreement between the five Central American States to guarantee peace and security in the region can be meaningful only if the Government of the United States formally commits itself to abide fully by such an agreement. Nicaragua deems it indispensable for the United States to subscribe to and ratify the Additional Protocol to the Contadora Act and consequently end forthwith its military aggression and all aggressive acts against Nicaragua.149.	Cuba  as President Fidel Castro pointed out over a year ago  desires an honourable solution  one based on mutual commitments  to the Central American conflict. That is the only real solution. Cuba reaffirms that it will support the negotiations entered into and the agreements reached by Nicaragua.150.	Cuba also reaffirms its support for the position of the Salvadorian revolutionaries  who have reaffirmed their readiness to negotiate a political settlement of the situation in El Salvador. It is quite clear that the United States must participate in such negotiations  since the real problem both in Nicaragua and in El Salvador results from United States interference and since no real  lasting solution of the situation in Central America will be possible without the establishment of mutual commitments  with the participation of the United States.151.	The history of the imperialist blockade and the constant acts of aggression against Nicaragua is well known. The country's harbours have been mined and its territory has been surrounded by military bases from which air  land and sea operations are launched.152.	Swept up in the feelings of triumph triggered by the shameful invasion of the little island of Grenada  which was condemned by the overwhelming majority of Member States at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  the United States Government is now planning new blows against the free peoples of America and the national liberation movement. The Honduran Army has received aeroplanes  helicopters and sophisticated weaponry from the United States Administration in order to harass Nicaragua. Thousands of United States officers and soldiers are stationed in Honduran territory  where they have built military airports and roads  modernized harbours  set up arsenals and barracks and developed a powerful infrastructure for war. Meanwhile  the Government of El Salvador is maintained through the substantial aid which the United States is providing to cover the military expenses of that regime  with which it is attempting to overcome the armed insurrection of the people. A steady succession of joint military manoeuvres by the United States and the armies of the region is being conducted  thus creating a permanent sense of war against Nicaragua and the Salvadorian revolutionaries.153.	The scene seems to have been set for a new interventionist adventure. From a military point of view  all the conditions have been prepared  including the necessary infrastructure and logistical support  and the military command simply awaits the political decision to launch the intervention.154.	But history  like reality  follows an inexorable course and laws  and no force is capable of changing that course or those laws. Set-backs may and do occur in the spiralling development of society. Peoples which had made long strides in the process towards final emancipation have been subjected again to the yoke of oppression and neo-colonial exploitation because of exceptional circumstances and the ""opportune"" action of imperialism. But such exceptional conditions as were present in  for example  Grenada are not to be found in connection with the Salvadorian revolutionary movement  in Nicaragua or in Cuba.155.	Anyone who decides to send United States troops to invade Central America must be ready to face being militarily bogged down in the region  progressively weakened in an unbridled and massive war  until final victory is won by the peoples of the region. Equally  anyone who would send troops against Cuba must be ready to face an all-out warâ everywhere  all the time; a multifaceted war of the people which would turn every inch of land under the invader's foot into a veritable inferno  a war in which there would be no surrender or truce but a fight until final victory  regardless of the time and the sacrifices required.156.	But Cuba longs for peace in the region and in the world at large  a peace with equal dignity for all  everywhere  guaranteeing that climate of security  stability  respect and co-operation so urgently needed by our peoples to build their future. Thus  we reiterate today our deep appreciation and recognition of and respect for the endeavours of the Contadora Group  which deserves the continued support of the international community.157.	In southern Africa  the use of force and the threats and pressures exerted by United States imperialism maintain a climate of tension in that region  where the racist Pretoria regime  its strategic ally  continues to carry out a policy of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and other independent States and persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia. It is precisely the overt support of the United States for the apartheid regime which has thwarted a peaceful  negotiated settlement of the question of Namibia and which is the main reason for the climate of tension and aggression prevailing in the southern part of the African continent.158.	In his statement of 26 July this year  at Cienfuegos  President Fidel Castro asserted that""any effort which may alleviate tension in our area  as well as international tensions  deserves our most serious consideration; any effort which tends to diminish the dangers of the folly of war. We are ready even to co-operate in the search for a political solution to the problem of the independence of Namibiaâa problem which is important for southern Africaâon the basis of resolution 435 (1978) of the United Nations Security Council. We are conscious of our responsibility to our people and to all mankind; that is our duty as socialists and as revolutionaries.""159.	As far as Cuba and its expressed readiness to co-operate in the political solution of these problems are concerned  there are three essential aspects to that solution: the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978); the cessation of all outside assistance to the armed organizations fighting against the recognized Government of Angola; and the cessation of all acts of aggression or threats of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola  including the withdrawal of the South African troops that even today remain in that country's territory. Those three basic requirements were affirmed in the joint declaration of the Governments of Angola and Cuba on 19 March 1984.160.	As is well known  the presence of Cuban troops in Angola came about and is determined by the request of the Angolan Government and the decision  based on solidarity  of the people and Government of Cuba to defend the sovereignty and security of Angola from the foreign aggression of which they were  and still are  the victims. There is no other reason  and there never has been any other reason  for the presence of our troops in Angola.161.	The strict implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  which involves the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia and the exercise by the Namibian people of its full sovereignty over all its territory  the cessation of foreign assistance to the counter-revolutionary organizations operating in Angola and the establishment of international guarantees for the respect of its sovereignty  territorial integrity and security will make possible the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.162.	In their attempts to delay  boycott and impede the independence of Namibia  the imperialists and their ally  the racist Pretoria regime  resort to lies  diversionary tactics  coercion  pressure and blackmail. Whom do they expect to deceive? All of us know who is who and who does what for peace  social justice and the independence of peoples. We all know  furthermore  who does what for the true independence of Namibia  and we shall not be fooled by false expressions of concern.163.	For example  in September 1978  precisely six years ago  the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 435 (1978)  which should have opened the way for the independence of Namibia. Among its sponsors were the United States and other Western Powers. Nevertheless  it is significant that the United States has never voted in favour of any of the resolution on Namibia adopted by the General Assembly since that time.164.	During the current session  several other resolutions on Namibia will be considered by the Assembly. We invite the representatives of the countries represented here to note the results of the voting. I can assure them that there will be no surprises: the enemies of Namibian independence have names known to all of us.165.	Furthermore  the exploitation  the scorn and the discrimination to which the black people of South Africa are subjected have no parallel in history and cannot but arouse the world's solidarity with their struggle and their longing for equality and for their rights and their aspiration to create a just society based on majority rule to be respected  as well as active and militant solidarity with the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC]  the legitimate representative and symbol of the South African people's struggle against the opprobrious apartheid regime.166.	The racists' response to the demands and aspirations of South African blacks has been to repress  terrorize  incarcerate  torture and execute their best children and patriots.167.	But it is not only in Central America and southern Africa that we see the imperialists arrogantly trying to maintain their interests under neo-colonial domination. Other focal points of tension exist in various parts of the world which must also be diffused in time if we are to avoid the progressive deterioration of the international situation and the risk of war. Effective action must be undertaken towards this end. The duty of the United Nations to preserve peace cannot be delegated; nor can the duty to demand that all States respect the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations be ignored  especially when the State in violation is a permanent member of the Security Council.168.	Never before has the policy of blackmail and of exerting pressure in international relations been so blatant  brutal or wide-ranging. It is now also used to place conditions on the financing of international organizations  especially those in which the United States has an overwhelming say. Pressures are exerted on the drafting of the budgets of international organizations in an attempt to stem the progress of multilateralism and international co-operation  to block the flow of resources for the development of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  and to encourage a marked preference for bilateralism  which enables all sorts of political strings to be attached to the granting of assistance resources.169.	There can be no doubt that such policies are aimed at reversing the democratization process which has been taking place in international organizations since the end of the Second World War and which is rooted in the changes that have occurred in the world following the accession to independence of many peoples previously under colonial domination.170.	The results of the imperialist policy of aggression  blackmail and pressure are evident in the way in which the United States is isolated in international organizationsâa situation which in turn feeds its irrational hatred of the United Nations system and its arrogant stand against the practice of multilateralism.171.	During the last session of the General Assembly  the United States Government voted against 90 of the 150 resolutions adopted by the Assemblyâa fact which reveals the anti-people  reactionary and hegemonistic character of the current Administration and its break with the prevailing world trends shared even by some of its principal allies.172.	Hence the Assembly's thirty-ninth session is beginning in an atmosphere rife with tension and grim expectations. The long list of important and sensitive issues before us requires an objective and sincere approach. Long hours of work await us if we are to improve the rarefied atmosphere prevailing in international relations and if we are to struggle once again to attain peace  development and a more just world order.173.	We are pleased that  in the present delicate circumstances  Mr. Paul Lusaka  of Zambia  is presiding over this important session of the Assembly. His contribution to the defence of the interests of underdeveloped countries  his indefatigable efforts as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  his well-known organizational skills and personal capability assure him the respect  admiration and trust of the international community in the discharge of his serious responsibilities. Cuba pays tribute to Mr. Lusaka's unanimous election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly and offers him the full support of its delegation as a modest contribution to his noble efforts for the success of this session.174.	We could not fail to express as well our sincere appreciation to Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  who  with characteristic intelligence and tenacity  led the Assembly brilliantly through a period equally fraught with dangers and tension.175.	In its irrational quest for world strategic supremacy  the United States did not hesitate  only a year ago  to impose the deployment of 572 medium- range nuclear missiles  weapons with first-strike capability  in Western Europe in order to create an imbalance of forces in that region which could not but elicit the adoption of countermeasures by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries  thus increasing the danger of nuclear confrontation and turning several European States into virtual hostages or targets of a nuclear counter-attack.176.	The United States is frantically attempting to develop new weapons systems to be used in outer space and to militarize that environment  while dreaming of possible ""star wars"". The earth has become too small for the imperialists  who now wish to take the arms race into outer space.177.	In contrast to such an adventuristic and warlike policy is the serious  responsible and constructive attitude of the Soviet Union  whose initiatives in the field of disarmament  including the freezing of production and deployment of nuclear weapons and the prevention of the militarization of outer space  constitute a most valuable contribution to international peace and security  which Cuba hails and supports fully.178.	Cuba also supports the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union to include in the agenda of the current session as an important and urgent matter an item aimed at preventing certain States committed to military superiority from pursuing their policy of State terrorism in international affairs and  more frequently  attempting to undermine the socio-political regime of other States by force of arms.179.	Notwithstanding the opposition of the international community  including many of its allies  the United States Government is manoeuvring to prevent the beginning of real negotiations on an agreement prohibiting the militarization of outer space  and it continues the insane arms race. While bringing the world ever closer to a nuclear holocaust  the United States thus wastes enormous human and material resources which could be put to better use for the development and well-being of the world population.180.	Such senseless waste takes place in the midst of the most serious world economic crisis of the past 50 years. Originating in the developed capitalist countries  the crisis affects all countries  but the so- called developing countries are the hardest hit  subjected as they are to unfair international economic relations based on inequitable terms of trade and economic dependence.181.	At its thirty-fourth session  the General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing the desire of the overwhelming majority of its members for global negotiations aimed at restructuring international economic relations and establishing a more just and equitable international order. Unfortunately  we have not been able to advance a single step in that direction. It must be said that the process has stagnated mainly because of the intransigent and inflexible attitude of the United States Government.182.	Thus  the initiatives of the developing countries have met with no response. This is true of the well-known immediate economic measures endorsed by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  and further elaborated and presented in the form of a proposal by the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires from 28 March to 9 April 1983.183.	The so-called Buenos Aires Platform gave some hope for the success of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. Perhaps never before has such a large group of countries worked so hard and so seriously on a package of important economic proposals. The failure of that session  the lack of practical results caused by the refusal of the United States representatives to undertake serious negotiationsâa position which they also imposed on the group of developed capitalist countriesâleft a bitter feeling of frustration among all those who had placed some hope in the sixth session.184.	Furthermore  high interest rates  in addition to contributing to the increase of the foreign debt of the developing countries to unbearable levelsâthese now amount to over $300 billion  and it is virtually impossible for many countries to service and repay themâhave caused a flow of capital to the United States and a depletion of the capital of the rest of the world in favour of that country  thus helping to finance the huge deficit generated by the arms race. Hence  paradoxically  some developing countries which are also affected by the economic crisis and which demand that the resources wasted on the arms race be diverted to development  contribute to the promotion of that race.185.	Obsessed with their quest for strategic military supremacy and their desire to strengthen the predominance of their transnational corporations  the imperialists are indifferent to the misery and pain inflicted upon the vast majority of the world's population.186.	The United States Government refuses to agree not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and is deluded by the dream of a limited nuclear war by means of a deadly ""first strike""  based on the fallacious belief that peace can be attained through the use of force.187.	It should therefore be the immediate  priority objectives of the General Assembly gradually to lessen the economic burden borne by mankind and ensure peace. It must find ways and means of turning words into deeds. To that end  Cuba  as a founding member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  will make every effort to ensure that the high ideals of the Movementâthe eradication of war and exploitation  of the inequities in international relations and of all forms of colonial and imperialist oppressionâ may prevail.188.	We reaffirm today our unswerving support and encouragement for the peoples that  having attained political power  now wage a tireless struggle for peace and development and close their ranks in the face of imperialist threats. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with those peoples that by sacrifice and determination are opening the way to freedom and independence. We reaffirm our solidarity with the workers and peasants  students and professionals  artists  intellectuals and scientists who  in the midst of hostile societies  daily plant the seeds of brotherhood with their own hands  their toil  their ideas  their art or their science.189.	We pay a tribute to the Sandinist combatants struggling heroically to build a new Nicaragua on the moral ruins of Somoza's regime and of colonial and neo-colonial domination. We express our firm conviction that  in spite of the present acts  of aggression and threats  Nicaragua will for ever be free through the noble sacrifice of its finest children.190.	We extend our greetings and assurances of solidarity to the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation  the Revolutionary Democratic Front and to all the Salvadorian people  whose combative stature has grown in the struggle against the combined forces of imperialism and El Salvador's puppet army.191.	We reiterate our demand that the invading troops in Grenada  led by the United States  cease their occupation of that country. The people of Grenada has the legitimate right to decide its own destiny in an independent and sovereign manner.192.	The Cuban delegation reaffirms its support for the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico  that unredeemed portion of our America  in their un-swerving aspiration to exercise their right to self- determination and independence  free from colonial ties.193.	We wish to express once again our support for the desire of the Panamanian people and Government that the provisions of the Panama Canal treaties be strictly observed and respected; for Bolivia's just demand to recover its access to the sea; for Belize's non-aligned status  territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty.194.	We stand for a peaceful settlement of the differences between Guyana and Venezuela over the Esequibo region. We stand also for the recovery of the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands by the Argentine Republic through negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. We urge the United Kingdom Government to undertake such negotiations immediately.195.	We pay homage to the Chilean people  who  defying the arrogance  terror and repression of the Fascist Junta  have raised with dignity and in open struggle the banner of their ideals of social justice and independence  free from corrupt national oligarchy and imperialism. Sooner or later  the people of Chile will win. We salute the struggle of other South American peoples who suffer the repression of the vassals of imperialism  in particular the Uruguayan people  who  having taken to the streets in protest  have secured the freedom of patriots who truly represent their ideals and aspirations and are still struggling to secure it for all other political prisoners and to achieve a truly democratic system. We salute them for having forced the Government to recognize the existence of previously banned political parties. They  too  will regain their freedom and will hold the reins of their destiny in their own hands.196.	We hail the efforts to create a climate of peace and stability in South-East Asia; we urge all concerned to continue such actions  steps and measures as may enable them to attain that important goal  and we reaffirm our solidarity with the countries of Indo-China  which still endure hostility and foreign aggression.197.	We believe that in South-West Asia efforts to promote a stable climate of peace and security based on mutual respect among the parties to the conflict must prevail.198.	We support the just aspirations and efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country  and we call for the cessation of interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and for the withdrawal of United States interventionist forces from the southern part of the Korean peninsula.199.	We support the aspiration of the Comoros to recover sovereignty over Mayotte and of Madagascar to regain its rights over the Malagasy islands  the Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India; and we support the just demand of Mauritius to recover the island of Diego Garcia.200.	We support the people of Cyprus in its just and respected efforts to preserve the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of its country within the framework of a united  non-aligned Republic  and we reject the proclamation of the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus""  as well as any attempt to partition the island.201.	Once more  we urge the Governments of Iran and Iraq to put an end to the war  waged for over four years now  with uninterrupted bloodshed and a drainage of resources which deeply affects the living standards and development expectations of both peoples  and threatens international peace and security.202.	We extend our solidarity also to the brave Saharan combatants and to the long-suffering  heroic and fraternal Palestinian people and its sole and legitimate representative  the PLO  in its tenacious struggle to exercise its inalienable rights  including the establishment of its own State in Palestine; we support  too  the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the interested parties.203.	We offer encouragement to the Namibian patriots in their valiant struggle against the repression of the Pretoria regime  a struggle waged under the guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  as well as to the brave South African patriots in the ANC  who maintain an active struggle in the very heart of the disgraceful apartheid regime. We pay a tribute to the front-line States for resisting the attacks of South Africa and its allies; to the Arab countries  which face the joint actions of zionism and imperialism; to all those who  no matter where  defend  with their lives  their right to freedom and dignity as human beings"
"37",1759,"CYP",39,1984,"ï»¿ It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election is attributable to the great esteem rightfully enjoyed by his country as well as to his reputation as an experienced and accomplished diplomat proven by years of untiring service to his country  to Africa and to the United Nations. I would be remiss if I were not to stress how much we value the bonds of long friendship that exist between our two countries  Zambia and Cyprus  both of which share the same principles as States Members of the United Nations  the Movement of Non Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth.186.	I also wish to express high praise and esteem for the President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who presided over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly with great wisdom and unparalleled diplomatic skills  honouring his own country and Latin America. On this occasion  I wish to state again the importance that we attach to our strong bonds of friendship with Panama  a country that has always championed the rights of small nations.187.	I would also like to extend a warm welcome to the newest Member State  Brunei Darussalam  and to wish its Government and people happiness  peace and prosperity. We are looking forward to close cooperation with Brunei Darussalam in both the bilateral and multilateral fields.188.	As the United Nations approaches its fortieth anniversary we cannot but think of the high principles and purposes which inspired its founding. We are also conscious of the acceptance of such principles and the responsibilities undertaken by every Member State on its accession to membership of the Organization. We trust that Member States  collectively and individually  will implement the noble aims of the United Nations. As we prepare and plan for this anniversary it is of paramount importance for States Members  jointly and severally  to take a searching look at both the achievements and the shortcomings of the United Nations in the four decades since it was founded.189.	The current range of activities of the United Nations goes far beyond that envisaged nearly 40 years ago in San Francisco by the representatives of the nations that signed the Charter of the United Nations. Today  the United Nations encompasses a system of specialized agencies elaborating and carrying out economic and social programmes and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and humanitarian policies and programmes. All these acuities and concerns have been of great help  particularly to the developing world.190.	Again we can take pride in the fact that because of the struggles of our peoples and our concrete actions in the United Nations we have been able  by and large  to eliminate colonialism. Our solidarity here at the United Nations guarantees the successful defeat of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.191.	It is of course true that over this period we have escaped the scourge of another global war. The cataclysmic effects of such a war leave us in no doubt that this is no mean achievement.192.	It is to be regretted  however  that regional conflicts have not been eliminated. A gloomy picture is created by situations and factors such as the all too prevalent resort to the threat or use of force  armed intervention and occupation  and human suffering due to denial of basic rights and freedoms  economic inequities  malnutrition and starvation.193.	Numerous United Nations resolutions have repeatedly dealt with such situations  but those resolutions remain unimplemented. Even those adopted unanimously by the Security Council  the principal organ entrusted with the task of maintaining international peace and security  have had the same fate. Indeed  they were often contemptuously ignored or brushed aside by some Governments. The recent Security Council resolutions on Cyprus are such examples.194.	Could it  then  be that the United Nations is going through one of the most difficult periods in its history? Does this arise from its failure to take enforcement action in crisis situations  as envisaged by the Charter? Can we small countries hope that the Security Council will in the future do so?195.	If this situation persists  if it is not ameliorated soon  the very credibility of the United Nations will be questioned. But we must not be cynical or despair. We must persist in seeking peaceful solutions  solutions based on principles  in the hope that justice will prevail and illegality will be defeated. It is high time for all nations to express  not merely with words and ceremonies  but also with policies and actions  their recommitment to the obligations they undertook by signing the Charter.196.	We should aspire to ""an extended and tolerable future for all humanity""  which  as the Secretary General states in his report on the work of the Organization  ""ultimately depends upon our success in making the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations the basis of the day-to-day relations of Governments and peoples"".197.	One of our principal concerns is the lack of progress in disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  because failure to achieve progress on this major issue may lead to confrontation and war  the results of which would affect the very survival of the human race on this planet.198.	As regards the world economic situation today  we are faced with a debilitating and deepening crisis that is most adversely affecting the developing countries. The results are well known and need no elaboration. It is sufficient to mention low growth rates  high unemployment  inflation and ever mounting external debts.199.	The problems of the world economic system are mainly structural  and the present economic order  based on the striking imbalance between North and South  is characterized by inequality  domination and dependence. 200.	The international community has a duty to act urgently and decisively to stimulate the process of global economic negotiations leading to the establishment of a new international economic order. It is therefore imperative for the General Assembly to adopt a wise and constructive stand at the current session in order to launch global negotiations as soon as possible.201.	Let me turn to another matterâthat of human rights and fundamental freedoms. There has undoubtedly been significant progress during recent years  especially in the elaboration of international instruments and standards aimed at promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as the establishment of international mechanisms for supervising the implementation of the provisions of such instruments. It is disheartening  however  that  despite this progress  there still remains a wide gap between objectives and realities. Mass  flagrant and persistent violations of human rights are to be found in various parts of the world.202.	Another major issue confronting the world today is the population problem. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City last August  has identified the need for Governments  various organizations and the United Nations system to implement a new population strategy  as embodied in the Mexico City Declaration on Population and Development/ The recommendations for the further implementation of the World Population Plan of Action^ now provide a framework and guidelines for a well-coordinated  multidisciplinary plan of action at national and international levels to meet global concerns about population problems and development.203.	As soon as Cyprus broke its colonial bonds and emerged  in 1960  as an independent State  we joined the ever growing Movement of Nonaligned Countries. We endorsed the principles of nonalignment because we believed  as we do today  that they provide the framework for the fulfilment of the aspirations for peace  prosperity and development of its members and because we believe that the Movement possesses the moral power and political will to work towards the elimination of alien domination  exploitation and inequality and for the establishment of a new system of international relations.204.	Today  in an international context of increasing tensions and bloc confrontation  nonalignment is a positive stabilizing factor in the struggle for international peace and security. In this context  the role of nonaligned countries is particularly important and their responsibility great.205.	I should be remiss if I did not express our gratitude for the warm support and principled position of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries on the Cyprus problem. Particular appreciation is rightly due to the Movement's Contact Group on Cyprus.206.	We are gravely concerned about the critical situation prevailing in the Middle East. The Middle East problem  at the core of which is the question of Palestine has persisted for decades. Yet we are today as far from a solution to this problem as we were in the more distant past. The human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population in the occupied lands continue to be violated. The Palestinian people are still being denied their legitimate and inalienable rights  including their right to establish an independent State on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974.207.	We stand by the view that a just and comprehensive peace in the region must be sought urgently. The principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the total and unconditional withdrawal of occupation troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 must be strictly adhered to.208.	The grave situation in Lebanon  our neighbour  has persisted. We wish to reiterate our full support for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity of that country. We call for the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from its territory. We express the hope that the people of Lebanon will achieve national reconciliation  peace and prosperity and that all human suffering will soon end.209.	Another hotbed of tension in our area is the unfortunate confrontation between the two nonaligned countries  Iran and Iraq. It is with deep concern that we follow the developments in the ongoing war between them  which has resulted in a grave loss of life  human suffering  physical damage and destruction. We express the hope and desire that an end will soon be put to this most unfortunate conflict  and we appeal to both sides to seek a peaceful  just and honourable solution.210.	The situation in southern Africa continues to be dominated by the policies of apartheid  racial discrimination and colonial oppression followed by the South African regime and by military aggression  acts of destabilization and sabotage practised by South Africa against neighbouring independent African States.211.	The international community has unanimously and repeatedly denounced the abhorrent policies of as an affront to our civilization and to the human race. Despite this  the South African regime has adopted constitutional ploys  accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign  to deceive the international community. The so-called constitutional reforms have been implemented against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population and exclude the 24 million South African blacks from any form of political process.212.	We fully subscribe to General Assembly resolution 38/11  and fully endorse Security Council resolution 554 (1984)  which rejects the new Constitution of the Pretoria regime  declaring it null and void.213.	At the same time  we express our solidarity with and support for the struggle being waged by the oppressed people of South Africa. We are deeply concerned at the persistence of South Africa in pursuing its illegal colonial occupation and exploitation of Namibia and at its refusal to implement the United Nations plan embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We firmly reject the attempts to link the independence of Namibia to extraneous and irrelevant issues.214.	We fully support the inalienable right of the Namibian people to self-determination and national independence in a united Namibia. Within the United Nations  in the United Nations Council for Namibia  and in the Movement of Nonaligned Countries  Cyprus will offer all possible support to the people of Namibia in their heroic struggle waged under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  their authentic and legitimate representative  for the liberation of their country.215.	Another unresolved problem in the African continent is that of Western Sahara  which has been of serious concern to the international community since 1975. We fervently hope that the Saharan people will be left free to exercise their right to self-determination. The relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries and of the OAU should be accepted by all parties concerned so that they may be implemented immediately for the benefit of all.216.	The deteriorating situation in Central America presents a serious threat to peace not only in the region but also internationally. Now  more than ever  there is a pressing need for dialogue and for intensification of efforts for the achievement of political and negotiated solutions to the problems of the region.217.	We wish to express anxiety over the situation concerning Nicaragua  an active member of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries. We sincerely hope that the efforts of the Contadora Group will contribute positively to a negotiated settlement of the conflicts in Central America. We hope that these efforts  coupled with a positive political will on the part of all interested parties  will lead to the establishment of peace  so that the States in the region may focus on the urgent task of development.218.	At this point  we wish to reiterate once again our firm stand that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be fully respected and that foreign interference  intervention and covert and overt attempts at destabilization must be abandoned. It is of paramount importance that the sovereign rights of the peoples of the countries of the region to choose freely the political  economic and social systems of their preference be fully respected.219.	The Cyprus problem  a major international problem  is not only well known to this international Organization but is also a question upon which the General Assembly has repeatedly pronounced itself by way of resolutions  in particular resolution 3212 (XXIX)  unanimously adopted by the Member States  including Turkey  ending with resolution 37/253. Those resolutions  as well as the resolutions of the Security Council  remain unimplemented; thus  the occupation of part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus continues  and that is the cause of all illegalities.220.	The question of Cyprus was last debated in the General Assembly in May 1983 and in the Security Council in November 1983 and May 1984. As is well known  the reason for recourse to the Council in November 1983 was the illegal attempt by the Turkish Cypriot leadership unilaterally to declare independent the occupied part of Cyprus. The Council  by its resolution 541 (1983)  declared this purported declaration of independence null and void and called for its withdrawal.221.	Between January and March 1984  the Secretary General launched another initiative to break out of the impasse. This initiative had the same fate as previous ones  and for the same reasons. The Cyprus Government accepted this initiative from the beginning and encouraged the Secretary General to proceed. Why the initiative failed and who was responsible for this failure were clearly revealed by the Secretary General in his report to the Security Council of 1 May 1984.6 While the Secretary General was proceeding with his initiative  the illegalities were continued and intensified. As a result  the Council was convened  and by resolution 550 (1984) it called for the reversal of all the secessionist acts and for the peaceful settlement of the problem in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.222.	Last August  the Secretary General  in a renewed effort to find a solution to the Cyprus problem  began a new initiative in Vienna. The next phase of this initiative was the proximity talks at high level in New York  the first round of which ended last week. The stumbling blocks and difficulties of the past  well known to all representatives here  continued to persist. It was agreed that a second round of proximity talks would begin on 15 October. In view of the fact that this second round is to take place  little more should be said. We reserve the right  and indeed we have an obligation  to inform the Assembly fully of developments at the appropriate time. It should suffice at this stage to stress that a solution can be found if partitionist concepts are abandoned by the Turkish side and a willingness to conform with the provisions of the United Nations resolutions is exhibited.223.	The Cyprus Government  as always  fully supported and supports this most recent initiative of the Secretary General and wishes to express to him its gratitude for it.224.	The Government of the Republic of Cyprus is fully committed to a peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions on Cyprus  as well as the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979.7 It will also not relent in its efforts to preserve and safeguard the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and nonalignment of the Republic and to put an end to the occupation of part of its territory.225.	In asking the General Assembly to put its considerable weight behind the new effort for a just solution of the Cyprus problem  we are convinced that this would not only have a beneficial effect for the preservation of the territorial integrity of other small States but would also enhance the credibility and effectiveness of this world Organization.226.	If the partitionist designs against Cyprus were allowed to succeed or even tolerated longer  then the future of all multicommunal  multiracial and multi confessional States would be in permanent jeopardy. That is why we feel certain that the members of the Assembly will continue and intensify their efforts for Cyprus until it is vindicated. For this we are grateful to all members."
"38",1827,"DDR",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you warmly on your election to your responsible office. I am pleased to greet you as the representative of an African country with which the German Democratic Republic maintains friendly relations.95.	I wish you  Mr. President  and the Secretary- General success in your activities.96.	The President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Illueca  deserves our gratitude for his work.97.	The German Democratic Republic congratulates Brunei Darussalam on its admission to membership of the United Nations.98.	I must note with concern that a change for a healthier state of world affairs is not in sight. On the contrary  the danger of nuclear holocaust is greater than ever before. The arms race is assuming dimensions which exceed all previously known extremes. As recent developments show  the arms build-up is intended to extend even into outer space. Terms like ""star wars"" can give us only a vague idea of the threats to which mankind and the planet earth are exposed.99.	This situation has come about neither suddenly nor unnoticed. It is the dire result of imperialist politics seeking military superiority and domination regardless of the cost. Nuclear war and nuclear blackmail are part and parcel of those politics.100.	There was a straight line from the arms build-up decision taken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] in 1978 to the deployment of new nuclear first-strike weapons in Western Europe. The peoples have not forgotten that this fateful decision was taken in Washington at the same time when  here in New York  the General Assembly  in the Final Document of its Tenth Special Session  which was devoted to disarmament  expressed hopes for peace and a cessation of the arms race. From this rostrum  the socialist Statesâand definitely not they aloneâcautioned against the ominous consequences of the arms build-up. They left no doubt that the stationing of United States intermediate-range missiles on Western European soil would inevitably change the situation in the world and entail a new round of the arms race  for that move was  in fact  the initial step towards a destruction of the approximate military balance existing between the Soviet Union and the United States  between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO. It was bound to be clear to everyone that the socialist States could not tolerate that. For then part  they had to take adequate countermeasures in order to preserve the foundation on which peace rests in the nuclear age.101.	It is primarily due to this strategic military equilibrium that Europe can now  for the first time in this century  look back to almost 40 years of peace. The history of the United Nations and preceding events show that attempts at military superiority  world-wide domination and diktat are bound to result in war. Anybody who negates this experience assumes a heavy responsibility and proves to be opposed to detente and peaceful coexistence.102.	The repeated warnings of the socialist States have unfortunately proved to be justified. The deployment of first-strike nuclear weapons poisons the atmosphere for negotiations on the basic issues of international affairs  disarmament and arms limitation. The danger of war has increased  and it is accompanied by immeasurable political damage  because confidence cannot possibly grow in the shadow of nuclear missiles that are aimed at the Soviet Union and the other socialist States. A heavy strain is thus put on peaceful international co-operation  which was  in particular in the 1970s  so hopefully advanced and of real benefit to East and West.103.	On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of victory in the anti-Fascist struggle for liberation  the peoples are hoping  first and foremost  that a nuclear catastrophe can be averted and peace in the world again be placed on a more secure foundation. The accumulation of ever more destructive types of weapons can and must be halted  and international developments must return to a state of tranquillity and predictability.104.	Firm action to achieve this aim is expected from the United Nations  which undertook in its Charter to do everything ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".105.	We share the view expressed by the Secretary- General that all States are obligated to co-operate when peace is in jeopardy. We also subscribe to his perception that the Charter of the United Nations is irreplaceable. Its principles are as valid as ever; they are and will remain mandatory norms of international life.106.	When all States act in conformity with those principles  force and aggression can be removed from international affairs and conflicts between States resolved peacefully.107.	As a representative of the German Democratic Republic  which on 7 October will celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary of its foundation and which  like the United Nations  emerged as a result of the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition in the Second World War  I reaffirm on this occasion its commitment to the noble purposes of the United Nations. As it has done so far  the German Democratic Republic will employ and facilitate all possibilities to pursue international dialogue at this assembly of States and to contribute to effective steps in the effort to achieve a secure peace  arms limitation and disarmament.108.	The dangerous evolution of the international situation can and must be checked. What is essential is the joint and determined action of all those interested in peace. As regards the position of the German Democratic Republic in this matter  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  stated when he recently met with representatives of the peace movement:""In order to avoid a nuclear catastrophe we will join forces with all who are aware that there is no reasonable alternative to peaceful coexistence between States having different social systems. Anyone of sincere heart and goodwill who seeks feasible means to secure peace will always find the German Democratic Republic a reliable  constructive partner  whatever the ideological or political camp to which he or she owes allegiance."" Should not all of those who are vested with responsibility let themselves be guided by such a principle?109.	The history of two world wars tells us that we must fight the threat of war before the weapons speak. War must be checked before it breaks out.110.	Arms build-up  territorial claims and chauvinism have always gone hand in hand when wars of aggression were being prepared. That is why we come out strongly against all revanchist and neo-Fascist tendencies wherever they appear  wherever they are tolerated or even encouraged. That is why any attack against the accords of the anti-Hitler coalition or the post-war order in Europe  that is  at the status quo  must be met with resolve  since any such attack is an attempt to revise the existing balance of forces  which has been the guarantor of peace.111.	We want the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act to be strictly observed; their signature by the authorized representatives of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe about 10 years ago was a reaffirmation of the existing post-war order in Europe.112.	With the same firmness  the German Democratic Republic speaks out against the cancellation of provisions which  in conformity with Allied post-war agreements  imposed arms restrictions on some countries.113.	With the Political Declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  adopted at Prague on 5 January 1983  the joint statement of leading representatives of those States  issued in Moscow on 28 June 1983 "" and the Declaration of the member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  issued in June of this year  the socialist countries have presented a comprehensive programme for the restoration of a healthier international atmosphere. That programme respects equality and equal security  as well as the legitimate security interests of all parties  and is therefore a realistic basis for concerted action. It combines political steps  which are suited to create the necessary climate of confidence  with proposals for arms limitation and disarmament  which would restrict the material potential for military confrontation. Consequently  it is a programme of material and political guarantees of peace.114.	The prevention of a nuclear inferno remains the key issue. The key itself is the renunciation of attempts to achieve military superiority  and this presupposes an immediate end to the deployment of new United States missiles on European soil and the dismantling of the systems already installed. That would make the countermeasures taken by the socialist countries superfluous; the way would be opened for the resumption of negotiations on ridding Europe of intermediate-range nuclear forces as well as operational tactical nuclear weapons.115.	The recent Soviet proposals which Mr. Andrei A. Gromyko outlined last week before the Assembly not only confirm the Soviet Union's readiness for serious negotiations  but also contain an urgent call for the holding of such negotiations. Those proposals are fully supported by the German Democratic Republic. We are similarly convinced of the necessity and usefulness of political dialogue  particularly in times of tension and danger.116.	Political dialogue can create confidence and in that way produce results to the extent that the parties mutually respect each other's legitimate security interests. Mere declarations of willingness to negotiate cannot calm the international situation. The desire for peace and willingness to disarm can be measured by concrete deeds. What is essential in this context is the will to take practical steps for the prevention of nuclear war.117.	In this regard  an agreement on certain norms to govern relations between the nuclear-weapon States would be of particular importance. Such norms should include: first  a treaty obligation upon all nuclear-weapon States not to be the first to use nuclear weaponsâa commitment the Soviet Union has been the first to undertakeâbecause that would reduce the nuclear threat and pave the way to disarmament; secondly  a general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  because that would restrain the development of new types of nuclear weapons; thirdly  an end to the qualitative arms race in the nuclear field and  especially  the prohibition of the neutron weapon  because that would put a stop to the nuclear arms build-up; fourthly  agreement on a programme for nuclear disarmament and proscription of aggressive doctrines of ""limited"" or ""winnable"" nuclear war  because that would point the way for joint steps to reduce the nuclear threat; and  fifthly  the conclusion finally  to complement these measures reducing the nuclear dangers  of a treaty on the mutual renunciation of the use of military force and on the maintenance of peaceful relations  which would be a true confidence-building measure.118.	The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones or corridors would be of great importance. The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its offer to make its entire territory available for inclusion in such a zone  provided that the Federal Republic of Germany is prepared to do the same  in keeping with the principle of equality and equal security. The German Democratic Republic regards the Joint Declaration of six Heads of State or Government from four continents  issued on 22 May 1984  as a constructive move  because it is aimed at preventing nuclear war. Its insistence on a nuclear-arms freeze as an initial step towards a further reduction of the nuclear forces is dictated by reason.119.	In the face of the incalculable risks that would arise from an extension of the arms race into outer space  the German Democratic Republic supports immediate action that would prevent the militarization of space and would place States under the obligation to use outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes  as suggested by the Soviet initiative.120.	The elimination of chemical weapons is a task in which the German Democratic Republic is cooperating without reservation. This applies both to a world-wide ban and to supportive regional measures.121.	Arms build-up policies place heavy strains on economic development in the world. Many States  especially the developing countries  have to pay. The high-interest policy of big business to finance immense military expenditures deprives the developing countries of thousands of millions practically overnight. It is only legitimate that resistance to that policy should be growing in all regions of the world  for the tremendous social problems such as backwardness  hunger  poverty and disease can be mitigated and finally eliminated only in a healthy international climate. The reduction of arms budgets is indispensable for that purpose. This is what the Warsaw Treaty States proposed in concrete terms in an appeal to the member States of NATO on 5 March 1984. We also hold that there is no obstacle that would prevent States which are not members of those military and political groupings from being parties to the proposed measures.122.	The socialist countries are working for broad  mutually advantageous co-operation and calling for a normalization of international economic relations. They support the early commencement of global negotiations within the United Nations framework on the crucial international economic problems.123.	In conformity with its foreign policy principles  the German Democratic Republic continues to assist developing countries as much as ever  even though it also has to carry great economic and political burdens because of the imperialist policies of threat and extortion and the continuing impact of crisis developments in the capitalist part of the world.124.	Thanks to greater efforts by its working population  the German Democratic Republic even increased its assistance to developing countries by five per cent in 1983 alone. We strongly demand implementation of the principles contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and in the Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. Though adopted 10 years ago  these documents are now more topical than ever.125.	There is no reasonable alternative to the peaceful coexistence and co-operation of States on an equal footing  irrespective of their system of society  geographical position and territorial size. The German Democratic Republic calls for prudent action to remove acute sources of conflict scale down tensions and prevent the emergence of new conflicts. It rejects with the utmost firmness the imperialist policies consisting in direct and indirect interference and overt acts of aggression  such as are practised in particular against non-aligned nations in various regions. The German Democratic Republic strongly supports the proposal by the Soviet Union for the General Assembly to consider the ""inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system in other sovereign States"" as an important and urgent matter.126.	The people of Grenada fell victim to naked aggression in 1983. Today they are subjected to brutal occupation and their social achievements are being destroyed.127.	The undeclared war against Nicaragua is being carried on through massive political and military aid for the Somoza mercenaries and through secret-service operations. The mining of ports was condemned world-wide as a terrorist act of violence and a gross violation of democratic international law.128.	The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its solidarity with the peoples of Central America. It supports Nicaragua's initiatives  as well as the efforts of the States of the Contadora Group to settle existing problems by peaceful means and without outside interference or even threat  on the basis of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.129.	The subsisting volatile situation in the Middle East is giving all peoples cause for deep concern. Any comprehensive  just and hence durable solution of the Middle East conflict presupposes recognition of the rights of the peoples and States of that region  including the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State. Therefore  the German Democratic Republic urges the early convening of an international conference on the Middle East  with the participation of the PLO  the only legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.130.	The German Democratic Republic aligns itself with sorely afflicted Lebanon in its quest for sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity.131.	Israel must immediately withdraw from all the territories occupied since 1967. Hegemonist intervention in the region must be ended. Only in this way can peace  security and development be ensured.132.	We support Cyprus in its struggle for national independence and for a peaceful  just and enduring solution to the Cyprus problem based on the relevant United Nations resolutions.133.	The German Democratic Republic condemns the continuing aggressive policy pursued by the South African racist regime with the backing of other imperialist circles. The German Democratic Republic is aligned on the side of all independent African States and of the ANC and SWAPO in the battle against racism  racial discrimination and apartheid and to organize their own lives in peace  security and independence.134.	We demand the settlement of the question of Namibia strictly on the basis of United Nations decisions in their entirety  including Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This resolution allows of no ""ifs"" and ""buts'"" and no linkage whatsoever.135.	We sympathize with the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to find a political solution to the situation in the region  but such a solution requires first of all an immediate end to the policy of interference in Afghan affairs which imperialist forces have been pursuing and to the warlike action which they have been instigating and directing against the Afghan people.136.	The German Democratic Republic supports the endeavour of the Indo-Chinese States to establish lasting peace and stability in South-East Asia through dialogue and co-operation among all countries of the region  to reject any external interference and to concentrate all resources on resolving the urgent problems of their countries  as stated again at the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Vientiane last July. The efforts made by the Lao People's Democratic Republic to achieve a peaceful settlement of the situation at the Lao-Thai border deserve United Nations support.137.	The German Democratic Republic continues to support all efforts to convert the Indian Ocean region into a zone of peace. The Conference on the Indian Ocean to be held for this purpose must no longer be delayed.138.	We regard as fully legitimate the insistence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and its efforts to bring about the peaceful and democratic unification of the country without interference from outside. The same holds good for the proposal to hold negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  the United States and South Korea with a view to converting the Armistice Agreement of 1953 into a peace treaty between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States and achieving a declaration of non- aggression by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea.139.	Both the precarious international situation and the forthcoming fortieth anniversary of the victory over fascism should give all States Members of the United Nations cause for redoubling their efforts to strengthen international security.140.	The people of the German Democratic Republic  who live at the dividing line between the two biggest military coalitions and know the meaning of war from their own painful historical experience  have a vital interest in the achievement of that objective.141.	Having risen from the ruins of the Second World War  the German Democratic Republic has grown since its inception 35 years ago to become a State of high political stability and great economic  scientific and cultural achievements. Neither the peaceful construction work of our own people nor that of other peoples must be allowed to be destroyed in a world-wide nuclear conflagration. Hence  the preservation of peace remains the overriding concern of the socialist German State. It is therefore the central issue of our relationship with the Federal Republic of Germany. Over the past three and a half decades  it has been the socialist State's peace policy and stability that have proved to be an important factor in ensuring that movements towards detente in Europe and to living together in peace have originated on German soil.142.	It is only natural that weâand not only weâ are worried when those in certain quarters  in spite of accepted obligations of international law  question the results of the Second World War and  in the up current created by the deployment of United States first-strike weapons  harp increasingly on an allegedly open German question and talk of ""reunification"".143.	To make it perfectly clear  let me say that there is nothing open  nor can there be ""reunification"". The people of the German Democratic Republic have irrevocably opted for socialism. The socialist German Democratic Republic and the capitalist Federal Republic of Germanyâwhich furthermore belong to opposite military alliancesâcannot be merged  let alone reunited. It is as impossible as bringing together fire and water. Between the two States there can be relations only on the basis of international law and of peaceful coexistence. There is no peaceful alternative 144.	This is why we fully understand those politicians who orient themselves on facts established by treaties and are worried about and warn against action to the contrary.145.	True service to the cause of peace resides in helping ensure that the situation that existed before the deployment of nuclear first-strike weapons in Western Europe is restored; that the series of European treatiesâthe Final Act of Helsinki  the treaties of Moscow  Warsaw  Prague and Berlin  and the Quadripartite Agreementâare strictly observed and revitalized; and that post-war realities in Europe are  as a matter of course  made the basis for all action. Merely to call into question the relevant agreements would be to risk war.146.	The United Nations has proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. Let us  the Member States  begin now to create the best conditions for making it indeed the beginning of a turn towards lasting peace the world over. The German Democratic Republic pledges its active co-operation in that endeavour."

The essential characteristics of the world today are the relationship between the industrial countries of the North and the developing countries of the South and the relationship between the democratic industrial countries of the West and the communist industrial countries of the East. West and East account for the greater part of the North. The North is a house divided  but the South  too  is torn by tension and antagonism.7.	We need dialogue between North and South. Internal tensions within North and South obstruct and slow down this dialogue. North and South must  therefore  reduce their internal tensions and dedicate their intellectual and material resources to a common effort aimed at the development of an international order based on equality  accommodation of interests and cooperation; an international order in which everyone has a fair chance  in which people can develop their strengths and abilities; an international order in which human rights are respected and social justice is applied to all.8.	This calls for what I would term an international domestic policy  a policy rooted in the conviction that the future of one's own country can only be assured if the future of all countries is assured.9.	The most pressing North South problem is the debt crisis in many developing countries  particularly in Latin America. The Presidents of Argentina and Venezuela have made pointed reference to this situation in their statements to the Assembly. The effects of the debt crisis are felt by South and North. Forceful measures of adjustment are required if the debtor countries are to recover economically. Such measures have political and social repercussions in those countries. Jacques de Larosiere  Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund [VMF]  said recently:""It must be realized that there are social and political limits to economic adjustment. The advantages gained by a country from servicing its debts and pursuing a policy of adjustment must be worth the cost in terms of the human misery caused by the adjustment.""Only in this spirit can the problem be solved.10.	The crisis is confronting the North  too  with difficulties. The necessary import restrictions by the debtor countries mean export reductions for industrial countries. The international banking system has been put under heavy pressure. This crisis can be solved only by the common effort of North and South. The debt servicing commitments and the servicing ability of the developing countries must be brought back into harmony. We need longer-term rescheduling strategies to support successful adjustment efforts by debtors. Mexico has furnished proof that it is possible to adjust successfully. We have reason to hope that the other countries  too  after a painful initial adjustment phase  will manage to move on to the second phase  in which adjustment and growth again go hand in hand.11.	We shall overcome the debt crisis only through intensive dialogue and cooperative solidarity. We therefore welcome the comprehensive dialogue on this subject scheduled to take place early next year within the IMF and the World Bank.12.	If economic recovery and development are to take place in the third world  a package of coordinated measures is necessary.13.	First  the industrial countries must ensure their own stable growth.14.	Secondly  protectionism must be fought. Markets must remain open and become more open to exports from the third world. Deeds must be made to match the many words in favour of liberalized trade.15.	Thirdly  the over-high international interest level must fall. How can permanent growth be achieved in the developing countries in the face of today's level of real interest?16.	Fourthly  the developing countries need more direct investments from abroad. The industrial countries must therefore continue their investment promotion policy. The developing countries  for their part  must create a favourable investment climate. Direct investments not only transfer capital but also transfer technology and managerial experience and provide easier access to the world market. The transfer of technology to the third world must be promoted with the utmost energy. An agreement on balanced codes for transnational enterprises and technology transfers would encourage investment.17.	Our special attention and assistance must be devoted to the world's poorest countries. Since 1971  the number of least developed countries has risen from 25 to 36. Their economic growth  and especially their food production  are not keeping pace with population growth. Their debt burden is oppressive. They need increasing official development assistance. For this reason  the Federal Republic of Germany has always given particular consideration to those countries in its development cooperation. For years it has been providing them only with grants. !t has remitted the public debt of most of those countries.18.	The situation is particularly dramatic in many African countries. Africa needs international solidarity and the coordinated efforts of the international community. Food security must be at the heart of these efforts; acute need must be combated; self-sufficiency must be strengthened. Africa is therefore a focus of our development cooperation. Substantially more than 40 per cent of our entire aid is channelled into that continent. In response to the appeal by the Secretary General  we provided an additional 50 million deutsche mark for special food security action in 1984. The World Bank report on sub-Saharan Africa reinforces our intention to allocate additional funds to Africa in 1985.19.	At this point I should like to appeal to the industrial countries with State trading organizations to bring their development aid into an acceptable relationship with their economic power and their arms expenditure. They too should open their doors more widely to exports from developing countries. They absorb only 5 per cent of all exports from developing countries  whereas more than two thirds of such exports go to the Western industrial States.20.	According to estimates by the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  the population of the world will almost double in the next 40 years  despite ail the efforts to decelerate population growth. That will multiply the number and the seriousness of the problems facing humanity. We who live today bear responsibility for ensuring that our children and grandchildren inherit a world which permits them to live in human dignity. The danger is growing that ""spaceship Earth"" will no longer be able to carry mankind.21.	The universal nature of this danger to the future is forcing the community of nations to pool its resources. More people need more food  drinking water  clothing  accommodation  schools  employment  hospitals and recreation facilities. All these things are not even sufficiently available to the majority of those living now. And yet we must provide them for more than 8 billion people  and time is short.22.	An increase in population will also impose greater strains on the environment. Even now  we see the deserts spreading  valuable soil becoming salinated and eroded  and vegetation in industrial countries being threatened by acid rain. Year by year  numerous types of animals and plants disappear irretrievably. Seas and inland waters are becoming polluted. Hydrocarbon combustion is jeopardizing the world climate. Industrial waste  refuse and sewage pose enormous technical and financial challenges to the world community. UNEP must become the driving force of a worldwide environmental policy. But all international cooperation is in vain if environmental protection is not practised at home  in our own countries. Polluted air and poisoned water do not stop at national boundaries. For this reason  we are talking and negotiating with all our neighbours in the West and the East on joint action to combat the dangers of pollution. The Conference on the Environment  held at Munich  provided an important stimulus for a joint approach on trans-boundary pollution. In the interest of combating environmental pollution at its source  more account must be taken than has been done hitherto  in public and private economic cooperation with the third world  of the need to protect the natural sources of life.23.	In the densely populated and highly industrialized Federal Republic of Germany  environmental problems surfaced earlier than elsewhere. We have therefore been able to gather extensive experience in recognizing  measuring and fighting pollution. We are prepared to share this experience with all interested parties.24.	The major tasks of economic growth and environmental protection  development and the provision of food cannot be solved without the potential offered by the new forms of high technology. New technological developments should serve all mankind; they must not be misused as instruments of power.25.	Gene technology  for instance  will provide the third world with new and great opportunities with regard to agriculture and the solution of the food problem. It appears possible that plants which can yield fruit even in difficult soil and climatic conditions will be developed using the methods of gene technology. It appears possible also that harvests can be considerably increased and the use of chemical fertilizers drastically reduced. The international research programmes to promote agriculture in developing countries must make full use of the opportunities offered by gene technology.26.	But this very form of technology makes us aware that new advanced technology not only presents us with opportunities but also confronts us with dangers which we must control from the outset. Respect for creation must guide us in our use of gene technology and must make us vigilant about any misguided attempt to manipulate human heredity. Human dignity demands that such manipulation be banned and made impossible from the outset. That is a topic for the United Nations  too.27.	Cooperation between North and South must reduce the prosperity gap  overcome hunger and want  disease and ignorance  and ensure respect for fundamental human rights.28.	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights must occupy a central place in the work of the United Nations. Peace and human rights belong together. Anyone who violates human rights is thereby breaking commitments he has assumed on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights; he is infringing international law.29.	For the Federal Republic of Germany  an active policy of support for human rights is a pillar of its policy for peace. A draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentâa draft convention which we support and to which we attach great importanceâhas been submitted to the General Assembly. We appeal to all Member States to accept the draft convention and the control procedures for which it provides and to let it become effective. Torture  one of the most dreadful scourges of mankind  must be banished from the world. No one should be delivered into the hands of torturers  and no torturer should go unpunished.30.	We welcome the favourable reaction to our proposal for an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment. I ask for further constructive cooperation. I address my appeal also to those States which do not yet want to give up the death penalty.31.	Racism  particularly	in South Africa  constitutes a fundamental violation of human dignity. We appeal to the Republic of South Africa to clear the way for the realization by all its citizens of elementary human rights.32.	The United Nations needs institutions that permit better protection of human rights. The appeals for the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights and for the institution of a court of human rights point the way to this goal.33.	The Charter of the United Nations represents a magnificent effort to overcome the inherited structures  based on the possession and projection of power  and to create new structures for peace. But the United Nations has not yet united the nations of the world. The world is still marked by rivalry between nations and power blocs  rooted in distrust. That is the result of bitter historical experience. World history has taught nations to be prepared for the possibility of force from outside.34.	Force is still being used. The Afghan people long for the right to preserve in peace their independence  their self-determination and the faith of their fathers. Laos and Kampuchea are fighting for their independence. In the Gulf war  people are still dying a senseless death. Central America is riven by tension from without and within. The independence of Namibia is still being withheld. In South Africa  people are discriminated against because of their colour. There will be no rest for the Middle East as long as violence and not negotiations are the order of the day. Without an undertaking to refrain from the use of force  without the realization by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination  without recognition of the right of all States  including Israel  of their right to exist  there will never be a lasting and just peace in the Middle East.35.	We must strengthen the peace-making influence of the United Nations. The Secretary General has rightly pointed out that there should be less talk about the inefficiency of the United Nations and more about a lack of willingness on the part of States to tap its potential. To this end  the principle of universality must remain inviolate. Despite all our differences  we must always so conduct the dialogue as to make its continuation seem desirable to all participants. We all know how difficult it is to settle or even to restrict conflicts once they have broken out. That is why conflicts must be nipped in the bud. For this purpose we need an effective early warning system permitting the Security Council and the Secretary General to act swiftly. We support the proposals made by the Secretary General on this matter.36.	In the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization  the Federal Republic of Germany  along with other delegations  has submitted proposals on the prevention of international conflicts.37.	Our refugee initiative  aimed at reducing the horrendous flow of refugees through political cooperation  also serves the purpose of stifling potential conflicts.38.	Observance of the prohibition of the use of force is the first step that must be taken. An undertaking not to use force does not mean renouncing convictions  values and interests. It focuses on the form and the means used by States to settle their differences. The undertaking to refrain from the use of force is one of the fundamental and indispensable principles for ordering the peaceful coexistence of States. The policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is a policy for peace  embedded in the commitment to refrain from using force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization  to which we belong  is built on this foundation. In their Bonn Declaration of 10 June 1982  the allies stated:""Our purpose is to prevent war and  while safeguarding democracy  to build the foundations of lasting peace. None of our weapons will ever be used except in response to attack.""39.	We know that military strength alone cannot guarantee a peaceful future. Disarmament and arms control are therefore integral parts of our security policy. In Europe  East and West face each other with huge arsenals; throughout the world  enormous resources  which could otherwise help us and the developing countries shape our future  are spent on arms. The prevalent distrust can be measured by reference to world arms expenditure figures. Confidence-building and disarmament are demands addressed to the entire international community  to East and West  to North and South alike.40.	Today  no region of the world can find peace and security on its own. Arms control in Europe strengthens peace and stability in the world. The worldwide and regional dialogue on disarmament and arms control has not been interrupted. Pessimism and resignation must not doom our efforts  which must be guided by the will to utilize the available instruments to pursue an active policy. That means  above all  that negotiations must take place. This principle must apply everywhere and in respect of all weapons. No weapons system must be excepted. No one may consider only his own security interests; the legitimate interests of others must also be acknowledged. No one may seek security at the expense of others.41.	We welcome the fact that President Reagan  speaking from this rostrum [4th meeting]  proposed to the Soviet Union a comprehensive disarmament dialogue. That dialogue is in the interest of all peoples. The United States and the Soviet Union bear a particular responsibility on account of their nuclear potential and their obligations deriving from the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 42.	Like the President of the United States  we favour the resumption of nuclear arms negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union without preconditions. We support the American desire for drastic reductions in the field of intercontinental strategic weapons. As hitherto  we want global renunciation of land based intermediate range missiles by the United States and the Soviet Union. We support every balanced agreement made to this end.43.	We call for arms control with regard to outer space while there is still time.44.	At the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  we want to achieve parity in conventional forces in Central Europe by means of mutual troop reductions.45.	We urge the participants in the Conference on Confidence and Security building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  to agree to concrete  militarily significant and verifiable measures for security and confidence-building. Such measures must apply to the whole of Europe.46.	We advocate that the undertaking to refrain from the threat or use of force be made concrete and be reaffirmed within the mandate given to the Stockholm Conference. It must apply among all States within the alliance systems and to the actions of participating States throughout the world.47.	We call for a fresh initiative in the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Finnish proposal that the tenth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act be marked by a conference at a political level merits support.48.	We appeal to all Members of the United Nations to enter into the process of confidence building in all parts of the world in a practical and serious manner  thereby improving worldwide the conditions for disarmament and arms control.49.	It remains important  in view of the universal increase in military expenditure  to publish military budgets and make them comparable. We call for a United Nations register providing information on arms exports and imports throughout the world.50.	We want a worldwide  comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical weapons. It is not sufficient to ban chemical weapons in Europe only  thereby preserving the option of using them in other parts of the world.51.	The commitments entered into as a result of disarmament negotiations must be verifiable. The Federal Republic of Germany will contribute its share to achieving success in disarmament negotiations.52.	Europe has experienced the horrors of two world wars. The European Community was born of these experiences. We seek European Union. The peoples joined in that union will develop their strengths and capabilities in such a way that Europe can take its rightful place in the world.53.	Franco German friendship is an example of how the lessons of history can be taken to heart. The joint commemoration by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and the President of the French Republic of the war dead at the Verdun military graves is a symbol of reconciliation and friendship.54.	The States of the European Community want to master the future together. But Europe is more than the 10 Statesâsoon to be 12âof the European Community. We seek cooperation with all the States of Europe. We Germans are aware of the responsibility deriving from the history of our country and from our situation at the heart of Europe. The Federal Republic of Germany has linked its fate firmly to that of Europe. Our policy is a policy for peace in Europe. With the other States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  we want to create  on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act a rueful order in Europe in which cooperation can develop freely between States  irrespective of the differences in their systems. We seek a peaceful order in which  as envisaged in the Helsinki Final Act  nations  can determine their own fate and live free from the fear of violence  threats and restriction of their liberty and in which people can enjoy the exercise of their lawful rights and the fruits of peaceful international exchanges.55.	It is a policy for peace in Europe too when we declare  as stated in the letter on German unity  that our political aim is to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination.56.	The treaties concluded between my country and our Eastern neighbours in the 1970s cleared the way for the Helsinki Final Act. We stand by every word of those treaties. The Federal Republic of Germany respects the territorial integrity of all States within their present boundaries. It proceeds from the existing situation in Europe. It makes no territorial claims on anyone and will not do so in the future either. The Federal Republic of Germany considers the borders of all States to be inviolable and will continue to do so. We call upon all States to educate their young people in peace and in respect for other nations and other opinions. Education in hatred jeopardizes peace; polemics against the peaceful intentions of other nations poison the political atmosphere.57.	The Federal Republic of Germany wishes to breathe life into the treaties concluded with its Eastern neighbours. We want the Helsinki Final Act to be implemented in all its parts. We want to continue the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That process has improved the situation in Europe; it has stood up under severe strains in the international climate. The contribution of all participants in the Conference  large States as well as small  will remain indispensable to security and cooperation in Europe. We want cooperation with all the States adherents to the Warsaw Pact. We want cooperationâpolitical  economic  technological and environmental. We want close cultural exchanges.58.	We shall resolutely and patiently pursue our charted course towards compromise and understanding. We shall not let ourselves be disheartened or confounded. We shall consistently pursue with the Soviet Union the dialogue and cooperation based on the Treaty of Moscowâand continued even during difficult times. That Treaty  like the long-term economic agreement  opens up great vistas that must be exploited.59.	The desire for German Polish understanding and reconciliation determines our thinking and action towards the Polish nation. The Treaty of Warsaw  concluded on 7 December 1970  breached once and for all the vicious circle of injustice and retaliation. It was one of the most important milestones in German and European post-war politics.60.	Our cooperation with the German Democratic Republic  even at times of East West tension  is an expression of the historically rooted responsibility of both German States for peace in Europe. This responsibility must also prove its worth in the joint solution of human and technical problems. People must be able to experience personally the benefits of detente. In this respect we have made progress. It is our wish that both German States should continue along the route marked out by the Basic Treaty normalizing relations and the Helsinki Final Act. It is our wish that they should set an example by meeting their obligations under the Final Act. In this way we shall live up to the requirement inherent in the recognition of our joint responsibility.61.	An improved relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is vitally important to East West relations and to world peace. Contemplation of the principles of equality and mutual consideration embodied in the United States Soviet declaration of 1972 could smooth the way for such a development. President Reagan  in his statement to the Assembly [4th meeting]  expressed the determination of his country to cooperate with the Soviet Union in securing world peace. That ought to meet with a favourable response from the Soviet Union. We can offer no substitute for dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union  but we  like other medium and small sized States  make our contribution to improving East West relations  and it is no mean contribution.62.	Europe  so often afflicted by wars and the source of many wars in other parts of the world  must today serve as the starting point for initiatives aimed at peace and cooperation in all parts of the world. For this reason  as a member of the European Community  the Federal Republic of Germany also relies in its relations with the third world countries on a policy that seeks  as stated in the second Lome Convention  ""to reinforce  on the basis of complete equality between partners and in their mutual interest  close and continuing cooperation in a spirit of international solidarity"".63.	We seek friendship and partnership on an equal basis with the countries of the South. We support the principle of genuine nonalignment because it preserves independence and provides protection from foreign hegemonic aspirations. The Movement of Nonaligned Countries is increasingly becoming a stabilizing factor in international politics.64.	The most populous country in the world  the People's Republic of China  is of great importance to world stability. We are gratified to note that China is opening its doors to Asia and to the world at large and is exercising its co-responsibility for international peace and cooperation.65.	The regional groupings offer small and medium sized States the opportunity to pool their resources and together to maintain their independence. The European Community cooperates closely with the States members of ASEAN and the Andean Pact within the framework of cooperation agreements. We advocate close cooperation between the members of the European Community and the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council. We are playing our part to ensure that the Euro Arab dialogue will be further intensified.66.	In a few days the Foreign Ministers of the States members of the European Community  together with Spain and Portugal  will be meeting at San Jose with their counterparts from the countries of Central America and the Contadora Group to launch a political dialogue and to lay the foundations for economic cooperation between the European Community and Central America.67.	North and South must talk to one another  negotiate with one another and find joint solutions to the present and future problems of humanity. The North South dialogue will be successful only if it is conducted in awareness of the equal dignity of all the world's cultures. The subject of cultural exchanges between North and South must not be banished to the fringe of talks; it must be at the very heart of such talks. Our world is full of cultural prejudices that are often rooted in ignorance. We all have more to learn from one another. The North may be richer than the South  but it is not thereby wiser  more human or more cultivated. The cultures of North and South must each recognize the equality of the other in its own cultural dignity. It is a matter of the mental attitude with which we encounter other peoples.68.	How often has arrogance towards other peoples arisen from contempt for their cultural identity and achievements. To understand a country  one must understand its culture. Experience of the equivalence of cultures is not inbred in peoples. It requires intensive cultural exchanges. We are prepared to give; we are prepared to take. Cultural exchanges contribute to the establishment of a peaceful international order.69.	During these days the nations of the world have turned to United Nations Headquarters in New York in hope and anxiety. They are uneasy. It is not merely the presence of tensions that worries them  it is the apparent increase in those tensions  and they wonder what will happen if the tensions continue to increase.70.	The problems confronting us are serious and difficult. No one expects us during these days to discover a magic formula that will solve them all at once. But the nations are right to expect one thing  namely  that we should give signs of hope  signs that the Governments of the world have recognized the danger  signs that they can halt the rising tensions. The nations do not want to hear us repeating long familiar  irreconcilable positions or apportioning blame. They want to know what specifically we intend to do in order to serve the common cause of peace. We must not disappoint them.71.	I have explained how my country fulfils its responsibility. The Federal Republic of Germany faces the challenge of peace with the confidence of a country whose citizens can freely develop and freely help to build a humanitarian and just world. This great aim of a just and humanitarian world should guide us as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1985 and as we observe in 1986 the International Year of Peace."
"40",1883,"DJI",39,1984,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Lusaka my most sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. His election to that high office is an honour to his country and to him personally. His great knowledge and experience of the United Nations will  I am sure  enable him to guide the deliberations of this session to fruitful results. I assure him that my delegation will always lend him its entire support and co-operation to help him shoulder the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him.323.	I should like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to his predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who demonstrated exemplary competence and devotion during his presidency of the thirty-eighth session.324.	It is also a great pleasure for me to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his zeal and devotion to the purposes and principles for which the United Nations was created and for the consistency of his efforts to promote peace and understanding among the nations of the world.325.	The delegation of Djibouti is also happy to congratulate the State of Brunei Darussalam on its independence and welcomes it most warmly to membership in the United Nations. We are happy to see Brunei Darussalam take its place here among the great family of the United Nations. We hope that soon we will be able to co-operate with that country.326.	Meeting once again here in the General Assembly  we find ourselves faced with many international problems that require great efforts of understanding and co-operation from us all.327.	We believe that the United Nations is the forum most suited to the exchange of ideas. It provides the most favourable atmosphere for developing human relations for the promotion of international understanding  peace and security. This is why we believe in the purposes and principles of the United Nations  particularly at a time when economic  social and political turmoil are creating hotbeds of tension and disruption in many parts of the world  especially in the third world. This dangerous situation in Africa  Asia and Latin America could  if remedies are not found rather swiftly  threaten the very survival of their populations.328.	Moreover  because of the escalation of tension that has been triggered particularly by the arms build-up  the entire world is living through a nuclear nightmare which could ultimately eliminate any glimmer of hope. All of us here are concerned about this danger  which would spare nobody. The nuclear and conventional arms races do not help dialogue among nations and are not in accordance with the principles underlying the creation of the United Nations following the terrible Second World War.329.	How can we speak of co-operation if the nuclear danger and this tension hang over our heads? We trust that through our combined efforts we shall be able to bring about a relaxation of tension  which will be in the interest of the peoples of the entire world.330.	Turning to the economic crisis  we are all aware of the fact that we would be virtually powerless to control the world economy unless there were full co-operation between the United Nations and its Member States.331.	The deterioration of the international economic situation has led the international organizations to give priority to studying ways and means of achieving a rapid improvement in the economy. Yet the problem of restructuring the world economy with a view to establishing a new international economic order based on more equitable economic relations remains unsolved. Only an atmosphere of mutual trust and a common determination to arrive at agreement on the most crucial issues will enable us to overcome the difficulties and lead us out of the deadlock in the negotiations between the developed and the developing countries.332.	I want to emphasize the terrible consequences of the economic crisis for Africa  which is most seriously affected by this situation. This problem has become a source of major concern and a matter of priority in the United Nations  as can be seen by the praiseworthy initiative of the Secretary-General and as has been emphasized in many international forums.333.	The African countries  aware of the gravity of the situation  have advanced various constructive solutions to help resolve the crisis. These proposals  which are contained in the Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  held at Addis Ababa in May of this year  reflect the views of African Governments and should be given due attention by the international community. In this connection  we urge the world community to co-operate fully with African Governments in their efforts.334.	The Republic of Djibouti  which ranks as one of the least developed countries  is experiencing a rather precarious economic situation because of its lack of natural resources and the non-existence of productive agricultural and industrial activities. My country has to import most of its consumer goods and food at very high prices. In addition  the acute shortage of qualified and experienced manpower in almost all public and private sectors aggravates the economic situation.335.	We also suffer from periodic droughts  the most recent of which affected more than a fifth of the population and destroyed a large percentage of our livestock.336.	In addition  the Republic of Djibouti  despite its meagre resources  welcomes in its territory refugees  and this makes even heavier the burden of the Government.337.	The economy of our country has so far been service-oriented  and this sector will be improved and modernized in years to come to meet national  regional and international requirements. However  to avoid complete dependence on a single sector  the Government has taken a political decision to which effect is given in its programme for the next seven years and which will enable us to establish the necessary conditions for a dynamic process capable of creating a productive economy based on the principles of collective autonomy. This programme was submitted to the international community in November 1983  when the conference of donors to Djibouti was held. Friendly countries and international organizations responded favourably to our appeal and contributed to the success of that conference. I take this opportunity to thank them for that response. We are convinced that the commitments entered into at the conference will be honoured so that we can attain our objectives.338.	The Republic of Djibouti would also like to promote fruitful co-operation with economic and trade partners based on mutual respect and the principles of interdependence and equality. We attach great importance to regional and interregional economic co-operation among developing countries  and we are ready to make our contribution to these efforts. We appreciate the value of fruitful co-operation with our Arab and African brothers and with other friendly countries.339.	We have always applied a policy of good- neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and  in the regional context  this ensures that trust  tolerance and mutual understanding prevail. Faithful to that position  we continue to work in this direction and we urge other States to intensify their efforts to create the conditions necessary to ensure the restoration of peace and stability to our region. We believe that initiatives in favour of a positive dialogue should be directed above all to developing significant co-operation in cultural and trade exchanges. We also believe that success for such a peace policy can be achieved only if we respect the fact that each of us is different.340.	Here we should like to pay a tribute to the efforts to ensure a dialogue that will have a positive impact on our region as a whole.341.	On the subject of the Indian Ocean  we believe that it is essential to apply the principles contained in the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace in order to avoid any continuance of the military escalation in that region. The Republic of Djibouti fully supports the wish expressed by the countries of the region and other States that want the Indian Ocean to become a zone of peace. Accordingly  we support the tireless efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean.342.	Last July  international shipping in the Red Sea faced an unprecedentedly dangerous situation when 18 or 19 ships belonging to different nations were damaged by mines. It goes without saying that this criminal act opens up new prospects of international terrorism  the consequences of which are unforeseeable.343.	The Republic of Djibouti  as a coastal State whose economic stability depends on maritime trade  views the deliberate mining of international waters with concern and anxiety. We have said that we are willing to co-operate with States in the Red Sea basin to prevent any such occurrences in future. This danger might not be limited to a single region of the world. Nobody knows where it will strike next. In these circumstances  the international community must be vigilant.344.	The Palestinian question remains the crucial issue in the Middle East crisis. At its last session and at earlier sessions  the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions condemning unambiguously the practices of the State of Israel in the occupied Arab territories and declaring null and void all the administrative and legislative measures taken by the occupying Power in pursuit of its annexionist and expansionist policy.345.	So far  no tangible results have been achieved. On the contrary  the occupying Power  through its discriminatory and arbitrary measures  has been strangling the economic  cultural and social life of the Palestinians and has been encouraging new settlers to come by using force and terror.346.	Much has been said about peace in the Middle East. We believe it is high time to talk about justice  for peace is a corollary of justice. Several peace plans have been proposed but none has yet taken effect because of the stubbornness and the categorical rejection of the Israeli Government.347.	We believe that the only path to just and lasting peace is recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the creation of an independent and sovereign State  the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and recognition of the PLO as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.348.	We would  here  pay tribute to the courage of the Palestinian people and congratulate the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization  our brother Yasser Arafat  for his tireless efforts to ensure that the objectives of his people are attained.349.	Since Israel has been occupying Jerusalem  the Islamic holy places have been the object of acts of sacrilege by Zionist extremists whose declared goal is to destroy the Christian and Muslim holy places  actions that they consider as the first steps towards complete Judaization of Jerusalem.350.	For centuries  the Muslims have been protecting the Christian and Jewish holy places  in accordance with the prescriptions of the sacred Koran  establishing relations between Muslims and those that received the writings before them. But  alas  nothing prevents the Zionist zealots from committing dastardly and cowardly crimes that will be inscribed in the annals of the darkest pages of the history of mankind. We believe that the international community must shoulder its moral and political responsibility and condemn such actions and ensure that the holy places of the various religions are kept safe.351.	Israel has always shown that it can indulge in acts of aggression against its neighbours as it sees fit. The most recent was the invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. We should not like to recall the horrors of that war  but we want to express our deep concern over Israel's continuing occupation of southern Lebanon and over the arbitrary measures taken by the occupying forces. Israel's attempts to isolate southern Lebanon by blocking the two main roads linking the south to the north  the restrictions on freedom of movement imposed on the inhabitants  its repression of the population there and its usurpation of the natural resources expose the real intentions of the Zionist occupiers.352.	The United Nations must exert pressure on Israel so that it will submit to the principle of the inviolability of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon  in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982). We call on the international community to help Lebanon regain its sovereignty over all of its national territory so as to allow for the reconstruction of that country  which for a decade has been subjected to unprecedented suffering and devastation.353.	The constant search for solutions to the tragic situation in South Africa has unfortunately not yet yielded any positive results. Confrontation and violence are constantly occurring  for the racist regime of Pretoria arrogantly rejects all appeals launched by the international community to abandon its policy of apartheid and continues to refuse to give the great majority of the people of South Africa fundamental political and human rights and freedoms.354.	The international community believes that apartheid has become a well-established system of institutionalized racism and racial discrimination against the black majority of South Africa. That is why apartheid has repeatedly been condemned as a crime against humanity. International mobilization to ensure the total elimination of that scourge is a sacred duty of the international community.355.	We reaffirm here the legitimacy of the struggle of the people of South Africa to eliminate that curious system  which flouts the most elementary rights of an entire people.356.	It is more than high time for the international community to take concerted action to avoid any escalation of violence that could give international dimensions to this conflict. We urge all States to respect the decisions adopted at international conferences.357.	Last August  the apartheid regime introduced a so-called new constitution which exposed another aspect of the odious policy of segregation  racism and racial discrimination in South Africa. This so-called constitution is a new strategy of confrontation which opens the doors to violence and police brutality against the black majority. It brought back to life that old policy of the colonial era which is now in its death throes: ""divide and rule"". However  we did note that the election of the three-chamber parliament required by the constitution through a referendum was almost completely boycotted. This humiliating defeat inflicted on the policy of apartheid was an outstanding proof of the great extent of popular support for the black majority struggling in South Africa. We believe that this so-called new constitution and the manoeuvres relating to it are just another aspect of apartheid which we must condemn and declare null and void.358.	We declare once again that condemning apartheid means actively supporting the liberation struggle and giving increased assistance to the liberation movements of South Africa.359.	As far as Namibia is concerned  the racist regime in South Africa continues to occupy the country illegally. The presence of the armed forces and the administrative authorities of South Africa in Namibia  the brutal repression of the Namibian people  the constant violation of human rights and the illegal exploitation of Namibia  and the attacks against neighbouring independent States  all of these must be forcefully condemned.360.	Any negotiations towards a political solution in Namibia must try to arrive at a cease-fire  followed by an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African occupying forces from the territory so as to enable the Namibian people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).361.	We reaffirm that the United Nations plan for Namibia  for which Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides a framework  remains the sole basis for a just and peaceful settlement of the question of Namibia. We must strongly condemn the most recent manoeuvres of the South African administration which are designed to flout the United Nations plan  thus violating the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and leading to the continuing colonial domination of Namibian territory by South Africa.362.	We strongly condemn the repeated acts of aggression and attacks perpetrated by the South African armed forces against neighbouring sovereign independent States  trying to intimidate  destabilize and discourage them from providing support to the liberation fronts.363.	In particular  we pay tribute to the front-line States  which have sacrificed a great deal to the cause of Namibian liberation and have stepped up their moral and material aid to the courageous people of Namibia and to SWAPO  despite the constant threats by South Africa. We call upon the international community to increase its generous assistance to the Namibian people struggling under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole authentic representative.364.	We believe that any economic or financial co-operation with South Africa would only increase the capacity of that apartheid regime to commit aggression and thus intensify its brutal repression of the African majority in South Africa.365.	With regard to Chad  we have always stated from this rostrum our conviction that foreign intervention or interference can never settle that problem. We now welcome the fact that France and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have decided to withdraw their respective forces from that territory. We hope that this new situation will lead to a resumption of the reconciliation process between brothers in Chad and that they will embark on an authentic dialogue aimed at ending a tragic situation that has already lasted too long. We trust that the efforts of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to resolve the problem will be stepped up in order to create an atmosphere and a framework conducive to dialogue in Chad.366.	My country reaffirms its position with regard to Western Sahara  namely  that the Saharan people should be enabled to exercise their right to self- determination. We fully support the consensus obtained within the framework of the OAU on organizing a referendum so that the Saharan people can express their wishes freely and in accordance with the various resolutions of the OAU summits.367.	We welcome the efforts undertaken for the solution of this problem and trust that the impetus will be maintained in order to preserve peace in our continent. We sincerely hope that the unity and understanding among the countries of the Maghreb will help the OAU in the search for a peaceful solution to this problem.368.	Turning now to the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Republic of Djibouti is deeply saddened by the dangerous situation in which those two countries have been involved for the past four years. They have been engaged in a bitter conflict in which they have both suffered and exhausted human  economic and material resources that could have been used for their economic development.369.	While we appreciate the constant efforts of the Security Council and the good offices of the Secretary-General and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  as well as those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  we must nevertheless express our deep concern and sorrow at the failure of the efforts undertaken to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. We regret that the war has recently been extended to the Gulf region and we feel that this could not only threaten the region but also have serious repercussions on world peace and security.370.	We welcome the wise action of the States members of the Gulf Co-operation Council in seeking a peaceful solution to that tragic conflict  and my Government has consistently supported the efforts undertaken by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.371.	We fully appreciate the positive initiative taken unilaterally by the Iraqi Government with a view to starting negotiations and halting military operations. We believe that efforts must be redoubled and support given to all initiatives in the hope of bringing peace to that region.372.	The Afghan crisis is still unresolved despite intensive efforts in the search for a political settlement based on full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan. It is clear that foreign armed intervention and the permanent foreign presence make it impossible for the Afghan people to express their wishes through free elections. The withdrawal of foreign troops and strict respect for the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries would enable the Afghan people to choose their future in freedom.373.	Tue Kampuchean people are the victims of foreign invasion and armed occupation. That situation is still unresolved and is a matter of concern to all nations that cherish peace. The Republic of Djibouti is opposed to foreign armed intervention and to the presence of foreign troops in the territory of Kampuchea. We reaffirm the need for all foreign troops to be withdrawn from Kampuchea in order to promote a political settlement that will ensure respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and restore its sovereignty  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.374.	With regard to the Korean Peninsula  we believe that the unity of Korea can be achieved peacefully through direct negotiations between the two parties concerned  without any outside intervention or interference. We call for an early resumption of the dialogue in order to reduce the present tension and establish trust between the two parties  thus preparing the ground for a peaceful settlement in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and making it possible to satisfy the national aspirations of the Korean people.375.	We wish to reaffirm the importance that we attach to what could be called the world conscience. On the basis of the elementary principles of the right to live in dignity and guided by the fundamental principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  all nations represented here must shoulder their responsibilities so that solutions may be found to the most urgent problems facing our peoples  in particular the poorest among them. We are convinced that through the determination and political will of each State we shall be able to bring to international relations more tolerance and fairness based on open and loyal co-operation. Practical examples of this exist  and we believe that  despite all difficulties  we must build upon them and strengthen them so as to give hope to future generations.376.	We might also mention South-South co-operation as part of this dynamic process. We welcome the realignments in the third world that should make it possible to ensure authentic dialogue between their peoples  leading to stability and peace.377.	I said earlier that in the context of this world conscience we all have a collective responsibility  and it is in the United Nations that we come closest to that reality. We sincerely hope  as the fortieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations approaches  that greater and greater efforts will be made to ensure that we achieve the purposes and principles of the Organization  for the benefit of mankind as a whole."
"41",1909,"DMA",39,1984,"ï»¿I wish to take the opportunity afforded me today to add my bit to those who have congratulated the President on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election is a further manifestation of the high esteem in which he is held by the members of this body and an expression of confidence in his ability to guide this session of the Assembly through its deliberations. I have no doubt that his experience and well-known diplomatic skills will contribute immensely to making this session a memorable one.190.	I also wish to offer our appreciation and congratulations to the outgoing President  the President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who so ably and successfully presided over the thirty-eighth session.191.	I wish to join with others who spoke before me to welcome Brunei Darussalam  the 159th Member of the United Nations.192.	Nearly four decades ago  a world bleeding and spent by the ravages of war pledged itself to the goals of and objectives enshrined in a Charter of hope and promise for its nations and peoples. One hundred and more wars and countless economic and social crises later  the Secretary-General  in whom is reposed the responsibility for applying the letter and spirit of the Charter  has stated in rueful terms that the United Nations as a peace-keeper is being frustrated by a proliferation of resolutions that are not being implemented.193.	Since that day  2A October 1945  when the Charter of the United Nations came into force  countless lives have been sacrificed with shocking frequency in many dispersed theatres of conflict; millions of infants have been weaned and nurtured in environments of insurrection  villainy and hate.194.	The sensibilities of civilized man have been repeatedly stunned by the wanton rape  torture and murder of women  men and children  even in countries where long-standing religious practice and commitment should have been expected to have secured the sanctity of human life.195.	And  as if that were not sufficient  incidents recur of ordinary men  women and children harassed and harried from their homes across tense frontiers  through inhospitable seas infested by marauding pirates. And so  on and on  this morbid period in the history of man's inhumanity to man continues  untouched  it appears  by contemporary pretensions of civilization  sophistication and intellectualism.196.	Like a doomsday book  the record continues to include issues of personal survival for some billions who live in conditions of abject misery  victims of disease from the womb to an early tomb. Even as multinational sales cynically promote death-dealing chemicals across the borders of third world countries  other billions of emaciated  famished and dispossessed beings shift from hope to economic hopelessness as financial crises beyond their control fetter them to an existence of daily  cruel privation.197.	Little wonder then  as pangs of common frustration and deepening depression bind these masses together across national frontiers in ever- expanding communities of despair and resentment  unstable and unreasonable radicalism fills the void between the conservatism of traditional leadership and the virulent anger of desperate followers. And contemporary notions of East versus West or North versus South pale before the potential of an apocalyptic conflagration which any diabolical exploitation of this scenario of mass resentment could ignite.198.	How then  now or in the future  do we discharge our trust to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to fulfil the noble purpose of the United Nations?199.	It is our submission that our predecessors  with their predisposition to the cause of mankind's welfare and security  envisaged the evolution of an international society with characteristics no less societal for being international  characteristics of common  basic moral values  of common ethical norms  instinctively pervasive  and of common language with all its nuances fluent among the international community.200.	It is our view that the escalating fragmentation of international society into entities such as third world  East and West  North and South  and non- aligned nations  is a clear reflection of pressure groupings in search of areas of commonality which  notwithstanding the Charter's noble precepts  have not yet been translated into universal practice.201.	It is our prognosis that  as more and more States with less and less commonality with their predecessors are admitted to the Organization  more and more will the fragmentation of interests outside the ambit of the United Nations society increase  with inexorable and agonizing costs that the architects of the Charter did not intend for its beneficiaries.202.	Yes  the world situation that the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly is called upon to address is not a substantial improvement upon that which faced the thirty-eighth session. These major problems persist in nearly every sphere of human endeavour  and in some cases have worsened. It is not an entirely comforting thought that  notwithstanding the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies  very few significant changes have been effected in those areas most concerned with the development and enhancement of the human condition. The lack of progress in efforts to bring about meaningful change is of great concern to us  because in nearly every case the least able among us are called upon to bear a disproportionate burden and sacrifice.203.	Recent hurricane damage in North America forces us to recall that just over five years ago  when the Commonwealth of Dominica had begun the process of adjusting to its newly independent status  Hurricane David devastated our small island State  severely crippling our limited productive capacity. The effort to repair the damage of that hurricane is still under way  but it has to be understood that a small nation which  prior to 1979  was hard pressed to find the resources to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure found the task doubly difficult in the ensuing years.204.	Some members of the international community came to our assistance  and we are grateful to them  but  even with the bilateral and multilateral aid the Commonwealth of Dominica has received over the past five years  the struggle to revive our economy  rebuild our infrastructure and provide minimally decent standards of living for our people has at times been hard and frustrating. But the experience has been invaluable  and at every level the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica have shown the determination  industry and leadership qualities necessary to meet the situation.205.	Reference is made here to the problems experienced by the Commonwealth of Dominica because in normal times they are duplicated every day in small island States everywhere  and even in the larger States of the third world  and the arrangements by which the international economic system is meant to be regulated have demonstrated profound weaknesses and an inability to deal effectively with those problems. Inevitably  the problems will most likely grow worse  with disastrous consequences for all  unless new approaches to the world economy are developed to meet the recurring crises that have repeatedly impinged upon and severely impeded the development effort of third world countries.206.	We have seen the high inflation and low growth of the 1970s followed  in the 1980s  by the longest recession in 50 years. There are reports of recovery in the industrialized countries  but the benefits of that recovery are not immediately apparent to us. High prices for industrial products  coupled with decreased demand for our exports  have left the economies of small island States such as the Commonwealth of Dominica in a depressed condition  a situation further aggravated by the protectionist policies being pursued by the industrial countries. Exhorted to place reliance on market forces  the Commonwealth of Dominica finds its attempt to diversify is less than successful  because the major markets will not readily accept the new products resulting from its diversification.207.	The world economic situation should be of concern to all nations  and  in an effort to ameliorate some of the worse effects upon the Caribbean region  the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community and Common Market took some action at their fifth summit meeting  held at Nassau from 4 to 7 July 1984. However  the Caribbean Community and Common Market can affect the situation only in a rather limited way  given that international economic relations are so closely interwoven.208.	The Commonwealth of Dominica views with concern and even alarm the international debt situation  which has assumed crisis proportions over the last few years. Admittedly  the ability of the Commonwealth of Dominica to borrow is limited  but  in the face of greatly increased costs  the servicing of whatever debt we have incurred only imposes an additional economic burden on a small State struggling to meet existing obligations.209.	Moreover  our concern goes beyond our own immediate plight. The debt problems with which the international community is at present faced have already resulted in the slowing of economic growth in many third world countries. That has necessitated the adoption of new policies geared to meet the changed conditions. Optimistic forecasts have given way to a gloomy outlook  and aspirations and dreams have been shattered. The new realism is that those who have very little will have to make do with less  and the social implications have already manifested themselves in some areas.210.	The Commonwealth of Dominica believes that the best hope for developing countries lies in a determined and concerted effort by the international community to increase concessional aid to those countries. The Committee for Development Planning spoke eloquently to that issue at its twentieth session  held from 17 to 21 May this year."" Noting that ""there is disorder verging on chaos in several areas critical to the economic life of all nations""  the Committee found that  while ""the heaviest burdens are falling on the weakest and poorest economies and therefore on the people within human society least able to bear that burden""  concessional ""flows have declined in real terms and now face special jeopardy"". The Committee views the situation as ""little short of an international scandal"" in the light of the fact that in present economic conditions ""sustained concessional flows to the poorest countries . . . assume an even greater importance than usual"".211.	Economic development is ideally undertaken in an international climate that is peaceful and free from tension. In more than one way  development is linked to arms reduction and disarmament  and that is one of the reasons why the Commonwealth of Dominica deplores the continuing arms race at every level. The ever-growing arsenals of nuclear weapons in the possession of the super-Powers are alarming  and the desire of an. increasing number of nations to acquire a nuclear potential is frightening. The continuous stockpiling of nuclear arms is the single most important problem facing the world today.212.	Nuclear disarmament and arms reduction must be the goal of all members of the international community. The attainment of that goal is a duty owed to every human being on Earth  and one we cannot shirk. The question is a recurrent theme of General Assembly debates  and the United Nations has convened special sessions to deal with the matter. Regrettably  however  in the face of a lack of cooperation by the nuclear Powers  the United Nations has been unable to make real progress in that important area. But lack of concrete achievement should not dissuade the international community from raising its collective voice against the trend to add to the existing arsenals. Nor should the world be persuaded by the deterrent argument  which  in the light of proliferation  is far outweighed by the potential for disaster resulting from mistake or irrational behaviour.213.	In the endeavour to stem the tide of nuclear proliferation and to proceed on the path leading to the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons  serious consideration should be given to the establishment of nuclear-free zones. The Treaty of Tlatelolco  signed by the Latin American countries  should serve as a guide in that regard.214.	International peace and security are threatened not only by nuclear weapons but also by the ever-growing trade in conventional arms of increasing destructiveness. That extensive trade in arms  by nations large and small  increases tension  intensifies fear  and adversely affects the stability of regions world-wide. Pursued in the name of national security  it invariably leads to regional insecurity. Militarily weak States feel threatened by their stronger neighbours  especially when there appears to be no correlation between objective security needs and the range and accumulation of arms.215.	The Commonwealth of Dominica  along with its neighbours in the Eastern Caribbean  is not unaware of the problem. Not so long ago  it experienced the potential threat posed to its existence as an independent State by a massive arms build-up in the region by a State whose security could not possibly require armaments of the nature and in the quantity that ultimately came to light.216.	Billions of dollars spent for arms by third world countries keep the munitions factories of the arms-exporting countries operating at full capacity  while economic development programmes stagnate for lack of funds. Five per cent of the amount spent for arms world-wide  if allocated to development programmes  would make the world a much better place for the majority of its inhabitants. It is lamentable that nations apparently see nothing sadly wrong in committing such tremendous energy and resources to potential wars of destruction rather than to the immediate war against increasing hunger  rampant disease  widespread malnutrition and illiteracy  unacceptably high infant mortality and the need to provide homes for millions of people.217.	The ability of the United Nations to maintain world peace and security is being severely tested by the local conflicts that are being waged with mounting intensity in various parts of the world. In many cases  super-Power rivalry  especially in the Security Council  obstructs the United Nations in the search for solutions to those grave problems; but more than that  it aggravates and exacerbates the conflicts themselves  transforming them into proxy wars and giving them new impetus and rationale. That appears to be the case with respect to the struggles in Central America.218.	The Commonwealth of Dominica believes that the conflicts in Central America are the products of complex social  economic and historical factors endemic to the area  and the infusion of larger amounts of arms into the region is not likely to result in any lasting solution. The conditions that engendered the conflicts must be addressed seriously and urgently  and  in pursuit of that goal  negotiation presents advantages that will surely be absent in any resolution arrived at by military means.219.	The efforts of the countries of the Contadora GroupâColombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuelaâin the search for a formula for negotiation and dialogue must be considered the only real hope for some measure of peace in the region. Those efforts should command the active support of all nations that desire an end to the tragic loss of lives and wanton destruction in Central America.220.	Despite the temporary lull in the fighting  the Middle East remains an area of tension threatening international peace and security. Year after year we have taken note in this body of the situation in the Middle East and the threat that it poses to the larger international community  but the central questions remain unresolved. The adverse claims of the antagonists are not irreconcilable; but decades of fear and suspicion have precluded the realization that the nations of that region have a community of interests which  if recognized  should lead them to abandon confrontation and embrace reconciliation and progress.221.	The Commonwealth of Dominica  having gained its freedom less than six years ago  values its independence and unequivocally supports the principle of self-determination for all peoples. Therefore  we cannot but support the claim of the Palestinian people to a homeland and its right to decide its own future under the leadership of men and women freely chosen by it. At the same time  there is a corresponding right of the State of Israel to exist in peace within secure borders. The assertions of those rights are not mutually exclusive. It only requires courage and statesmanship from the leaders of the region and balanced commitment and support from the rest of the world. That is the task which faces the peoples of the Middle East and the rest of the international community  and it does not appear to be beyond our collective effort and resolve.222.	As we assemble today  Lebanon  once a prosperous country of the Middle East  remains divided  its once flourishing institutions in shambles  and its territory occupied by foreign forces. No nation deserves the fate of Lebanon. The Commonwealth of Dominica condemn the continuing violation of the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon and joins with other Members of this body in calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese soil in as expeditious a manner as possible.223.	The war between Iran and Iraq has dragged on for four years  and there does not appear to be any end in sight. Thousands of lives  including those of innocent civilians  have been lost  but the attention span of the world community appears to be brief and sporadic. That tragic conflict does not seem to have been a great preoccupation of the world community until recently  when the attacks on oil tankers posed a threat to the economic well-being of certain industrialized countries. It is indeed a sad commentary on the state of world opinion that it appears to accord to property damage higher consideration in the scheme of things than it does to the loss of human life.224.	By any yardstick  the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq deserves greater diplomatic effort than it has received in the past  and we believe that the United Nations should seriously undertake an effort to energize all interested parties in an attempt to find a solution to that war.225.	With respect to the situation in Koreaâa country that has been divided for nearly as long as the Organization has been in existenceâthere is an urgent need for a peaceful solution. In our view  this can be done only through direct negotiation among the different factions. Dialogue can dispel the existing antagonisms and distrust and lead ultimately to reconciliation. To this end  this thirty-ninth session should consider favourably the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations fold as full Members  thereby fostering their peaceful existence.226.	Even as this session got under way  the stark realities of the pernicious system of apartheid were forced upon the consciousness of the world by the violence of the forces of the South African Government against the black majority peacefully attempting to assert rights recognized by everyone. On the day before the beginning of the general debate  500 black South Africans were arrested and detained by the police of the minority Government of South Africa for no other reason than that they had attended the funeral of a 22-year-old man.227.	The abominable system of apartheid has received the justifiable condemnation of the civilized world but the internationally ostracized regime of South Africa  in defiance of world opinion  has embarked on a policy of further entrenching that odious system by a shameful constitutional arrangement that isolates the black majority of South Africa and fixes it permanently  as it were  beyond the pale of popular representation.228.	The defiance of world opinion by the apartheid regime of South Africa is made possible by the glaring inconsistency of some nations which  while condemning the international canker that is apartheid  eagerly conduct business as usual with the South African regime. The Commonwealth of Dominica believes  therefore  that in condemning apartheid we must also deplore the actions of those nations that serve as an underpinning for the system  and we must also reject the reasons advanced for their actions. Otherwise  many might justifiably accuse us of sophistry and of crystallizing formalisms.229.	The apartheid regime of South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia despite the clear responsibility of the United Nations for that Territory and notwithstanding the many resolutions of this body calling upon South Africa to bring its illegal occupation to an end. The people of Namibia have a right to self-determination  freedom and national independence  in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2145 (XXI)  as well as subsequent resolutions of this body in connection with Namibia. Further  we support the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO  and we do not believe that South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its repression of and violence against the Namibian people can be legitimately linked to other events in southern Africa.230.	The founding fathers  in drafting the principles by which the United Nations should be guided  called upon all nations ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person"" and ""in the equal rights of men and women"". That summons was further strengthened by Article 55 of the Charter mandating the United Nations to ""promote . . . universal respect for . . . human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion"". Concern for human rights by the United Nations also led to the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.231.	The Charter and the Declaration represent the clearest expression by the international community of the belief that mankind's progress in every field should be consonant with the preservation of individual freedoms and human dignity.232.	The promotion and protection of human rights is a duty imposed on all Members of the United Nations. The evidence of widespread violations of human rights on every continent of the globe should therefore provoke moral outrage in all of us on a scale much larger than is at present evident.233.	The question of human rights violations is ritualistically included in the agenda of the General Assembly  but the selective basis on which condemnation is meted out by this body belies the pretended concern by the United Nations for the victims of human rights violations. That the violation of human rights should be condemned wherever and whenever it occurs is a position unshakeably held by the Commonwealth of Dominica  and we believe that condemnation limited to a few States merely heightens scepticism regarding the Organization and tarnishes its reputation.234.	The search for peace and the general welfare of mankind is not a new concept. Yet mankind still seeks to resolve its differences by conflict of one sort or another. Man himself  in panic and hysteria  has in recent times endeavoured with his intellectual resources and through instruments and mechanisms of his own design to circumvent the golden rule.235.	I wish to suggest that the Organization may yet fulfil its mandate before it is too late if only we can reach out with a bridge of justice  love  truth and understanding across the widening gulf of jingoistic mistrust which now plagues our family of nations.236.	Perhaps the Organization has grown too accustomed to viewing the world as it is. We believe that  in the spirit of the men at San Francisco 39 years ago  we should  in the words of George Bernard Shaw  ""Dream things that never were and ask why not?""."
"42",1948,"DNK",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like first to offer Mr. Lusaka my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of the Danish delegation in performing the duties of his high office.330.	Furthermore  it gives me great personal pleasure to extend a most cordial welcome to Brunei Darussalam as the newest Member of the United Nations.331.	The international situation today represents a disheartening picture. We are witnessing a lack of progress in the dialogue between East and West in the crucial area of arms control and disarmament. The global problems of hunger  poverty and the violation of human rights remain serious. Regional conflicts have deteriorated into open military fighting. Perhaps the only reason for keeping some optimism alive is the fact that the growth in international communications gradually makes people aware that we live in one world and ultimately share a common future.332.	The real and urgent challenge of today is to organize the international community in a way that compels us all to face the fundamental issues confronting mankind. The world has become too small for antagonism and confrontation. Differences and conflicts of interest must be resolved through compromise and co-operation.333.	The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is a fundamental factor in the environment of international politics. This past summer's great disappointment was the lack of sincerity in bringing about negotiations aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space. Earlier  the Soviet withdrawal from the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces and the strategic arms reduction talks interrupted the serious efforts aimed at achieving security at a lower level of armaments. But problems are not solved by turning one's back to them.334.	In this negative atmosphere  it is extremely important that efforts to turn developments in a more positive direction have been made in the dialogue between East and West at the collective level. In NATO we have thoroughly examined East- West relations in the light of the experiences of the 1970s and the challenges of the 1980s and with the aim of creating a more constructive dialogue. In our declaration from the meeting in May in Washington we reconfirmed the priorities and aims of the Alliance. Thus  despite severe set-backs in recent years for the policy of detente  the Alliance has not given up hope. In fact  efforts to seek dialogue and cooperation will be intensified as part of a long-term policy to bring about genuine detente and stability. The President of the United States  when he spoke in the Assembly yesterday  very clearly reaffirmed the United States commitment to this policy  and we very much hope that the Soviet Union will respond positively to that statement.335.	Our policy undoubtedly corresponds closely to the hopes and aspirations of all people in West and East alike. It also corresponds closely to the conditions that must be met if the individual countries on both sides of the present dividing line in Europe are to enjoy fully the privilege of expressing their interests and pursuing them in co-operation with others. The principal aim is to strengthen peace and deepen co-operation between East and West. In the short term  a more modest aim is to reach a situation in which both sides have more to gain from co-operation than from confrontation. The Danish Government is ready to contribute actively towards the attainment of this aim.336.	The Danish Government values highly the possibilities for common action which flow from the multilateral process initiated by the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975. The years have also demonstrated the value of the Conference process as a framework for dialogue. This process represents to all the participating States  big and small  an opportunity and an obligation: an opportunity for all to launch their ideas and values into the discussion about the future of Europe; an obligation to seek results through consensus.337.	This year  the process has acquired a new important dimension  the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarm-ament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  with the task of establishing a set of militarily significant  verifiable confidence- and security-building measures covering the whole of Europe. It is our hope that the Conference will be able to work out concrete measures to strengthen confidence between East and West and thus consolidate the commitments under the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act concerning the renunciation of force.338.	We are also looking forward to the CSCE expert meeting on human rights at Ottawa next spring. We trust that the meeting will contribute to the promotion of the human dimension of the Helsinki Final Act.339.	Last year  a record total of 63 resolutions concerning disarmament was adopted by the General Assembly. Unfortunately  this impressive number of resolutions has not had much impact in terms of concrete disarmament measures. The Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva  has dealt intensively with many questions which my Government regards as high-priority issues  such as a comprehensive and effective ban on chemical weapons. The course of these negotiations has so far been discouraging.340.	We urge all parties to show good will and flexibility and to work together in an effort to solve some of the high-priority questions  including an agreement on a comprehensive test ban and the question of preventing an arms race in outer space.341.	Nuclear disarmament remains the issue of the highest priority. At the bilateral level  the United States and the Soviet Union have conducted negotiations on mutual reductions of strategic nuclear arms. It is regrettable that these negotiations have been discontinued. It is the view of the Danish Government that they must be resumed without delay.342.	The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear forces  negotiations which have also been discontinued  are of special concern to us. Instead of a negotiated correction of the imbalance created by the Soviet deployment of additional SS-20 missiles  a situation has been created which has led to further deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The Danish Government sincerely hopes that negotiations will be resumed without pre-conditions or delay.343.	In an effort to halt the continued build-up of nuclear weapons  the Danish Government supports the idea that the nuclear-weapon States should agree to a verifiable freeze on all types of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles as a basis for negotiations on a build-down  taking into account the security interests of all States. In this context  I should like to repeat from my statement at the thirty-eighth session  that the Danish Government supports all realistic efforts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in conformity with the provisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session  devoted to disarmament .344.	We can  and must  achieve measures of nuclear disarmament. But this does not mean that we should simply accept the present situation in the area of conventional arms. Quite apart from the possibility of conventional war itself and the risk of escalation  in certain circumstances  into nuclear war  if the diversion of resources to development is to mean anything at all  then most of these resources must come from expenditure on conventional arms and armed forces  which accounts for four fifths of present military spending.345.	For all those and other reasons  we hope that the study which the Secretary-General has submitted to the General Assembly on all aspects of the conventional arms race and on disarmament relating to conventional weapons and armed forces will be a first step towards effective measures of conventional disarmament  which will complement measures of nuclear disarmament. I wish to express my gratitude to the Group of Experts for their endeavours  which resulted in a study adopted by consensus.346.	The conflicts in the Middle East still give rise to considerable concern. During the past year there has been little substantive progress towards a peaceful settlement of the problems of that war-tom region. The Danish Government calls upon all parties concerned in each conflict to recognize that their maximum aims are unattainable and that negotiations between them are the only way to achieve peace.347.	The fundamental and longest-lasting conflict in the Middle East is the Arab-Israeli dispute. The Palestinian problem is the core of this conflict; and a solution to the Palestinian question remains a prerequisite for an Arab-Israeli settlement  which can be achieved only through direct negotiations between all parties concerned. Although we do not want to prejudice the outcome of such negotiations  the Danish Government has often stated its belief that a lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict must take account of both the right to existence and security of all States in the region  including Israel  and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.348.	However  regrettably  it is becoming ever clearer that the existing situation is detrimental to the building of the confidence necessary for the peace process. It is crucial that the Israeli Government put an end to its policy of establishing settlements in the occupied territories  in order to preserve the principle of exchanging territory for peace  on which Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is based. It is equally important that all parties apply the principle of non-recourse to the threat or use of force.349.	The Danish Government commends the achievements of the Lebanese Government of National Unity towards an improvement of the security situation in Lebanon  and its efforts towards national reconciliation. It is our firm belief that the international community still has an important role to play in the restoration of Lebanon's independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity. Any durable settlement in Lebanon would also require the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory.350.	The continued conflict between Iran and Iraq poses a very serious threat to the stability of the whole Gulf region. Human suffering on both sides has been shocking  and despite numerous international mediation offers no peaceful solution is in sight. I wish to express again my Government's appreciation to the Secretary-General for obtaining the commitment of both parties not to attack civilian targets  and I encourage the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to continue their efforts to bring an end to this tragic conflict. Since the beginning of the war  Denmark has pursued a policy of impartiality and has continuously advocated a peaceful settlement based on negotiations  it goes without saying that we strongly condemn any use of chemical weapons in this or any other conflict. We also call upon both parties to comply with the principles and provisions of international humanitarian law in armed conflicts.351.	A glimmer of hope for the future of southern Africa arose earlier this year. At Lusaka  an under-standing was reached on 16 February between Angola and South Africa on the withdrawal of South African troops from southern Angola. At Nkomati  an Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness was signed on 16 March by Mozambique and South Africa   which seemed to imply that South Africa was finally abandoning the policy of destabilization of the countries neighbouring it. Hopes were raised that these agreements would contribute to peace and stability in the region  and more specifically to early progress towards independence for Namibia.352.	Regrettably  it now seems that the hopes were raised too high. There is imminent danger of a return to the deadlocked position which characterized the negotiating process last year. South Africa has sus-pended the withdrawal of its troops from Angola and continues its illegal occupation of Namibia. Whereas SWAPO has reconfirmed its commitment to the United Nations plan for Namibia's transition to independence  South Africa continues to lay down extraneous conditions for its co-operation in the implementation of the plan. The Danish Government remains convinced that the Namibian people must  without delay  be given the opportunity to decide their own future through free and fair elections  under United Nations supervision and control  in conformity with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).353.	In South Africa itself the fundamental elements of the apartheid system remain. The new South African Constitution has in no way changed the deplorable fact that the great majority of South Africans are still denied basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. The effective boycott of the recent elections by the so-called Coloureds and Asians clearly showed the solidarity of those groups with the black majority and their aspirations for basic human rights for all  without distinction of any kind such as race or colour. The repressive measures undertaken by the South African authorities against those who were active in the boycott are clear evidence that the so-called constitutional reforms are nothing but an attempt to consolidate the apartheid system.354.	Peace and stability will not come to southern Africa as long as the apartheid system is maintained. The Danish Government remains convinced that the international pressure on South Africa must be increased and made more effective. The South African Government must not be given any illusion that the world community will settle for anything less than Namibia's early independence and the eradication of the apartheid system.355.	In defiance of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations  Soviet military forces have remained in Afghanistan  thus violating the territorial integrity of an independent State  maintaining the threat to the stability of the South-West Asian region and imposing a serious strain on the international climate and a heavy burden on neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. The latest Soviet military attempt to bring the popular resistance movement under control has added dramatically to the sufferings of the already hard-tried civilian population. We are seeing a further increase of international concern for the humanitarian aspects of the situation. To my Government's call for withdrawal of the Soviet forces and recognition of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination is added the hope that international relief organizations  including UNHCR and the International Red Cross  will be given working conditions that will enable them to alleviate the plight of the civilian population.356.	My Government is deeply concerned over the situation in Kampuchea  which is comparable to that in Afghanistan. I reiterate the appeal for a comprehensive political settlement that would secure complete withdrawal of all foreign forces; the right of the Kampuchean people to determine its own destiny through free elections  supervised by the United Nations; respect for the independence and neutrality of Kampuchea; and a commitment by all States to refrain from interfering in Kampuchea's internal affairs.357.	Denmark has noted with satisfaction the moves towards democracy that are taking place in various Latin American countries. We hope and believe that this process will lead to full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in all countries of Latin America.358.	The Danish Government is gravely concerned at the present tense situation in Central America. Just and durable solutions to the centuries-old social and economic injustices and oppression cannot be achieved by military means. The only path to just and durable solutions lies in regional political cooperation and respect for the fundamental principles of non-interference and the inviolability of national frontiers. This goal can be attained only through economic and social reforms and a more equitable distribution. It is of overriding importance that all the conflicts in Central America be settled by peaceful means  through negotiation. All parties directly or indirectly involved in those conflicts should therefore show the greatest possible restraint.359.	My Government fully supports the peace efforts of the Contadora Group and regards the elaboration of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America [see A/39/562] as an encouraging development. I hope that the forthcoming meeting at San Jose of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community  Spain and Portugal and their counterparts from the countries of Central America  as well as of the Contadora Group  will contribute to a successful outcome of those peace efforts.360.	International awareness of human rights has emerged  and a body of international human rights law has been adopted. A global human rights conscience exists. It is for States to respect human rights and to ensure that respect under responsibility not only to their citizens but also to the international community and international law. Nevertheless  these standards continue to be violated in almost every part of the world. 361.	There are no easy solutions to human rights problems. One important aspect in our efforts to improve the human rights situation is the imperative necessity of achieving global accession to global instruments and to their implementation machinery in its totality  as well as the political will to abide by the decisions  recommendations and views of international institutions established to safeguard human rights.362.	In spite of the results achieved in the field of standard setting  it is still necessary to improve the protection of human rights in international law. The vicious practice of torture and summary or arbitrary executions are but two examples of flagrant human rights violations where international efforts are required. My Government warmly welcomes the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  submitted by the Commission on Human Rights. It is hoped that the lengthy and exhaustive deliberations belong to the past  so that the compromise text before us may be adopted during the present session of the General Assembly with effective and mandatory implementation provisions. My Government is also prepared to support steps to extend and strengthen the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on summary or arbitrary executions.363.	The Danish Government remains firmly convinced that ideological  religious and cultural differences in the world should not prevent the universal and homogeneous application of human rights standards. We therefore sincerely hope that this session of the General Assembly will see a return to the consensus it established last year on the Programme of Action for the Second Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination 364.	In addition to the immediate sufferings caused by violations of human rights  such violations tend to generate refugee problems. Despite an encouraging trend during the past year  voluntary repatriation under safe conditions is still a possibility for very few refugees. Resettlement in third countries remains the only remedy for far too many. Denmark remains committed to participating in international resettlement programmes in a spirit of international burden- sharing.365.	The Danish Government attaches great importance to the involvement of the United Nations in promoting full equality between men and women. The World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  to be held next year at Nairobi  will provide an opportunity for reviewing achievements so far and for setting out strategies for the future. Likewise  we welcome the concern of the United Nations  through the International Youth Year  1985  for the increased participation of young people in the development of society.366.	The international economic situation in the early part of this decade showed a grim picture. It was not until last year that we experienced a firstâ although fragileâeconomic upswing in many of the industrialized countries. This year has proved that our cautious optimism then was not wishful thinking. Although the economic growth rates vary considerably among nations  the general trend is a positive one; clearly  economic recovery is now under way.367.	The task before us is to consolidate and strengthen this development. To achieve this goal  we must also address the serious problems which continue to present obstacles to economic growth in large parts of the world  in particular in many developing countries. It is a shared responsibility that ways be found to promote economic development in the third world and among the large populations who have experienced a reduction of per capita income and for whom the concept of recovery has until now remained an abstract idea.368.	The United Nations is a unique forum for a thorough debate on the increasingly interrelated components of the world economy. It is the Danish Government's hope that this session of the General Assembly will make a real contribution to the achievement of consensus with regard to the ways and means of reaching the goals set out in the Charter of the United Nations in the economic and social areas.369.	In spite of the enormous needs of developing countries  official development assistance has stagnated during the last few years. Certain donor countries have moved closer to orâlike Denmarkâ have exceeded the 0.7 per cent target  but most are still! far from reaching it. In the present situation  it is more than ever necessary that donor countries live up to their commitment to expand official development assistance. This would also lead to more equitable international burden-sharing. Particular emphasis should be placed on assistance to the poorest and least developed countries. More development assistance resources should be used for production and employment-generating activities  especially in the agricultural sector.370.	Notwithstanding the amount of foreign assistance  it is a prerequisite for development that the recipient countries pursue effective economic policies aimed at mobilizing domestic resources and channelling them to efficient and productive use. This may not always have been the case. We have seen examples of artificially high exchange rates and distorted price structures within the agricultural field  with negative effects on production and development. It is crucial to the political and practical ability of donor countries to maintain and expand their assistance that development efforts are not hampered by such policies.371.	The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is one of the most ambitious and comprehensive action plans formulated by the United Nations system. Regrettably  the accomplishments have so far fallen short of the expectations for the decade. We urge all countries to renew their efforts during the final phase of review and appraisal  in order that this may lead to reinforced national and international commitments to achieve the goals of the International Development Strategy.372.	The initiative taken by the Secretary-General on behalf of the African countries has increased the awareness of the donor community concerning the urgent need to assist those countries in alleviating their acute problems. Almost all African countries are suffering  and the situation in many sub-Saharan countries can only be described as disastrous. Emergency measures are necessary as a supplement to longer-term efforts to secure the sound functioning of the African economies.373.	Danish development co-operation with the African countries has always been particularly intensive. In fact  last year no less than 53 per cent of our bilateral development assistance  as well as a considerable portion of our assistance through multilateral and humanitarian organizations  went to African countries. We stand ready further to strengthen our co-operation with those countries.374.	The consistent support of my country for the development activities of the United Nations family is well known. This year the Danish contribution to UNDP will amount to approximately $40 million  which is considerably more than in 1983. However  similar efforts are necessary on the part of other donors to improve further the financial basis of the Programme and at the same time secure more equitable burden-sharing between donors. It is my hope that such a development will be furthered by the revitalizing process of UNDP  which is now under way.375.	The work of UNICEF is followed with great interest by the Danish public. As a new member of the Executive Board  we hope to contribute constructively to the work of this important body. The child survival revolution launched by UNICEF in 1983 has gained widespread and well-deserved support among potential donor countries  developing countries and international organizations.376.	Finally  a word on an important international conference which took place this year-âthe International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August. That Conference confirmed that the interrelationship between poverty and rapid population growth has gained increased recognition by the international community. My Government is confident that the recommendations of the Conference and the Mexico City Declaration on Population and Development will provide a solid basis for further progress in the implementation of the World Population Plan of Action.377.	In this respect  I find it most important that family planning is now considered a basic human right and that such activities should be pursued with full respect for the free choice of individuals and couples.378.	It is a primary objective of the Danish Government to work for the strengthening of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and to help to create conditions in which the bodies of the Organization may most effectively perform the functions entrusted to them.379.	When  as we hope  Denmark becomes a member of the Security Council beginning on 1 January 1985  we will approach the task humbly and with great respect for the responsibility resting upon us. Our foremost endeavour will be to help to provide the Council with that fundamental authority which can only come from unanimity among all its members.380.	In my previous statements before the General Assembly  Iâlike most of my colleaguesâhave included a section on my Government's commitment to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and the great merits of the Organization  which  in its universality  is the unique forum for co-operation among all sovereign States of the world. I have omitted that section this year. In dealing with the many issues of world affairs  I have involuntarily emphasized the role of the United Nations in relation to each of them. Can there be a more significant and more sincere affirmation of the real relevance of the United Nations?"
"43",1993,"DOM",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic and of the delegation which I have the honour of leading  I wish to convey to Mr. Lusaka our most sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. This well-deserved distinction recognizes his role as a fighter for the cause of peace and the well-being of nations  his brilliant work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and his effective co-operation in the United Nations. His election augurs well for the balanced and fruitful conduct of this session. This wise choice is also an eloquent tribute to the country  Zambia  and to the entire African continent  which is characterized by its devotion to the quest for a fairer international social order.261.	My delegation also pays a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for his efficient leadership of the deliberations of the General Assembly at the thirty-eighth session. His diplomatic skill won him the admiration of all and is a source of pride to the peoples of Latin America.262.	I should also like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his perseverance in translating into reality the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for his invaluable contributions to the cause of progress and international peace and security.263.	Allow me to extend a most cordial welcome to the new State of Brunei Darussalam  which recently won independence. Its efforts to realize the ideals of justice pursued by the United Nations will undoubtedly prove to be an asset to the Organization.264.	The international situation  which grows more alarming each passing day  should be a matter of collective concern to all peace-loving nations and should  of necessity  lead them to strengthen the United Nations. This firm belief inspires me to reiterate the idea I put forward in my statement at the thirty-eighth session that:""At this difficult time in the history of mankind  international co-operation  which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations  must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation."" 265.	In view of the growing interdependence that characterizes contemporary international relations  today's problems affect all the members of the international community but have a greater impact on the least developed among them. We are therefore concerned at the tendency on the part of some industrialized States to abandon the necessary co-operation among States  which should be based on. a profound feeling of solidarity. We must create a real political will to embark upon genuine international co-operation  which should have as its aim the establishment of social justice among our peoples.266.	International life is dominated by the critical choice between war and peace. There is a close interdependence between two basic requirements for the growth and advancement of the developing countries: first  the creation of conditions of peace and security and  secondly  the launching of a new international economic order. The arms race militates at one and the same time against attaining both of these requirements.267.	The stalemate in the disarmament negotiations between the two super-Powers has resulted in quantitative and qualitative arms escalation. The international tension created by that escalation is one of the principal obstacles to the attainment of those goals. Moreover the resources that should be devoted to development are being used instead to produce more sophisticated armaments.268.	In this important matter  I wish to state that we associate ourselves fully with the Joint Declaration on peace and world disarmament made on 22 May 1984 by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania. We agree with those illustrious statesmen that:""The power and ingenuity of the human race must be used  not to perfect weapons of annihilation  but to harness the resources of the earth so that all people may enjoy a life of security and dignity in an international system free of war and based on peace and justice.269.	For the Dominican Republic  negotiation and dialogue are the best instruments in the search for peace. There is no dispute for which a fair solution cannot be found through the means of peaceful settlement provided by international law and the Charter of the United Nations itself. As a corollary to this deep-felt conviction  our Government takes a consistent position of principle that of rejecting  in so far as international coexistence is concerned  any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.270.	Keeping the peace should be an indivisible commitment for all Members of the United Nations. We applaud and encourage the work being done by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization with a view to preventing international conflicts and diminishing the risk that they pose. My delegation values that work very highly and announces here its constant willingness to contribute to the attainment of those basic objectives.271.	At the past two sessions of the General Assembly  I explained in detail that my country was desirous of and interested in co-operating in bringing about a negotiated settlement to the Central American conflict. The Government of the Dominican Republic has constantly echoed those responsible voices that offer assistance in restoring peace in those brother countries  free from outside impositions or interference  and in devoting their energies and resources to the requirements of development.272.	On his very first day in office  in August 1982  the President of my country  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  in the Santo Domingo declaration issued jointly with four other Latin American leaders  recommended dialogue and negotiations as means for resolving the crisis in Central America  along with other measures for bringing about political  social and economic recovery in the region.273.	The Dominican Republic has always expressed support for the steps taken by the Contadora Group  maintaining an unchanging and unequivocal position in this regard. The outstanding process of mediation undertaken by Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela has culminated in the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  which we hope will be signed as soon as possible. It is clear that  while the actions of the Contadora Group have received the encouragement and backing of the United Nations and the international community  this final stage of overriding importance requires the full  active and complementary support of the countries of the Latin American region particular and of the international community as a whole. We wish to record our gratitude and express our encouragement to the Central American countries which have already stated their willingness to sign this important document.274.	Similarly  we share the view that assistance from countries with ties to the Central American region would be highly desirable to ensure the effective implementation of the Contadora Act. We believe that the best way of achieving this important goal would be through a determined effort of solidarity by Latin America that would eliminate or at least reduce to a minimum a certain element of confrontation  directly or indirectly  in our hemisphere that could affect the situation in Central America.275.	It is the duty of Latin America as a whole to promote the detente and understanding that would effectively guarantee the establishment of peace in the region. The parties involved must therefore make reciprocal concessions which  in turn  provide mutual benefits  principally in the important areas of national security and economic and social development.276.	It has been an invariable tenet of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic that any type of colonial domination  whatever form it might take  must be rejected. In line with this attitude  we note with concern that there are still areas of the world under colonial domination. These constitute sources of unrest and tension in the sphere of international relations and endanger international peace and security.277.	One persistent source of unrest is the disregard of the legitimate claim of the Argentine Republic to territorial sovereignty over the Malvinas. We regret the lack of progress at the meeting at Berne last July between representatives of the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom. We cordially urge the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume their negotiations  and we reiterate our support for the renewed mission of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General with a view to assisting the parties to those negotiations.278.	The insecurity and sufferings of peoples are not limited to one geographical area. I should like to refer to other events  topics and circumstances which affect international life and are of concern to the Government of the Dominican Republic.279.	First  I wish to express the Dominican Republic's profound anxiety over the situation prevailing in southern Africa. A mere glance at this part of the world shows us that apartheid  racial discrimination and colonial domination continue blindly to resist the natural and legitimate forces of social change. The heroic struggle of the peoples of southern Africa for self-determination must receive the most decisive support of the international community.280.	I reaffirm the full solidarity of the Dominican people with the people of Namibia and our unreserved support for the struggle being waged by SWAPO  the legitimate representative of the Namibian people  for the liberation of their territory and the establishment of an independent State based on the principles of equality  freedom and justice.281.	Among the disturbed regions of the world  the Middle East has been a constant source of concern to the United Nations since the Organization's inception. My country unswervingly maintains its position that the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the region requires prior acceptance of the view that the question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East situation.282.	We therefore urge  as we have on previous occasions  that the necessary conditions be fostered to enable the Palestinian people to exercise  without any kind of outside interference or coercion  its right to self-determination  including its right to national independence and political sovereignty and to establish a State on Palestinian territory.283.	We reiterate equally strongly our heartfelt conviction that any peace solution in the Middle East must take into consideration Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which recognizes the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.284.	No less worrying is the situation in Lebanonâ a country with traditional ties to the Dominican Republicâwhich is cruelly torn by fratricidal battles. We believe that now more than ever the paths of dialogue and negotiation should be explored there and that the international community is morally obliged to extend its full co-operation to the reconstruction process in Lebanon.285.	However  unanimous recognition of the need for the restoration of the sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the withdrawal from its territory of all unauthorized foreign forces is an essential prerequisite for the settlement of the conflict.286.	The war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq is taking its toll in death and destruction on both sides and is adversely affecting prospects of regional and global peace and security. We believe that the international organizations should be prepared to help and encourage the peace-making process between the parties.287.	We reaffirm our belief that the desired reunification of the Korean people should be achieved through a negotiated settlement between the two parties  without outside interference or pressure.288.	One of the sustaining pillars of Dominican foreign policy is non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. This has been a historical constant  evident throughout the life of our Republic. However  we consider that non-intervention is closely linked to another cardinal principle of international life: the self-determination of peoples. The Dominican Republic has invariably shown firm support for the right of peoples freely to decide the form of government they deem most suited to their national interests.289.	Our deep attachment to these principles impels us to express before this Assembly of the international community our profound concern at the situation prevailing in several parts of the world where foreign interference is damaging the sacred attributes of national sovereignty and independence. In this connection  we affirm our absolute rejection of the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Lebanon  Central America  Africa and anywhere else that this situation exists.290.	The Government of the Dominican Republic views with deep concern the upsurge of acts of terrorism in international life. It has condemned these and will always condemn them wherever they occur. We believe the recourse to terror  in any form and for any motive  is unacceptable to the international community and offends its conscience.291.	On the subject of scourges  I should like to refer to the Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs  signed by the Presidents of Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador and Venezuela  by the representative of the President of Peru  by the President-elect of Panama  by a member of the Governing Junta of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua and by the Vice-President of Panama at Quito on 11 August 1984. We associate ourselves fully with the approach adopted in that Declarationâthat is  to consider traffic in narcotics as a crime against humanity  with all the legal consequences applicable in such cases. We also support the proposal for the establishment of an international or regional fund to furnish aid to developing countries affected by traffic in narcotics  in order to combat and overcome the causes responsible for such situations and to provide the competent national institutions with suitable instruments to deal with such activities.292.	The international community is still being battered by the worst world economic crisis of recent decades. Despite some signs of recovery observed in certain industrialized economies  the international recession persists and the third-world countriesâ particularly those in Latin Americaâare still beset by economic stagnation and subjected to painful processes of adjustment which in the main are ineffective because of the lack of equity and symmetry in the distribution of the costs of international economic restructuring.293.	From the Second United Nations Development Decade  the 1970s  which held promise of a transfer of real resources to the developing areas  we have moved into a period dominated by the group and sectoral interests of some industrialized countries which  not fully realizing that we live in an interdependent world  have caused a reversal of financial assistance flows  leading to restrictions on market access and the pursuit of economic policies that have upset the international economic order.294.	Consequently  the sustained economic growth of a few years ago has come to a halt. Our peoples' purchasing power in strong currencies has dwindled. World trade is at a standstill. A dramatic shortage of international liquidity is threatening the stability of the financial and monetary system.295.	The third-world countries  which set their sights on industrialization during the 1980s in the hope of absorbing growing unemployment  find that important industrial sectors cannot grow satisfactorily because the developed countries' economies  deprived of comparative advantages  are imposing quotas and restrictions on our principal exports.296.	One example is sugar  the underpinning and the mainstay of economies such as that of my country. Sugar is subjected to subsidies and protectionist measures which some developed countries extend to their producers and which are one of the main reasons for the decline in the world price of this commodity. In addition  the United States has just reduced by 20 per cent the sugar quotas assigned to our countries. This measure is contrary to the philosophy underlying the promising initiative for the Caribbean basin sponsored by that country.297.	These protectionist measures show the extent to which the world economy may be destabilized if this type of behaviour continues to spread. If the countries that are most competitive in selling certain goods cannot find outlets for their production or do not obtain suitable prices for their commodities  where will they obtain the international liquidity to purchase goods from abroad or to finance the servicing of their eternal debt?298.	Clearly  the answer cannot be that this liquidity should be achieved at the expense of the standard of living of our peoples  because that solution would be economically unfair and politically and socially destabilizing and would have implications that could even endanger the international financial and monetary system itself.299.	During the 1960s and 1970s  the relationship existing between trade and development was reflected principally in the fact that the surpluses generated by trade were recycled in the form of investments and loans. By contrast  the present trend is to concentrate capital inputs on the basis of incentives to encourage high interest rates and other measures involving substantial restrictions on international trade.300.	High interest rates are aggravating the external debt problem  by increasing financial costs. Thus  Latin America will have to pay out over $7.5 billion more than it would have had to pay out if the United States base rate had not risen by three points since the beginning of this year. In turn  the existence of such high interest rates encourages the outflow of capital to the financial centres  thus further reducing the capacity to pay and the international liquidity of our economies. That is one reason why Latin America  deeply in debt  has paradoxically become a net exporter of capital.301.	The figures supporting this statement are chilling. In net terms  Latin America is transferring to the industrialized countries over 3 per cent of its gross domestic product. In 1983 over $30 billion  representing half of the region's net savings  were transferred as interest and profits alone. Debt servicingâinterest aloneâabsorbs 35 per cent of Latin American exports. In the past four years  the region's output declined by 10 percent  and unemployment is still on the rise.302.	The severe deflation into which the developing countries' economies have been led  in order to create conditions in which debt-servicing payments can be made  has undoubtedly reduced the threat looming over the financial order of the developed countries. But this has been achieved through severe  indeed traumatic  curtailments of imports and of consumption  through a decrease in the already precarious standard of living of our peoples and  in many cases  through disruption of social peace owing to the sacrifices required of peoples with fewer resources available to them.303.	My country  which has suffered at first hand the rigours of this crisis and the consequences of economic adjustments  cannot remain indifferent to this distressing social picture  which is working against the United Nations ideal of creating the necessary conditions of stability and well-being for peaceful and friendly relations among nations.304.	Faced with the serious phenomenon of external indebtedness  which as has been seen  has significant adverse effects on them  the Latin American countries haveâit must be recognizedâalready set in train a dynamic process of solidarity  which is increasingly becoming an example for the third world and which is backed by firm political will.305.	The Quito Declaration and Plan of Action preceded by the Santo Domingo undertaking  and more recently the Cartagena Consensus and the Mar del Plata Communique are eloquent expressions of this solidarity and of this common will  whose main objective is to find a solution to the serious problems identified during the dialogue and to achieve understanding between all the parties concernedâin other words  between creditors and debtors.306.	This was clearly stated by the President of the Dominican Republic  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  in a speech made at the University of South Carolina  before the President of the United States  Mr. Ronald Reagan  and other leaders of the Caribbean Community. He said:""At Cartagena  we acknowledged the need to restructure our economies  to make the adjustments which will enable us to exercise self-discipline  but we also proclaimed the necessary joint responsibility for the solution of the crisis borne by the Governments of the creditor countries  the international banks and the international financial organizations.""307.	The countries which joined in the Cartagena Consensus reaffirmed at Mar del Plata the need for direct political dialogue between creditors and debtors which would recognize the joint responsibility of all in the search for solutions to the crisis and lead to the achievement of a fairer economic order.308.	As the provisional secretariat of the consultation and follow-up machinery established under the Cartagena Consensus  the Dominican Republic will do everything in its power to help bring about the proposed political dialogue which  as stated at Mar del Plata  should preferably be held during the first half of 1985. This political dialogue would also serve as an opportunity to review the role played by important international agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank in the international economic order.309.	As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the solemn proclamation by the General Assembly of the new international economic order  we note with regret that the attitude of some industrialized countries is hindering the start of the global negotiations  the result being that the North-South dialogue on international economic cooperation is being kept in a state of virtual paralysis.310.	There is still no progress in the negotiations  despite the notable flexibility of the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77  as evidenced at their most recent meetings  and despite the fact that the developed countries acknowledged at their economic summit meetings  such as those held at Williamsburg in 1983 and in London last June  the global nature of the international crisis and the interdependence which must necessarily exist between North and South.311.	Nevertheless  as shown by the report of the Committee on the Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  the industrialized countries are having difficulty in taking measures consonant with the agreed principles.312.	The proposals submitted at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  proposals that were the fruit of concerted action involving representatives of approximately 100 nations from three continents  were rejectedâyet another example of the meagre responses of the industrialized countries  whose last two summit conferences  instead of giving rise to expectations and fostering hopes  caused painful frustrations.313.	The recently concluded Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August  again provided a forum for a demonstration of the inflexibility of the most powerful nations in the face of the urgent need to promote a more stable economic order  showing that the voice of the third world at the end of the century is heard almost as a monologue of over 100 voices rather than as part of a dialogue.314.	This obliges us to ponder the need for an effective expansion of South-South co-operation in all spheres  since this would create better prospects for the strengthening of our economies  without any intention of diverting trade into exclusively horizontal patterns  because we fully recognize the high degree of interdependence prevailing m North-South relations. This would not prevent our countries  which have very marked common interests  from strengthening their mutual trade  deliberately and with a very clear political will  in pursuit of the goal of remedying even partially the unequal treatment to which we are subjected.315.	We trust that the critical international economic situation will be a factor accelerating the informal consultations being held at the United Nations on the subject of global negotiations. At the end of this session of the General Assembly  we hope to have significant agreement in the area of global negotiations  the continued postponement of which is a source of discouragement to the developing countries.316.	Before concluding  I should like to say that my country  which is host to the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women  is extremely pleased to note the very efficient and capable work of the Institute in the performance of its vital tasks. We hope that the international community will continue to extend its support to this dynamic Institute. This new autonomous United Nations body is devoting its efforts to training and to the dissemination of information on the link existing between the development process and the situation of each individual in particular.317.	In this context  we must state that the modern world seems to have understood that when international relations are subordinated to the interests of the rich countries  the problems and aspirations of the vast majority of the developing countriesâall seeking diversified and democratic solutions to the world crisisâare ignored.318.	International conflicts assume a much more complex character with unforeseeable consequences when due consideration is not given to the particular identity of our peoples and to the very special needs which they have at the various stages of their evolution and growth.319.	The approach of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will provide a very propitious occasion for a review of our international system and of its efficiency. We attach vital importance to the level of understanding and knowledge possessed by the peoples of the world on the subject of the United Nations  so that mankind can identify with the principles  spirit and ideals of its Charter.320.	Forty  for the United Nations  is an age of maturity and experience  of vigour and of youth. To reflect on the commitments assumed by this universal Organization for the solution of conflicts  for disarmament  for human rights  for justice and for co-operation  is to realize that we all belong to one and the same community  which must seek peace and development through solidarity.321.	In reiterating on this occasion the firm support of the Government of the Dominican Republic for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  we urge the Members of the international community to strengthen the Organization  so that it may really serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends."
"44",2040,"DZA",39,1984,"ï»¿123. Your assumption  Sir  of the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly gives the Algerian delegation much pleasure and many reasons for satisfaction. Your selection is fitting recognition of your well-known and highly regarded competence and experience  as well as evidence of the international community's gratitude to you as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  which has made a much valued commitment to the liberation of that Territory and the recovery of the full rights of its people and has made praiseworthy efforts to bring them about.124.	Your selection  Sir  is also naturally a tribute to your country  Zambia  whose initiatives and actions have consistently demonstrated a profound commitment to the restoration of the rule of law wherever it is undermined and the restoration of justice wherever it is flouted. This commitment  which is part of your country's heritage and tradition  has found a powerful means of expression and implementation in the wisdom and enlightened vision of President Kenneth Kaunda.125.	The fact that you come from Africa  Sir  gives a further dimension to your selectionâthat of the African presence at this session  which brings even more forcefully to the attention of the international community  meeting here  all that remains to be done to bring about the triumph throughout our continent of the aspirations of its peoples freely to decide their own destiny and be assured of the means to improve their lot.126.	Your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  served the United Nations well. In a gravely troubled world environment  he strove to play his part  which was an important one  in our common endeavour to restore the dialogue and rebuild the confidence that are today so sorely lacking in the international community.127.	The Algerian delegation wishes to include in these congratulations and this tribute the Secretary- General. We cannot praise too highly his actions and initiatives in his efforts to bring to bear  in the easing of tensions and the peaceful settlement of conflicts  the contribution of the United Nations  the force of its principles and the justice of its objectives of universal peace and prosperity.128.	The Algerian delegation also takes pleasure in welcoming Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations.129.	At this time of taking stock  looking back and evaluating what has been accomplished  so that we may better appreciate what has still to be done  we find no grounds for encouragement. The concerns expressed  the growing uncertainty and self-centred attitudes are sure to continue in view of the worsening of the international environment.130.	The exacerbation of the East-West confrontation and the recrudescence of imperialist activities threaten world peace and hinder co-operation between nations. The few accomplishments of detente are still being questioned. The Movement of Non- Aligned Countries welcomed the beginning of detente  because it held the promise of universal application.131.	There are strong  pressing tendencies today to reduce the aspirations of our peoples and the interests of our nations to mere aspects of the East-West rift. The search for spheres of influence and States which may be used as staging posts or strategic points remains at the heart of confrontational power relationships. The natural right of peoples to freedom and the sovereign right of States freely to choose their own means of nation-building are still being hindered or actively thwarted. Relations of co-operation and exchange between States are still subject to restrictive approaches conceived and carried out in terms of political allegiance and obedience.132.	In its high degree of sophistication and destructive power  the escalation of the arms race combines the horrific and the absurd. Space itself is being opened up to rivalry and confrontation  the prospects of which boggle our imagination. Accordingly  the crisis in international relations has come closer to the brink than ever. It is accompanied by an unprecedented breakdown in dialogue and communication  which worsens the crisis  increases mistrust  adds to uncertainty and dangerously darkens the world horizon. In addition  it seriously disturbs the rare possibilities that still exist.133.	It is hardly necessary to add that a world economic crisis worsens the crisis that I have described and feeds on it. An analysis of all recent international financial events can lead only to the conclusion that there is a constant decline in international co-operation for development.134.	The clear threats to the international monetary and financial system have not sufficed to call attention to the crucial problem of development financing. The indescribably tragic economic situation in Africa has given rise to initiatives  recommendations and programmes of action  all of which have faced obstruction or  at best  indifference. The commodity market  international trade in general  monetary disarray  and access to technology and to capital markets are factors which are at the heart of today's fundamental imbalances in the world economy.135.	At a time when interdependence is a fact  there is no room for narrow views of the world order. In the face of the obvious interrelationship among these problems and the influence of one sector of human activity upon others  it is futile to reduce the solution to a search for initiatives regarding individual sectors or for fragmented action. It is equally futile to bank on a fragile and precarious recovery in some countries without a guarantee of development for all the others.136.	The international community cannot possibly avoid these facts which relate  essentially  to the structures of the prevailing system of international relations. The changes under wayâhowever diverse their origins and varied their manifestation or means of implementationâall point to the need for structural action. The world economy today cannot merely submit to the natural state of affairs. In a situation of critical inequality of resources and of opportunities for growth and development  the laws of nature consolidate existing pockets of opulence and expand areas of deprivation  wherever they persist.137.	The only conclusion to be drawn is that we seem to be determinedâor at least resignedânot to see coexistence among our peoples and our nations except  on the one hand  through the primacy of force and claims to domination and  on the other  through exploitation aimed at keeping the largest possible number of people beyond the pale of prosperity and well-being.138.	Is there no reasonable alternative to all this  which is part of a fatal fascination with destruction? In mankind's progress towards the fulfilment of its destiny  is it only the inevitability of fear which can dissuade  and guaranteed mutual annihilation which can lead to peace on this earth? Cannot human intelligence and the world's vast resources make possible a destinyâfor all and with the participation of allâother than that of wealth for a few and deprivation for the majority?139.	The improvement of international relations and the task of establishing a new universal order demand co-operation and participation by all. Everyone must make his contribution to the building of peace  justice and progress.140.	Algeria learned from its war of national liberation  and it is identified with the ideal of non- alignment. It has taken on the duty strictly to observe principles leading to the achievement of co-operation  understanding and free exchange among nations. Algeria has also taken on the duty to contribute to the spread throughout the world of the policy of good neighbourliness  the negotiated settlement of disputes and the realization of the legitimate aspirations of peoples  with respect for the identity  the options and the rights of all.141.	That same duty guides Algeria's behaviour in the region to which it belongs: the great Arab Maghreb. For my country  the building of the great Maghreb is part of a joint destiny and  hence  of historical determinism itself. We are convinced that what brings us together legitimizes our ambitions  the magnitude of our objectives and the credibility of our means of attaining them. We have faith in all our available means to overcome transitory hazards and passing problems  for we cannot believe that they can indefinitely thwart the task of unification which is so broadly shared and so greatly desired. There are imperatives to meet and demands to satisfy in the building of this structure. The first among them is to achieve the most favourable conditions  to define clear-cut principles and to establish a sound basis for bringing together the will of peoples and the pooling of their efforts.142.	It is obvious that  in its very essence  the building of the great Arab Maghreb is also in keeping with the requirements of our national development processes through the mobilization of our potentials and of our complementary elements  without which there can be nothing but unavoidable harm and damage  manifested in dislocation in our ranks  in wasted resources and in lost opportunities. There can be nothing but retreat  when the need is to advance and rise to the heights required so desperately by the needs of our peoples. There can be nothing but disunity  when collective effort and a determination to overcome circumstances can and must make the endeavour an authentically united one.143.	In making that endeavour  there are regional realities which must be taken into account  just as there are real opportunities which must be seized. It is essential that hidden realities do not degenerate into additional obstacles  just as it is essential that underestimating the opportunities available does not lead to resignation and a wait-and-see attitude.144.	In all this  no lucid  coherent unified endeavour can be credible to or supported by our peoples unless it faces realities rather than ignoring them for the sake of making things easier or of short-term considerations.145.	The very relevant lessons learned from past experience  the strength of our commitment to the ideal of unity and the respect rightly due to the aspirations of our peoples call  here too  for clear-sightedness in our approach and discipline in defining and reaching the various stages in the process.146.	One fact must be understood: any unified action which disregards or is thought to disregard these imperatives cannot be implemented. When it is a matter of the destiny of peoples and the future of countries  a belief in voluntarismâhowever worthy of respect it may beâcannot take the place of the needed clarity and method  just as spontaneity itselfâhowever creative it may beâcannot prevail over the need for discipline and for building gradually on experience.147.	The treaty of fraternity and concord  which has been supported by Mauritania  Tunisia and Algeria  is steeped in these imperatives. It was created by actively taking these requirements into account  the cardinal objective remaining that of creating a healthier climate and the establishment of a framework more propitious for the unification of the Greater Maghreb.148.	This treaty has a philosophy  namely  that of unity  and all of its provisions stem from the will for action undertaken towards that end. Benefiting from our past experience  it has integrated those lessons in the plan for action adopted and the objectives laid down. The treaty is open to all those animated by a sincere belief in the unity of the Greater Maghreb and by a genuine will to bring about its complete success.149.	The plan for a Greater Maghreb can only be brought about by actions which  avoiding precipitate undertakings that might be harmful  are properly and thoughtfully organized. This plan is that of an endeavour which brings together that which is ready and does not divide any further that which is available to be pooled. The plan for a Greater Maghreb can only have as its grand design those elements which  free from temporary objectives  are aimed at meeting the true expectations of the peoples of the region. 150. In our region a body of understanding  peace and co-operation is being built. There are people ready to unite for the collective good; there are also the will and the determinationâand in my country these are resoluteâto work for active good neighbourliness in the enlightened interests of all the peoples of the region.151.	The building of a Greater Maghreb offers unique conditions for overcoming misunderstanding  tension and conflict in the region  in particular  in Western Sahara. If the building of the Greater Maghreb brings about the conditions for a just settlement of that conflict  it is equally clear that in this work of construction nothing should be allowed to infringe the national rights of the people of Western Sahara or to damage or prejudice them in any way.152.	It could not be otherwise for my country  for Africa and for the international community as a whole  which has determined that the question of Western Sahara is part of the ongoing process of decolonization. Particularly in this case  this is the view of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] expressed in resolution AHG/Res.104 (XIX)  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  and endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 38/40. This view has been the subject of African consensus and of the international community as a whole. Through the OAU and the United Nations  whose actions and initiatives are complementary and mutually supportive in this matter  the means of bringing about a just settlement remain open. The OAU  in particular  provides the natural framework and the necessary means for such a just settlement. If that framework was not used and if those means failed  it is not because the current chairman of the OAU or the implementation committee established by the continental organization had not done everything possible to achieve peace; nor is it the fault of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  because it has abundantly demonstrated its commitment to reconciliation between the brotherly peoples of Morocco and Western Sahara. The current Chairman of the OAU and all of Africa have properly located the responsibility for the present impasse. The readiness shown by some who have attempted  albeit in vain  to thwart and to counter the intransigence of others can therefore be measured. Thus  on the eve of the twentieth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  those who have assumed their duty are well known  just as those who have shirked their duty are known. Algeria ventures to hope that the work of peace has not exhausted its available resources or had its last word.153.	Since there is an awareness of the higher interests of our region which will prevail over the belief in the fait acompli and as long as the conviction prevails that there is no possible alternative to stability  security and progress of the Greater Maghreb without undertaking to guarantee the legitimate rights of all its peoples  this endeavour remains worthy of our continuing efforts and our constant determination to ensure that everything possible is done so that the logic of force will give way to the desire and need for peace  understanding and concord  which should prevail over conflict and disunity.154. At this crucial stage when so much is at stake  the work of the OAU requires the contribution and support of the United Nations. It is vital for the international community here and now to have a clear understanding and appreciation of everything that is at stake in our region.155.	The same contribution and the same support the United Nations must be given with respect to the OAU in its endeavour to achieve peace in Chad.156.	This is the place to take note of the beginning of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Chad  which the OAU made a primary condition for the cessation of the fratricidal confrontation in that country. This was made possible through the constant pressure exerted by Africa and the firmness of its determination to make the destiny of Chad the subject of a free decision by the people of Chad themselves. The opening of the process of the withdrawal of foreign troops from that territory therefore represents a step within the process of the national reconciliation of Chad and  through it  a milestone in the building of an African consensus. The same pressure remains to be exerted  the same efforts remain to be deployed  and the same determination remains to be maintained that the withdrawal  far from reflecting the concerns of foreign Powers alone  must be carried out with strict respect for the national unity of Chad and for its full territorial integrity.157.	Algeria  for its part  attentive as it is to all developments in this region  remains determined and ready to do everything possible to bring about the full implementation of African decisions and  through them  the restoration of understanding and concord among all the people of Chad.158.	In southern Africa  the challenge of apartheid remains. Thus  a crime against humanity  a colonial fact and a policy of expansion and aggression still go unpunished. Certain attempts have been made to tamper with the constitutionâand we know what their fate has beenâin order to confer legality or legitimacy on a system which  because of its very essence  we believe cannot possibly be reducible to rearrangements or reforms; the denial of humanity cannot be allowed to continue; aggression and expansion  which are at the very heart of apartheid make it plain  if there were any further need of this  that the only possible improvement in that system would be its very disappearance. A crime against humanity cannot be absolved; it must be punished.159.	Apartheid is creating in southern Africa  with tacit acquiescence and complicity  a structure of hegemonistic ambitions throughout the region. South African national resistance demonstrates every day to the world the strength of its aspirations and its essential claim that its rights be satisfied. Furthermore  the attitude of unusual lucidity and courage adopted by the oppressed South African communities has dealt a very severe blow to apartheid thus showing that in a situation of total oppression it is futile to bank on division in order the better to establish domination and exploitation.160.	In Namibia  another manifestation of apartheid persists: the colonial occupation of a Territory which the United Nations has undertaken to lead to independence. Links have been established and conditions set which are an obstacle to the proper working out of this process  which enjoys the unanimous support of the international community. We cannot accept any pre-conditions based on external calculations which impede the independence of Namibia. The South West Africa People's Organization is the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people. The unswerving application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the framework and the instrument of the decolonizationâwhich is at present being curbed or distortedâof this African Territory.161.	A challenge of the same nature and scope confronts the international community in the Middle East. In this region  the exercise of the national rights of the Palestinian people has been thwarted; the territories of Arab States have been occupied or annexed and their security is being threatened. The occupation of southern Lebanon is an obstacle to the national unity of Lebanon. The Israeli-American strategic alliance encourages Zionist expansionism and gives it the means to achieve its ends. Only one conclusion can be drawn from all the tragic experience of the vicissitudes in this area  namely  that there will be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East until the national rights of the Palestinian people  the denial of which remains at the heart of the crisis in the region  are recognized.162.	The martyrdom of the Palestinian people and its national resistance impose a duty upon the international community which it must discharge  first and foremost by ensuring the exercise of the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State on its ancestral territory under the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  its sole  authentic and legitimate representative. Within this context  action in support of the convening of an international conference on the Middle East in which the PLO would be assured full and effective participation is a major priority of the United Nations.163.	Another priority of particular importance for my country is action to ensure the cohesion  unity and strengthening of the capacity to act of the PLO. This is the way to establish a platform of political initiative and action which would enjoy the authentic support of all Palestinians  reinforce Arab potential and  beyond that  provide the international community with a framework for solidarity and support of the Palestinian cause.164.	Other conflicts and hotbeds of crisis in the world persist and are becoming exacerbated or intensifying. They give rise to legitimate concern on our part.165.	The persistence and tragic course of the war between Iraq and Iran concern us deeply. It is because we believe in the possibility of and the existence of the means for a just solution that Algeria has worked ceaselessly to bring about the necessary conditions for a political solution which cannot but serve the ultimate interests of our brothers in Iraq and Iran and thereby those of the unity of our ranks dictated by our common destiny.166.	The question of Cyprus also persists and reminds us of the need to do everything possible to bring about understanding and harmony between the two Cypriot communities. To this end  it is essential that there is full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non- aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. We venture to hope that this essential requirement will prevail over the still controllable effects of recent regrettable developments. In this regard  we are particularly encouraged by the tireless efforts of the Secretary- General.167.	The growth of tension in Central America is also a subject of concern. The fundamental issue in this region remains the right of peoples freely to determine their own political and economic system and their path of development without interference  constraint or impediment. We cannot go on indefinitely denying this fact  which we have to thank the Contadora Group for highlighting by proposing a new approach to the settlement of the problems in Central America. It is the duty of the international community to give its support and assistance by constant action to bring about the restoration of peace and stability in the region.168.	The escalation of the arms race is a very damaging factor in contemporary international relations; particularly because its effects are combined with the breaking off of disarmament negotiations. It is imperative for all that these negotiations be resumed in a spirit of sincerity and responsibility  free of any attempt to claim or achieve supremacy.169.	If we realize that security through fear is not true security and that  if it is desired  there is the alternative of the peaceful coexistence of all peoples  it will be possible to establish a climate of peace and confidence among nations.170.	To attain this objective  concerted action must be taken within the framework of a process for tackling the essential problems involved in setting up a system of true collective security. As long as disarmament efforts continue to be separated from the crucial question of collective security  and as long as this continues to be seen exclusively in terms of the balance of power  our efforts will be futile or  at best  totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the day.171.	The interrelationship of the factors of security and disarmament dictate integrated action inasmuch as disarmament is not an end in itself  and its goals must serve to bring about universal peace and security based on justice and right. This is the fundamental stake and this is the major challenge we face.172.	The meeting on strengthening of security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region  held at Valetta on 10 and 11 September last by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Mediterranean countries which are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  is the expression of a determination to help meet this challenge and to perform this task  because the Mediterranean is  by its nature  a zone of peace and co-operation and cannot be dissociated from the security of Europe or separated from general international security.173.	In an international environment which is universally in a state of unrest and instability  the world economic crisis is deteriorating into a critical phase. International commercial  financial and monetary structures are constantly in a precarious state. Liquidity has no relationship with the actual needs for development financing. The increase in the rates of interest  apart from creating extra obstacles to access to international capital markets  is enclosing more and more countries within the endless spiral of indebtedness  which is not aimed at the financing of development activities but rather at the mere servicing of the debt itself. Primary commodity prices have remained bogged down  thus cutting off countries which are often among the poorest from precious resources.174.	A factor which aggravates this situation is that international co-operation for development is regressing in spirit  in effectiveness and in its extension. All the evaluations of the various international conferences  in particular the most recent ones  agree in drawing this conclusion. Even more serious  the organs or institutions of multilateral co-operation are intervening in sectors that are very sensitive for the developing world  which is facing what really must be called a diminution of its resources; this is the case with the IDA  IFAD and UNDP. This is an urgent situation which the international community must reverse. There are also fields of critical interest for the developing world where international action is urgently necessary. In this context  Africa must be the centre of concern of the international community. On that continent  the economic situation of a large number of countries has been reduced to a simple matter of daily tragedy. This situation requires an urgent collective effort and the highest possible priority. In this regard  the initiatives of the Secretary-General should enjoy the commitment of all and their whole-hearted support.175.	The state of monetary and financial disorder represents a veritable axis of imbalance and instability in today's system of international economic relations. This has to do with structures that have to be remodelled and with an overall framework that has to be thought out again. To this end  the convening of an international conference on general financial and monetary problems is of the highest priority.176.	The fact of the actual interdependence of nations is something we must ail understand; it has come to stay  just as has the fact of the interpenetration of problems facing us and their close and intimate interrelationship. Hence  if the plan for global negotiations is still meeting considerable obstacles as regards its implementation  nothing alters its validity and its capacity to bring about solutions.177.	In a precarious and uncertain environment  it is a matter of legitimate satisfaction to note that South-South co-operation is being embarked upon with resolution and with a sense of responsibility as regards the honouring of promises. The meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Finance of 11 Latin American countries at Cartagena in June of this year was further evidence of this. This process  which has had such a good beginning  is worthy of our encouragement and of the strengthening of our commitment to it and of the consolidation of the conditions and means necessary for its accomplishment.178.	This appraisal sheds harsh light on what is at stake and on the magnitude of the challenges facing the United Nations. In the face of such a profound and total crisis  it is of the utmost harm for dialogue and communication to have been broken off so completely. It is of the utmost harm also for the framework of the United Nations  which is of course so necessary for such dialogue and communication  to have fallen so much out of favour.179.	If the fact of a divided humanity has made the United Nations powerless  united humanity can make its mission one of force and credibility.180.	If we are convinced that the United Nations is an act of hope  then it is we who harbour the genius and potential for rehabilitating the United Nations in its work of civilization."

I also greet the President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who so brilliantly conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly; and the Secretary-General  a distinguished Latin American diplomat.50.	Ecuador is also happy to welcome the newest Member of the Organization  Brunei Darussalam  a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations with which my country maintains cordial relations through the Andean Group.51.	We are all very much aware of the gravity of the present time. The poorest peoples  grouped or identified within that miscellany which is called the third world  call  with varying degrees of urgency  for immediate efforts by the other world blocs to avert dangers that could lead to a veritable catastrophe if they are not overcome. The indifference of some  the worsening living conditions of most and the trend towards aggression rather than solution of others are to blame for this. Global negotiations gain importance daily at the international level  and they should be such as to strengthen the movement towards cooperation rather than confrontation.52.	Ecuador agrees with the demands for a prompt and equitable solution to the most important problems of our time made by the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries at various times. That Movement will gain greater authority to the extent that its proposals are characterized by austerity  objectivity and the absence of extremism or partiality to any of the other world blocs.53.	Foreign debts  particularly  but not exclusively  those of Latin American countries  have required slow and exhaustive renegotiation. Certain demands that ignore economic realities and threaten the survival of peoples have faced many countries with tragic dilemmas.54.	The problem of indebtedness is the common responsibility of debtors and creditors  of those that control the main economic currents in the world and the peoples subjected to them. The solution must involve them all. Once again  co-operation is essential  but from time to time the threat of aggressive confrontation looms ahead.55.	Ecuador maintains an open attitude regarding dialogue and negotiations with the industrialized countries and financial organizations  but it stresses the inescapable need for renegotiation to leave free an essential margin not only for the survival but for the progress of debtor countries.56.	The extension of deadlines for debt renegotiation  the opening of new lines of credit and other similar measures will not provide a real solution to the problem of Latin American indebtedness. The only effective and definitive solution will have to come through the restructuring of economic policies. These should no longer be inspired by ill-conceived protectionism  which is largely to blame for the fact that Latin America has a growing current account deficit in its balance of payments and that it has become a net exporter of capital.57.	Latin America calls upon the developed worldâthe first and second worldsâto open the door to trade in the products that Latin America can export and in so doing to abandon the series of restrictive measures or the groupings inspired by political principles rather than by the norms of sound economyâpolitical principles which have consistently been prejudicial to Latin America's opportunities for export and foreign trade earnings.58.	Like all Latin American countries  Ecuador is aware of the need for a policy of austerity. It is true that the effects of indebtedness induced Latin American Governments to overspend  but it is no less true that international creditors stimulated such policies in their desire to invest capital not only in productive sectors  as had always been the tradition with banks and private international financial mechanisms  but also in Governments  and that which could eventually have helped and relieved Latin American countries undoubtedly prompted the overspending. But austerity must not mean the death sentence for Latin American communities  which cannot be compelled to lower the standards of their economic life  of their productivity  of their sources of employment to levels at which the problem no longer affects Latin American communities only but becomes an explosive world problem  with masses of people impoverished not because there is any lack of resources from which they may benefit but because of an economic system that stresses payment mechanisms for an old debt and forgets or minimizes what is necessary for the people's subsistence.59.	Ecuador supports any initiative that can strengthen understanding and unity in the world  in regions and in sub regions. This applies within the Andean Group  where Ecuador advocates practical and positive rather than theoretical economic and cultural integration  just as it does within the group of South Pacific countries  within which it reaffirms the legitimacy of their defence of their sovereign right over their seas and the natural resources therein  as well as over the sea-bed as an integral part of the heritage of and a promise of well-being for our peoples. It applies  too  within the group of Amazonian countries  in order to safeguard its national destiny and sovereignty in a region where we reaffirm Ecuador's rights as an Amazonian country from the epic discovery of the Amazon River by the Quito expedition of 1541 to the time when Ecuador  faithful to its tradition of peace and legality  sought to strengthen friendly relations with Peru and sought a sincere climate of mutual understanding in order to promote a just and honourable solution to its territorial controversy.60.	At a time when it is imperative for the peoples to hear constructive voices m favour of concerted action and the common good  Ecuador will not rest in its efforts to draw closer to all countries of the world  in particular those to which it is bound by history and geography  by nature and blood  by culture and common objectives.61.	Ecuador's sense of universality demands defence of the principles of non-intervention  the self- determination of peoples  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for ideological pluralism and human rights  and the rejection of all forms of intervention  aggression  colonialism and the acquisition of territory by force. Just as we respect the sovereignty of others  so we demand respect for ours. 62.	Ecuador observes with satisfaction the progress achieved towards a peaceful solution of the question of the Beagle Channel. This was inevitable since it involves two sister countries united by the moral and spiritual voice that carries most authority on our planet.63.	Ecuador has supported and will continue to support initiatives aiming at peace and understanding among peoples. This is why the Ecuadorian delegation supports the efforts to settle the differences concerning the question of the Malvinas Islands.64.	In the United Nations  Ecuador has supported and will continue to support the need for the withdrawal of foreign forces from all territories which do not belong to them  whether in Afghanistan  Lebanon and the Middle East as a whole  Cyprus  Kampuchea  Namibia or Chad. Similarly  Ecuador rejects any form of violence  destabilization of States  intervention or deployment of forces of any foreign origin in Central America. That is why Ecuador has given its full support to the actions taken by the Contadora Group of Latin American Governments and trusts that they will achieve practical results. It hopes  therefore  that it may soon be possible to hold completely free elections in those Central American countries still governed by non- democratic Governments  and it reaffirms the concept of a democracy not as a formal system that merely appears to be one but as a real  vital system  in which the principles of the Charter of the United Nations find concrete and unrestricted application; in which the freedom of individuals and groups is a categorical imperative for the organs of public power; and where power and force bow to the need to respect the dignity and freedom of individuals.65.	Since its accession to independence  Ecuador has been a constant defender of the freedom of man. It was one of the first countries to abolish slavery entirely  within a process which sprang from the genius of the ideas of Bolivar  the Liberator  when we were a part of ""Gran Colombia"". In 1851 Ecuador eliminated the last remnants of the slave system. The eradication of racial discrimination has also been the subject of considerable legislation throughout Ecuador's history and it is fully enshrined in the political Constitution of the State.66.	Within the United Nations the Latin American countries have contributed to the universalization of the passion for freedom. As a result  Ecuador has supported everything contributing to decolonization and  consequently  the admission of new Members to the Organization. Similarly  we have been opposed to exclusions of any kind. It is the right of all States to belong to the world Organization  and it is in the interest of the United Nations to attain universality in the most complete manner possible. Consequently  Ecuador would be pleased to see the admission of both Koreas  either jointly  which would give cause for satisfaction  or individually or  better still  as one unified Korea  if the ongoing negotiations yield successful results.67.	As in the case of the maritime extensions  so in the new geographical  historical and juridical dimensions of outer space  above all in the matter of the geostationary orbit of satellites  Ecuador renews its appeal for such areas to remain solely within the realm of peaceful use  free from any warlike purpose  and it reaffirms its rights as an equatorial country as well as the need to apply the benefit of the orbit  a limited natural resource  in favour of developing countries in general and equatorial countries in particular.68.	The same sense of universality  the awareness that it is the human condition that sets juridical values and not the reverse  inspires the attitude of Ecuador with respect to the promotion and defence of human rights. All States are committed to the promotion and defence of those rights. No selective or discriminatory criterion  be it inspired by political order or by ideology  justifies any dichotomy in this system. Human beings are the direct and inevitable object of the unrestricted recognition of certain elementary rights  and the ignoring of them cannot be justified on the basis of the imperatives of power or the organization of States  whatever may be the philosophy that inspires them. In Ecuador  human rights are fully respected. The rule of law has prevailed. The State is the first to abide by the Constitution and the law. The Government strictly observes and respects the rights of individuals and groups. The present Government  the result of an overwhelming electoral process  which has received the broad backing of the majority of the citizens  is inspired by the principles of Christianity as a doctrine which defends the equality and the dignity of the individual  and it is oriented towards the exclusive aim of working untiringly in favour of the people  in keeping with freedom and justice.69.	For the reasons I have mentioned  the National Government will devote maximum efforts to the preservation of true democracy and peaceful coexistence and the rejection of all threats of terrorism  which we consider as a crime against humanity  just as we consider the traffic in narcotic drugs. These concepts were set forth and incorporated in the Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs of 11 August 1984.70.	Collective responsibilities for disarmament and development are also universal. The primary objective of the United Nations continues to be development  and to attain this it is imperative to achieve peace  which has so often been disturbed and threatened in past years. Disarmament is not merely a mechanical activity for dismantling war machinery; it must be a moral attitude  whereby respect for individuals and collectivities prevails over the imperatives of power. The kind of disarmament that must be attained is moral disarmament  that which eliminates the aggressive instinct from the actions and the conscience of man and which curbs the arrogance and desire for dominance of whoever feels strongest.71.	Atomic explosions for warlike purposes are to be condemned wherever they take place  and those in the South Pacific are of particular concern to my country. Given the danger which those tests represent for the ecological balance of the region  such explosions have been condemned by the South Pacific Permanent Commission  an organization comprising Colombia  Chile  Ecuador and Peru.72.	Development must become  as it has not yet become  a shared task  in which the rich and the poor have something to gain and something to bring and in which a political attitude of willing co-operation and not a bureaucratic fiction of pseudo-co-operation prevails as an ordinary circumstance in the international community. 73.	The most powerful countries are inevitably committed to expressing an unequivocal political will for co-operation  so that the world economy may recover and international economic relations may become less unfair.74.	The co-operation of the world Powers with the developing world must be extended in a pragmatic way. Not only risk-capital flows  direct investment  the transfer of technology  and opening credits and markets  but also the processes of multilateral cooperation must be expanded and intensified. An end must be put to that absurd restrictive criterion of discouraging investments by the richest countries in the areas of the developing world  whether such discouragement springs from financial  protectionist or political motives. There must be an awareness of the fact that the contribution in technology  people and capital from the more developed countries is an essential requirement for the rapid and harmonious progress of the so-called developing world.75.	Ecuador was one of the founding countries of the United Nations. We are on the eve of celebrating 40 years of existence of the Organization. My country reiterates that the United Nations system is of paramount importance for peace  stability and progress in the world. It is necessary to enhance the Organization  refine it and  if necessary  transform it  so that it may be not only the forum for national declarations but much more: the grand stage on which the peoples may reach an ever greater measure of understanding  friendship and common action. Moreover  this fortieth anniversary must be an occasion for revising procedures  reducing organizational costs and proliferation throughout the system  and accentuating the technical service role of the specialized agencies  in order to concentrate within the United Nations itself responsibility of a political nature. Any confusion in the matter of objectives  any interference by technical organs in political matters  will only imply a loss of authority and efficiency for the entire system.76.	It is therefore imperative  in the year that lies before us  so to consolidate concrete actions that the General Assembly may attain viable results  stressing common denominators and agreement  rather than tension  extremism or sectoral interests. The Economic and Social Council must be the ideal forum for development issues  where progress is made in the search for higher standards of living for the poor majorities in the world  which is the primary and concrete objective of today's international system in the economic  social and cultural spheres; and the Security Council must fulfil the purpose for which it was established  particularly through an operative system that enables it to reach peaceful solutions for international disputes.77.	All these criteria and the endeavours I have mentioned  among the many others  altruistic and positive  of the Organization constitute one of the substantial elements in the restoration of balance to the interdependent and planetary world we inhabit. It can make the difference between human co-operation and devastating strife  between the hope that the approaching century may truly be better and the tragic pessimism that misunderstanding and blindness may prevail in international relations. It can be the great dividing line between a holocaust and redemption."
"46",2132,"EGY",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me at the outset to congratulate you on your election to this high office and to greet you as a distinguished son of our dear continent  Africa  as well as the representative of our sister country  Zambia  and a dear friend with whom I have been privileged to collaborate in promoting the causes of freedom  development and peace.93.	I take this opportunity also to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  and to pay a tribute to him for the skilful way he conducted the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session  which was characterized by high-level participation by a number of Heads of State and Government  particularly from non-aligned countries.94.	I wish also to welcome Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations and to stress our willingness to co-operate with this sister country in pursuit of our common aims and objectives. 95.	It gives me immense pleasure to come back to this rostrum and to my dear colleagues. I look forward to continuing with them  in my new position  our endeavours towards the realization of the noble principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.96.	I am all the more pleased to speak again today in the name of Egypt in the wake of an exemplary experience that Egypt has had on the road to the exercise of democracy. I should like to pause here and reflect on this outstanding  bright landmark in our contemporary history.97.	The democratic process in Egypt is in consonance with the ongoing and persistent efforts we are making to cope with and respond to the challenges of the age. It also reflects our conviction that only a free individual is capable of promoting peace and forging progress and development.98.	This significant development in Egypt  which is an integral part of the Arab nation  is an achievement for Arab human rights and particularly for the right to participate in shaping the present and the future in complete freedom and security.99.	In this regard  I should like to express our gratitude to King Hussein of Jordan and to the fraternal people and Government of Jordan for the positive and wise step they have taken to re-establish diplomatic relations with Egypt. That action testifies to the firm will of the people and Government of Jordan to bring about a meeting of brothers so as to open up prospects for the future of Arab solidarity and to add momentum to the common action in order to achieve the objectives and aspirations of the peoples of the Arab nation.100.	We are meeting this year on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  which was born in the aftermath of the most dreadful scourge mankind had yet experienced  the Second World War. The peoples of the world  in their resolve to make that war the last war  were determined to establish a system that would govern relations between States and peoples based on freedom and co-operation rather than oppression  domination and belligerency.101.	Tremendous transformations and changes have marked the last four decades. New energies once undreamed of have been released  adding to mankind's potential. Man has explored hitherto inconceivable horizons. The great Powers have managed to avoid drifting into armed confrontation.102.	At the same time  this period has witnessed a stockpiling of arms that is without precedent in the history of mankind Despite great developments in the means of production  the third world finds itself encircled by ever-increasing impediments and obstacles and  therefore  unable to keep pace with other countries. The picture becomes more gloomy when we reflect upon conditions in the part of the world in which we live  namely  the Middle East and Africa  where issues of liberation  self-determination  peace and security remain unresolved and constitute a threat to international peace.103.	For more than two decades the peoples and countries of the third world have responded to those challenges facing them by their commitment to the principles and objectives of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  which has provided them with a positive and historic alternative. That Movement has taken a leading role in the rejection of blocs and polarization and has played and is still playing a historic part in reshaping the pattern of contemporary international relations with a view to establishing a new international order based on respect for the sovereignty  independence and cultural identity of States  on adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others  on the moral values of peoples and on making an effective contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.104.	Egypt  m keeping with its responsibilities as a non-aligned country  calls upon the international community to reflect seriously on the issues that are of grave concern to all of us.105.	The Middle East has gone through a series of tragic conflicts. Egypt  inspired by the world-wide consensus on the need for the peaceful settlement of those conflicts and to spare the peoples of the region and the world the dire consequences and grave complications they entail  was prompted to launch its historic peace initiative in the hope that a just and honourable peace encompassing the whole region might be achieved  a peace that would usher in a new era of coexistence in accordance with the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations  the framework for civilized relations between States and peoples.106.	It is regrettable  however  to note that the persistent Israeli policy of tightening its grip on the occupied Arab territories and denying the Palestinian people their right to self-determination and to choose their own representatives and spokesmen has shaken hopes for peace. Feelings of frustration and bitterness continue to exist because of the continuation of Israeli policies designed to perpetuate domination over the occupied Arab territories and their populations. We have witnessed measures designed to annex Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  as well as the bombardment of an Iraqi nuclear reactor used for peaceful purposes and the invasion and continued occupation of southern Lebanon.107.	Today we are witnessing the emergence of a wave of detestable fanaticism that should not be underestimated. Although it has not galvanized a broad constituency  it has the potential for becoming menacing and setting off a chain of actions and reactions. We therefore commend those Arab and Israeli men and women who have bravely voiced their revulsion to fanaticism and who have stated their belief that peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Israelis and mutual tolerance are the only civilized alternative norms of behaviour worthy of the history of this region  one that has inspired the loftiest moral values.108.	We deem it our duty to continue to proclaim the need for a just political settlement of the Palestinian problem and of the Middle East crisis. Only thus can the Middle East live in peace and the world be spared those complications.109.	It is our view that in order to reach such a settlement a number of indispensable facts  arising out of the experience gained by the parties to the conflict  should be highlighted.110.	First  peace and territorial expansion are irreconcilable. Israel must therefore relinquish the occupied Arab territories so that genuine peace can be attained. This applies equally to the West Bank  including Jerusalem  to the Gaza Strip and to the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. 111.	Secondly  the question of Palestine must be resolved through negotiations  with the participation of the Palestinian people  the party directly concerned  and Israel.112.	Thirdly  these negotiations should be based on the principle of mutual recognition and reciprocal acknowledgement of the right to exist.113.	Fourthly  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is a sacred and inalienable right. The history of the question of Palestine teaches us that denial of this right or failure to recognize it has been the main cause of all the blunders  with the ensuing complications and wars. When we mention the right to self-determination  this necessarily entails the right of this people to establish an independent State on its national soil  as well as its right to join with any other entity through the free expression of its own will.114.	Fifthly  in the light of these premises  the Palestinian people  as the party directly concerned  is entitled to choose its representatives and its spokesmen. The Palestinian people has already chosen the PLO as its representative and spokesman.115.	We note that there is a new coalition cabinet in Israel  and we hope that its options and orientation will be directed towards a genuine and just peace which responds to the national rights of the Palestinian people. This is the only way to ensure real security for Israel.116.	In this context  we are not lacking in peace initiatives or proposals. There are now several peace proposals  including the draft resolution submitted to the Security Council by Egypt and France on 28 July 1982. we also have the Arab peace plan  contained in the Final Declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  adopted at Fez on 9 September 1982  President Reagan's initiative of 1 September 1982 and other proposals. Now  we have the United Nations initiative as represented in the call by the General Assembly for the convening of an International Peace Conference on the Middle East  to which we have responded favourably and which we have supported. We wonder why such a call should be rejected or ignored. All of us should reflect deeply on the implications of the positive response by the PLO in accepting this initiative. This is a great step towards peace.117.	The events in Lebanon have once again attested to the futility of invasion and of the imposition of peace through force. The need to ensure its security has been advanced by Israel as an excuse for invading Lebanon. We were among the first to warn against the futility of such an approach  which could only result in more victims and foment more hostility and bitterness. The events in Lebanon have confirmed the validity of our views. We therefore consider the decision taken by the new Israeli Cabinet to withdraw from Lebanon a sound one. We hope that this decision will be implemented without delay  putting an end to the series of acts of aggression against Lebanon  a country for which we cherish every hope of stability  reconciliation and prosperity in an atmosphere of freedom  unimpeded by foreign interference.118.	I should like to deal with one of the aspects of the situation prevailing in the occupied Arab territories  namely the humanitarian aspect  particularly the constant violations of the provisions of international humanitarian law  especially the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  and the challenges such violations pose for us as States parties to this Convention  and parties also to an international system in which the issue of respect for human rights represents an integral part of its legal structure.119.	Violations of the provisions of international humanitarian law inside the occupied Arab territories have assumed appalling dimensions as manifested in the perpetuation and consolidation of settlement policies in those territories and in the terrorist  oppressive and punitive measures perpetrated against the Arab population in those territories. These practices constitute serious violations of the provisions of that Convention  to which almost all States have acceded  including Israel.120.	While we are fully appreciative of the efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure security for the Arab population in the occupied territories  we are equally aware of the constraints and limitations imposed by the nature of the activities of that Committee  which could curtail those efforts and render them inadequate to address an increasingly deteriorating situation in the occupied Arab territories.121.	At the same time  the Geneva Convention is part of a contractual legal system which is not confined to the parties to the conflict. Rather  it is a global legal system encompassing all States parties to the Convention  conferring on them an interest and a responsibility to ensure full respect for the provisions of the Convention.122.	In view of this concept  and given the failure of all attempts to terminate such violations  it is our view that it is highly propitious to consider convening a diplomatic conference comprising all States parties to the Convention to review the deteriorating situation in the occupied Arab territories. Such a conference should envisage measures conducive to ensuring respect for the provisions of the Convention. We call upon all States parties to the Convention  as well as the Secretary-General  the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the President of the Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues  to study this proposal and start consultations on how best to implement it.123.	I move now to the grave and explosive situation in the Gulf region resulting from the continued armed conflict between Iran and Iraq  with both of which Egypt maintains the closest spiritual and historical ties. This conflict  which is exacting a high toll of human lives and material resources which should have been devoted to life rather than devastation and death  is a source of profound sorrow and regret to us.124.	The position of Egypt vis-a-vis this conflict has been unequivocally spelled out from the very beginning and remains unchanged. We are exerting maximum efforts within the framework of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to reach a peaceful settlement to this conflict. Such a settlement would put an end to this senseless war and reinstate the rights of each party  in keeping with the basic principles of international law  the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. In this regard  Egypt will spare no effort to pursue those endeavours until the appeal of the international community has been fully responded to and hostilities have been halted and negotiations started to reach a peaceful settlement.125.	In this respect  we wish to express our deep appreciation of the continuing efforts made by the Secretary-General with a view to putting an end to this war. We support those efforts and wish him success.126.	This position taken by Egypt emanates from its option for peace not only as a principle of its foreign policy but also as an overall pattern to be established in the entire region to which we belong and in the world at large.127.	In this context  recent developments in the Red Sea region have underscored the importance of Egypt's previous call that the Red Sea countries should make concerted efforts to ensure the safety of navigation in the Red Sea. We welcome and wholeheartedly support the Sudan's initiative to this effect. Such an initiative  launched as it was by the sister country of the Sudan  with which we are linked by inherent ties of integration  promotes the prospects of peace for the region and for all our peoples.128.	I should like now to touch upon certain pressing conditions in our African continent whose peoples have suffered injustice  colonialism and exploitation as have no other peoples of any continent. Our continent has braved all odds to gain its total independence  a fact which should have prompted special international attention to support Africa's endeavours to achieve total liberation and development.129.	Unfortunately  we still see our brothers in the south of the continent living the tragedy of the age  which brands with disgrace not only the racist clique in Pretoria but also all those who aid that regime and refrain from opposing its practices both in word and in deed.130.	That regime has recently undertaken certain measures in a desperate attempt to introduce some changes to the repugnant face of	through the so-called constitutional reforms  which in fact only mean more camouflage and codification of that racist policy. Therefore  it was only natural that the African majorityâwith its astute political perceptionâshould have boycotted the elections conducted last August in implementation of the so-called constitutional reforms. The Security Council acted in perfect wisdom when it condemned those elections. Egypt reiterates its support for the struggle of the people of South Africa to eliminate racist policies and establish a non-racial democratic system in that cherished part of the African continent.131.	At the same time  the racist regime in South Africa persists in its occupation of Namibia  although six years have elapsed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978)  which endorsed the framework for a just settlement within which Namibia could gain its independence. There is no doubt whatsoever that the only obstacle to the implementation of that resolution lies in Pretoria's insistence on linking implementation with other factors totally alien to its substance and content.132.	Recent developments in southern Africa  particularly concerning the Namibian question  have made clear the positive attitude and sense of responsibility of SWAPO  as well as its sincere wish to achieve the independence of Namibia peacefully through negotiations. That conciliatory attitude was met with arrogance and intransigence on the part of the South African regime  which sought only to delay Namibia's independence as long as possible. Such procrastination leaves SWAPO with no alternative but to continue its legitimate and just struggle  which Egypt will support until Namibia achieves its independence.133.	In reviewing the pressing problems confronting our African continent  I should like to emphasize the exceptionally grave situation the continent facesâa situation which cannot be described as simply an ""economic crisis"". Indeed  it has turned into a serious crisis  both economic and humanitarian. To realize the proportions of this crisis  suffice it to know that an estimated 5 million children will have died in 1984 as the result of the food shortage  that more than 150 million people will face famine this year  that per capita food production has decreased by 11 per cent compared to 1970 figures and that per capita national income in most African countries has been steadily declining throughout the past few years.134.	In the face of this grave situation  the international community must earnestly embark on a serious planâwhether in the short or long termâto contain it.135.	The developed countries cannot shirk their responsibilities  because  in the final analysis  we find that the crisis in Africa is largely due to current international economic conditions. Moreover  we live in an international community which should be characterized by interdependence. We also believe that an economically viable and strong Africa can contribute greatly to the achievement of economic and political stability in the world.136.	Against this background  Egypt raised the issue of the economic crisis in Africa in meetings of the Organization of African Unity and called for consideration of this issue in the Economic and Social Council during its second regular session  held at Geneva. However  we cannot conceal our disappointment at the failure of the Council to approve a declaration on this issue. Therefore we raise the question once again and hope that a more comprehensive international awareness of the crisis and its serious dimensions can be mustered in such a way as to enable usâduring the current session of the General Assemblyâto adopt concrete  clear-cut measures to tackle this crisis. I should like on this occasion to place on record our sincere thanks to the Secretary-General  who has launched an initiative in this respect and spared no effort to follow it up.137.	If our world today is still afflicted by a number of grave and diverse problems  the group of non- aligned countries and the group of Islamic countries have laid down a practical framework for coping with most of those problems. We may well look forward  with sincere hope  to the success of the tireless efforts exerted by the Secretary-General with a view to reaching a settlement of the situation in Afghanistan in such a way as to ensure the rights of that brotherly people to peace  freedom and stability. We equally commend his efforts towards resolving the Cyprus problem through fulfilment of the aspirations of the Cypriot peopleâincluding both the Turkish and Greek communitiesâto solve their problems and find an appropriate formula for coexistence and cooperation m accordance with their will and traditions. 138.	We continue to underscore the importance of sincere efforts to implement United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea and to pave the way for appropriate international conditions to enable the Korean people to achieve their aspirations and realize their hopes in unity. We are confident that efforts to find just and peaceful solutions to those problems will result in easing international tensions and strengthening the progress of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.139.	Egypt voices its support for the efforts of the Contadora Group to extricate Central America from the circle of violence and enable the peoples of the region to achieve peace  stability and development.140.	Twenty-five years have elapsed since the General Assembly adopted  at its fourteenth session  a resolution which stressed  that the objective of general and complete disarmament was the most important and most pressing issue our world confronted. Agreement was reached on setting up the Disarmament Commission at Geneva. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was concluded in 1968  and a large number of non- nuclear-weapon States thereby renounced the nuclear option and placed their nuclear installations under international control. Despite efforts by the non- aligned countries in the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva and here in the General Assembly at two special sessions devoted to disarmament  we note not only an absence of any progress in disarmament negotiations but also  unfortunately  a further accumulation of nuclear weapons  which has brought the stockpile of nuclear warheads to 80 000  enough to destroy the world several times over. Nuclear weapons are proliferating in new locations and domains  and legal freedoms  such as the freedom to use outer space and the high seas  are used for more nuclear militarization. The rate of expenditure on the production of instruments of mass destruction is on the increase and has reached astronomical levels at a time when there are people starving to death  as is the case in Africa. This is the appalling image we have of the world  one which haunts the life of man today with a new type of anxiety and fear of annihilation and self-destruction which could occur unintentionally through a miscalculation or a misreading of data.141.	Therefore  we cannot but persist in urging the nuclear-weapon States to heed the voice of reason and to respond to the plea of millions of people to halt the nuclear-arms race by reaching agreements conducive to the gradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the possibility of a nuclear war.142.	As preparations for the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are already under way  we are fully entitled to call urgently for the fulfilment by the nuclear-weapon States of their commitments in accordance with article VI of that Treaty  by starting negotiations in good faith to reach agreement on effective measures to stop the nuclear-arms race and achieve a complete ban on nuclear tests.143.	In other words  it is our view that the Conference should consider measures which would commit nuclear States to non-use of their nuclear weapons against States that do not have nuclear weapons and have renounced the nuclear option. It should also support any country that might be the victim of aggression against its nuclear installations devoted to peaceful purposes.144.	As far as the region to which we belong is concerned  Egypt has for several years called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and  in February 1981  it ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The General Assembly  for its part  reaffirmed at the thirty-eighth session its previous resolutions calling upon States of the region to desist from producing or acquiring nuclear weapons or allowing the positioning of such weapons by a third party on their territories and to subject all their nuclear activities to IAEA safeguards.145.	The ministerial meeting of the Mediterranean members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Valletta on 10 and 11 September 1984  reiterated in its Final Declaration the necessity of establishing such a nuclear- weapon-free zone in the Middle East and requested the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to take specific steps to bring this concept into being.146.	I have already highlighted the acute economic and human crisis afflicting the African continent. Needless to say  this crisis stems basically from prevailing economic conditions which hinder the developing countries  particularly in Africa  from surmounting the barriers of underdevelopment and accelerating the development process.147.	In this context  we emphasize the serious debt problem and the escalating interest rates  the continuous fluctuations in exchange rates  the persistence of protectionist trends in international trade  accentuated by a sharp decline in the prices of raw materials exported from the developing countries  and the deterioration of the terms of trade of these countries.148.	We had entertained the hope that meetings recently held  such as the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  would have provided an opportunity to reach agreed solutions for international economic problems and reactivate the North-South dialogue. It is regrettable that that session could not accomplish concrete results. Also  the outcome of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  provided yet another example of the stalemate being encountered at present in the North-South dialogue.149.	The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  adopted a flexible approach to extricating global negotiations from the persistent deadlock. However  that initiative has not received its due response from the countries of the North.150.	We share with many the conviction that the world economy is so complex that it is indispensable to strengthen interdependence and dialogue in order to find solutions to all these problems.151.	In this regard  I wish to recall the appeal made by President Hosni Mubarak  of the Arab Republic of Egypt  before the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development last year  which was intended to instil a new spirit of international co-operation  when he called for regular consultations between the Heads of State or Government in the North and the South to review the international economic situation  agree upon policies which would spare the world further acute crises and ensure the sound functioning of the economic cycle for the common benefit of mankind.152.	We call upon countries of the North to approach the dialogue with a new outlook based on the conviction that we share the same destiny and that comprehensive solutions through dialogue and understanding are the only option available to us.153.	Last year  at the thirty-eighth session  when President Hosni Mubarak addressed the Assembly  he underlined the necessity of convening a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to the subject of enhancing the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security.154.	We have recently received the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  in which he made a detailed analysis of the set-back suffered by the collective system and the need to restore confidence in and credibility to the United Nations and to enhance its effectiveness. We share the Secretary-General's views and conclusions on the causes of this crisis and the necessity for them to be redressed.155.	It is our view that  as we are on the eve of commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  it is a highly propitious time to initiate practical steps to convene such a special session.156.	On the eve of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  let us close our ranks in solidarity in the interest of peace and prosperity for our peoples. Let us make this anniversary a unique opportunity to achieve for future generations real victory over ignorance  poverty  starvation  fear  oppression  terrorism and injustice."
"47",2202,"ESP",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  Sir  I wish to convey to you my delegation's congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your well-known personal and profession-al qualities  clearly shown throughout your fruitful work in the United Nations  offer a guarantee that our work will be conducted by firm and expert hands.I can assure you that in the performance of your task you may count on the sincere co-operation of the delegation of Spain.182.	It gives me special satisfaction to recall the praiseworthy work done by the President of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who occupied the highest position in Panama and also devoted himself to the work of that session183.	On behalf of my delegation  I  too  wish to give a cordial welcome to the new Member of the Organization  Brunei Darussalam  the admission of which adds to the community of sovereign nations. We wish that nation all the best in its new life as an independent State.184.	We are living through particularly difficult times. We are witnessing a recrudescence of violence and terrorism  an exacerbation of old conflicts  a worsening  for most people  of the economic crisis  in brief  the persistence of a climate of insecurity and international tension.185.	However  we have today institutions and multilateral mechanisms with which  despite their imperfections  we can face these challenges. They are  in fact  the appropriate means for solving global problems  assuming there is the political will to use them correctly. I am referring especially to the United Nations. And in this context  the recent appeal by the Secretary-General for multilateralism could not have been more opportune. My delegation supports that fully.186.	With idealism  but also with realism  the Government of Spain has inscribed among its priorities for foreign policy the defence of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and I can assure you  Mr. President  that we will do whatever is within our reach to strengthen the Organization.187.	Peace requires security as a prerequisite  but only with justice can it attain its fullness.188.	Spain today has taken on the moral commitment to contribute to the attainment of a safer and more just international order. Because we wish there to be a safer world  we consider it a priority to make considerable strides in the areas of detente and disarmament. We remain convinced  however  that these strides would be short-lived were we not to make efforts at the same time to attain a more just economic and social order.189.	We continue to experience moments of tension in international relations  made worse by the break in the dialogue between the major Powers and by the arms race. Present levels of weapons are dangerous as well as costly. We cannot disregard the general cry  particularly by the young  who call for us to put an end  without further delay  to such shocking escalation.190.	We are absolutely convinced that it is possible to attain balance at a lower level of armaments without endangering the legitimate security interests of each State.191.	We have made various appeals  which we reiterate at this time  for the United States and the Soviet Union to resume their talks as soon as possible. We believe that at these times of mistrust and uncertainty any proposal aimed at restoring effective dialogue should be welcome. It is in this spirit that the President of the Government of Spain made a statement in support of the so-called initiative of the five continents  begun last May by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania.192.	Some recent indications support our conviction that the doors to dialogue remain open. Today  more than ever  we must expand such avenues of communication towards a rebirth of the spirit and practice of detente.193.	But  together with dialogue between the great Powers  all States  whether nuclear or not  are in duty bound to promote the causes of disarmament and detente. Spain  within the framework of the Western system of security  of which it is a part  as well as through its participation in the various multilateral forums  will spare no efforts to that end.194.	Within the framework of the United Nations  we hope that the Conference on Disarmament may shortly conclude a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and that it will achieve the results which everyone desires with regard to the prohibition of chemical weapons. In both areas  existing obstacles  including that of verification  should not prove insoluble. At the same time  we hope that the Conference on Disarmament will pay special attention to the risks of militarization of outer space which  were it to become a reality  would be a new and serious factor of instability and insecurity.195.	While arms reduction and control are essential to the maintenance of international security  we cannot forget the decisive importance which confidence-building measures have for the process of disarmament; these measures are aimed at reducing international tension and at strengthening rationality and stability in international relations. Spain is taking an active part in the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  at Stockholm  which followed the Madrid meeting of representatives of the participating States of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  and trusts that the Stockholm Conference will be able to adopt concrete and effective measures. Our delegation  without giving up any of its basic principles  is willing to analyse and take into account the points of view which may be presented by other groups of countries. In keeping with its position at the Madrid meeting  my country will try to bring about a rapprochement among the parties and thus safeguard the basic principles that make for coexistence and co-operation.196.	While we wish to build real and lasting peace  we must also endeavour to eliminate the deep causes of conflicts: injustice and oppression.197.	Torture  arbitrary detention and forced disappearances continue to be current practice in many regions of the world. Political persecution still forces citizens of some countries to go into exile. Racial discrimination afflicts many societies; its most odious and intolerable manifestation is the system of apartheid198.	Despite that painful fact  we cannot disregard the important role played by the United Nations and other international organizations in the definition  recognition  protection and promotion of fundamental rights and freedoms. Owing largely to their activities  more and more States are accepting the obligation to report on the status of human rights within their borders  are agreeing to recourse by their citizens to multilateral forums and are agreeing to be investigated. But there is still a long way to go towards perfecting and completing present control mechanisms.199.	The Government of Spain  while it continues to develop its constitutional tenets  is willing to continue co-operating with the international system for the defence of human rights. In the framework of the United Nations  we took part this year  for the first time  in the work of the Commission on Human Rights  whose role we regard as of crucial importance.200.	This session of the General Assembly is to consider a draft convention on torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  which has been submitted to it by the Commission on Human Rights. We believe that this draft  to which my Government attaches great importance  is ripe for adoption and that  through a negotiating effort  it will be possible to overcome the difficulties that still remain and to adopt the convention at this session.201.	A stable and peaceful world can only be based on a more just and better balanced economic and social order. The improvement and restructuring of international economic relations constitute one of the great challenges faced by the international com-munity.202.	The international economy is suffering one of its deepest crises. Given the global nature of that crisis  the solutions can only be global too.203.	It is true that the picture for some countries is less disquieting than it was last year  owing  among other things  to the increase of the activities in the sphere of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and to the gradual recovery of international trade. But the effects of the crisis continue to be felt particularly severely and intensely in the less-developed countries.204.	The foreign debt not only is the main hindrance to development for many countries  but also threatens the very survival of the international financial system. Spain is open to any proposals that may include new ideas for solving this difficult problem  without losing sight of the possibilities offered by present avenues for renegotiation  among them the IMF. But we should not forget that we are faced with a question that should not be approached on a strictly financial basis.205.	High interest rates in the United States lead to a massive capital flow into the North American market and press upwards the rates in other countries. That is still another road-block to economic recovery. It hampers international trade and com-pounds the problems of the debtor countries.206.	Protectionist trends are being reaffirmed in the international market. Thus a vicious circle is created  which prevents developing countries from reconciling economic progress with the servicing of their foreign debt.207.	Many developing countries have had to face an economic crisis while  at the same time  opening new ways to democratic participation by their citizens. It is a tribute to the democratic system that the impact of adjustment measures implemented by those countries has not led in many of them to the social and political turmoil that some had predicted. Nevertheless  maintaining these recession-inducing policies for too long could lead to a social explosion whose consequences would be felt throughout the international community.208.	As the Secretary-General states in his report on the work of the Organization ""If we do not address current economic problems seriously and urgently  we will not be able to confine them to the economic sphere alone. In our world of growing economic interdependence  impoverished people faced perpetually with a variety of overwhelming economic and social crises constitute not only a challenge to international conscience  but a threat of international stability as well.""209.	All of us must learn the lesson of this crisis  which is none other than the irreversible economic interdependence of the world and the close interrelationship of economic and political phenomena.210.	Spain  a country that has had to undergo democratic transition and consolidation at a time when adjustments have been required because of the economic crisis  stands in solidarity with the developing countries in the situation they are facing. Thus  my Government has authorized all bilateral and multilateral negotiations designed to alleviate the effects of the crisis on those countries.211.	The United Nations has played an important part in the struggle against underdevelopment through its co-operation programmes for development  emergency aid  training and research  and food aid. We are convinced that in the present circumstances it is called upon to play an even more important part. In this context  the final launching of global negotiations at this session of the General Assembly could be one of the most appropriate means of finding a lasting solution to the present crisis.212.	I have chosen to focus my statement on the three major challenges that the international community faces on its path towards coexistence based on security  respect for human rights  and economic and social development. Now  however  I shall refer to some of the regional problems of special interest to my Government.213.	My country continues to be concerned about developments in Central America  where the living conditions and safety of the citizens continue to deteriorate. We have repeatedly stated that in our view the deep causes of the long-standing crisis in the region are unjust economic and social structures and that the trends we note towards growing militarization merely contribute to a worsening of the situation and could turn the isthmus into an area of endemic confrontation. On the other hand  the tendency to place internal conflicts or differences between States in the context of global confrontation between the major Powers not only is an obstacle to the solution of the present crises and the age-old problems of the countries of Central America  but also threatens world peace.214.	Since the beginning of 1983  Spain has been actively supporting the peace initiative of the countries in the Contadora Group and the tireless efforts made to reach a regional agreement based on the principles of non-intervention  non-interference  non-use of force or the threat of force  and real respect for human rights as enshrined by the United Nations.215.	Spain feels itself closely linked to that region and is especially alive to the aspirations of its inhabitants to peace and well-being. We are pleased  therefore  at the rapprochement that seems to be taking place between Western Europe  of which we are a part  and Central America  to which we are joined by fraternal bonds. We believe that Europe should spare no efforts on either the economic or the political level that could contribute to attaining a peace that is possible and a prosperity that is legitimate. In this connection  we regard the initiative taken by President Monge  of Costa Rica  which will bear fruit at the end of this week in the meeting at San Jose of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five Central American countries  the four countries of the Contadora Group  the 10 countries members of the European Economic Community  and Spain and Portugal  as an extremely important one  and we hope that it will contribute to the attainment of those goals.216.	In the South Atlantic  the future of the Malvinas Islands continues to be a major source of concern for the international community. In addition  it is a source of tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina. We urge those Governments to resolve their sovereignty dispute through negotiation in such a way that the territorial integrity of Argentina may be restored and due account taken of the interests of the population  in keeping with United Nations resolutions.217.	By historical  political and cultural tradition  nothing that occurs in the Mediterranean area can be alien to Spain. My Government watches with especial attention the problems and developments in the Maghreb region. We trust that the treaties of fraternity between Algeria  Tunisia and Mauritania and the treaty of union between Morocco and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will  instead of creating two opposing axes  result in benefits for an increasingly united and peaceful Maghreb. We continue to believe that such a peace can be achieved only if the Saharan conflict is settled. The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] have set forth quite clearly the principles and means by which that can be done. My Government will spare no effort and will co-operate as called upon by the parties concerned or by the United Nations and the OAU whenever such co-operation can contribute towards a just and stable peace in the region.218.	The question of Cyprus continues to be a source of tension in the eastern Mediterranean. We reiterate our appeal for a compromise that can ensure the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus and promote peaceful coexistence between the two communities settled there.219.	At the thirty-eighth session  I tried to set forth clearly the position of the Government of Spain with regard to the tragedy of Lebanon  the question of Palestine and the war between Iran and Iraq. I shall not repeat what I said at that time  but I do feel it opportune briefly to mention some of the most recent events there  since they may have a bearing on the evolution of the problems of the Near and Middle East.220.	In Lebanon we have recently witnessed bloody and painful events that have shocked the conscience of mankind. Nevertheless  even amidst so much grief  the spirit of the Lebanese people  reaffirming its independence  sovereignty and identity  has survived intact. We must welcome the recent efforts towards reconciliation made by the Lebanese them-selves  efforts that have been supported by many Arab countriesânotably  by the Syrian Arab Republic and Saudi Arabia.221.	The Palestinian people  although increasingly secure in its identity  continues to be deprived of its rights and its homeland. Of late  in addition to the traditional difficulties inherent in so extremely complex a problem as that of the Middle East  a certain climate of confusion and division has come to prevail within the PLO. Only the security created by unity and cohesion can lead to the creation of the conditions necessary for a negotiated  just and lasting solution.222.	Such a solution  we must repeat  can only be based on withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and the security of all States of the region  including Israel. However  it will be difficult to begin to move towards peace if the Israeli Government does not abandon its settlement policy.223.	The war between Iran and Iraq compels us to reissue to its leaders our earlier appeal that they evince the flexibility needed to put an end to a conflict that has for four years now had tragic consequences for the peoples of two friendly countries. We trust that a compromise may be reached that will allow them to coexist in peace and to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are aware that the human and material losses caused by the spread of hostilities to the Gulf are not as severe as the death and destruction the belligerents have suffered  but we do ask that the free and peaceful passage of vessels from third countries through those waters be assured.224.	In other geographic areas as well there are problems that continue to be a source of concern to my Government.225.	In keeping with United Nations resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea  which we have supported  we believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops is a necessary prerequisite for the peoples of those two countries to be able freely to choose the political system best suited to their interests.226.	With regard to the problems in southern Africa  we would cite with hope and interest such accords as the Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa  signed at Nkomati on 16 March 1984  and talks such as those that led to the agreement between Angola and South Africa  reached at Lusaka on 16 February 1984. It is still premature to be optimistic. However  those events  as well as the recent meetings between leaders of South Africa and SWAPO  should impel us to encourage a development that could lead to the rapid independence of Namibia through the implementation  without further delay  of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the cessation of all aggression against Angola and other African front-line States.227.	I cannot conclude my statement without making reference to a problem that is of very direct concern to my country. My Government is continuing its efforts to find a solution to the anachronistic situation that exists in Gibraltar  the only colony still extant on the continent of Europe. It is a priority objective of Spain's foreign policy to achieve the restoration of its territorial integrity through peaceful means and continued dialogue with the United Kingdom. The Government of Spain reiterates its commitment  in the course of such negotiations and in the future  to respect the legitimate interests of the population of Gibraltar.228.	Last April my country was honoured by the visit of the Secretary-General. My Government wishes to express to him once again its gratitude for the quiet and devoted work he has been conducting. His effective guidance of the Secretariat and his perseverance in the quest for solutions to such thorny and delicate problems as those of Cyprus  Afghanistan or the Iran-Iraq conflict are worthy of our praise as well as of our support and encouragement.229.	The forthcoming fortieth anniversary of the United Nations should be for all of us an occasion for profound reflection on the limitations and also on the opportunities that the multilateral system  as en-shrined in the Charter  provides us in facing the challenges of an ever-changing world.230.	In the meantime  let us through our efforts at this session of the General Assembly contribute to making progress  albeit by small steps  in the quest for a safer  more prosperous and freer world."
"48",2274,"ETH",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf  Sir  I should like to congratulate you on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is not only a recognition of your personal qualities as a seasoned diplomat  but also a fitting tribute to the positive role your country  Zambia  and your distinguished Head of State  President Kenneth Kaunda  play in international affairs. While wishing you every success in the discharge of your weighty responsibilities  I should like to assure you of the full co-operation of the Ethiopian delegation in your endeavours.141.	I should like also to take this opportunity to express Ethiopia's appreciation of the wise and effective leadership provided by your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama.142.	We also welcome Brunei Darussalam into this family of nations.143.	The quest for peace  progress and justice has been the most constant factor in human history. Neither the stage of development attained by societies nor their cultural idiosyncrasies could permanently alter this immutable yearning which springs from the very depths of man's conscience. Indeed  this nobility of spirit still continues to animate the thoughts and actions of the great majority of mankind.144.	Yet history has never been one-dimensional. The pursuit of the lofty objectives of peace  progress and justice by the preponderant majority of the peoples of the world has throughout history been opposed by a minority which single-mindedly pursues the policy of domination  oppression and plunder. This minority considers aggression  intervention and war as legitimate instruments to realize its obnoxious policy. Indeed  the history of the world has been and continues to be  in large measure  a reflection of the struggle between these two opposing forces.145.	The victory over fascism and militarism in 1945 stands as a brilliant landmark in this continuing process of the struggle between good and evil. The founding of the United Nations in the same year symbolizes not only the unity of purpose  which was unmistakably manifested through the joint efforts of mankind against fascism and militarism  but also the universality of the hopes and aspirations of peoples throughout the world for peace  progress and justice.146.	It is this universality of man's cherished values that we have committed ourselves to protect and promote when  in the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  ""We the peoples of the United Nations"" unequivocally expressed our determination to put an end to war  to preserve the dignity of the human person  to maintain justice and to promote social progress. The United Nations has thus become the repository of the nobler instincts of mankind and the sole representative of its collective conscience.147.	In this connection  and on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  therefore  I feel duty-bound to affirm once again Ethiopia's unswerving commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter and to the goal of further strengthening the United Nations as the only universal forum for the harmonization of the actions of nations in the attainment of the fundamental objectives of peace  progress and justice.148.	In reviewing the current international situation  we find that the world of 1984 for the most part is still confronted by the same problems with which the United Nations has been seized for decades. The arms race  international economic problems  the challenges posed by racism and apartheid  the question of Namibia's independence  the problems of the Middle Eastâto name just a fewâare still with us. That these and other international problems have remained unsolved for so long cannot be attributed  as some might claim  to the shortcomings of the United Nations. They are due in large measure to the breakdown in the international legal and political order  as evidenced by the behaviour of some Member States which increasingly violate the rules and norms of international law and frequently disregard the United Nations as the universal forum for the resolution of international problems.149.	The problem in southern Africa  which has its genesis in the baser instincts of a few to dominate the many and which has been gnawing at the conscience of humanity for so long  is a case in point. The racist Pretoria regime  aided and abetted by its imperialist allies  intransigently persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia  and the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  as endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978)  so far remains a dead letter. To our utter dismay and frustration  the apartheid regime and its allies  in particular the United States Government  while intensifying their plunder of the human and material resources of Namibia  continue to raise extraneous issues in order to delay further the exercise by the Namibian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and nations independence. At the same time  they leave no stone unturned in their search for a group of puppets which could ensure the perpetuation of their dominant role in the affairs of post-independence Namibia.150.	There is no doubt that such futile attempts by racists  colonialists and neo-colonialists will be foiled by the heroic people of Namibia  under their sole and legitimate representative  SWAPO.151.	Within the Republic of South Africa itself  the racist regime is doing everything in its power to consolidate the obnoxious system of apartheid. While continuing to deny the African masses their fundamental human rights and freedoms  the apartheid regime is attempting to entice the Coloured and Asian population with ""constitutional"" subterfuge and meaningless ""political reforms"". Ethiopia is convinced that this age-old imperialist stratagem of ""divide and rule""  to which the preponderant majority of the population of South Africa  including the Coloureds and those of Asian origin  are opposed  will  like all the other evil designs of the apartheid regime  be totally rejected by the international community.152.	Not content with the repressive measures continuously meted out to the African population of Namibia and South Africa  the Pretoria regime  with the full support of its imperialist allies  has carried out with impunity repeated acts of armed aggression against the front-line States  in particular Angola and Mozambique. Those same States have also been victims of subversion and destabilization by the Pretoria regime  which has infiltrated into their territories mercenaries  fifth-columnists and agents to cause death and destruction.153.	In the warped logic of Pretoria and its friends  the armed aggression against and destabilization of the front-line States are justified as a genuine search for regional peace and stability. The international community is  however  cognizant of the fact that the objective of that policy on the part of the apartheid regime and its allies is but to buy time for Pretoria and to gain a respite from the armed struggle so gallantly waged by SWAPO in Namibia and the liberation movements  in particular the ANC  in southern Africa.154.	As the Final Communique of the Summit Meeting of the Front-line States  which was held at Arusha on 29 April 1984  so eloquently stated:""Peace is incompatible with racism and colonialism. . . . Neither military might nor devious political machinations . . . can defeat the idea of freedom and racial equality.""We in Ethiopia earnestly hope that this self-evident and historic truth will be heeded by those few countries which consider that fortress of apartheid as a natural ally and a bastion of Western civilization. It is  however  gratifying to note that the international community continues to consider apartheid as a crime against humanity and to reject the illegal occupation of Namibia and institutionalized racism in South Africa.155.	While pledging to redouble their efforts to render moral and material assistance to both SWAPO and the liberation movements in South Africa and the ANC  the Government and people of Ethiopia appeal to all nations of goodwill to do likewise until the torch of freedom and racial equality is fully ablaze in both Namibia and South Africa. The United Nations also cannot continue indefinitely to be satisfied with condemnatory declarations; it must adopt and enforce mandatory sanctions against the racist regime until the United Nations plan is implemented in Namibia and apartheid is dismantled in South Africa. At the same time  the front-line States should be given all-round assistance to reconstruct their economies and better to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.156.	It is also our hope that those countries which recently hosted Mr. Botha in their capitals with a view to helping Pretoria break out of its isolation will realize that no amount of public relations and diplomatic charades can alter the true nature of the pernicious system of apartheid.157.	We also hope that the United States Administration will abandon its policy of linking the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban internationalists from Angola. This policy has been instrumental in delaying the independence of Namibia. It must be realized that  as far as the Namibian people are concerned  independence delayed is independence denied.158.	In addition to the intractable problems in southern Africa  there are other serious challenges  such as the question of Western Sahara and the conflict in Chad  with which Africa is concerned today. Despite the complex and delicate nature of these problems  the search for solutions by the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity and other African leaders still continues. However  so far progress has not been achieved towards resolving the question of Western Sahara as a result of the difficulties encountered in implementing in their entirety the provisions of resolution AHG/Res.104 (XIX)  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983. It is Ethiopia's expectation that the forthcoming session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity will break the impasse and resolve this problem.159.	As regards the situation in Chad  I welcome the agreement recently signed by France and Libya and call upon our Chadian brothers and sisters to take advantage of this opportunity to bring about national reconciliation  peace and prosperity to their country.160.	The difficulties Africa is facing in the political arena are more than matched by the alarming economic and social condition in which it currently finds itself. Africa's present sorry situation is not a sudden phenomenon but  rather  the result of the cumulative impact of a number of adverse factors that have plagued the region. The wounds that colonialism inflicted on African countries and the ravages of neo-colonialism in its many guises have adversely affected prospects for socio-economic development in Africa.161.	Today  Africa suffers  on the one hand  from serious internal and external structural deficiencies  including  in particular  slow economic growth and global economic rigidities  and  on the other  from the devastating effects of natural disasters such as persistent droughts  recurrent cyclones  earthquakes and floods. The current social and economic crisis of the continent  therefore  encompasses two important dimensionsânamely  the emergency situation that constitutes an immediate threat to human survival  and the deep-rooted domestic and international structural problems that have hitherto thwarted and continue to thwart Africa's development efforts.162.	A cursory perusal of international economic and social data reveals that the nations of Africa are suffering the full brunt of the world economic downturn. The recession that has engulfed the inter-national economy during the last few years has had a reverberating effect on African economies. Its attendant evils  such as the collapse of commodity prices  increased protectionism  unfavourable terms of trade  balance-of-payments deficits  decline of official development assistance and mounting external debt  have negatively affected both the present well- being and the prospects for the future development of the peoples of Africa. As a result  the average growth rate of gross national domestic product has declined by almost 300 percent; from 4.4 per cent in 1980 to 1.1 per cent in 1982  which  I must underline  is far below the population growth rate. Per capita output in 1983 declined by 10 per cent as compared to that of 1980.163.	Africa's performance in the international trade sector also leaves much to be desired. The collapse of the prices of our principal export commodities has drastically reduced our foreign-exchange earnings. Export values in 1983 declined by 32 per cent below those of 1980. Africa lost over $2 billion from its export of five primary commodities alone during the period 1979-1981 as a result of the continuous decline in the prices of raw materials. This phenomenon has aggravated the balance-of-payments deficit  which stood at $2.7 billion in 1982 for Africa as a whole.164.	The sad fact is that this constant deterioration of foreign-exchange earnings  coupled with stagnant flow of official development assistance  has left Africa in a situation where it cannot generate additional income sufficient enough even to cover debt- servicing  let alone undertake new development programmes. Indeed  the outstanding external debt balance of African countries rose from $143 billion in 1982 to $150 billion at the end of 1983. This sum represents 180 per cent of the value of goods and services exported by the continent for the same year. External debt servicing also rose to 22.4 per cent of export of goods and services  compared to 10 per cent in 1980.165.	Worse still is the sharp decline of net capital inflow  from $14.2 billion in 1982 to $7.8 billion in 1983  forcing African countries to resort to commercial borrowing at high interest rates.166.	As I have intimated earlier  one of the major factors that accounts for the current economic problems of Africa is the legacy of the economic structure that the continent inherited from colonialism. African countries  after the attainment of political independence  were forced to continue the pre-independence economic development patterns which were based predominantly on production and export of a small range of agricultural and mineral products. This narrow economic base and dependency on foreign markets has left the level of development of the required capabilities of infrastructures and other factor inputs at a rudimentary stage in the majority of our countries.167.	Thus  the growing malaise in the economies of African countries is far from being a result of a simple cyclical phenomenon emanating from the current global recession. I submit it is rather a result of the underlying structural maladjustment inherited from colonialism.168.	Any remedy to redress the immediate and pressing problems of the continent  therefore  calls for measures that deal with the underlying causes. Such measures  in our view  should not be limited to the containment of immediate crises through stopgap measures of a reactive character  but should seek to overcome them by creating conditions for robust growth.169.	Over and above the critical economic crises  Africa is at present facing the spectre of drought and desertification. The drought  which in the early 1970s was localized in a few Sudano-Sahelian countries  has now spread to other regions of Africa  afflicting more than half the member States of the OAU. This persistent and widespread drought has led to environmental degradation and progressive desertification. Millions of hectares of productive and fertile land of yester-year today lie waste through desertification.170.	As a result  most African countries which were once self-sufficient are now net importers of food  with 25 per cent of all the concessional aid that flows into the continent being spent on the purchase of food. Should the present trend persist  food-import bills will continue to rise  claiming perhaps as much as 60 to 70 per cent of all concessional aid and loans and leading to further curtailment of development activities. Indeed  the situation has become so critical that most or almost all of our socio-economic development projects have to be shelved for the moment. Indeed  this prolonged drought  besides retarding our development efforts  poses a long-term threat to the very survival of the African peoples and their civilization.171.	As is well known  Ethiopia is one of those that has been hit by the current drought. I need not take much of the precious time of the Assembly in explaining the prevailing grim situation in which more than 5 million of my compatriots are facing the threat of famine and starvation as a result of the prolonged and persistent drought that has afflicted the country since the early 1970s. My Government has all along tried to keep members of the Assemblyâand  indeed  the international community at largeâfully informed of the plight of the drought victims in Ethiopia. At this point  I should only like to underline the fact that the current situation is so serious and the cumulative effect of past droughts so devastating that the Ethiopian people need urgent and massive international assistance.172.	In this connection  I should also like to express the sincere gratitude of the people and Government of Ethiopia to all donor Governments  specialized agencies and other United Nations organs  as well as voluntary agencies  for their humanitarian concern and relief assistance.173.	I should like at this juncture to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his initiatives to focus the attention of the international community on the critical situation in Africa and for his efforts to bring an integrated and coherent approach to the solution of the crisis.174.	Ethiopia is also gratified by the report of the Secretary-General on the critical economic situation in Africa  which gives a vivid and detailed account of the African situation  including a precise assessment of the emergency needs in the most seriously affected countries within an integrated framework of African development. We hope that  in the course of the deliberations of the Assembly at this session  that document will receive the attention it so much deserves and  more important  the necessary response of the entire international community in terms of concrete measures.175.	We in Africa have spared no efforts to respond to the crisis  using all the means and resources at our disposal. This  of course  is as it should be  for we recognize that the primary responsibility for the development of our region rests with us. But because of the magnitude and complexity of the problems  Africa could not realistically be expected to cope with the situation single-handed. In some cases  certain aspects of Africa's crisis lie beyond the capacity and possibilities of the African countries individually or collectively  and many of the basic elements of our crisis are either under the control of nature or in the arena of international economic relations. In both cases  Africa's capacity to influence or change decisively the direction of events is obviously very limited.176.	Nevertheless  we have not failed to try to find solutions. Indeed  not only did the fortieth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa from 27 February to 5 March 1984  address itself fully to the crisis but  as a follow-up to the resolution adopted at that session  the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  at its tenth meeting  held at Addis Ababa from 24 to 28 May 1984  adopted a Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis. That Memorandum was submitted to the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session in 1984 with the conviction that its consideration would lead to concrete action by the international community. In that Memorandum  as well as in the Addis Ababa Declaration on Africa's External Indebtedness  adopted by the African Ministers of Finance  Africa has stated its well-considered and collective opinion on the crisis  with specific recommendations as to what role it expects the international community to play.177.	Regrettably  however  the debate in the Economic and Social Council  although it showed an understanding of and sympathy for the African crisis  ended without any agreed declaration. It is my fervent hope  therefore  that  at this session  the General Assembly will succeed where the Economic and Social Council has failed and come out with a declaration pledging the full support of the international community in solving Africa's economic crisis on the basis of the proposals contained in the Special Memorandum of the Economic Commission for Africa. It is also my hope that the international community will demonstrate once and for all its real commitment to complement the efforts of the African countries in facing both the struggle for survival and the challenge for development. The needs of the countries in terms of emergency and development assistance are well known. What is needed is a concrete framework for meeting such needs.178.	However  one cannot fail to ask whether this framework can be evolved in the prevailing unjust international economic system  which itself is gripped in a pervasive and perilous crisis. Indeed  the present international economic system continues to be a cause of profound concern  not only because of its devastating impact on the economic and social life of the peoples of the developing countries  but also because of the tension it generates among nations  thus negatively affecting global peace and security.179.	While the gravity of the crisis demands bold vision and constructive dialogue  as well as innovative and collective efforts  the absence of political will on the part of developed countries has so far impeded the necessary common endeavours to seek solutions to global economic problems. Instead  the developed world seems to have resigned itself to doubts  mistrust and  most damaging of all  inward- looking tendencies.180.	For almost three decades now  the developing countries have made a continuous appeal for common prosperity. They have persistently and earnestly advocated the restructuring of the present lopsided and inequitable international economic order. Nevertheless  all efforts to seek structural adjustment in the system and to adopt measures required to alleviate the conditions of the developing countries have met with stubborn resistance from some developed countries.181.	This failure to act in concert to deal adequately with the alarming global situation has  in turn  further aggravated the international economic climate. In this connection  it must be realized that each time the international community fails to take measures commensurate with the seriousness of the problem  not only the poor but also the rich are bound to be affected.182.	Ethiopia will therefore continue to urge the international community to take bold and concrete measures with a view to establishing the new international economic order. The interdependence of nations makes it imperative that this global challenge be met with a global response. We earnestly hope that the economic power centres concerned will reassess their present situation  bearing in mind that only effective and imaginative measures will create positive opportunities for fruitful co-operation  outweighing the short-term advantage of predominance.183.	While the overwhelming majority of mankind is languishing in untold misery and squalor  billions of dollars and millions of man-hours are recklessly wasted each day on the production  testing and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. Clearly  nothing demonstrates better than this stark fact that the world has lost its moral compass.184.	The united opposition of the vast majority of mankind to the nuclear-arms race notwithstanding  new  more deadly and more accurate nuclear-weapon systems are being produced and stationed in several parts of the world with the objective of attaining nuclear superiority and  in fact  first-strike superiority  thus further increasing the risks of war.185.	Last year more than in the previous year  this year more than last year  the macabre march towards apocalyptic nuclear confrontation has been gathering momentum. Indeed  the nuclear noose around the neck of humanity is further tightened with each passing day. The quest for peace and disarmament has therefore become the leading item on the agenda of mankind today. But peace cannot be manufactured. It is a product of creative thinking  reasoned discourse and statesmanship which aims at the humanization of man and the preservation of his civilization186.	On behalf of the people and the Government of Ethiopia  therefore  I appeal once again to the nobler instincts and the common sense of all those concerned to halt  and indeed reverse  this blind rush into nuclear catastrophe and  instead  join the rest of humanity in a common search for a better tomorrow.187.	Over and above this nuclear threat  the further militarization of outer space and of the hitherto peaceful regions of the globe is a source of anxiety to most of us. We in Ethiopia are particularly concerned at the intensification of military activities in the Indian Ocean region. Numerous declarations and resolutions by the United Nations and the non- aligned countries notwithstanding  the Indian Ocean region is far from being a zone of peace. Indeed  it is increasingly becoming a military zone.188.	The presence of military forces  the establishment of imperialist military bases and the acquisition of military facilities  the setting up of new military command posts and structures and the show of military power through so-called military exercises not only pose a threat to the security of the littoral and hinterland States but also aggravate relations among nations both within and outside the region  endangering international peace and security. We believe that this dangerous trend of the militarization of the region must be stopped and reversed. In this connection  Ethiopia is convinced that the convening at Colombo of the long-awaited international Conference on the Indian Ocean can make a positive contribution towards this objective.189.	The paradox that the absence of war does not constitute peace is more obvious today than at any time in the past  a glaring example of which is the situation in the Middle East. The quiet that pervades the Middle East today is more apparent than real  for the fundamental cause of all the conflicts in the region still remains unattended to. It is Ethiopia's long-standing position that no solution can be viable and long-lasting unless and until it addresses itself to the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State in their territory.190.	Ethiopia is compelled  therefore  to reiterate its call for the exercise by the Palestinian people of its fight to self-determination  and to this end expresses its support for the holding of an international  peace conference on the Middle East in which the PLO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  will participate on an equal footing with all the other parties concerned.191.	As in the Middle East  the quiet in Cyprus  in the Korean peninsula and elsewhere is deceptive. Cyprus is still divided. Since recent developments give no cause for optimism  we again call on all Cypriots to work towards a united Cyprus  with that country's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status fully respected. In this connection  we note with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General  which we support and encourage.192.	Unlike in Cyprus  recent developments in Lebanon have been encouraging. We welcome the establishment of a Government of national reconciliation in Lebanon and wish the people of that friendly country unity  peace and prosperity.193.	As regards the situation in the Korean peninsula  Ethiopia reaffirms its support for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people without any foreign interference. In this connection  we find the proposed tripartite talks most useful and the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the area most urgent.194.	No less urgent is the need to put an end to the Iran-Iraq war  in which the world has witnessed the atrocities and cruelties of war for the last four years. Both parties must put a halt to all hostilities and seek a peaceful solution to their differences.195.	As regards the serious situation obtaining in Central America  the South Atlantic and South-West and South-East Asia  my Government's position is well known. However  I cannot but express Ethiopia's utmost concern and indignation at the situation in Central America  where the sister State of Nicaragua is being subjected to aggression from without and subversion from within  with the open assistance of the Government of the United States.196.	In expressing Ethiopia's support for and solidarity with the fraternal and gallant people of Nicaragua and its Government  I once again call upon the United States Administration to abandon its hostility towards the Sandinist revolution and instead join the peace process initiated and pursued with so much wisdom and perseverance by the Contadora Group.197.	Before I conclude my statement  please permit me briefly to apprise the Assembly of recent developments in my own country. As all members will recall  it is now 10 years since the Ethiopian revolution ushered in fundamental changes in the political  economic and social system of the nation. Most of these eventful years  however  were not years of tranquillity in which we were able to devote all our energies solely to the realization of our cherished goals of economic and social development. Those were years which  parallel to the restructuring of our society  were spent  to a large degree  in the defence of the gains of our revolution and the territorial integrity of our motherland. These preoccupations notwithstanding  appreciable advances have  however  been made to strengthen the social infrastructures of the country and to ameliorate the well-being of the masses.198.	The achievements of the last 10 years in eradicating from Ethiopia the age-old enemies of mankindânamely  ignorance  disease and povertyâ are a source of particular satisfaction to the Ethiopian people. Today  the scourge of illiteracy is fast disappearing from the face of our nation. The drive to expand formal education and primary health care is gaining momentum. Agricultural and industrial development is accorded nigh priority in order to provide our people not only with the basic necessities of life but also a higher level of material and spiritual well-being to realize fully their human potential. Indeed  this is the comer-stone of the 10-year development plan  which was adopted only a month ago by the Founding Congress of the Workers Party of Ethiopia.199.	In today's Ethiopia  the basic human rights of every citizen are fully guaranteed. These rights are not only safeguarded by political and legal instruments but are also solidly reinforced by structural set-ups in which our people are organized and mobilized for effective participation in the national life of the country. Grass-roots democracy  unknown in the past  is now the moving force of our social  economic and political activities  enabling the masses to guide their own destiny in a manner that fulfils their needs and responds to their aspirations. As both a culmination and crowning achievement of this process of national organization  our people have now established the Workers Party of Ethiopia to guide the revolution and the destiny of the nation.200.	We are convinced that the establishment of this Party and the adoption of its programme reinforce  more than ever before  Ethiopia's commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity and to the policies and principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We will continue to be guided by the basic principles of sovereign equality of States  respect for the unity and territorial integrity of States  the inviolability of State frontiers  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  and peaceful settlement of international disputes.201.	The failure of some States to observe these basic rules of international relations and their policy of irredentism and expansionism  subversion and terrorism  exploitation of natural disasters for self- serving and short-sighted political ends  malicious propaganda and aggressive wars have been the primary causes for conflict and tension in our part of the world.202.	For peace  stability and co-operation among States to thrive in our region  it is imperative that irrational hostility must give way to reason. Intransigence must be replaced by compliance with regional consensus. The Charter of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity and international treaties must be fully respected.203.	With our revolution 10 years old  we in Ethiopia face the future with increased confidence and optimism. We look forward to working with even more determination to attain our cherished foreign policy objectives. Our glorious history of struggle against colonialism and imperialism will be reinforced by our determined quest for peace  cooperation and understanding both within our region and beyond.204.	All those who entertain vain territorial ambition and those who see their own strength only in a weakened Ethiopia  will never find us wanting in our determination to pay any price in the defence of our historic unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity. But all those who want to reciprocate our policy of peaceful co-operation and good-neighbourliness will always find us willing partners."
"49",2320,"FIN",39,1984,"ï»¿May I begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Finland has good relations and has developed close co-operation with your country. Your wide experience in international affairs  and of the United Nations in particular  makes you especially qualified to guide this Assembly in its deliberations. You have my best wishes in the difficult task which lies ahead of you.66.	May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly.67.	It gives me particular pleasure to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  to whom we already owe a great deal for his authority and leadership.68.	I should also like to extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam  the 159th Member of the United Nations.69.	The world situation has not taken a turn for the better. Its characteristics are many; increased uncertainty  and even hostility  in international relations; a spiralling arms race; unresolved political  as well as social and economic crises. In brief  ours is a world of conflict and confrontation instead of a world of dialogue and co-operation.70.	The United Nations must remain the principal instrument for the maintenance of international peace. It must provide for collective security under its Charter; it must assist in resolving international conflicts and disputes  it must foster economic and social progress and promote human rights. It is an organization of sovereign nations  each having legitimate needs for security and well-being. It is also an organization of interdependence and common responsibility. As the President of the Republic of Finland  Mr. Mauno Koivisto  stated last year  at the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  Finland is unequivocally committed to assuming its share of that responsibility.71.	On issues of security  States have increasingly sought to provide for their own security unilaterally by increasing armaments. Security is seen in terms of potentially antagonistic relationships. The result is perceived threats  heightened tensions and a continuous arms race. The arms race  particularly in the nuclear field  has become a source of insecurity for all. The nuclear threat concerns everyone. The world must explore other avenues for promoting security by developing its co-operative element  gaining security through arms control and disarmament  building relations through confidence and mutual understanding.72.	The record of disarmament efforts over the past few years is disappointingâindeed  it is alarming. The lack of progress is dictated by political realities. Yet  in a climate of confrontation  determined efforts to negotiate are particularly important. They may not change the turn of events overnight  but they attest to the need for conciliation and co-operation.73.	All Member States have responsibilities in the disarmament domain  but the world has the right to expect that the nuclear-weapon States  which have the primary responsibility for disarmament  act decisively to halt and reverse the course of the arms build up. The prevention of nuclear war  the curbing of nuclear arms proliferation  the limitation and reduction of nuclear arsenals  the banning of chemical weapons and the prevention of an arms race in outer space remain priorities on the international agenda.74.	There must also be efforts towards aims control and disarmament at the regional level. Such efforts should aim at improved stability and security and should contribute to the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. The Finnish Government is particularly interested in the promotion of nuclear- weapon-free zones and has put forward proposals for such a zone in the Nordic region.75.	There are ways to strengthen the co-operative element of security  the security of common responsibility. The fundamental premise is that in no circumstances nuclear weapons be used. There is interest by all in improved relationships and stability in the field of security; there is interest by all in preventing accidental wars and promoting crisis management. There should be a determined effort to transform this interest into commitments.76.	During the coming year the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is to be reviewed. This Treaty remains one of the most important single achievements in the field of disarmament. The Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty should make progress in strengthening the non-proliferation regime and in facilitating international co-operation in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. By displaying their commitment to nuclear disarmament and making tangible progress towards a comprehensive nuclear-test ban  the nuclear-weapon Powers would  for their part  contribute to a successful conference.77.	In Europe  where East-West tension is particularly visible  where the concentration of armaments is heaviest and where the arms build up continues unabated  co-operative efforts are urgently needed. A key element is to build confidence among States responsible for security in Europe. This year an endeavour to build that confidence has been launched at the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  at Stockholm. That Conference should  as soon as possible  proceed towards substantive negotiations on confidence- and security-building measures. Finland hopes that this and other endeavours within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process will lead to better implementation of the Helsinki Final Act' and to tangible progress for the benefit of the peoples in Europe and in the whole world78.	There are other areas and issues affecting the well-being and lives of millions where common responsibility must be displayed. The deepening economic and social crisis in Africa has come to the attention of the international community. Starvation  famine and deprivation have taken command over a great number of African nations. Sub-Saharan countries in particular have been seriously affected by persistent droughts. Internal social upheavals  coupled with the international economic recession  have further drained the already weak economies of those societies. The refugee problem brought about by political conflicts and turmoils still adds to this agony. At the moment  more than 150 million people on that continent face hunger and malnutrition. It is clear that the present African plight exceeds previous experiences on that continent. As the Secretary-General has said  ""the basic fact is that Africa is engaged in a struggle for economic survival.""79.	The situation is grave  but not desperate. There are ways and means by which the underlying reasons for the present calamity can be addressed. The responsibility for bringing to an end the present economic and social crisis in Africa rests primarily with the African Governments themselves. We appreciate the efforts already undertaken by the African Governments and urge them actively to pursue measures to reverse these negative trends. But at the same time the international community cannot escape its own responsibility for supporting the intensified national efforts of the developing countries  particularly in the agricultural sector. Increased and improved aid and other supportive measures are called for. In this respect we welcome and support the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General and the organizations within the United Nations system to intensify their programmes in Africa. For its part  the Government of Finland channels over 50 per cent of its bilateral aid to Africa.80.	In recent years we have witnessed with increasing concern the way in which efforts to make full use of the United Nations as a forum for negotiations on global economic problems have failed time and again. It is not enough to point to the factors that have contributed to the erosion of the credibility of the Organization. We have a common responsibility to make the Organization work by attacking its deficiencies together. A case in point is provided by the Economic and Social Council  which is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations. According to the Charter  the Council should give policy impetus to economic negotiations throughout the United Nations system. It should also co-ordinate the activities within the United Nations system in increasingly interdependent sectors. We all know that the Economic and Social Council does not at the moment fulfil this task.81.	Another example in this field is the failure of the international community to launch global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development under the auspices of the United Nations. Today we seem to be further away from this goal than we were five years ago. We should not blame the institution for this situation. The responsibility lies with us  the Members of the Organization. More forthcoming attitudes towards the task of launching global negotiations are called for  in the North as well as in the South  if we are to make progress in this undertaking.82.	Despite these shortcomings and disappointments  we should not forget the fact that within the United Nations system common responsibility in the economic and social sectors is manifested in the field of operational activities for development. United Nations development funds are making a visible contribution to the improvement of the living conditions of people throughout the developing world. The United Nations operational programmes enjoy the support of the international community  although the planned growth rates of those programmes have not been met and the volatility of exchange rates has affected them negatively.83.	As part of its efforts to reach the 0.7 per cent official development assistance target by the end of the decade  Finland will continue to increase its support to multilateral development activities and international humanitarian relief programmes. We will place particular emphasis on the special needs of the least developed countries.84.	In this context  I should like to mention that my Government welcomes the recent establishment of the World Institute for Development Economics Research at Helsinki. We hope that the first affiliated research institute of the United Nations University will fulfil the expectations of the international community by providing new impetus and fresh ideas in this very vital field of research.85.	The Members of the United Nations bear a common responsibility  one which extends beyond the immediate urgencies of today. What we are doing nowâand what we are not doing nowâwill have an effect on our future and on that of our children.86.	Awareness of the dictates of ecology is spreading. The younger generations especially know that there is an exigent interrelationship between the needs of economic development  the resources of the earth and the environment of the human beingâthat our ecosystem is an integrated whole. Those problems cannot be successfully solved by any nation acting alone. They must be addressed by the international community as a whole.87.	Human rights are closely related to peace  security and prosperity in the world. An area of vital concern to the United Nations and to all its Member States is the need to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. It should be recognized that the United Nations and its Members have made great progress in this field  whether defined in terms of political rights  economic  social and cultural rights  action against racism or the general development of the international bill of human rights. The process of developing new international rules in the human rights area continues. I wish to refer in particular to the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which my Government hopes will be adopted by the General Assembly as soon as possible. On the other hand  human rights continue to be widely disregarded and fundamental freedoms are still denied in many parts of the world. We continue to witness unjustified arrests  torture  arbitrary executions  religious intolerance and political persecution.88.	Surveying the implementation of internationally adopted human rights is a major task for the United Nations. It is important that the role of the United Nations be strengthened and further developed in this respect. I would in this context appeal to all Governments to lend their full and constructive co-operation to the relevant United Nations bodies in order to ensure the full enjoyment by all individuals of human rights and fundamental freedoms.89.	War against famine  ignorance  poverty and underdevelopment and the promotion of welfare and a secure future for mankind are the common responsibility of the Members of the United Nations. Let us hope that recognition of this common task will help us to find the way back to co-operation and conciliation even in the political field  where so much at present should be done.90.	The Nordic countries  confirming their strong support for the United Nations and for measures aimed at settling international disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the principles of the Charter  have in recent years examined ways and means of strengthening the United Nations. Nordic endeavours in this field have close connections with the reports of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. The problems facing us and facing the United Nations can be tackled effectively only through close international co-operation and with the necessary determination and patience.91.	The Nordic countries have given particular emphasis to United Nations peace-keeping operations as one of the practical instruments which the United Nations has successfully evolved. Finland attaches great importance to these functions and today has troops and observers in all United Nations peace-keeping operations. We see these operations as an important way in which Member States  including the smaller ones  can contribute effectively to the collective task of peace-keeping and peace making.92.	This year the Organization  in particular the Security Council  has discussed situations which  in various parts of the world  are endangering regional and international peace and security. The Council has in most cases been able to reach a decision on the matter. What is lacking is the will to carry out those decisions. We share the view of the Secretary-General  expressed in his report on the work of the Organization  that the international community cannot condone the disregard of almost all of these decisions by the parties involved in the disputes.93.	In our view  the basic principles of a peaceful settlement of the problem of the Middle East remain immutable.94.	The key to the situation is the Arab-Israeli conflict. Together with other developments in the region  it poses the most persistent threat to peace and security  not only in the region itself but also in the world as a whole. The political  strategic and economic importance of the region transcends the regional confines of the conflict.95.	A comprehensive settlement of the conflict must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel must therefore withdraw from Arab territories occupied since 1967. Acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible. The right of Israel and other States in the area to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be guaranteed. Furthermore  provision must be made for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to national self-determination. This pre-supposes the right of the Palestinians and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  as the most significant representative of their national aspirations  to participate in negotiations on their own future within a comprehensive solution of the conflict.96.	From the internal point of view  the situation in Lebanon seems to be improved even if many of the major problems still remain unsolved. We hope that the national reconciliation will not fail. The territorial integrity  sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries must be strictly respected.97.	The war between Iran and Iraq has entered its fifth year. The loss of human life and waste of resources have reached staggering proportions. My Government welcomes and supports all mediation efforts that may contribute to a peaceful settlement of the war.98.	For nearly 20 years the United Nations has made strenuous efforts to achieve independence for Namibia. Today the prospects of a solution again seem to be improving. The front-line States  together with the South West Africa People's Organization  have shown a constructive spirit to find new ways for dialogue between the parties. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) still remains the basis for a solution of the Namibian question. The Government of Finland does not see any reasons why its implementation is delayed. Any political solution must be based on the holding of free and fair elections. The wishes of the people of Namibia must be fully taken into account in the independence process. The United Nations  with its special responsibility for Namibia  must sustain the pressure on South Africa so as to ensure that the independence of Namibia is achieved without delay.99.	In South Africa the apartheid system remains fundamentally unchanged. This was noted by the Security Council  which recently strongly rejected and declared null and void some of the superficial modifications to the system. Finland unequivocally condemns the system as an abhorrent violation of human rights and human dignity. The need for concerted international pressure on South Africa to change its policies remains. There cannot be any compromise on the principle of the equality of every human being or on the need to have that principle observed in practice. That is why the Security Council must continue its consideration of measures to intensify the pressure on South Africa for change.100.	The situation in Central America remains critical. Finland believes that the solutions to the problems of this region lie in the maintenance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. The States of the region themselves should be given an opportunity to solve their problems free from any outside intervention. To this end  Finland supports the efforts of the Contadora Group for a peaceful  comprehensive solution.101.	The United Nations is the forum for all States to make their contribution to fostering peace  security and well-being in the world. Each State  big and small  should participate in this effort. But in pursuing these ends  not only do nations have their role as Members of the world Organization  the United Nations; they also bear responsibility for peace and security in their own regions.102.	Finland has stable  harmonious relations and fruitful co-operation with all its neighbours. She stays outside the conflicts of interest between the great Powers  she maintains and develops friendly relations with all nations: Finland pursues a policy of neutrality. Finland seeks to promote efforts towards peace and stability in the Nordic region  towards security and co-operation in Europe and in the whole world.103.	The days when a State could pursue a policy independent of all others are long past. We live in a different world  a world of wider  more complex  more challenging responsibilities. They are common responsibilities that must be shared in order to secure peace and prosperity for all peoples of the world."
"50",2365,"FJI",39,1984,"ï»¿Today  Sir  my country celebrates the fourteenth anniversary of its independence and it is a singular pleasure for me to extend to you my delegation's congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It is also a great pleasure to welcome to the Organization  on behalf of my delegation  the 159th Member State  Brunei Darussalam.94.	All Member States have solemnly undertaken to maintain international peace and security and to settle international disputes by peaceful means. Events around the world indicate a drifting away from that undertaking. The list of crises and conflicts is ever increasing. This trend must be checked  and it can be if there is an international resolve to act in the interest of peace. The United Nations resolutions on these crises and conflicts provide ample basis for that kind of resolve and action.95.	A manifestation of the lack of resolve to undertake negotiations and dialogue as a means of settling disputes between States is seen in the upsurge of terrorism and terrorist activities throughout the world. Respect for the rule of law and the principles and rules of international law governing norms of behaviour is of such paramount importance that any deviation or persistent breach of those norms could easily lead to anarchy. The recent incidents of the bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut and the appalling bomb attack on the Republic of Korea's high-ranking officials in Rangoon last year should be condemned by all. For its part  my Government has unequivocally condemned those acts of terrorism and urges all States to contribute to the elimination of such acts.96.	A number of items on our agenda refer to crises. I would like to refer to a few of them. My delegation will no doubt be referring to others in due course.97.	With regard to the situations in Afghanistan  Cyprus and Kampuchea  the international community has repeatedly called for comprehensive political solutions  and we fully subscribe to this. The relevant resolutions of this Assembly call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of those countries. In this connection  we continue to support the determined efforts of the Secretary-General and urge all parties directly concerned to co-operate with him in order to settle those crises.98.	The Korean peninsula remains an area of persistent tension. We continue to support the aspirations of the Korean people to a speedy resumption of the dialogue between North and South in order to settle the Korean question by peaceful means and without any external interference.99.	The question of the Middle East is becoming even more complex. Ever since its inception  the United Nations has sought a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East  but a solution has eluded the Organization to this day.100.	The question of the Palestinian people remains at the core of the Middle East crisis. There will be no durable peace in the Middle East until the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to a homeland  and the rights of all States in the region  including Israel  are assured. To move in that direction  dialogue and negotiations between all the parties directly concerned are essential. But  for them to succeed  conditions conducive to peace have to be created. To this end  the most immediate need is the withdrawal of all unauthorized forces from occupied Arab and Lebanese territories.101.	As a Member of the United Nations  Fiji remains fully committed to doing all it can to contribute within its modest means to the attainment of peace and stability in the Middle East. Our participation in the United Nations peace-keeping operations in Lebanon is a tangible manifestation of this. It would  however  be remiss of me if I did not mention the drain on our limited financial resources as a result of our participation. Other troop contributors also feel the financial strain. Yet this situation would not have arisen if all Member States had met their financial obligations.102.	It is  regrettably  all too clear that serious violations of human rights are taking place in many parts of the world. We  the Members of the Organization  have a special responsibility to take action on violations of human rights wherever they occur and to endeavour to find solutions which can contribute to putting an end to such violations.103.	Nowhere is such violation more flagrant and agonizing than in southern Africa  where the evil policy of apartheid is systematically perpetuated and consolidated. The international community must redouble its efforts to work towards the dismantling of that policy and it must reject categorically the recent so-called constitutional reforms  which  instead of eliminating the policy of apartheid  serve only to consolidate it further.104.	The United Nations has a proud record in the area of decolonization  yet we cannot become too complacent. We must continue to work towards the elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations in various areas of the world. Undoubtedly  our biggest challenge in this area is in southern Africa In defiance of the United Nations and of the global consensus on the urgent need for independence for Namibia  South Africa continues its illegal occupation and exploitation of that country. Fiji is of the firm view that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must be implemented fully and urgently and that attempts to link the independence of Namibia to what is happening in another country must be rejected.105.	In my own region  my Government has followed with close interest and attention the developments in the neighbouring Territory of New Caledonia. At its recent meeting in Tuvalu  the South Pacific Forum leaders took the opportunity to examine closely the situation evolving in that Territory. They welcomed the administrative and land reforms which have been instituted as part of the movement towards the granting of self-determination to the people of New Caledonia and called for further administrative and political reforms in the Territory as a preparatory measure for independence. In calling for those additional measures  the Forum leaders recognized the critical importance of ensuring the active participation of the indigenous Melanesian community in the Territory's educational  vocational and administrative institutions  to facilitate the Territory's early and peaceful achievement of independence.106.	In this regard  Fiji and other members of the South Pacific Forum would welcome an unequivocal affirmation by France of its commitment to the independence of New Caledonia and to bringing this about speedily  in accordance with the wishes of the Territory's entire multiracial population  including especially its Kanak community.107.	If there is a single issue which alarms the world today it is the nuclear-arms race and the threat of a nuclear holocaust. The lack of any real progress in the arms negotiations leading to disarmament and the strained relations between the super-Powers have heightened that alarm.108.	It is true that nuclear disarmament will depend primarily on the nuclear-weapon States  and especially the super-Powers. This forum  however  provides an opportunity for all States to voice their concern. The nuclear-weapon States cannot and should not ignore that concern; the survival of everyone is at stake.109.	It is my delegation's hope that the concern and deliberations in this forum will provide an important and necessary impetus to meaningful negotiations leading to the halting of the arms race and eventually to arms reduction and disarmament by the nuclear- weapon States. It is with that hope that my delegation welcomes the continuing inclusion of items that are pertinent to this issue on our agenda. It is also with that hope that we once again urge the reconvening of the stalled Geneva and Vienna negotiations between the two super-Powers. Without any meaningful agreement  the arms race will continue. Ultimately  the failure to check this unremitting arms build-up and thereby avert a nuclear holocaust will render irrelevant all other issues on our agenda.110.	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is an important security measure and we hope that the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in 1985  will promote positive co-operation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We look to the nuclear-weapon States to demonstrate their good faith in our disarmament efforts.111.	A moratorium on the testing  production and deployment of nuclear weapons constitutes  in my Government's view  the most basic and the most essential element of our disarmament efforts.112.	The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty should continue to have high priority on our agenda. While we are concerned at the lack of progress towards such a treaty  we nevertheless urge the Conference on Disarmament to pursue in all earnestness the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.113.	Apart from the considerations that I have referred to  my Government's concern lies closer to home. One of the major nuclear-weapon States continues to conduct its nuclear testing programme in the South Pacific. This it has done persistently for the last decade now  disregarding the overwhelming opposition and condemnation of my Government and the Governments of our South Pacific neighbours. Needless to say  the nuclear tests carried out in the region pose real threats to our marine environment and our peoples. At their meeting in Tuvalu recently  the South Pacific Forum leaders reiterated their strong opposition to the continuation of nuclear testing by France in our region. We are heartened in this regard by the support of the shared concern expressed in a declaration conveyed to the Secretary- General by the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific  our Latin American South Pacific neighbours.114.	With the combined calls of the Pacific and Latin American countries for the cessation of all nuclear testing in the South Pacific  my Government had hoped that France would abandon its nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Instead  in complete disregard of the feelings of the peoples of the region  France has announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing programme in our region for the next 15 years. In response to this announcement  our Minister for Foreign Affairs  only two days ago  reiterated the strong opposition of my Government. The Minister also made it clear that if the testing is safe  as it is claimed to be  it would be logicalâas it is advisable and expedient for all concernedâto conduct it on European soil.115.	In recognition of the overwhelming desire of our peoples to remain free from the risk of nuclear fallout  the South Pacific Forum leaders have taken a collective decision to work towards the establishment of a nuclear-free zone for the region. Their concern for the safety of their peoples and their environment is also manifested in the position that member countries of the Forum have taken in the ongoing negotiations on a treaty on the development and protection of the natural environment of the South Pacific region.116.	Our commitment and resolve in the South Pacific to protect our environment from nuclear contamination stem from our anxieties and concerns as island peoples. With the limited land area of most island States in the region  our seas and their resources are of overwhelming importance to our survival. We therefore reiterate our request to the United Nations and its agencies for assistance to the small island countries in the South Pacific to enable them to elaborate and implement ocean development policies that will ensure the optimum and rational utilization of their living and non-living resources  for the benefit of their peoples and their region.117.	As a small island developing country  Fiji attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. All-encompassing in its nature and scope  it is in our view one of the very few legal instruments that attempt to redress the inequity of the past  in favour not of one but of all and devoid of partisan doctrine. It was for this reason that we were the first to ratify the Convention  and it is for this reason that we now urge Member States to ratify it so as to bring its provisions into force. When that happens it will represent an important instrument for international co-operation for the economic and social development of all peoples.118.	I conclude by reaffirming my country's support for the Organization. The United Nations remains the only organ through which the international community can address our common enemies of war  colonialism  human rights violations and poverty. Undoubtedly some of its deliberative organs need to be strengthened. Its principles  however  are as valid as ever. Fiji will continue to support those principles."
"51",2411,"FRA",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  I should like to pay a tribute to you  Sir  as President of the General Assembly. Your farsighted opening address matches our own concerns and positions on many points. Through you I should also like to salute the country you represent here  Zambia  and its President  Kenneth Kaunda  a tireless advocate of peaceful evolution in southern Africa.117.	It is an honour for me to lead  for the fifth time  the French delegation to a session of the General Assembly. This session  which welcomes the admission of the 159th Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam  is a noteworthy opportunity also for me to affirm from this rostrum  as did the President of the French Republic at the thirty eighth session and the Prime Minister at the thirty-seventh session the importance France attaches to the building of an international order defined in terms of law and watched over and nurtured by the organs of the United Nations family: the  Security Council  which enjoys permanent decision-making power  as defined in the Charter of the United Nations; the General Assembly  which gives each State the right of political expression; and the specialized agencies  including those of Bretton Woods  whose spheres of jurisdiction have been and will continue to be specified and enlarged as necessity dictates.118.	The duty of the international community  of the United Nations  is to provide a framework  a means of expressing the aspirations of our peoples to justice  security and independence and to try to find answers to the problems that arise among our nations. If the United Nations fails in this task  current conflicts will worsen and others will be added to them; whole regions of the world will become arenas of confrontation. This we know. We also knowâand I will return to this point laterâthat the whole of economic life is threatened by potentially explosive situations that might be catastrophic for some and would spare none.119.	This is another way of saying that my Government once again this year endorses the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization [A/39/1] and wishes to be associated with that veritable manifesto for the multilateralism and universality of the United Nations. We also note the frankness and clear-sightedness of the criticisms that he has deemed it necessary to express of the work of the United Nations itself: his condemnation  for example  of the proliferation of resolutions that go unapplied  or his concern at the ever-growing politicization of a great many technical and economic problems.120.	These preliminary remarks are especially important in view of the fact  which we should have the honesty to recognize  that these past 12 months have not brought much satisfaction to most of the world's peoples. The train of poverty has lengthened as a result of economic deterioration and the contraction of world trade. Natural disasters have at times assumed catastrophic proportions. In another forumâthe Development Committee of the World Bankâmy colleague  the Minister of Cooperation and Development  has described the tragedies of Africa. Think of the legions of refugees driven from their villages  and sometimes their countries  by hunger  fear and the threat of annihilation. Think of the famine and the encroaching desert. It is essential to recognize forthwith that the problems of that continent are priority problems and to underscore the importance of meetings on this subject  from the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  to the debate on the World Bank's interesting special report on Africa.121.	Poverty and decline  which seem to many irremediable  are affecting other parts of the third world also. All too often  and almost everywhere  hope of improvement is fading  expectation of a new development is waning  resignation is setting in  despair is becoming more widespread.122.	In short  I repeat  negative trends seem to me to have cast dark shadows the last few months. At best  there has been stagnation; in general  ground has been lost and the overriding feeling is not optimistic among the weak and the poor  which is to say the vast majority of the world.123.	Things are scarcely better on the political level. There is the impression that nothing is being resolved between East and West. For months the superpowers have refused to talk with each other. One of them sought to make the resumption of the negotiations which were broken off for more than a year subject to preconditions that prejudged the outcome. Advice was given to the closest allies to put their contacts on hold as well. Admittedly  a ray of hope has filtered through at this sessionâthe encouraging news that meetings have finally been scheduled.124.	Elsewhere  wars and the threats of war persist. The bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq continues; the Israeli Arab confrontation shows no sign of abating; the integrity of Lebanon has not been restored; the independence of Namibia is being continually postponed; Cyprus is torn apart; foreign forces in Afghanistan and Cambodia have not been withdrawn; insecurity and the fear of outside intervention still dominate the scene in Central America. The single bright spot is the decision on the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad  a move that should enable the people of that country to shoulder their responsibility fully and to regain their unity  on the initiative of their Head of State.125.	How can we fail to remember  above and beyond the violations of the rights of peoples and States that I have just cited  the increasing attacks on human rights? A id we hear growing and swelling the demand of ever larger numbers of people for justice  freedom and equality. Yes  these past 12 months have been sad and discouraging.126.	In the face of such a situation  which has deteriorated over the yearsâand I am referring particularly to the world economic disorder  which I shall refer to againâthe international community has no right to remain silent. Still less has it the right to remain inactive if it does not wish to dash the hopes of the peoples of the industrialized world  born in the aftermath of the massacres of the Second World War  and the hopes of the developing countries  born in the wake of the great wave of independence.127.	I should now like to review the various items.128.	In the East West confrontation  no one will deny that primary responsibility in the normal course of events belongs to the two superpowers. Therefore  we expect those Powers to re-establish contacts and dialogue.129.	The first objective has to be  as the President of the United States said the day before yesterday  to reverse the arms build-up  particularly the build-up of nuclear weapons  to avoid unleashing a new arms race triggered by the portentous announcement of imminent progress in new technologiesâI am thinking in particular of space technologyâand to revitalize and actively pursue the process of bringing about balanced and controlled arms limitation.130.	Concerned members of the international community can and must contribute actively to such progress. France  for its part  attaches great importance to the Conference on Confidence and Security building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  which should make it possible to restore a certain level of confidence among the countries of Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals  in the field of conventional forces. In any case  my country will be active in the quest for a balance of forces  which is a prerequisite for peace. Its own military nuclear effort will remain exclusively on the level of defensive deterrents. Last year  at the thirty eighth session  speaking from this rostrum  President Mitterrand outlined our position on the various discussions on this subject  namely  the strategic arms reduction talks and the negotiations on intermediate range nuclear forces  which we hope will be resumed at an early date  and our participation in possible nuclear disarmament negotiations  once existing arsenals have been reduced to quite different and less unreasonable proportions and once other conditions have been met. Our position has not changed since then.131.	France also intends to participate actively in international efforts to prevent  under effective monitoring  particularly serious developmentsâI would remind members of our active participation in the discussions on chemical weaponsâand in the efforts to control the new alarming and destabilizing progress in the most disturbing areas of future technology. That is the reason for the initiative taken by France at the recent meetings of the Conference on Disarmament  at Geneva  regarding the use of space for antimissile and anti-satellite activities. It is also the reason for our considerable interest in any initiative on this matter. 132.	France  a loyal partner in the Atlantic Allianceâneed I reaffirm this?ânevertheless retains its freedom of judgement and action. Together with its close partners  it will encourage closer relations among the peoples of Europe  whom history united for centuries and then divided over the course of the last 40 years.133.	The peoples of Europe themselves have indeed the desire  the right and the possibility of contributing decisively to the easing of tensions. Let the right of each to express his own identity and freely to choose his future be recognized and we shall see new ties developing among European countries of different and even opposing ideologies and alliances  because our peoples want to know one another better  to rediscover together the old elements of their common past  to expand economic and cultural ties and to seek occasions for meetings and direct contact among individuals.134.	It is important  moreover  that the differences between the superpowers  the rivalry between East and West  do not prevent the rest of the world from living its life. We are convinced of the importance of nonalignment when it is in keeping with the national will. True nonalignment can and should strengthen international stability. We are determined to help this. My President underscored this point a year ago when he actively took part in the Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the Nonaligned Countries held in New York from 4 to 7 October 1983 and organized by the President of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  Prime Minister of India. Members will have noted that relations between my country and the nonaligned countries have increased and gained in trust and depth over the past few years.135.	The desire to affirm the identity of each quite naturally includes systematically encouraging the expansion of relations among neighbours  thus furthering regional cooperation. France  which has known so many wars with its neighbours over the centuries  has rediscovered the close friendship that is only fitting with its great German neighbour. It has embarked irreversibly on the construction of the European Community in all areasâcommercial  economic and political It has found in that entity a greater strength and a better potential for hearing what is happening in the world and for being heard in it. In this way  France confirms and strengthens its capacity for independence.136.	What France wishes and accomplishes for itself and its neighbours it also wishes for all others in the world. Every time a possibility of regional organization appears  my country will support it  regardless of the location. Members should not be surprised  therefore  at our commitment to the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  the League of Arab States and also  farther from Europe  ASEAN  the Andean Pact countries  and others.137 Quite naturally also  cooperation among regions should be encouraged. This is one way to advance relations between neighbouring countries while still preserving the real independence of all  even the weakest among them and those experiencing a period of difficulty or needing external aid at this time. Members must not think that the second Lome Convention linking the 10 member States of the European Community to 65 African  Caribbean and Pacific countries is the result of mere chance  any more than is the meeting to be held at San Jose the day after tomorrow which is to bring together the 10 member States of the European Community  the two candidates for admissionâSpain and Portugalâand the five countries of Central America in the presence of the four countries that are members of the Contadora Groupâand I could give many other examples. This is a well-thought-out policy.138.	In the global context  it is possible to trace the main lines of the action that my Government finds desirable in the face of today's major issues.139.	First of all  I should like to refer to the subject of warfare  and above all where there has been the greatest bloodshed in the past two yearsâI mean  between Iran and Iraq. The repeated appeals of the United Nations  and particularly the resolutions of the Security Council  must be heeded by the two belligerents and not just by one of them.140.	The use of inhumane weapons should be renounced so as to spare the civilian populations. A tribute should be paid to the Secretary General for his efforts and the initial results he has obtained. Everything possible must be done to bring about a return to the customary freedoms in that region  particularly freedom of navigation. In this way  progress will be made towards ending this terrible connect  which will cease to have a raison d'etre once the parties return to the borders recognized by the international community and once the issues in dispute can  for the most part  be dealt with at the negotiating table.141.	Elsewhere  there are grave tensions that could lead to war: I am referring to Cyprus  for example  whose sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity cannot be called into question. We are encouraging the Secretary General in his noteworthy efforts.142.	I am also thinking of Central America. The Central American countries should be encouraged to settle their mutual disagreements through a series of discussions and arrangements among themselves  in accordance with the principles set forth in the revised Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America  with all interference in internal affairs and all outside intervention rejected. The political forces should thus be able to voice their own opinions and the republics of Central America should be helped finally to overcome economic and social situations that are a legacy of the past. Threats and aggression are no longer acceptable.143.	I am also referring to peoples that have been divided  the heroic people of Korea  for example. Over the centuries they have asserted their identity and unity only to find themselves subsequently drawn by war into an intolerable division  while in fact they have a right to unity. We hope the Koreans will soon sit among us as other peoples do.144.	Then  there are places where human rights are violated by outside intervention or constraints  by the unwanted occupation of foreign troops: in Afghanistan  where armed intervention by foreign forces increases as resistance by the people increases; in the Middle East  where the Palestinian people are suffering and despair of seeing their rights recognized  of knowing at long last the homeland which will be theirs; where the State of Israel  for lack of guaranteed securityâwhich is its inalienable rightâ within the borders that have been recognized by the international community  pursues a policy incompatible with the indispensable recognition of the rights of the other peoples of the region; where Lebanon  which has already suffered so much  is unable to secure respect for the Security Council resolutions concerning the southern part of its territory and to obtain an end to all foreign presence; in southern Africa  where Council resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibian independence  continues to be disregarded  even defied  while the war continues in Angola  with the presence and participation on that territory of South Africa's army; in Western Sahara  whose people have a right to self-determination; in Cambodia  that country of a great and ancient civilization  bled white by appalling genocide and now occupied by its neighbours to the east.145.	What horrors these clear violations of the rights of peoples and States have entailed! And all too often these violations go hand in hand with scorn for human rights  with the negation of fundamental values that should be the basis of any society  as the Charter of the United Nations has recognized and affirmed.146.	France will speak out  will voice its condemnation  will take action wherever the lives and dignity of individuals are threatened  wherever people are held in constraint and deprived of their basic freedoms. It will continue to express its reprobation everywhere  with the same words and the same conviction. This pledge holds true for Governments and countries that are very different from one anotherâfrom the countries that signed the Helsinki Finn Act to the countries east and south of Africa and on the South American shores of the Pacific. Everywhere we shall strive to alleviate suffering and obtain the freedom of those who are unjustly imprisoned  those whose names are known and stand as symbols  from Shcharansky to Mandela and the countless others who are anonymous expiatory victims.147.	The United Nations deserves support and a tribute on this level: the Commission on Human Rights; conventions that are constantly being refined and improved on; resolutions condemning racism and discrimination. It is also beginningâand I welcome thisâto stress the global nature of the problem  by opening debate on economic and social rights and thereby moving  in conditions that France finds right and opportune  towards an enlargement of the definition of fundamental human rights. Such progress of law at the world level deserves constant encouragement.148.	But there are other serious threats to fundamental human rights that have to be considered. We must ask ourselves why the current world economic crisis is so serious and our market economy system powerless to contend with that crisis and resolve the economic disorder that has prevailed in the world for a number of years now.149.	After 1945  a certain economic order governed the industrialized world. There was monetary order  agreed upon at Bretton Woods; although it was  of course  threatened when the dollar left the gold standard  order nevertheless persisted and exchange parities were relatively stable. There was budgetary order; the industrialized countries made every effort to balance their budgets. There was a degree of predictability in the prices of raw materials. There was order in tradeâadmittedly  largely fuelled by the needs of reconstruction after the massive destruction of the war and the population growth that immediately followed it. All these elements of order opened the door to a category of society that in the nineteenth century was called the proletariatâin other words  the most underprivileged in the industrialized countriesâand  since then  the developing countries.150.	It seemed that growth was assure and would go on forever. Countries that had untapped or inadequately developed resources in the world decidedâquite rightlyâto equip themselves to exploit their wealth. They invested in people. Hundreds of thousands of young persons were sent off to receive higher education; infrastructures were developed; business capital was increased.151.	In all our countries in Europe and in the third world  a larger production apparatus emerged  accompanied by more onerous administrative  economic and social structures. This was achieved at the price of a high level of indebtednessâa level justified  however  in a period of seemingly assured growth and when borrowing was carried out in predictable and reasonable conditions. At the same time  especially in countries that were still largely rural  a trend towards urbanization led to the migration of hundreds of thousands of peasants  who settled in urban communities where the future seemed to lie in industrial production and the service sector. All this seemed rational and reasonable.152.	Then  suddenly  the game changed: the markets of the industrialized countries  having reached the saturation point  closed up. There was no longer any expansion. Countries  including France and others in the industrialized world  which had had a labour shortage for a number of years suddenly had an excess labour force and unemployment.153.	At the same time  disorder had set in: monetary disorder  with its corollary of sizeable fluctuations in exchange rates; budgetary disorder  with huge deficits forcing States to turn to the financial markets; and the dizzying climb of interest rates. The Bretton Woods system had disappeared  and quite naturally the most economically powerful country irresistibly attracted the world's liquidities; its currency  the dollar  soared while its interest rates increased under the effect of the budget deficit.154.	The market economy world became chaotic and unpredictable. A  the same time  growth ceased everywhere. The effects of the current remarkable recovery in the United States have still not changed the direction of this development. Markets saturated elsewhere are no longer able to absorb additional purchases; indeed  many markets are actually deteriorating from year to year.155.	For the third world  this development has beenâand I shall not mince wordsâcatastrophic: the more a country's economy advanced  the mere serious the phenomenon. Such countries had counted on economic growth; they were thus deprived of the whole apparatus needed for amortization  at a time when nothing was generating the necessary resources for his. The surpluses of the oil producing countries have disappeared. In other developing countries  debt has climbed to its current levels: $700 billion for the third world as a whole  $350 billion for Latin America.156.	Debt servicing had become intolerable burden  since there was no longer any growth in revenue. Higher interest rates only exacerbated the situation. Since 1982 in every country in Latin America  debt servicing  had it been undertaken without any adjustment  would have far exceeded the total liquidity accumulated in the reserves. At that point  a reversal set in. The gross domestic product fell. Imports declined drastically  by 60 per cent in some countries in the space of three years. Consequently  the industrial countries were themselves affected  especially those that depend very much on their relations with the third world  as is the case of France. The negative growth in the third world has thus been an important factor in the increase of unemployment in the industrialized countries. The purchasing power of our countries declined abruptly as a result. The vicious circle of depression and deflation was complete.157.	What  then  have been the responses?158.	International organizations have found palliativesâthat is  means of responding immediately to immediate problems  and they deserve great praise for this. They have found answers even as the major international banks have been endangered  with the total of precarious debt far exceeding their capital.159.	answers have been found for the short term  and  more rarely  for the medium term. The Paris Club has examined the cases of 25 countries in 18 months. The quid pro quo of this rescheduling had to be the adoption of strict and rigorous policies  which the IMF has defined with the remarkable professionalism that is characteristic of it. It has dealt with 45 countries.160.	The third world countries concerned accepted the measures imposed with great courage. For the most part  they indicated their determination to go ahead with monetary adjustments  to accept realistic pricing for services and foodstuffs  to freeze wages  to increase taxes  to fight capital outflows. In short  they accepted tremendous suffering for their peoples in acknowledgement of pledges that had been made and were to be respected. Shall we recognize sufficiently the courage it took in each country and in meetings such as those at Cartagena in June and at Mar del Plata this month?161.	What has been the price of this? First of all  the creation of a disinflationary phenomenon which reduces singularly an essential element of world growth; secondly  the imposition of the sacrifice of ambitions and the abandonment of policies that leaders considered and presented as the way to ensure greater justice; and  lastly  an increase in the number of the jobless.162.	But the hundreds of thousands of men and women who migrated to towns lost the protection of the rural world without finding a new system of security in exchange. Without jobs  what will become of these uprooted people? Does this not spell hopelessness for generations of young people? It was reasonable to bank on growth and development; yet now this wager has generated trouble  doubt and danger.163.	This approach has settled nothing  for without development why should the future be any improvement on the present? Postponing the due date of a debt in the hope that tomorrow the debtor country will be in a better position to service it is meaningless unless between today and tomorrow there is growth  development  increased income and an improved repayment capacity.164.	But the evolution over the past two years has tended to discourage investment: interest rates are high  exchange rates are unstable  the banks that provided most of the financing have lost confidence. In 1983  for the first time  the net flow of capital towards the South was negative. No further comment is necessary.165.	Meanwhile  the international meetings that have followed one on the heels of another have at best succeeded in providing a timid analysis of the phenomenonâthe sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983; the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna last August. International assistance funds are declining in real value: the replenishment of aid is inadequate; UNDP has had to cut back on its commitments. France stands out as an exception because we have increased official development assistance over the past three years; we are alone or almost alone in this.166.	I know that the description is a bleak one and perhaps it will be considered exaggerated. However  we must look to the future. For the past two years  a favourable line of thought has been emerging; in all the industrialized countries and in all the countries of the third world  the same analysis has appeared.167.	Whatever sets off the concern or the criticismâinterest rates  indebtedness  budget deficit  monetary instability  lack of liquidity  difficulties for the banksâthe reasoning is global. We know it must encompass all subjects  for they are linked  and it concerns all countriesâinterdependence is complete. We also know  howeverâand this was underscored at the London Economic Summit of the seven industrialized countries  held in London last Juneâ that each country  each case  has its own specific characteristics. Thus  a global analysis is coupled with specific ways of utilizing the means. There is now a remarkable community of views as far as the analyses and reasoning are concerned. This should give us a chance to activate and mobilize powerful economic forces.168.	What should be done? Obviously  I shall not give a simple answer. The problem is too serious and too complex for a single answer. Action is called for in several areas.169.	We must first try to replace the current disorder by a more stable and predictable situation  particularly in the areas of currency and raw materials. We must rebuild an international economic order.170.	In the monetary field  as my colleague  the Minister of the Economy and Finance  pointed out once again in Washington a few days ago  we must be able to act on interest rates. This is asserted by everyone in every part of the world. Their level is a major obstacle to recovery. Real interest rates have never been so high; they must return to reasonable levels. Therefore  we must attack the root cause  namely  the excessive deficit in Government spending  which leads to a destabilizing public drain on the financial markets.171.	Actions over a longer term are also called for in order to lay the foundations of genuine international monetary reform  as the President of my country emphasized at length at the 1983 meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. This does not mean going back to the Bretton Woods agreements  which reflected another period  but greater stability and reasonable predictability of exchange rates must be ensured. The European Community has largely succeeded in achieving this with the European Monetary System  and we believe that it is also possible within a triad of the dollar  the yen and the European currency unit [ECU].172.	I shall not dwell on the subject of raw materials  although it is an essential one. It is true that prices have experienced a certain upward movement but they remain erratic  and the lack of predictability has awesome consequences for the rationalizing of the supply demand relationship and for the ability of the producer country to forecast the pace of its development through self-financing. So we must continue to organize these markets by drawing up new agreements in instances where these are economically feasible; by renewing existing agreements and making them more effective; and  lastly  by establishing the Common Fund for Commodities already agreed to by more than 75 countries.173.	Once some order has been re-established  efforts will have to be made to consolidate the financial recovery of the most heavily indebted developing countries  which are also often those with the most promising future  otherwise they would not have found a lender.174.	The emergency solutions so effectively implemented by the IMF must be complemented by and coordinated with more far-reaching action. The London Economic Summit of the industrialized countries  like the meeting of Cartagena of Latin American countries  emphasizedâcorrectly  in our viewâthe need for better integration of debt rescheduling plans in the medium term. This means defining plans for adjustment over a reasonably long period and coordinating them with rescheduling operations over a period of several years. It also means strengthening joint action by the IMF and the World Bank in order to ensure a better relationship between adjustment and development. In this way  austerity and growth will be linked. The economic effects of action of this kind will be coupled with the psychological effects of renewed hope among those bearing the unavoidable burden of the disciplines adjustment imposes.175.	Of course  these organizational efforts will be really valuable only if sufficient resources are channelled to the developing countries to finance economically sound projects and developments  thus giving a new stimulus to growth. This means making use of all sources of financing.176.	Concerning official development assistance  bilateral and multilateral assistance must at last reach the level the United Nations has called for  of which I have already spoken. The funds provided by the international community should approach the volume recommended by those responsible in this area. It is heart-breaking that the seventh replenishment of the IDA is limited to $9 billion  while the big contributors were almost unanimous in accepting $ 12 billion. The IFAD and the other programmes of the United Nations and its family must be funded  as must the regional development banks  whose activities are worthy of attention. The special fund for Africa  already mentioned  should have priority in this respect. France pledges a special contribution once this fund has been set up.177.	The adoption of such policies by Governments and by the international community should help restore confidence and revive the potential for action by the banking sector. In fact  anything that can encourage public and private investment in the third world is a step in the right direction  it being understood that the recipient countries are entitled to set the main guidelines for such investment.178.	Concerning shorter-term flows  in particular capital from commercial banks  the private sector must be encouraged to maintain and consolidate these flows. This is in their own interest and they must be convinced of this. No pressure  no outside incentive can replace confidence. Private flows will be permanently ensured and consolidated only if confidence is re-established in the determination to build sound bases and in the prospects for debtor country stability and development. The agreements recently signed with some countries testify to this.179.	Such confidence should also be easier to rebuild if international and governmental public financing institutions  in particular the IMF and the World Bank  are able to assist. In this respect  we must extend and develop co-financing that associates private funds and funds from international organizations. In this way  the international structure can act as a catalyst to mobilize capital brought together by the banking circuit. Private and public funds are closely associated.180.	Let it be quite clear that these arguments are presentedâand I say this unashamedlyâin the interest of all. Some time ago I spoke of a planetary ""New Deal."" What was President Roosevelt's gamble when he came to power? He put his money on a recovery stimulated by the weakest elements of society  through the resulting expansion of the market. Time proved him right. Of course  it is always hard  not to say deceptive  to make a transposition when two situations are so different. However: the problem facing us today is similar to the one that faced him. We must inject new hope  or discipline will be painful; we must find means of stimulating recovery that will not condemn the weakest but that will  rather  make use of their capacities for progress. Is a worldwide ""New Deal"" possible? I want to believe it is.181.	I owed it to representatives here present to provide this very broad overview  for I am standing at the rostrum of an assembly whose responsibility is global  covering the whole world  from north to south and from east to west  dealing with all aspects of human activityâpolitical  economic and social. I have thus outlined some of the principles that guide my country's policy. We have reaffirmed them on many occasions; we will continue to do so with the calm and the confidence that arise from our convictions.182.	France's foreign policy is guided by a few simple underlying principles. It serves essential values  values that since the appearance of the first individual have put mankind at the centre of the efforts of every civilized society and every society aspiring to be civilized  values that consequently acknowledge the rights of peoples and thus the rights of nations  values  lastly  that cry out that peace is possible through the balance of forces in a climate of free expression and through a search for progress for all.183.	France intends to uphold these principles in close cooperationâindeed  in conjunctionâwith its partners in the European Community  for we believe that the consolidation of that Community is an important element for our part of the world  a factor in the prosperity and peace of the world as a whole.184.	This hope will have a genuine chance only if  all over the earth  individuals respect each other's diversity  if they examine their difficulties together  if they try to build international order together and  to that end  together adopt appropriate rules of law. Thus  I close as I began  by reaffirming our commitment to the United Nations  our Organization  and by thanking you  Mr. President  and you  Mr. Secretary General  for the orientations you have given us from the very beginning."
"52",2481,"GAB",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me to extend to you  Mr. President  on behalf of the Gabonese Government and people  as well as on behalf of Mr. Omar Bongo  President of the Republic  the warmest congratulations of the Gabonese delegation on your unanimous election to preside over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You are a worthy son of Zambia  a friendly country with which Gabon has the most brotherly relations  and your election does us honour. You have earned the admiration and support of the international community as represented here by your unswerving dedication to the principles of the self- determination and independence of peoples and your personal contribution to the efforts to bring about lasting world peaceâparticularly peace in southern Africaâand the independence of Namibia  notably in your capacity as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia.120.	I should like to include in these congratulations Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  for the way in which  as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  he conducted our work. His constant availability and the qualities he demonstrated in fulfilling his responsibilities  despite his difficult and important duties  enhanced his personal reputation and his country's prestige.121.	In the same vein  the exemplary dedication to duty and the pragmatism of the Secretary-General guarantee that the questions submitted for our consideration  no matter how sensitive  will be tackled with the determination needed to find solutions to them in the appropriate framework and through negotiation.122.	Finally  I take this opportunity to welcome most cordially the sovereign State of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th State to become a Member of the Organization. I pay a whole-hearted tribute to the delegation of that country  and to the delegations of all the other States that champion the noble ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.123.	Once again  we are gathered here to discuss the major problems of our time and together to seek ways and means to help strengthen international peace and security and consolidate multilateral cooperation in a way more in keeping with reality. The climate of generalized insecurity which we are experiencing  compounded by a frenzied arms race  indeed demands that peace and detente be given a new chance. It is m this context that the Gabonese delegation  going along with the general consensus  supports all efforts to enhance the Organization's effectiveness and enable it better to discharge its primary responsibilities  namely  the maintenance of peace based on justice  on the one hand  and the contribution of all to the strengthening of international security  on the other.124.	Respect for the Charter and the relevant resolutions that we have adopted here is naturally part of those concerns. We must encourage all States Members  and particularly the major Powers  to turn this political will of theirs into reality  that is  to have recourse  as required  to one of the fundamental principles of the Charter  namely  dialogue  which is the primary tool for the settlement of conflicts  which the Gabonese Government has chosen as the backbone of its foreign policy. It is on the basis of that conviction that I should like to revert to and stress some issues to which Gabon attaches the utmost importance and to the settlement of which we would like to make our modest contribution.125.	First  disarmament. It is essential to pursue relentlessly the quest for an open dialogue and full co-operation between the two blocs in order to reduce tensions and establish a climate of confidence which is now lacking. Detente  a sine qua non of the maintenance of peace  should be part of a world-wide system of peaceful coexistence  encompassing all regions of the world and all aspects of State relations. It must be based on respect for territorial integrity and the political independence of all States  non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of force. To achieve a lasting peace  detente must also be sought in the context of a universal effort to achieve general and complete disarmament. All the more so since  at the thirty-eighth session  the General Assembly adopted resolutionsâwe shall not mention them all hereâwhich have the virtue of showing quite clearly the links that exist between disarmament and development. That is the cast with regard to resolution 38/71 of 15 December 1983  which establishes a proper relationship between those two ideas. Thus  Gabon whole-heartedly hopes that the various negotiations on the control of armaments will soon lead to specific and positive results making possible the resumption  as soon as possible  of the negotiations that have been suspended.126.	The Gabonese Government also supports certain initiatives which have been put forward from various quarters  particularly those which stress the need to hold an international conference on military expenditures and the different implications of the relationship between ' disarmament and development  such as the initiative taken on 24 September last from this rostrum by the President of the United States who suggested to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the establishment of regular ministerial or governmental meetings between their two countries on those issues.127.	I turn now to the situation in southern Africa. I continue to believe that the attitude of certain States which have important interests in that regionâa mercantile approach which chooses to ignore the inhumane dimension of the policy of apartheidâ cannot fail further to exacerbate tensions between the black and white communities and expose the entire South African society to upheavals that will not be confined to that area alone. That is why Gabon is of the view that a progressive disinvestment of the transnational corporations that operate in South Africa and the halting of all new investment would help bring about a peaceful solution to this problem.128.	As we have done in all our meetings  we have continued to call for strengthening the United Nations role and wish tirelessly to work to achieve respect for the resolutions adopted for the benefit of Namibia. In this connection  Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which provides for Namibian independence and elections to be held under United Nations auspices  must be strictly implemented. South Africa must prove to the international community its desire to put an end to its despicable policy of apartheid and establish with its neighbours and the rest of the world relations based on mutual respect  non-interference and non-intervention. I therefore appeal to the conscience of statesmen who still support South Africa and whose countries have as the very foundation of their constitutions the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and call upon them to promote on a global  non-selective basis those rights wherever they have as yet not been achieved  in particular in South Africa  where the authorities  with reference to the recent constitutional reforms  have elevated discrimination to the level of a governmental system.129.	The double defeat suffered by Pretoria following the sham parliamentary elections organized in August 1984âwhich have been declared null and void under the terms of Security Council resolution 554 (1984)  confirmed a few days ago by the General Assembly at this sessionâbecomes a warning and seems to us to constitute both encouragement and a guarantee of the justness of the heroic attitude of the black population.130.	The Gabonese Government takes this opportunity to reaffirm its staunch opposition to this new strategy  which is now dividing the South African community into antagonistic classes. Gabon believes that that strategy cannot ever be a proper solution for the problems existing in that part of our continent. Therefore  my delegation supports and will always support the position that only the total eradication of the system of apartheid by means of sustained international pressure will enable us to overcome this tragic situation that victimizes the black majority.131.	Still with reference to Africa  I wish to mention two cases of conflict of particular concern to my delegation. I am speaking of Chad and Western Sahara. Without reverting to the efforts already made in the past by the Gabonese Government and  more specifically  by President Bongo for the settlement of those two conflicts  I should like once again to voice the hope that an African and peaceful solution will be found. We can therefore most solemnly reaffirm here the role to be played by the OAU  which in our view is the appropriate place for the various parties to these conflicts to meet around the negotiating table. Gabon whole-heartedly hopes that the African continent may become a haven of peace and security and we will always support all initiatives to this end.132.	Other hotbeds of tension in the world continue to be a source of concern for us. In the Middle East  first of all  the Gabonese Government is convinced that a settlement that would not take into account the deeply felt aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be a lasting one. In this connection  we reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to a peaceful existence and to remain permanently within secure and recognized boundaries  like all other peoples in the region. Once again  we call upon the Government of Israel to put an end to its settlements policy in the occupied territories  a policy that is endangering the chances of an overall settlement of the conflict.133.	Iraq and Iran continue to wage a war which has grave consequences not only for their populations but also for the very security and balance of that part of the world. The Gabonese Government supports the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary- General to help those Iwo fraternal countries to engage in an effort at de-escalation of that war. We again renew a pressing appeal to the two sides to cease hostilities immediately and begin a dialogue with a view to achieving a settlement of the conflict  which has lasted all too long already and which clearly serves neither their interests nor those of the other peoples in the region.134.	Finally  as regards Lebanon  a country with which Gabon maintains excellent relations  we wish to express appreciation for the efforts at national reconciliation made by President Amin Gemayel  who has always worked very hard to help his country recover its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Here  the important thing is that all foreign forces should withdraw from the territory.135.	With respect to South-East Asia  and more specifically the situation in Kampuchea  Gabon reaffirms its support for the principles of territorial integrity  sovereignty and the inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations. All States of the region must embark upon a dialogue leading to a settlement of their disputes and the establishment of lasting peace and stability  as well as the elimination of interference  threats of intervention and the hegemonistic designs of outside Powers.136.	Concerning the Korean peninsula  I should like also to stress that Gabon is following with special interest the development of the situation and we remain committed to the idea of a negotiated solution designed to bring about the peaceful reunification of the two countries.137.	Finally  my delegation favours a political settlement of the question of Afghanistan on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops  full respect for its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and strict observance of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference.138.	We cannot examine the hotbeds of tension which in our times are threatening world peace and security without mentioning the disturbing events in Central America and the Caribbean. Gabon believes that  despite the progress achieved recently by the Contadora Group and the five countries of Central America through the adoption of the document stating the objectives worked out in Panama  the situation in Central America continues to be a matter of concern and we believe that we must put an end to it on the basis of the universally recognized principles we have just mentioned and  in particular  dialogue. Better understanding among all peace-loving men largely depends on this.139.	It was on the basis of this same spirit of dialogue  understanding and rapprochement among peoples bound by the same culture and ideals that our Head of State undertook the felicitous initiative of proposing to his counterparts in Central Africa the establishment of the International Centre for Bantu Civilizations  grouping together some dozen countries for the benefit of 170 million people. I take this solemn opportunity to pay a tribute to all the institutions and men of good will that worked to ensure the creation of this organization on 8 January 1983 by signing its constitution.140.	The gravity of the international economic situation is of no less concern to us than the political questions we have just mentioned. Indeed  the serious recession which has so severely stricken all countries  in particular those of the third world  and the difficulties faced by our countries at the present time are a source of great concern  inasmuch as the survival of our populations hinges on their solution. Thus  for the developing countries  the hope of a new international economic order is an earnest guarantee of better control over the world economic system based on the observance of major imperatives  without which there cannot be any improvement in relations between rich and poor countries.141.	Thus  for the delegation of Gabon  solidarity is the only asset that can truly reconcile the interests of the international community as a whole.142.	The political and economic interdependence of the world in which we live indeed implies that we must manage the world as a single entity for the benefit of mankind as a whole. What else could we do when we know that one of the tasks entrusted to us by the Organization is precisely that of preparing a better world for future generations? And yet we must say that the way current economic relations are developing does not show a will on the part of some countries to fulfil this task.143.	In this regard  I should like to stress the gravity of the current economic situation  characterized in particular by the instability of the prices of commodities  which has disastrous consequences  such as fluctuations in the export earnings and deficits in the balance of payments of the poorer countries.144.	We must therefore emphasize the dimensions of the present threat to world trade  which is steadily shrinking because of the deterioration in the terms of trade and the instability of international liquidity. We must therefore seek ways and means to undertake an in-depth realignment of international economic structures so that the developing countries may be able  because of the quality  diversity and competitiveness of their products  to ensure their exports and thus obtain the financial resources they need for their growth and harmonious development.145.	Moreover  the problem of the indebtedness of the third world countries appears day by day to be a serious matter for concern  reflecting the extent of the difficulties facing this category of countries.146.	The paralysis of most third world economies causes us to argue in favour of a new definition of policies of development assistance. The success of such policies depends not only on the necessary coordination of efforts by the various partners but also on a better adaptation of the international financial institutions which must administer those policies.147.	The experience of recent years makes it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to organize the appropriate co-ordination between the countries of the North and of the South. The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  reflect better than anything else the lack of the will on the part of the rich countries to reach joint solutions in co-operation with the countries of the third world  especially on such fundamental questions as borrowing rates and industrialization. It is well known that industry in our countries represents only 11.9 per cent of the world economy.148.	Notwithstanding the frequent failure of inter-national economic conferences  Gabon reaffirms its support for the launching of global negotiations  without which the world economy will never really be able to regain its momentum.149.	My delegation therefore believes that the present deadlock in the dialogue between the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world should lead the latter to achieve self-sufficiency and promote the conditions for their internal  self-reliant development  thus making possible genuine  mutually advantageous South-South co-operation.150.	With regard to the strengthening of horizontal co-operation  18 October 1983 has become a memorable date for the countries of Central Africa  because on that day we saw the fulfilment of another initiative of President Omar Bongo: the establishment of the Economic Community of Central African States  covering a vast economic region comprising approximately 60 million people and endowed with immense and diverse natural resources. I have no doubt that the Community will make resolute efforts to permit our States to take control of their economies and thereby improve the living conditions of their populations.151.	All the matters I have mentioned have in common the interdependence of the political  economic and human factors. They also have in common the need for reliable international institutions. That is why  as I have already had occasion to say  the role of the United Nations must be strengthened. All things considered  there is no viable substitute for the United Nations system in our efforts to build a new and better world  even if that system is far from perfect. But what work of man can ever be perfect?152.	That is why Gabon  since its admission to the United Nations  has been grateful to benefit from the work of the Organization and  in its turn  within the limits of its modest resources  has constantly supported United Nations programmes and its efforts to achieve a more peaceful world  a more just world  a better world.153.	With that noble ideal in mind  my delegation remains convinced that the Assembly will devote itself at the thirty-ninth session to strengthening the capabilities of our international system  on whose harmonious functioning peace  security and balance in large measure depend.154.	Developments in international economic relations have not always been satisfactory  and the political situation is shaky  but my country  on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  supports the idea of intensifying international cooperation and believes that our efforts to this end must be encouraged  stimulated and renewed.155.	A few years ago  His Holiness Pope Paul VI rightly declared that ""the new name of peace is development"". If the efforts of the Organization are aimed consistently at that noble objective  our hopes cannot fail to be fulfilled. Buoyed up by those same hopes  the Gabonese delegation is ever ready to co-operate fully with the Assembly so that the work of this session may be truly successful."
"53",2526,"GBR",39,1984,"ï»¿First  may I add my voice to the voices of those who have already congratulated you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.  I wish you every success in conducting its affairs in the months ahead. To the outgoing President  Mr. Illueca  I extend my thanks for the conscientious way in which he discharged his duties. And it is with great pleasure  and some pride  that I congratulate Brunei Darussalam on becoming  on 21 September  the 159th Member of the United Nations.38.	Let me also  at the outset  pay a warm tribute to the Secretary General. His unceasing efforts to bring about the solution of the world's problems continue to win our highest esteem and support.39.	Two years ago  the Secretary General  in his first report on the work of the Organization ' pointed to a crisis of multilateralism. He suggested that the world was ""perilously near to a new international anarchy"". His report this year shows  with customary perceptiveness and honesty  how little progress we have made towards the objectives he set two years ago. The Secretary General has told us frankly what we  the Member States  can doâindeed  have to doâto overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented our achieving the vision of a better world which inspired those who drew up the Charter of the United Nations now almost 40 years ago.40.	At Fulton  Missouri  only a year after the birth of the United Nations  Winston Churchill spoke of the political will needed to tum the fledgling Organization into a practical force for peace. He said:""We must make sure that its work is fruitful  that it is a reality and not a sham  that it is a force for action  and not merely a frothing of words  that it is a true temple of peace . . . and not merely a cockpit in a tower of Babel.""41.	Winston Churchill would certainly have endorsed the profoundly practical instinct that is so evident in the Secretary Generalâs reports. And 1  too  strongly support the Secretary Generalâs latest call for us to ""ask ourselves what useful steps can be taken in a given situation rather than starting by thinking of all the extraneous reasons why they cannot be taken"".42.	For Churchill's insight is as relevant as ever. Effective international cooperation to tackle the world's problems needs more than polished speeches and well drafted resolutions. It needs courage and imagination; above all  it needs a steadfast commitment on the basis of universality to take practical action in pursuit of realistic objectives.43.	Nowhere is that more necessary than in our approach to the problems of the world economy. The annual economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries is a good example of the kind of pragmatic approach to problem-solving I have in mind. Last June the United Kingdom hosted in London the tenth such meeting. We were able to reach a large measure of agreement on the essentials for world recovery. At the same time  we took real account of the difficulties which many countries still face. Despite those difficulties  the past 12 months have brought substantial improvements. Two years ago  world trade actually fell. Last year  it grew only 2 per cent. This year  the IMF has forecast growth in world trade of 8.5 per cent.44.	This recovery has not been confined to the industrialized world. For many developing countries  too  the outlook has improved and is improving further. The current account deficit of the nonoil developing countries is this year expected to be less than half its level in 1981. And this year the growth rate for developing countries should reach 3.7 per cent. This significant improvement has not been achieved without hardship.45.	I pay a tribute to the success adjustment policies pursued by many developing countries  often in the face of real social and political difficulties. These policies need to be sustained and more widely adopted if we are to manage and diminish the problem of international indebtedness  and they need the full support of the industrialized countries. This point has been rightly stressed by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund  Mr. de Larosiere. In his words:""The efforts of developing countries need to be supported by the industrial countries  who have it in their power to create a more robust and dynamic world economy  as well as by concerted action to ensure adequate international financing flows and open trading conditions.""46.	A major cause of the problems of developing countries is the high level of international interest rates. The United States economy has shown how real new employment can be created in a society that is open and willing to face the need for change. But the current size of the United States budget deficit and the high interest rates that go with it still pose a threat to world recovery. We welcome the United States Administration's recognition of the need to tackle the problem. We hope that it will be sustained and carried into action. Lower world interest rates would benefit us all. They would ease the burden of debt repayment. That in turn would allow many countries to increase their imports  and a general increase in trade is in everybody's interest.47.	The world's economic problems can only be solved through cooperation in this spirit of interdependence. Certainly my country is determined to work in close cooperation with debtor nations  case by case  to achieve mutually acceptable solutions to their difficulties. The challenge is to implement practical measures which stand a real chance of success.48.	The British Government has put forward a number of proposals. We discussed them at the London Economic Summit in June. My colleague  the Chancellor of the Exchequer  Mr. Lawson  described them at the IMF meeting in Washington yesterday. He made proposals for the use of multiyear rescheduling  for an enhanced role for the World Bank and its associates  for more private investment in debtor countries and for more stable long-term finance. If carried into practice  these proposals would do much to help the debtor countries. But  without doubt  the greatest contribution would come from sustained and widening recovery49.	The industrialized countries have a special responsibility for helping to spread this recovery beyond their own frontiers. We must be in earnest in our fight to resist and to reduce protectionism. World trade must be revived through open markets. Here too  given the crucial importance of the dollar exchange rate and so of interest rates  the United States has a unique part to play.50.	We have been disappointed that the resources available to the IDA have not been increased as we hoped. This makes it all the more important to undertake a special effort to help the poorest countries  above all in Africa. We cannot ignore the special conditions that have afflicted much of Africa or the Secretary-generalâs plea for support. Special measures are needed for special conditions.51.	The truth is that there are no instant solutions. The need is for common determination to work for solid  often unspectacular  progress on all fronts. Solutions to the economic problems I have described need to be rooted firmly in political reality if they are to endure. I am encouraged by the fact that Governments have been willing to identify practical steps that they can and will take together. That is the main reason why prospects for the world economy are better now than they were a year or two ago.52.	The approach that is working in the economic field applies equally to political relations between States. Here too  there is a need for practical measures to solve real problems. Nowhere is that need more urgent than in East West relationsânot because of what is happening but because of what is not happening  because in this area there has not been anything like the same meeting of minds over the way forward as there has been on economic questions. In his report the Secretary General speaks of ""great Power tension accentuated by a lack of progress in disarmament and arms limitation"". I share his analysis. That is why we need to make a fresh start. President Reagan this week put forward a series of proposals that could lead us in that direction. We must all reject the temptation to identify difficulties with that approach and instead identify the ideas with which we can agree.53.	In the past year  Mr. Gromyko and I have met on no less than four occasions. On each of those occasions  I have been struck not so much by the differences between usâalthough these are real and substantialâas by the similarity of what we say are the basic aims of our peoples. This similarity of underlying approach is reflected in the desire of both sides to break the spiral of the arms race  in our shared aim of better relations between East and West  and often in apparently similar words and phrases. I found myself in complete agreement with the statement of the high level Economic Conference of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  held in Moscow in June that ""no world problemsâand that includes the historic dispute between socialism and capitalismâcan be solved by force of arms"". So what separates us is not so much the words we use as the meaning we attach to them. Our task must be to bridge that gap  to reconcile  in a spirit of mutual understanding  our differing purposes with our underlying interest in our common safety and security.54.	Each side has proclaimed its desire for a more comprehensive dialogue. I refuse to believe that that cannot be achieved. I believe we can find a common way of resolving such issues of supreme importance to us all. In that same speech in Missouri  Churchill called for greater mutual confidence. He said:""There is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britainâand I doubt not here alsoâtowards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences and rebuffs in establishing lasting friendships ...""Forty years later that remains our hope.55.	During 1984 the West has made far-reaching but practical proposals in every arms control negotiation. At Stockholm we have submitted specific measures which would enhance confidence and security throughout Europe. At Vienna we have made I major new proposal to resolve the long-standing disagreement over the level of Eastern forces. At Geneva  Britain has taken two initiatives on verification of a chemical weapons ban  while the United States has submitted a new draft treaty.56.	Against that background I deeply regret the Soviet suspension of the nuclear arms talks. Of all subjects on the East West agenda  the control and reduction of nuclear weapons is by common consent the most important. And yet it is the one aspect of arms control which is not at present the subject of negotiation. The United States has offered to resume these talks  anywhere  at any time  without preconditions. The whole world would applaud a positive Soviet response.57.	So  too  on the question of arms control in outer space. On 29 June  the Soviet Government proposed that talks should begin in Vienna in September. It asked for a prompt response. The Americans gave it  constructively and seriously. But so far the Russians seem to have been unable to take ""yes"" for an answer. Dialogue cannot be a one-way processâstill less  negotiations. No one can converse with an empty chair. I hope the Soviet Union will find the political will to take its place at the table. When it does  it will find the West ready and willing to talk.58.	The negotiations on the future of Hong Kong which the British and Chinese Governments have been conducting since 1982 are an excellent illustration of the way in which difficult issues may be resolved. Earlier today  in Beijing  the two Governments initialled a draft; agreement on the future of Hong Kong. It is a triumph of good sense. It shows how  in the search for solutions to international problems  agreement is only possible with courage  imagination and political will on all sides. Chairman Deng Xiaoping's idea of ""one country  two systems"" is an example of such a positive approach. The people of Hong Kong will wish to judge for themselves the outcome of these negotiations. But already I am confident that we have achieved a historic agreement.59.	Britain also has a special relationship with  and a close interest in  the island of Cyprus. I hope that there  too  we may see early progress in the continuing search for a solution. The Secretary Generalâs current efforts to bring about a resumption of the intercommunal talks must not be allowed to fail. Only thus will a settlement of the wider problem be possible. That is why the British Government supports the Secretary General in his task. We stand ready to do all we can to assist him.60.	I turn now to three troubled regions of the world where failure to resolve the disputes which divide the parties could have grave consequences.61.	In the Middle East  it is deeply disappointing that once again this year we are no nearer a solution of the Arab Israel dispute  but with the arrival of a new Israeli Government there is now an opportunity to turn a new page. The outlines of a just settlement have been clear for many years. It must reconcile Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized borders and the Palestinians' right to self-determination. But plans or statements of principle from the international community are in themselves of limited value unless the parties to the dispute have the political courage to take the bold steps necessary for peace.62.	Such steps are possible now without anyone's security being endangered. The new Israeli Government could halt the policy of installing illegal settlements in occupied territory. The Arab countries and the Palestinians could formulate a realistic and a common negotiating stand before it is too late. The United States has a unique position of influence with parties on both sides of the dispute. Its role is indispensable. President Reagan reaffirmed on Monday his commitment to his country's search for a just and lasting peace. I very much welcome that. As the President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community made clear yesterday fusing]  we and our European partners stand ready to help and to use our influence to work for the peace which has eluded us all so long.63.	In Lebanon  the efforts of the Lebanese Government to bring peace to that country which has suffered so long deserve the support of all of us. The 10 member countries of the European Community have called consistently for the early withdrawal  in agreement with the Lebanese Government  of all foreign forces. The presidency statement yesterday reiterated that plea. In our view  national reconciliation and withdrawal of those forces should go ahead together. UNIFIL has continued to perform a useful role in southern Lebanon  a role whichâas the Secretary General said in Aprilâcould with advantage be enlarged.64.	In the Gulf  we shall continue to support any initiatives which offer hope of an end to the long and tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq. We welcomed the decision to send a United Nations team to investigate allegations that chemical weapons had been used. The British Government condemns unequivocally the use of chemical weapons by anyone. We are encouraged that both sides continue to support the Secretary Generalâs appeal to avoid attacks on civilian centres of population. We hope that they will take further steps to limit the scope of the conflict and that this will prepare the way for an honourable settlement of the dispute.65.	Southern Africa is another area where failure to make progress towards solving disputes could have consequences far beyond the region itself. The events of the past few weeks have amply demonstrated the wider dangers of the present policies of the South African Government. They underline the urgent need for real progress towards a system of government supported by all South Africans. This can be achieved only by dialogue within South Africa and between South Africa and the world at large.66.	Even so  there has been some progress towards reducing tension in the region. In particular  I welcome the wide-ranging contacts between Mozambique and South Africa following the Agreement on Nonaggression and Good Neighbourliness  signed at Nkomati on 16 March 1984. We have also welcomed the agreement between Angola and South Africa  reached at Lusaka on 16 February 1984  on the withdrawal of South African forces from southern Angola. We shall continue to work for further steps towards an early settlement of the Namibian question.67.	In Central America  too  there is a need for concerted action if we are to check the trend towards instability and foster social and political development. The roots of the conflict and political turmoil racking the region are indigenous  but the problems have been exploited and exacerbated by those who care little for regional stability and democratic evolution  preferring to pursue their own political objectives.68.	That is why we were encouraged by the democratic elections in El Salvador this year and why we like our partners in the European Community strongly support the Contadora initiative. I much look forward to the meeting at San Jose next weekend between the Foreign Ministers of the 10 member countries of the Community and Spain and Portugal  and of the Central American and Contadora countries. This will be an important opportunity for us to underline our active interest in promoting and encouraging peace. Our purpose is to make a practical contribution to democracy and development in the region.69.	I must now turn to the relationship between my country and Argentina  whose newly elected President addressed the Assembly on Monday [5th meeting]. Let me stress again that we welcome wholeheartedly Argentina's return to democratic government. We are ready  from that new basis  to try to work towards more normal relations between us after the tragic events of two years ago. We firmly believe that this would be in the interests of Britain  of Argentina  of all our friends in Latin America and of the Falkland Islanders themselves.70.	Of course Britain and Argentina have differentâand deeply heldâpositions on the question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. No one should forget that we were negotiating on that very subject in 1982 when Argentina launched its brutal invasion of the islands. The present Argentine Government was not responsible for that disastrous action  but its consequences cannot just be brushed aside.71.	As I have said  we attach great importance to improving our relations with Argentina  and we have made a genuine and sustained effort to reach agreement with the Argentine Government on a basis for direct talks. It was clear that  if those talks were not to founder at the outset on the very issue that divides us  the question of sovereignty could not be addressed. We therefore needed to find a way of meeting the legitimate requirements of both sides. With the help of the Swiss and Brazilian Governments as protecting Powers and after a great deal of detailed work  a clear and satisfactory basis for talks was achieved and agreed by all.72.	When the talks began at Berne in July  Argentina took a position at variance with this agreed basis. Their representatives insisted that no progress could be made towards normalization without the certainty that a mechanism would be established to permit negotiations over sovereignty. This overturned the very basis on which talks between us had been agreed. The talks therefore came to an end. This was an important opportunity missed. I think that many people will have been disappointed  as I was  that President Alfonsin  in his speech to the Assembly two days ago  presented the same position once again explicitly as a precondition of any talks between us.73.	Let me also underline that there is a further fundamental principle involved in this dispute which cannot be overlookedâthe principle of self-determination. It is a principle which is jealously guarded by the people of Great Britain and  indeed  by every Member of the United Nations. The Falkland Islanders  like any other people  have the right to self-determination. We had hoped that the new Argentine Government  with its attachment to democracy and human rights  would be ready to recognize this fundamental human right of the Falkland Islanders.74.	Those who call on us to negotiate on the sovereignty of the islands should think what exactly it is that they are asking us to do. For Argentina  such negotiations could only have one outcome: the transfer of sovereignty over the islands irrespective of the wishes of the Falkland Islanders. To ask us to do that is to ask us to overturn the principle of self-determination enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.75.	We shall continue with the economic and constitutional development of the Falkland Islands. We shall maintain the minimum level of forces required to defend the islands. Let me emphasize those words  ""defend the islands"". Our military dispositions are designed solely for that purpose.76.	We have sought ways of improving relations with Argentina by tackling practical issues where real progress is possible to the benefit of both sides. It is still my profound belief that  in the difficult circumstances I have described  the only way forward is to find a way of taking such practical steps as will enable confidence to be re-established between our two peoples.77.	The right of peoples to choose their own Government is also at issue in Afghanistan and Cambodia. The outside world has little idea of the suffering which the Afghan people endure. We cannot ignore the harsh realities of the problem  which my Irish colleague  Mr. Barry  has already described [6th meeting]. We give our full support to the efforts of the Secretary General  which are seeking to ensure that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and successive United Nations resolutions shall be applied to restore an independent and nonaligned Afghanistan. This cannot happen until Soviet forces are withdrawn.78.	In Cambodia  the Vietnamese occupying force remains  despite the resolutions passed by an overwhelming majority in recent years calling for a complete withdrawal. The British Government continues to support the Cambodian people's right to determine their own destiny  free from outside interference.79.	The continued division of the Korean peninsula has been a matter of concern much longer than the occupation of Afghanistan and of Cambodia. My visit to Panmunjom earlier this year reminded me of this sad fact. The British Government remains convinced that the suggestions put forward by the Republic of Korea for direct talks between the two sides represent the best prospect for a peaceful solution.80.	There is one final region of the world I should mention  although it is not one much visited by Foreign Ministers. This year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty/ The Treaty is a remarkable example of political foresight. It provides an excellent model of practical cooperation achieved through international agreement. The fact that a further four States have acceded to the Treaty in this anniversary year shows its continuing value. The British Government would not wish to see any development that would undermine this important Treaty.81.	We discuss many global and regional political issues in this Hall. But when we do so it is easy to forget the fundamental reality of the freedom and wellbeing of the individual. The architects of the Charter of the United Nations were quite clear about this. They set down  as a major purpose of the Organization  to achieve cooperation ""in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion"". The gulf between this intention and the gross abuses of human rights which still occur in so many parts of the world appals me. These abuses are sometimes carried out in the name of political  social or religious ideologies  and indeed by some of the leading signatories of the Helsinki Final Act/ Sometimes such abuses result from conditions of anarchy and chaos. My Government deplores them all  wherever they occur and whatever the reason with which their perpetrators may attempt to justify them.82.	A particularly gross form of abuse of the most fundamental human rights of allâthe rights to life and libertyâis terrorism. The horrifying events in Beirut last week served as a grim reminder of this growing evil. Terrorist acts may often be the work of small groups of crazed fanatics. But more and more they have had the material backing of a few misguided Governments. As the Secretary Generalâs report [A139/1] makes clear  there has been a steady increase in politically motivated violence in all its baleful forms. Few areas of the world have been spared. As so often  it is innocent men and women who pay the price for this assault on the basic values of civilized society. Indiscriminate murder for the furtherance of political ends is wholly unacceptable. We must resist it with every legitimate means available to the international community.83.	The growing involvement in terrorism by Governments and their representatives abroad has brought to light another urgent problem: the abuse of diplomatic immunity. This is something which must deeply concern us all. Many representatives know that my Government is reviewing the working of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. We are seeking ways to tighten control of unacceptable activities by members of diplomatic missions. The Convention has  generally speaking  performed useful service for over 20 years. Its underlying principles have for centuries stood the test of application between sovereign States of widely differing character. What is lacking is determination on the part of signatory States to apply rigorously enough the safeguards and sanctions it contains. The Declaration on International Terrorism  issued at the London Economic Summit  held from 7 to 9 June 1984 and the measures agreed by the European Community a6 Dublin earlier this month are evidence of how  given the political will  States can swiftly take practical action to deal with international problems.84.	Let me in conclusion return to the theme with which I began. In speaking today of all the global and regional problems which confront us  I have many times referred to the need for realistic solutions and for a practical approach. I do so out of profound personal conviction  a conviction that is continually reinforced by my experience in political life in my own country and in international affairs. Put simply  it is this. None of the disputes and disagreements before us is of its essence insoluble. In many cases  we can already envisage the outline of a solution. In almost every case  what is needed  and what is missing  is political willâabove all  the political will to work for practical agreement  to have the courage  imagination and dogged determination to negotiate in a rational and realistic fashion. Often  perhaps in most cases  that will mean the pursuit of limited  but attainable  objectives. Such an approach is a gradual one  demanding the steady creation of confidence between the parties. It will imply the breaking down of issues into manageable proportions  and it will require a spirit of understanding which takes account of the political and economic realities on both sides of the argument.85.	Such an approach puts a discount on ringing declarations of intent and on uncompromising statements of minimum objectives. But it places a premium on steady  perhaps unspectacular  negotiation  often in private  and when it pays dividends  it pays handsomely. I said earlier that the British and Chinese Governments had initialled a historic agreement on the future of Hong Kong. But it is more than that. The agreement itself and  perhaps even more  the process by which it was achieved are powerful symbols of the way in which seemingly intractable problems can indeed be susceptible to treatment. And that  Mr. President  is the prescription which I end by offering you this afternoon."
"54",2597,"GHA",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the Provisional National Defence Council and the people of Ghana  I bring you warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is indeed a tribute to your personal qualities and your outstanding contribution to the cause of freedom in Africa. It is also an honour for your country and for Africa as a whole.59.	I should like to take this opportunity also to express the gratitude and appreciation of my delegation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  for the skill  fair-mindedness and wisdom with which he conducted the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly.60.	Ghana is particularly proud and happy to welcome Brunei Darussalam as a new Member of the United Nations. This addition to our number not only enhances the universal character of the Organization but also reinforces the principles of self-determination and independence  which are basic to the Charter of the United Nations.61.	It is indeed because of our unflinching commitment to those principles that we cannot countenance the continued denial to the people of South Africa and Namibia of their inalienable rights to the enjoyment of political freedom and human dignity. The racist regime's undisguised ambition to play the totally unacceptable role of a regional super-Power in southern Africa should be recognized as the driving force behind its brutal terrorism against its neighbours. We would be untrue to ourselves if we failed to observe this fact. The destabilization of the frontline States through terror and oppression and the indiscriminate killing of defenceless women and children in villages across southern Africa is the direct result of South Africa's determination to maintain its policy of racism and its system of apartheid.62.	Those who had given apartheid South Africa the benefit of the doubt must have realized in recent months that  even after the Agreement on Non- Aggression and Good Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa signed at Nkomati on 16 March 1984  the people of Mozambique continue to suffer from acts of terrorism perpetrated by the so-called National Resistance Movement  a movement financed and equipped entirely by South Africa. Now an even more dangerous situation has been created for the liberation struggle in southern Africa by the reported cease-fire arranged by racist South Africa between Mozambique and the dissident National Resistance Movement.63.	We therefore now expect that the international community  particularly those States which claim to have influence with Pretoria  will recognize this fact and adopt such policies in support of the United Nations as would bring a speedy and meaningful change in South Africa.64.	We salute the valiant Asian and Coloured communities in South Africa for their massive boycott of the recent elections to the so-called three- chamber  but radically segregated  Parliament. It is a show of solidarity and unity with their black compatriots which must be applauded by all those who seek to uphold the principle of racial equality. It should be obvious that the purported separate Asian and Coloured representation in Parliament is nothing more than a device to entrench apartheid more firmly in South Africa.65.	The Government of Ghana remains ever committed to the total eradication of apartheid and to the establishment of a democratic society under majority rule in South Africa. We believe that this is the only way in which all of its peoples  irrespective of their race  colour  sex or creed  can enjoy equally and fully all the fundamental human rights and freedoms provided under the Charter and other covenants of the United Nations.66.	With regard to Namibia  South Africa continues to raise uncertain hopes and expectations  but the reality is that there has been no practical change in the situation in spite of recent talks between SWAPO and representatives of the apartheid South African regime. The Territory regrettably remains in bondage and its people still under racist oppression and far from freedom and independence.67.	As we understand from the reports of the Secretary-General  all outstanding issues over Namibia have been cleared to the satisfaction of even racist South Africa. Why  then  does the apartheid regime of South Africa continue to use the extraneous and irrelevant presence of Cuban troops in Angola as an excuse for delaying freedom  justice and sovereign independence to the people of Namibia? Ghana cannot accept that there should be any trade-off between the inalienable rights of the people of Namibia to independence and the unfettered exercise of Angola's sovereign right to enter into genuine security arrangements for the preservation of its independence and territorial integrity. We again recommend strongly that steps be taken without further delay by the Security Council to implement its resolution 435 (1978) in order to bring Namibia rapidly to independence.68.	With regard to the struggle of the people of Western Sahara  the Government of Ghana remains equally committed to respect for their inalienable rights to self-determination and sovereign independence. We therefore once again call on the two parties to the dispute to enter into direct negotiations in accordance with the resolution of the Organization of African Unity on the matter.69.	With regard to Chad  we remain convinced that a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict can only be found on the basis of national reconciliation and territorial integrity. We welcome the reported agreement between France and Libya to withdraw their respective forces from Chad as a positive step in easing tension in that country and creating the necessary conditions for a negotiated settlement. We urge all the internal parties to the conflict and the people of Chad as a whole to seize this opportunity to work together to find a fraternal and peaceful solution to their differences.70.	It is distressing to see that  in the Middle East  Israel continues to practise a reign of terror and intimidation against the Arab countries and the Palestinian people of the area. Its illegal occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories continues to undermine stability and to pose a grave threat to international peace and security. There can be no basis for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East unless Israel withdraws from all the Arab territories it has illegally occupied and annexed by acts of war. Israel must comply with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and other relevant United Nations resolutions. It must also now resolve the core of the Middle East problem  which is the denial to the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to their homeland  self-determination and national independence.71.	Developments in Cyprus in recent months have also given the Government of Ghana cause for grave concern. As we have stated before  the unilateral declaration of independence by the Turkish minority in Cyprus is clearly the unfortunate and regrettable culmination of efforts on the part of Turkey to maintain a permanent division of the island and to achieve a complete separation of its Greek and Turkish communities. The decision of the Turkish- Cypriot minority puts in permanent jeopardy the peaceful coexistence of Turks and Greeks on the island. It undercuts all decisions and efforts of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. Ghana  for its part  will continue to support a unified and independent Cyprus  free of external interference  and the resolution of communal differences by peaceful dialogue. It is our sincere hope that the Turkish-Cypriot leadership will reconsider its decision and work for the unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus.72.	The relentless fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq continues to cause the Government and people of Ghana great anguish. It is a war that is as unnecessary as it is wasteful of some of the human and material resources that the third world so vitally needs for urgent productive and developmental purposes. Faced with this unending carnage  we appeal once again to all our brothers and sisters in Iran and Iraq to end the war and resolve their differences by peaceful means.73.	Central America continues to be an area of turmoil and conflict that poses a serious threat to international peace and security. The search for a peaceful solution to the conflicts in the region through the Contadora process must be supported and not undermined by acts of sabotage and destruction of infrastructure  calculated to do the greatest economy damage to the real interests of Nicaragua. The efforts of the people of Nicaragua to establish a truly democratic society which correctly reflects the realities of the historical experiences of Nicaragua must be supported and properly assessed and the reactionary forces of oppression and destruction must be condemned. We endorse the process of democratization of Central America and repeat the call for foreign military interference in that process to cease in favour of a negotiated settlement of the conflicts in the region by the people of that region.74.	Ghana cannot condemn foreign intervention in Central America  be it covert or overt  and condone the foreign occupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan  in persistent defiance of United Nations resolutions. We are particularly disappointed that  in spite of the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  a dialogue on the future of Afghanistan has still proved elusive. The people of both Afghanistan and Kampuchea deserve to live under conditions which will permit them to determine freely their own system of government.75.	Overshadowing all these troubling but none the less local conflicts in various regions of the world is the threat of nuclear war. Unlike the threat posed by all the conflicts I have already mentioned and many others which are no less serious  the threat of nuclear war does not endanger international peace and security alone; it menaces humanity with total annihilation. In addition  it consumes such vast sums of money as to constitute an obstacle to the global developmental process.76.	It is for these reasons Shat we appeal to the international community as a whole  and the superpowers and other nuclear States in particular  to make a supreme effort to save mankind from nuclear extinction.77.	We are encouraged by the recent resumption of high-level contact between the United States and the Soviet Union  and we hope that it will soon lead to a return to the bilateral nuclear-arms negotiations of Geneva  l well as to a meaningful thaw in the relations between the two super-Powers.78.	While we recognize the value of the bilateral approach within the context of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks at Geneva  it is our firm conviction that other disarmament issues should be discussed within the multilateral framework of the United Nations. Only when the United Nations is involved will the voice of the non-nuclear-weapon States be heard and their interests and concerns taken into account in the search for those agreements that will  it is to be hoped  bring an end to the arms race in all its forms  as well as save the world from nuclear war.79.	Turning to the global economic situation  we cannot but bemoan the fact that over the past year most developing countries have remained in the throes of severe economic crisis. The majority of them continue to be caught in a vicious spiral of declining production  employment and trade. As a result  most have had to undertake further contractional adjustments  at a heavy cost to their economies and with adverse social and political consequences. Their import capacity has been further impaired. They have had sharply to curtail investments in agriculture  industry and basic services  which are at the heart of the development process. And many of them have had to seek a rescheduling of debt-service payments. Nowhere has the crisis been more devastating than in the low-income countries  particularly those in Africa.80.	To be sure  there has been improvement in the economic performance of a few developed market- economy countries  but this recovery has not spread convincingly to other countries in that category. It has not pulled up commodity prices appreciably  nor has it been accompanied by a meaningful decline in interest rates. International mechanisms for the transmission of growth have in any case been weakened by recent developments. The recovery has therefore barely touched the developing world  and the prospects of most of these countries remain dim. In many African countries  these set-backs have been aggravated by prolonged drought and desertification  by the widening gap between food production and population growth  by acute dependence on food imports and by the consequent threat to their social and economic systems.81.	Immediate steps are accordingly required on a number of fronts. The stance of macro-economic policies in the developed market-economy countries needs to be shifted so as to broaden and deepen the incipient upturn in economic activity. More than that  action must be taken to relieve the strains on the external financial positions of developing countries. Deliberate and vigorous measures must be pursued to revitalize the development process in the third world. In particular  there is need to augment the financial resources of the multilateral lending institutions and to improve access to them by developing countries; there is need for a fresh and substantial allocation of special drawing rights; there is need for systematic debt relief for low-income countries; and there is need to replace the present ad hoc treatment of commercial bank debt with longer- term approaches. Moreover  recent developments show that the present trade and payments system is serving increasingly to destabilize the developing countries rather than protect them  as it should. It is important  therefore  that the necessary processes of reform in the international economic system be set in motion with urgency. All these measures require intensified international co-operation; yet  paradoxically  multilateralism has been weakening.82.	In these circumstances  the critical economic situation in Africa cannot but arouse grave concern. Living standards in sub-Saharan Africa have shown a sharp decline. Net capital flows to the region are still substantially below the volume required to have an impact on the developmental process. The Secretary- General and the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are to be warmly commended for the role they have played in drawing international attention to the human tragedy unfolding in that part of the world. But it is no less important that an agreed framework for purposeful international action  taking into account the recent initiative by the World Bank  be developed urgently to support the efforts of the African countries in dealing with the situation.83.	We in Africa are fully conscious that it is our primary responsibility to tackle our economic problems ourselves. In the Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa in May 1984  and in the Lagos Plan of Action this fact has been given full recognition.84.	Even more important  African countries  Ghana included  are making strenuous efforts to meet the exigencies of their current plight. In Ghana  the Provisional National Defence Council initiated two years ago a series of comprehensive and far-reaching economic reforms which included decisive measures to rehabilitate the productive sectors of the economy by giving remunerative prices to producers for their efforts  improving their access to essential inputs  realigning the currency to restore incentives to export and improving revenue collection  and revamping the administration and management of the economy. The broad aim of these reforms is to create the material conditions for implementing the national objectives of social and political transformation  including the restructuring of the basic institutions of the economy. We have made considerable progress towards this objective  but  as in other African countries in a similar position  the full success of our efforts depends on whole-hearted international support. Unless such support is forthcoming  the credibility of those who urge policy reform and adjustment on African countries will be sharply compromised.85.	In this regard  we are encouraged that  after a period of scepticism  our efforts in Ghana have now won the respect and support of the financial community. We hope that support will be even more forthcoming in the critical months and years ahead.86.	The last 12 months or so have been especially traumatic for Africa  and we must together seek solutions to its critical problems. The Secretary-General has stressed this international responsibility several times  and we must help to save millions from starvation and misery. I hope that Africa can count on the General Assembly to lead the way.87.	Turning now to the domestic political scene in Ghana  our revolution is a process initiated by citizens of Ghana  some in uniform and others not in uniform  who courageously took up the challenge  one no longer to be denied or devalued  posed by the continued inability of successive Governments and the political organizations that sponsored them to resolve the economic  social and cultural issues which have for some time now obstructed the development of our nation in the true interests of our people.88.	I wish to reiterate that the ultimate and irrevocable objective of the Ghanaian revolution is the development of a viable democratic system which genuinely reflects the political will and creative power of all our people  a system that derives its strength from their active and dedicated participation in a Government which is fully committed to the cause of our people and which therefore makes democracy a living reality in the day-to-day lives of the ordinary citizen.89.	It is no longer open to us to continue to legitimize social and economic injustices and acquired cultural attitudes and irrelevancies by uncritical adherence to constitutional transfers which nominally guarantee norms and institutions but which have completely failed to institutionalize true democratic values of social justice  accountability and responsibility as an objective reality in the formulation and implementation of national policies by the elected representatives of the people. It is the ardent desire of the Provisional National Defence Council to work ceaselessly against the re-emergence on our national scene of those situations and conditions which have resulted in the past in recourse to the military as an instrument of change and so to pre-empt the very real danger of institutionalizing military rule as a political fact of life in our society.90.	In conclusion  I wish to assure the General Assembly of my Government's commitment to the United Nations and to multilateralism generally. The United Nations may have failed to find solutions to all the problems of mankind  but it has thereby merely reflected the reality of international relations. On balance  it has achieved more for the international community than any other international organization of its kind. It should be clear to the critics  therefore  that the United Nations can only be as effective as its Members allow it to be. We thus have a common duty to ensure that this priceless instrument for international peace and advancement should be reinforced and made more effective if we are indeed to save succeeding generations from conflict and perdition.91.	As we prepare to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations next year  it is necessary for all States to rededicate themselves to the ideals of peace enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations."
"55",2643,"GIN",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  since this is the first time that I have had the honour and privilege of addressing this Assembly on behalf of the Second Republic of Guinea  allow me to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  which came as a surprise to no one. We would also like to pay a well- deserved tribute to your country  which happily has solid ties of friendship and mutual trust with the Republic of Guinea. Your outstanding qualities  Sir  as a seasoned diplomat and your wide experience in the affairs of State  together with your admirable wisdom  guarantee that the work of this session will proceed in the serious and tranquillity required in view of the present disquieting international situation.49.	It is also a pleasure for our delegation to express its congratulations to Mr. Jorge Illueca for the brilliant way in which he led the work of the thirty- eighth session.50.	We welcome  too  the new State of Brunei Darussalam on its admission as the 159th Member of the large United Nations family and assure its Government and people of the readiness of the Government and people of Guinea to co-operate with it.51.	We would also like  on behalf of Colonel Lansana Konte  President of the Republic of Guinea  to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary- General the deep gratitude of the Military Committee of National Recovery and the Government of the Second Republic for the commendable and tireless efforts he has made for the peaceful settlement of the international problems facing the United Nations.52.	As the Assembly is aware  as a result of its categorical and historic ""no"" in the referendum of 28 September 1958  the courageous people of Guinea achieved full sovereignty on 2 October 1958 in a great outburst of enthusiasm and hopeâenthusiasm at having broken the chains of colonialism and hope for a future that held every promise of brilliance.53.	Unfortunately  little by little  as time went on  the Guinean citizen  who had fought like a lion  who had made so many sacrifices and suffered all manner of deprivations to lead our country to independence  saw the noble objectives for which he had fought betrayed. Since then  unfortunately  the people of Guinea  powerless under the burden of a totalitarian and bloody regime  suffered body and soul  shed tears for the thousands of innocent victims  including the finest of its sons  who were assassinated in cold blood  and witnessed the inevitable deterioration of all its values and socio-economic conditions.54.	A people stifled  oppressed and confounded; a people discouraged by the prospect of a future without food; a people lacking hospitals and medicines; a people lacking viable schools  much less decent housing; a people without means of transport and good roads; a people whose needs are immense and whose misfortunes are manyâthis is the legacy of 26 years of a reign whose cynicism vied with its cruelty; this is the true face of the martyred people of Guinea following its long and painful desert passage  which  thank God  came to an end on 3 April 1984  when the Guinean armed forces came to power.55.	On 3 April 1984  the Republic of Guinea turned a new page in its history. The armed forces  responding to the appeal of the people  without any bloodshed  assumed their historic responsibilities to save the peace-loving people of Guinea from an imminent civil war into which the former administration would inevitably have led it  inspired by racial and ethnic considerations.56.	The extraordinary outburst of joy  the many expressions of satisfaction throughout the country welcoming the fact that the national army had taken over the destiny of the nation  clearly demonstrated that the tragedy which had been played out for more than a quarter of a century in Guinea had reached tragic dimensions which were no longer bearable.57.	The immense hopes aroused by the events of 3 April 1984 went far beyond our national borders  and the positive reactions registered on the continent and throughout the world make it possible for us  while relying first and foremost on our own strength and our own potential  to appeal for international solidarity which could help us quickly to establish the well- being of the Guinean citizen and  therefore  that of all people  since every individual is part of humanity at large. Full light will be shed on the Guinean tragedy so that the necessary lessons will be learned to ensure that never again will an individual or individuals enslave a people  as was the case in Guinea.58.	Right after taking power  the Military Committee of National Recovery found itself facing a most disastrous economic situation  with the public treasury depleted and the economy at square one. Aware of that burdensome heritage  the result of a quarter century of waste and chaos  the Military Committee of National Recovery and its Government decided to do everything in its power for the rapid development of the immense potential which nature so generously bestowed on our country. Therefore  since 3 April 1984  Guinea has been a vast work-yard  open to all countries that want to co-operate with it in the framework of sincere  open and mutually beneficial co-operation. In this respect  we are pleased to point out that a new investment code which provides sufficient incentives has just been prepared and published.59.	Need we state that what prevails now in Guinea is freedom  the real freedom of which our people dreamt on that fleeting dawn of 28 September. What prevails in Guinea is democracy  genuine democracy and fruitful dialogue  which can give freedom to hearts  minds and initiative. Guinea is now a haven of peace  tranquillity and security  open to the world at large and where human rights and individual freedoms will be zealously defended and completely respected.60.	From this rostrum we reaffirm our complete adherence to the Charter of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity  the non-aligned countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We extend our unconditional support to all national liberation movements in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America.61.	We are determined fiercely to combat foreign domination  racism  apartheid  Zionism and any use of force to resolve international problems. We shall participate fully in the quest for peaceful solutions to the many conflicts confronting our world.62.	The thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  like the preceding session  has opened in the midst of a highly disturbing international situation. A simple list of the conflicts engulfing our world  and particularly those in the African continent  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America  which unceasingly multiply and develop  is enlightening. The constant and tragic worsening of those conflicts in the world is the painful and dangerous consequence of the ideological and military confrontation of the hegemonistic Powers that wish to divide the world into exclusive zones of influence.63.	This dangerous policy of tension is compounded by the serious and trying economic recession which strikes with full force at the developing countries and  above all  at those African countries that are already in the grip of famine  malnutrition  disease and all the effects of drought and other natural disasters.64.	As we consider the situation in these crisis areas  we must observe with concern that it is always the same ones that are responsible for the increasing tension in international relations.65.	Africa  for its part  has enjoyed no respite  given the conflicts and challenges that disturb it and compromise its development. Our continent remains confronted  first and foremost  with the intolerable policy of apartheid  established as a system of Government by a Fascist and arrogant minority regime.66.	The intransigence of Pretoria in the search for an immediate solution to the Namibian question stems completely from the support that it receives from its allies  whose anachronistic views underlie the calculated delays which prevent the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.67.	Furthermore  armed aggression  political pressure on neighbouring independent African States and the complicity of several Member States from which South Africa benefits have led to a dialogue of the deaf and a deadlock  making it possible for the apartheid regime to repress the South African people from within by force of arms.68.	The enemies of African freedom count on others being lulled by the continuation of this dangerous situation so that they may prevent the exercise by the Namibian people of its inalienable right to independence  a right admirably defended by the valiant freedom fighters of SWAPO.69.	Given the tragedy of Namibia  the United Nations cannot afford to be the passive instrument of base individual interests without losing its credibility in the eyes of public opinion. It must demand that all its Members strictly respect its decisions so as to induce racist South Africa to accept the complete implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the only way of leading the Namibian people to self-determination and national independence.70.	In the past  in the present and in the future  the Republic of Guinea opposed  opposes and will continue to oppose with increasing energy  resolve and determination the manoeuvres of those who want to link the freedom of the fraternal people of Namibia to problems relating to the sovereignty of an independent African State  Angola.71.	Our delegation wishes once again to take this opportunity to reaffirm to SWAPO  its valiant leadership and its freedom fighters  the unconditional support of the people of Guinea.72.	Our delegation once again assures the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania of the unconditional support and active solidarity of the Government of the Republic of Guinea in their liberation struggle  as well as the considerable efforts made by the front-line States.73.	The explosive situation prevailing in southern Africa is unfortunately not the sole concern of the delegation of Guinea. Our continent has other hotbeds of tension  the two principal ones being Chad and Western Sahara. There again  the destructive effects of a serious deterioration of international relations and the prevalence of individual selfish interests have fuelled the flames of division and paralysed the efforts of our continental organization  the OAU. For the sake of the credibility of that organization  we must strictly respect its resolutions and implement them to the letter. It therefore seems to us essential that conditions be created for the implementation of resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX) on Western Sahara  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983.74.	With respect to Chad  our delegation is pleased at the new developments in that situation and strongly affirms that it is for the people of Chad and for them alone to find a solution to their problems. Of course  all the efforts of the international community should focus on helping the people of Chad to recover national peace and unity in a sovereign Chad whose internal security and territorial integrity will be definitively guaranteed. In this respect  we welcome the efforts being made to gather together around the same table all the representatives of the sons of that martyred nation.75.	The Republic of Guinea makes an urgent appeal from this rostrum to the international community to give its complete support to the OAU in its delicate search for a peaceful and lasting solution to all the conflicts which confront the continent  seriously imperil the survival of its organic unity and dangerously curb the harmonious and balanced development of each of the African nations.76.	Our delegation sincerely deplores the steady worsening of the situation in the Middle East  as well as the inadmissible fact that it has been impossible to find appropriate ways and means of putting an end to the pointless bloodshed and massive destruction of the property of the peoples of that region.77.	It must be recognized that the main factor of instability in the region is Israel  whose responsibility in prolonging and exacerbating tension is unquestionable. By persisting in its policy of occupying Arab lands  by using force to establish and maintain its domination in the region  by adopting an attitude of superiority bordering on disdain and arrogance  Israel is hardly working towards the establishment of peace  a sine qua non for peaceful coexistence and fruitful co-operation between Jews and Arabs.78.	We are firmly convinced that nothing solid  lasting and effective can be accomplished towards solving the problem of the Middle East unless account is taken of the fact of the Palestinian nation and unless Israel recognizes the inalienable and imprescriptible right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State under the leadership of the PLO  its sole and authentic representative.79.	I repeat that the Government of Guinea has no quarrel with the existence of the Israeli State. We have said that what we cannot accept is the acquisition by force of the territory of another State. History has taught us that what is acquired by force will be lost by force  and that two wrongs do not make a right.80.	With regard to the painful conflict between two brother Muslim countries  Iran and Iraq  the Republic of Guinea believes that this terrible war  in which all means of destruction are being used  thus endangering economies that had good prospects  has lasted too long. It is high time for the leaders of those two fraternal countries to listen to the voices that everywhere clamour for an end to the hostilities  an end to the nightmare that has cost hundreds of thousands of human lives and led to the destruction of a number of towns and very important industrial installations. It is time for genuine negotiations leading to peace and reconciliation. It is high time to stop an escalation that would inevitably result in an extension of the zone of conflict and thus to an internationalization of hostilities whose devastating effects on the region and the rest of the world would be difficult to contain.81.	Our delegation welcomes the agreement reached by the two belligerents under the auspices of the Secretary-General to protect the civilian populations against indiscriminate bombing. In the hope that that small and very fragile step may be respected and strengthened and lead to a genuine cease-fireâ an indispensable prelude to any peace negotiationsâ our delegation reaffirms to the two parties its complete readiness to continue within the Islamic Peace Committee its mission of friendship and reconciliation so that at last peace and solidarity may prevail in the relations of those two fraternal countries  which history  geography and religious faith have determined must live together.82.	Since the thirty-eight session of the General Assembly  the problem of Cyprus has developed considerably in dangerous ways. Today  the country's independence  national unity and territorial integrity seem to be threatened. The Government of the Republic of Guinea encourages and supports ail efforts to bring about national reconciliation through direct dialogue between the Turkish and Greek communities of the island  aimed at respect for the unity of the Cypriot people and the maintenance of the country's territorial integrity.83.	In the Korean peninsula  as in many other parts of Asia  peace remains precarious. The Government of Guinea reiterates its appeal to the international community and to all people of goodwill to support the sincere efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to begin a constructive dialogue between the peoples of the north and the south of the Korean nation with a view to creating a confederal republic. The Korean people  whether of the north or of the south  aspire only to peace and the reunification of their homeland. The international community must support its efforts to attain that objective by expressing its support for the final withdrawal of all foreign forces and the transformation of the armistice agreement into a peace agreement.84.	Our delegation is also still concerned about the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We believe that it is for the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples themselves  and for them alone  free y to decide their political direction in domestic and foreign policy  without foreign pressure or interference.85.	As for the crises shaking Latin America and the Caribbean  we favour respect for the territorial integrity and security of all the States of the region and non-interference in their internal affairs.86.	With this survey  incomplete as it is  of some of the problems relating to world peace and stability  it is only right to observe that the General Assembly is unfortunately again meeting against the background of an alarming deterioration in the international situation  characterized by confrontation  military intervention  foreign occupation  an acceleration of the arms race and economic stagnation.87.	When it is estimated that world military expenditure in one week is equivalent to the yearly financial effort needed for the complete recovery of the economic situation of the least developed countries  we can only conclude that there is a pressing need to put an end to the dangerous paradox of the arms race.88.	We believe that during this Second Disarmament Decade  the international community must ensure the effective implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly and resolutely prevent any action that might change its objectives and imperil its results.89.	The deterioration in the international political situation is  unfortunately  reflected in international economic relations  where the situation does not inspire optimism. The crisis in international economic relations and the ever-widening gap between the developing countries and the industrialized countries threaten the stability and independence of our States.90.	The imbalance designed and maintained by the rich countries tends to continue  to the detriment of our nations  thus creating a basically anachronistic situation in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer.91.	It is therefore fitting to stress the injustice of the present international economic system  which brutally affects the developing countries  obstructing all their attempts to escape the tragic situation in which they are struggling.92.	Initiatives aimed at getting the rich countries to participate in negotiations on the global development of all the present problemsâraw materials  energy and trade  money  finances and industrial and agricultural developmentâhave been met with reluctance by some developed countries. Yet  the many discussions between the North and the South  the various agreements and the adoption of General Assembly resolution 34/138 had given a glimmer of hope to some.93.	For years now  a point has been made in all international forums of the importance of North- South co-operation. It is a theme which has merely caused a great deal of ink to flow.94.	That is why it is desirable that today the international community should make a reality of that co-deration  so that our peoples  which are facing a distressing economic situation  may at last benefit from the fruits of their labour  thanks to our receiving a just return for our products.95.	A global programme aimed at international co-operation  with the participation of all countries  is urgently needed in the present international economic situation.96.	Furthermore  concrete measures must be taken  measures which reflect a political will to establish a new world system which ensures for all mankind a fair share of the accumulated wealth and the fruits of scientific and technological progress.97.	In May 1974  the General Assembly  meeting in its sixth special session  concluded that the system of international economic relations was incompatible with the historic changes that had taken place and with the economic and social development needs of peoples. It therefore proclaimed the need for us to work together to establish a new international economic order.98.	And what have the developing countries seen happening since then? A deterioration in their terms of trade  an inability to achieve self-sufficiency in food or to increase their participation in world industrial production  enormous difficulties in gaining access to technology  and an alarming increase in their foreign debt.99.	Our delegation is convinced that the only possible way to restore equal opportunities in North- South co-operation is to establish fruitful relations of co-operation based on justice and mutual interests  with the United Nations as a framework for the negotiations.100.	In addition to economic difficulties  in some cases our countries are facing natural disasters; this remains the sorry plight of the third-world countries.101.	In a grim world situation  fraught with crisis  it should be mentioned  among other things  that more than half of the African countries are afflicted by drought. A rapidly increasing population growth contrasts with the vertical drop in food production. In these conditions  it can easily be understood why  on our continent  about 150 million persons are victims of famine  according to FAO estimates.102.	That is why my delegation believes that by giving massive assistance to put into effect the programme to combat desertification in Africa  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/184  the international community can fulfil one of its duties of solidarity  in the framework of international co-operation.103.	The solution to the complex problems facing our world today requires  more than ever before  the consolidation of the role that the United Nations must play in the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security and in the promotion of respect for international law in inter-State relations. The United Nations must become a dynamic and effective forum so that major international problems can be tackled from the global point of view and so that thereby the most complex problems of the world can be settled. If those objectives are to be attained  an assessment of United Nations activities is necessary in order to increase its effectiveness and to adapt its structures to the international community's present-day and future requirements and realities. It is also important that  in its international conduct  every State should respect the norms of law and of ethics.104.	In conclusion  my delegation repeats from this rostrum that the Government of the Republic of Guinea is ready to co-operate closely with all other Governments in the quest for the most appropriate ways to achieve all our objectives  so that  by its results  this session of the Assembly may live up to the important responsibilities of the United Nations in regard to the attainment of the noble and legitimate aspirations of all peoples to peace and progress  in the framework of balanced  sincere and fruitful co-operation."
"56",2683,"GMB",39,1984,"ï»¿Permit me at the outset  Sir  to extend to you the warm congratulations of the entire Gambian delegation on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It is for us a source of immense satisfaction and pride to see the presidency of the Assembly entrusted to a son of Africa as distinguished as yourself and representing the sister republic of Zambia  with which my country enjoys the most warm and friendly relations and whose commitment to the principles and objectives of the United Nations is exemplary. Your own broad international experience and proven diplomatic skills enjoy the highest respectânowhere more so than here in New York  where you have distinguished yourself in your dual capacity as representative of your country to the United Nations and as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia. I place absolute confidence in your ability to guide the deliberations of this important session to a successful conclusion and wish to assure you in this regard that you may count at all times upon the full co-operation of the Gambian delegation.87.	I also wish to pay a tribute to your able predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who presided with admirable skill over the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session. There can be no more eloquent testimony to his statesmanship and political acumen than his elevation earlier this year to the presidency of the Republic of Panama.88.	I also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for the untiring efforts which he has continued to exert in pursuit of the objectives of the Organization. He has  moreover  taken a particular interest in the problems of Africa. This was exemplified by the special initiative which he launched earlier this year in response to the economic and social crisis afflicting our continent.89.	Finally  I take great pleasure in congratulating the Government and people of Brunei Darussalam upon their accession to independence  and in welcoming the recent admission of that country as the 159th Member State of the Organization.90.	Four decades have now elapsed since the genesis of the United Nations at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington  D.C. Few  if any  will disagree that the intervening years have witnessed tremendous progress in terms of both the establishment and development of the Organization and the progressive universalization of its membership. However  as we look forward to the International Year of Peace  which will be marked by the fortieth session of the General Assembly  the moment is propitious for a review of the Organization's record in terms of the principles and objectives set out in the Charter.91.	Such an exercise provides few grounds for complacency. The dismal state of relations between the super-Powers has spurred on the already frenzied arms race  thereby heightening international tension and exposing the entire planet to the constant threat of an all-engulfing nuclear apocalypse. In international relations  meanwhile  the peaceful settlement of disputes remains the exception rather than the norm. As a result  while we may have been spared a direct military confrontation between the most powerful nations  regional conflicts often of considerable ferocity darken the horizon on every continent. In the area of fundamental freedoms  to which my Government attaches the highest importance  the most basic human rights remain more honoured in their violation than in their observance. And  notwithstanding the impressive advances that man's creative genius has continued to achieve in the field of science and technology  poverty  hunger and disease remain the miserable lot of the overwhelming majority of the Earth's inhabitants.92.	These are the principal symptoms of the crisis of multilateralism addressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. There can be no more graphic illustration of this disturbing phenomenon than the deteriorating situation in South Africa. There  a racist minority regime  representing the very antithesis of the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  has continued its ruthless and systematic oppression of the majority non-white population.93.	A year ago  the racist regime adopted a series of so-called constitutional reforms aimed in reality at entrenching white supremacy at home while at the same time rehabilitating Pretoria's pariah image abroad. Although cautious support was expressed by a small number of South Africa's traditional partners  those constitutional manoeuvres were immediately and categorically rejected by the General Assembly. Disregarding this almost unanimous verdict  South Africa proceeded last August to organize sham elections for seats in the Asian and Coloured chambers of its new tricameral Parliament. Appropriately  this electoral farce was condemned as null and void by both the General Assembly and the Security Council. Any residual doubts regarding Pretoria's real intentions will have been firmly dispelled both by the climate of harassment and intimidation in which the so-called elections were conducted and by the vicious repression which continues to be unleashed systematically against any opposition to the new constitutional dispensations.94.	The Assembly has been seized of Pretoria's apartheid policies since its inaugural session  some 40 years ago. Evidently  more forceful measures are now called for to ensure the elimination of this barbarous and inhuman system  which my delegation unreservedly condemns. At the same time  I wish to reaffirm my Government's total support for the heroic struggle for liberation being waged by the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania.95.	My Government is no less preoccupied by the situation in the Territory of Namibia  which has now endured 100 uninterrupted years of foreign occupation and colonial domination. Although the adoption in 1978 of the United Nations plan for Namibia appeared to portend an early end to South Africa's illegal occupation  the racist regime has since then invented one pretext after another for delaying its withdrawal from the Territory.96.	In the first quarter of this year  we witnessed certain developments in the southern African sub region which were hailed in some quarters as a diplomatic watershed heralding an early transition to independence in Namibia. Predictably  such optimism has proved unwarranted  for Namibia remains under the oppressive yoke of South Africa's occupation. Meanwhile  the racist regime has formally reaffirmed its commitment to the principle of ""linkage""  which was categorically rejected by the Security Council in its resolution 539 (1983). This situation represents a brazen affront to the authority of the United Nations and is clearly unacceptable. More-over  as past experience has demonstrated  it poses a grave threat to the security and stability of the entire sub region. South Africa's recalcitrance must therefore be met with appropriately firm action to compel it to withdraw from the Territory  thus enabling the Namibian people  under the dynamic leadership of SWAPO  to exercise freely their inalienable right to self-determination.97.	In addition to the critical situation in southern Africa  the unity and security of the continent remain threatened by the persistence of a number of other regional disputes. With regard to the situation in Western Sahara  my Government deplores the continued conflict over the issue of self-determination in that Territory. It is our view that the settlement of this dispute can and must be brought about within the framework of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  whose resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX) has already provided the outlines of a negotiated settlement.98.	With regard to the question of Chad  the Gambia has followed with deep dismay the tragic fratricidal conflict which has denied peace and stability to the people of this Founder Member State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] since their attainment of independence. My Government fervently hopes  therefore  that recent developments regarding the withdrawal of external forces will contribute to restoring the unity and territorial integrity of the sovereign Republic of Chad.99.	The highly charged situation in the Middle East represents another issue of grave concern to my Government. Here  the achievement of regional peace and stability remains effectively precluded by the continued frustration of the legitimate nationalist aspirations of the Palestinian people. In the West Bank and Gaza  which represent the last vestiges of the Palestinian State originally envisaged by the General Assembly under its resolution 181 (II)  the Arab population continues to endure the rigours of Israeli occupation. In this regard  my Government deplores the illegal settlements policy and condemns  in particular  the organized terrorist activities of Jewish colonists.100.	Meanwhile  Israel's expansionist ambitions remain apparently limitless. In addition to the West Bank and Gaza  it continues illegally to occupy the Syrian Golan Heights. At the same time  it has  with equal disregard for international law  occupied fully one third of Lebanon's sovereign territory for over 20 months. At its thirty-eighth session  the Assembly endorsed the call for an international peace conference to be attended by the various parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict  including  inter alia  the authentic representative of the Palestinian people  the PLO. The Gambia is firmly convinced that such a conference represents the only prospect of securing the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and restoring peace and security to this troubled area.101.	In the eastern Mediterranean  meanwhile  political normalcy has continued to elude the island of Cyprus  with which the Gambia enjoys close ties within the framework of the Commonwealth and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We were therefore disappointed by the breakdown in August last year of the intercommunal talks  and by subsequent unilateral moves regarding the status of the northern portion of the island. However  my Government has noted with appreciation the recent resumption  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  of proximity talks between the representatives of both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. We fully support the search for a political solution based on a bizonal  bicommunal federation  which alone can satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the island's two communities.102.	Elsewhere in the Middle East  the unresolved hostilities in the Persian Gulf  which have now entered their fifth year  continue to provoke the concern of the international community. The Gambia is deeply saddened by this tragic conflict which has pitted against each other two sister Islamic States with which we share the warmest cultural affinities. In addition to the enormous human and material costs  the continuing hostilities represent a grave and pressing danger to international peace and security.103.	Earlier this year  the President of the Gambia  Elhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  acceded to the chairmanship of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  of which my Government has been an active member since 1981. We have since redoubled our efforts in the search for a negotiated settlement. I wish at this point to appeal to the two parties to continue to co-operate fully with the Islamic Peace Committee in order to permit the restoration of lasting peace and stability to this troubled region.104.	I now turn to the completely unacceptable situation which continues to prevail in Afghanistan  almost six years after the invasion of that non-aligned nation. At its thirty-eighth session  the General Assembly adopted  by a majority even more overwhelming than in previous years  resolution 38/29  which reiterated the call of the community of nations for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. Not only have the terms of that resolution been disregarded  but the military occupation of Afghanistan has actually intensified. This was illustrated with ferocious clarity by the massive onslaughts this year in the Panjshir and Shomali valleys  in which thousands of civilians were killed  maimed or displaced.105.	In recent months  moreover  the army of occupation has expanded the scope of its bloodthirsty activities beyond the territorial limits of Afghanistan  resorting with increasing frequency to attacks upon the territory of the sovereign republic of Pakistan  which already bears the brunt of the refugee problem emanating from this conflict. The Gambia deeply deplores this ominous trend. At the same time  we wish to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan  Under-Secretary-General Mr. Diego Cordovez  whose indefatigable mediation efforts we continue to follow with the closest interest.106.	In South-East Asia  the situation in Kampuchea remains equally disturbing. Here  too  the illegal presence of foreign troops has transformed a large section of the population into refugees. This has placed an intolerable burden upon neighbouring countries of first asylum  particularly Thailand. Meanwhile  the serious danger to international peace and security posed by this situation has been demonstrated by the repeated eruption of hostilities along the Thai-Kampuchean border. My Government is of the view that the normalization of this unacceptably volatile situation demands the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Assembly  thus permitting the Khmer people to determine their own future  through free and fair elections.107.	On the Korean peninsula  the situation of the divided people of Korea is still a tragic reality. My country reaffirms its position that the reunification of the two Koreas can be achieved only through peaceful and genuine dialogue between the two parties  without external intervention. With the establishment of meaningful dialogue aimed at fostering mutual confidence and improved relations  the cause of the peaceful reunification of the Korean people would be greatly enhanced and tension eliminated from the peninsula.108.	In Central America  meanwhile  peace and stability remain gravely threatened by the acute tension prevailing in the isthmus. It is the hope of my delegation that a negotiated settlement of the current disputes can be found within the framework of the regional Contadora initiative.109.	These are some of the more pressing political issues confronting the international community. In addition  however  the Assembly will have to address itself to a host of economic problems which pose no less of a threat to world order  for  although there is now indisputable evidence in the industrialized countries of the North  at least  that the recession is finally drawing to a close  this welcome recovery is unlikely in the present circumstances to be translated into improved living conditions in the developing countries of the South.110.	Already crippled by the soaring energy costs of the last decade  these countries are now having to grapple with the problem of foreign debt  which  in this period of unprecedentedly high interest rates and currency fluctuations  is further devastating their fragile economies. As a result of this crisis  developing countries have had to adopt severe retrenchment policies  which have necessitated the reduction of social programmes in such essential areas as health  education and housing.111.	On the African continent  this alarming situation has been further aggravated by the twin ravages of drought and desertification  which now afflict some 24 of our countries. This scourge has drastically reduced agricultural production throughout the region  resulting in a significant decline in export earnings  while at the same time precipitating a widespread food emergency. Paradoxically  therefore  African countries have become net importers of food at a time when their foreign reserve position is at its weakest. Our Governments  of course  realize that the primary responsibility for improving our economies rests with ourselves. It is for this reason that we in the Gambia have recently embarked upon certain internal adjustment measures  while continuing to participate at the sub regional level in such collective development programmes as those of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel and the Organization for the Development of the Gambia River Basin.112.	These vigorous efforts  however  need to be complemented by international assistance and co-operation. Appropriately  international attention has been focused upon the economic and social crisis in Africa since the launching in February of the Secretary-General's timely initiative of which Africa remains deeply appreciative. At the same time  we are grateful for the high priority the international community has continued to accord to this crisis  as exemplified in the statements of solidarity and support emanating from the London Economic Summit and the more recent IMF-World Bank meeting in Washington. Indeed  the decision taken by the Assembly upon the initiative of our confederal partner  the sister republic of Senegal  to inscribe on its agenda the question of ""Countries stricken by desertification and drought"" is a further manifestation of this encouraging trend.113.	In this connection  I am pleased to announce that a three-day round-table conference is scheduled to meet at Banjul from 28 to 30 November 1984  under the auspices of the United Nations. Therefore  I avail myself of this opportunity to renew our invitation to the international donor countries  as well as international organizations and agencies concerned with development  and to appeal for generous assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Gambia. It is our ardent hope that the conference will effectively address the medium- term and long-term economic needs of the Gambia  particularly in the sectors of agriculture  transport and communications  and health.114.	I have dwelt at some length upon the particular concerns of my own country with regard to international economic relations. Our national situation  however  is essentially a microcosm of the economic circumstances of the developing world in general. Concerted international action is  therefore  required to redress the structural imbalances that this generalized pattern clearly reflects. For several years  developing countries have called in vain for the launching of a comprehensive North-South dialogue on the fundamental issues in international economic relations. They have called  in particular  for more equitable terms of trade  increased financial resources for development and a restructuring of the international monetary system  all within the context of a new international economic order. The Gambia remains committed to the early launching of the related global negotiations.115.	This is the background against which the thirty-ninth session is convening. As custodians of the hopes and aspirations of mankind for peace and social justice  we have the task of translating these ideals into reality. These important responsibilities have assumed a vital urgency at a time of increasing uncertainty for the majority of the human race. I speak of those who live under the threat of war and persecution  of those who languish under the spectre of starvation and disease and of those who continue to eke out a miserable existence unfit for human beings. Let us  therefore  through collective action  rededicate ourselves to the lofty ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  in order to ensure the continued peace and progress of all our peoples."
"57",2723,"GNB",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all  my delegation is very pleased to see an eminent son of Africa presiding over the General Assembly at its thirty ninth session. In electing you to the presidency for this session  the international community wished  above all  to pay a tribute to your country  Zambia  with which Guinea-Bissau maintains relations of friendship and brotherliness  for its important contribution to the process of decolonization of the African continent and the realization of the ideals of peace and freedom which are so dear to the Organization. The General Assembly also wished to show its appreciation for the lofty qualities which distinguish you  to salute your dynamic and tireless activities as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  and to greet you as a humanist and staunch defender of the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.81.	I should like also to express to your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  my country's gratitude for the devotion and personal commitment he displayed throughout his term of office.82.	I should like also to take this opportunity to welcome Brunei Darussalam to the great family of the United Nations and to wish it every success in the consolidation of its national independence and its economic and social development.83.	We are particularly pleased with the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar's realism and farsightedness  which we had occasion to emphasize at previous sessions of the General Assembly  have been further confirmed in his persistent efforts to improve the functioning of the Organization and to strengthen its role in the consolidation of international peace and security  development and cooperation. We wish to commend his lucid analysis of the world situation  which is a reflection of the main concerns of the international community  and we subscribe to the measures advocated for remedying the various crises affecting international relations.84.	In view of the complexity of the problems now confronting mankind and their constant deterioration  it is indeed a matter of regret to have to note that a certain spirit of pessimism and a certain conformism appear to be more and more prevalent in our work. This state of affairs may be explained by the structural nature of our problems and also by the lack of real political will to seek just and lasting solutions.85.	A more and more noticeable trend towards crystallization of our discussions around the same questions indicates the urgent need for us to meditate on our own individual and collective conduct and to give our joint actions the necessary dynamism and motivation. Above all  it is important to eliminate the spirit of confrontation  selfishness and intransigence and the various kinds of pressure  which tend to undermine the proper functioning and the very raison d'etre of the United Nations.86.	The numerous failures and disappointments we have noted in the efforts of the Organization to build a world of peace  justice and progress are nothing more or less than a corollary to our own inconsistencies and weaknesses. That being so  it is clear that the problems besetting mankind as a whole can be resolved only through a global approach and through effective participation in that process by all States. To try to avoid that reality or simply to ignore it would be tantamount to denying the principles contained in the Charter and to condemning the United Nations to repeated failures.87.	That helps to explain the various attempts which have been made by the developing countries in general  and particularly by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to encourage a constructive dialogue with the wealthy countries on matters of development. It may be said that  despite the persistent obstruction of certain countries  these efforts have nevertheless been pursued. The meetings held at Quito  Cartagena and Mar del Plata and the recent meeting held at San Jose  Costa Rica  with the participation of some Latin American States  the members of the European Economic Community  and Portugal and Spain  bear out that resolve.88.	The economic indicators  in both the developing and the developed countries  clearly demonstrate the pressing need for re-launching global negotiations.89.	When we speak of North South dialogue we do not understand it to mean a sort of accommodation designed to satisfy the wishes of a particular group of countriesâin this case  the least developed countries. Rather  it is a common enterprise undertaken by the international community under the auspices of the United Nations  on the basis of a unanimous desire to put an end to the present intolerable international economic situation. This action should be geared to the creation of conditions that would make possible the achievement of balanced and equitable development which would be in keeping with the dialectic of positive interdependence among nations. In this connection  it is important that due account be taken of the constructive proposals made by the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77.90.	The distortions of the present economic and financial situation  in addition to the natural catastrophes besetting the populations of developing countries  all require immediate and appropriate action. The burden of external debt  compounded by high interest rates the drop in production and exports  the constant deterioration of the terms of trade  the food crisis and lack of the resources needed to exploit their economic potentials have today placed the developing countries in a grievous situation  the persistence of which jeopardizes their achievements in many of these fields and compromises the attempts to satisfy the legitimate rights of their peoples to social well-being  health and education  and at the same time tends to diminish their faith in the future.91.	The African countries are suffering particularly from the consequences of the present world economic crisis  and from the phenomenon of desertification  which affects most of them. Afflicted by drought  the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian area  including Guinea-Bissau  have experienced desert creep  a decrease in their agricultural capabilities and destruction of their cattle  without at the same time having the means necessary to enable them to cope with such situations.92.	The impoverishment of Africa and the third world in general has thus reached alarming proportions  proportions which jeopardize the very possibility of survival for millions of human beings tragically affected by hunger and sickness.93.	Nevertheless  nothing can justify acceptance of hunger as a necessary evil of our time. Nor can the absence of adequate measures for the eradication of this scourge be justified when it is borne in mind that there are enormous food surpluses elsewhere  in other countries  the rational utilization of which would make it possible to save millions of human lives.94.	In the light of this gloomy and regrettable state of affairs  1 think no one can deny the historic responsibility borne by our northern partners  regardless of their socio-political and economic systems  to be actively involved in efforts to promote collective prosperity.95.	In this connection  we hope that the appeal made by the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will help produce a heightened awareness of this tragedy and encourage the specific emergency measures the situation dictates.96.	The question of peace  the relationship of which to development seems for the time being only to be viewed theoretically  is also a constant preoccupation of mankind.97.	General and complete disarmament  which is often erroneously presented as a matter within the exclusive purview of the major military Powers  is one of the essential prerequisites for strengthening world security and creating a climate that would favour the advent of genuine global peace.98.	The rechanneling of the tremendous resources now being used for military purposes so that they may be used to further the economic and social progress of the developing countries in particular would in this connection be a heartening sign of humanity's choice to realize its profound aspirations to peace  progress and happiness through a clear-sighted  consistent and beneficial action. This is  essentially  an indispensable step towards the establishment of the new international economic order  to which we all aspire.99.	The current international situation makes it necessary for us once again to express our extreme disquiet at the recrudescence of violence  instability and insecurity in various parts of the world.100.	The persistence and constant deterioration of areas of tension in the Middle East  southern Africa  Central America and southern Asia  as well as the scant signs of any positive developments in these matters make us wonder about our capacity to handle the present problems and a fortiori any others that might arise in the future.101.	Thus  for example  although it is unacceptable and has been the subject of unanimous condemnation  the attitude of South Africa and Israel has still not been dealt with effectively by the international community. The arrogance displayed by those two States and their total scorn for the principles and norms of international law  the resolutions and decisions adopted by various bodies of the United Nations and all the initiatives that have been taken internationally can only be explained by the considerable support provided by their economic and military allies. The continuation of this situation is a threat to international peace and stability and clearly indicates the increasingly marked trend in certain States to seek simply to serve their own interests to the detriment of the rights of other peoples.102.	Our solidarity must be ever more active vis-Ã -vis the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Palestine  as also those countries that border on those bastions of apartheid and zionism  by way of defending their national independence and their territorial integrity.103.	The effective support of the international community for the liberation movements in southern Africa  in particular the ANC and SWAPO; should be aimed at providing a clear-cut affirmation of the justice of their struggle and the need for full realization of the inalienable rights of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa to independence  progress and social justice.104.	Full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the most appropriate way of ensuring Namibia's swift and peaceful accession to independence. The attempts to link that country's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola are nothing more than a delaying tactic which the United Nations and the vast majority of its Members have rejected out of hand.105.	The self-styled constitutional reforms and the semblance of a democratic trend in South Africa can surely only be construed as an insidious attempt to improve cosmetically the racist image of the apartheid regime. Furthermore  the genuine reasons for this scenario are quite obvious: the further alienation of the black majority from political life in the country and the accentuation of racial stratification by arousing dissension in non-white communities and justifying the inhuman treatment inflicted on the black populations.106.	Guinea-Bissau subscribes to Security Council resolution 554 (1984)  which rejected the so-called new constitution. We should like here to express our full solidarity with the patriots of South Africa who have courageously and resolutely opposed this new manoeuvre on the part of the South African regime  thus issuing a heartfelt appeal to the universal conscience that steps be taken to make it possible to eradicate the odious system of apartheid.107.	The extraordinary summit meeting of the heads of State of African countries whose official language is PortugueseâAngola  Cape Verde  Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principeâon 27 April last in Maputo  reaffirmed the unflagging support of our five countries for the struggle of the fraternal peoples of Namibia and South Africa. The summit went on to emphasize that as long as apartheidâbeing  as it is  the main factor leading to tension and destabilization in the regionâ continued to exist  there could be no genuine peace in that part of the African continent.108.	The summit also welcomed the negotiating process initiated in southern Africa and reaffirmed its solidarity with the frontline States  the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique in particular  in their efforts to preserve their national independence and territorial integrity.109.	Guinea-Bissau  which is aware of its own responsibilities in the total liberation of the African continent from all forms of domination and oppression  would  in the light of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes among States  lend its support to any initiative that would take into account the expressed interests of the Namibian and South African peoples regarding peace and stability in southern Africa.110.	In the Middle East  it is quite obvious that as long as there is no solution of the Palestinian issueâ a solution that should involve full exercise of the Palestinian people's legitimate right to create a sovereign and independent Stateâand as long as Israel continues illegally to occupy Arab territories  there can be no real possibility of peace in the area.111.	The seriousness and complexity of the explosive situation prevailing in that part of the world fully justify the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties concerned  including  quite obviously  the PLO  the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people.112.	Although we have achieved noteworthy results  particularly in the process of decolonization  along the lines laid down in the historic General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  it must at the same time be admitted that this is a matter still at the forefront of our attention. Particularly on the African continent  certain Territories are still subject to foreign domination  despite the repeated efforts made by the international community to liberate them.113.	In this connection  the situation prevailing in northwest Africa  where there is still a dangerous source of tension and conflict  is a matter of particular concern to us. We regret that resolutions on the question of Western Sahara adopted at the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983/ and at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which  inter alia  advocate direct negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO  have as yet not been implemented. However  were those resolutions implemented  that would undoubtedly be a factor of prime importance  not only in ushering in peace in the region  but also in laying the groundwork for strengthening the unity of the peoples involved and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  and the advent of a greater Maghreb.114.	We would like to reiterate our continued support of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Frente POLISARIO in their just struggle for the independence of Western Sahara.115.	The situation in Chad is also a matter of concern to us. Here  we remain convinced that the solution to the problem of Chad should be an internal one  free from any external interference. That is why we hope that the recent developments in Chad will help to promote a settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the OAU and also serve to safeguard the higher interests of the people of Chad.116.	We could not give any coherent account of the history of decolonization or talk about the right of every people freely to determine its destiny without referring to the question of East Timor. The repression and massacre of the Maubere people are facts that no member of the international community  whatever its socio-political system or ideology  could possibly overlook. The final solution of that question presupposes recognition of the inalienable right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and independence and requires that negotiations be held among all the parties concerned  namely  FRETILIN "" Indonesia  and Portugal as the legal administering Power.117.	We believe that the steps taken by the representative of the Secretary General to find the necessary conditions for a final solution to this problem should be pursued and should enjoy the support of the parties concerned and of the international community.118.	My country supports the plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea and welcomes the efforts that have been undertaken to make it possible for this legitimate aspiration of the Korean people to be satisfied.119.	Safeguarding the national unity  territorial integrity and nonaligned character of Cyprus is also something that enjoys our full support. That is why we should like to commend the efforts made by the Secretary General to achieve those ends.120.	The persistent tensions in South Asia  Central America and the Caribbean do not augur well for any lasting solution or any return to peace and stability as long as the legitimate rights of all States in those regions to the free conduct of their own affairs and the free choice of their economic  social and political systems are not respected.121. The action of the Contadora Group to establish a climate of peace and understanding in Central America through dialogue and concerted effort deserves our encouragement. We believe that all the countries in the region  and particularly Nicaragua  should be in a position  quite free from any external interference  to resolve their domestic problems and create the necessary conditions for peace and development in their respective countries.122.	My country is increasingly disturbed by the tragic situation prevailing in the Gulf as a result of the war between Iran and Iraq. Once again we urge those two member countries of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Nonaligned Countries to opt for the path of negotiation  which is the only way in which the higher interests of the Iranian and Iraqi peoples can be safeguarded and the only way they can be guaranteed the peace that they so sorely need if they are to make progress within their respective frontiers.123.	In recent years  Guinea-Bissau has suffered from drought  a drop in agricultural output and declining exports. The deterioration of climatic conditions  together with the devastating effect of the world economic crisis at large  is one of the main concerns of the people and Government of Guinea Bissau. That is why our Government is making every effort to stimulate agricultural output  particularly by having production support sectors whose commerce  transport and warehousing infrastructures will help to guarantee self-sufficiency in foodstuffs and an increase in exports.124.	The implementation of the first national development plan is thus responsive to our country's desire to structure the economy by adapting it to the requirements of the process of economic and social development. It is in this context that  with the assistance of UNDP  this year we organized a round table involving the main trading partners of Guinea Bissau. A rapid follow-up to the conclusions reached at that meeting will lead to the implementation of measures required for the stabilization and revamping of our economy.125.	On behalf of my Government  I should like to take this opportunity to thank all those countries and governmental and nongovernmental organizations which took part in that round table for their clearly expressed desire to develop fruitful cooperation with Guinea-Bissau.126.	As we approach the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  despite its difficulties and weaknesses  we think it is quite legitimate to rejoice at its achievements. But there can be no doubt that a great deal remains to be achieved and that the responsibilities weighing on the United Nations are becoming ever heavier.127.	We are convinced that the realization of the hopes of the peoples we represent here if within the grasp of the human resources and immense wealth available on this planet.128.	Man's creative genius  judiciously used for peaceful purposes  can help to eliminate sickness  hunger  poverty and injustice and to promote the collective prosperity for which we all yearn so deeply. It is the duty and responsibility of our States to work to create peace in the world and to mobilize available resources in order to achieve development objectives on a global scale. Our efforts must be collective; they must all be focused on a better state of understanding among our nations; they should dispel mistrust and tension  thus making it possible to consolidate the bases for global cooperation which will serve the interests of all mankind"
"58",2762,"GNQ",39,1984,"ï»¿It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly. We are convinced that the work of this session will be crowned with success and that the statements of the representatives of the various Member States of the Organization and the conclusions and recommendations arrived at on the items on the agenda will be governed by reason and justice.2.	As once again we begin our work  I should like to convey the sincere good wishes of Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  for harmonious progress in the work of this session of the General Assembly and for success in the adoption of resolutions and decisions at the end of our work. We express the hope that those resolutions and decisions will become a reality and will not result in mere rhetorical or sterile expressions of ideals which  far from proving viable  fair and equitable  will only give rise to conflicts  worsen divisions and promote extremism  in complete contradiction of the spirit of the Charter signed at San Francisco.3.	Equatorial Guinea  my country  believes that it is essential to increase efforts to promote better relations and respect for the equality of all peoples in the world  to guarantee the sacred principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to achieve its goals. The prestige and the authority of the United Nations must be strengthened. This is particularly necessary at the present time when dialogue is becoming increasingly difficult and force is likely to be used because of the juxtaposition of the interests at stake.4.	The unanimous election of Mr. Lusaka as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly is not only a source of pride and satisfaction for Equatorial Guinea but also a recognition of the determination of the country which he represents  Zambia  to remain faithful to the ideals of peace  justice and freedom and to maintain the dignity of man  despite temporary setbacks and difficulties. We are therefore convinced that with his qualities  professional experience and dedication he will fulfil the responsibility of guiding the destiny of this session in a most exemplary manner.5.	Similarly  we express our appreciation and thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who  while carrying out his important and diverse functions as Head of State of Panama  guided the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly with outstanding competence and skill.6.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization presents a clear and complete description of the complexity of the problems facing the world. It merits our deep appreciation and it can assist us in examining the items of the agenda with which we have to deal. We should like to express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary- General for the valuable work that he is doing as the head of the Organization. We wish him every success in the difficult but highly honourable task entrusted to him in bringing about a better world.7.	The admission of a new Member to the United Nations family has always been a source of happiness for my delegation. The recent admission of the State of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations gives us great satisfaction since this represents  among other things  a practical step towards the universality of the United Nations. We welcome and congratulate that new Member and look forward to its contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and the establishment of fruitful co-operation in building an empire of justice for the protection and well-being of peoples.8.	As I stated from this rostrum when I spoke at the 30th meeting of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  following the changes which took place in the country in August 1979  has successfully carried out the difficult but noble task of establishing a democratic system. This has led to the effective establishment of executive  judicial and legislative systems in keeping with our constitution. Notable progress has been made in the social and political life of the country  which is reflected in the peace and tranquillity which prevails.9.	Unfortunately  notwithstanding the unceasing efforts of the Government  the economic situation of my country  which is purely the result of the situation we inherited from the previous period and the general world economic crisis  is beset by many difficulties which have yet to be overcome. Equatorial Guinea  one of the least developed countries  is in a state of devastation and a direct victim of the most harmful effects of the world crisis.10.	Nevertheless  my Government has worked to lay solid foundations for harmonious economic development  to rehabilitate our country and to bring about development in general. Negotiations at the sub regional level in Central Africa led to Equatorial Guinea's joining of the Central African Customs and Economic Union during the meeting of the Council of Heads of State of that organization held at Bangui in December 1983. Similarly  on 27 August this year  the President of the Republic signed the treaty admitting Equatorial Guinea to the Bank of Central African States. We believe that our national endeavours will thus become a part of the endeavour of the sub region to combat the underdevelopment  hunger and poverty which afflict our peoples.11.	In the context of this effort to bring about rehabilitation and development in my country  I should like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of my Government appreciation for the assistance which friendly countries and international bodies have constantly provided to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea since 3 August 1979. Nevertheless  given the long road before us  we trust and hope that this assistance will be expanded and further diversified on the basis of General Assembly resolution 38/224 of 20 December 198312.	On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization  the economic situation of the over-whelming majority of Member States in this great family is becoming increasingly critical and the possibility of overcoming this crisis seems increasingly remote  while the instability which currently characterizes international relations continues. Al-though some improvements have been made on the political  social and cultural levels  the influence of ideological blocs  so-called strategic interests  and selective protection of human rights  based on criteria which do not take into account the special characteristics of countries and peoples  lead us to conclude that  generally speaking  negotiations to remedy current inequalities and imbalances are deadlocked.13.	The Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  meeting at Lagos in 1980  the Political Declaration adopted by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in 1983  the intense activity by the Group of 77  the recent proposals of the 11 Latin American countries to solve their external debt problemsâto mention only a fewâare initiatives which should be matched by the developed countries  which should co-operate to ensure a fair exchange between North and South. We must accept the reality that growth and stability in the North and accelerated development in the South are interrelated. The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  if the wealthy countries were to see the light  could be remembered as the anniversary that saw the beginning of a new stage of progress towards a better world.14.	The worsening of the present international economic crisis emphasizes the vital need to apply the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in relations between States  taking into account the fact of interdependence regarding trade. The constantly increasing deficits in the balance of payments of underdeveloped countries and their growing foreign debt must be compensated by fair prices for the raw materials they produce and the establishment of appropriate measures to make possible not just increased wealth for rich countries but also a considerable improvement in the economic conditions of poor nations 15.	We hope that the economic resolutions and recommendations adopted by the General Assembly at the present session will not simply confirm the need for the developed countries to contribute to the economic recovery of the poor countries in general  but will result in a practical  positive reaction in the form of contributions to this end. We also hope that international financial organizations will set an ex-ample by contributing to the attainment of these objectives.16.	In contradiction to the provisions of the Charter  the progress in science and technology achieved by some Member States is used against the interests of peace and international security under the pretext of protecting their interests. Such progress is being used even in the pursuit of ways to exterminate mankind. While Equatorial Guinea shares the view that the future of mankind is the responsibility of all countries  the great Powers  judging by their own declarations  have primary responsibility in this area. The negotiations at Geneva should be resumed and should be used to reduce geographical distances and ideological differences. The political will of States should be brought into harmony with the higher interests of mankind on questions which are already accepted by a consensus and which we cannot ignore.17.	Considerable financial resources go to produce and develop weapons of all kinds. Millions of human beings in various parts of the worldâAfrica  Asia and Latin Americaâare being wiped out by drought  hunger  poverty and disease  as well as by natural disasters of atmospheric origin which also destroy considerable natural resources. This happened in my own country recently. We believe that these ills are so serious that scientific  technological and financial resources must be made available to check them. We appeal for international solidarity for the solution of the problem of drought  with the provision of special  immediate assistance to the countries which are the victims of this unprecedented horror.18.	While those with great stockpiles of armaments continue to arm themselves for defensive purposes  supposedly against the threat of war  weak countries also have the right to life. Thus it is necessary  in theory and in practice  to help to wind down the arms race  with the corresponding reduction in military expenditures  and to struggle to eliminate international mercenarism and terrorism  which merely contribute to the destruction of the economic and political equilibrium of independent countries.19.	The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the stepping up of the production of other kinds of weapons of mass destruction  allegedly for reasons of security and self-protection  only help to make more probable the victory of the ills afflicting the poor countries: hunger  poverty and disease. We have heard so many ringing declarations on disarmament  calling for a freeze  the prohibition and reduction of nuclear weapons  a ban on the testing  production and use of nuclear weapons and chemical and biological weapons  the prevention of nuclear confrontation and all the other proposals which we have been hearing in the General Assembly over the last few years. It is high time that these became reality; only then shall we feel protected and only then will world peace and security become a reality.20.	Equatorial Guinea is gravely concerned by the present situation in which men  women and children in all countries of the third world are the innocent victims of the misapplication and faulty channelling of the abundant resources available in the most developed countries  which increases dependence and deprivation of the poor countries. We need relevant programmes and projects for hygiene  housing and foodstuff production to meet the basic requirements of the neediest populations.21.	It is not unduly optimistic to acknowledge the great work carried out by the United Nations in its almost 40 years of existence  nor to emphasize that certain items on its agenda minimize the importance and value of its activities. Now that apartheid South Africa is showing its true colours  the independence of Namibia recedes further into the distance. This is in flagrant violation of many General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and outright contempt for international public opinion.22.	We reiterate our position that South Africa's presence in Namibia is illegal and must be ended. We renew our support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and reaffirm that conditions and circumstances outside the Territory of Namibia should not affect or delay the process of its independence.23.	It is surprising to observe that  although every State Member of the United Nations agrees on the need to maintain international peace and security  this unanimity is not reflected in the implementation of the relevant resolutions. In South Africa  the black majority continues to suffer the effects of the policy of apartheid. This system that has been imposed on the majority is abhorred by all  but many appear to be selective in condemning it  and various economic  strategic and ideological interests seem to be in conflict with the efforts to eradicate it. That makes it all the harder to achieve the great objective of the protection and defence of fundamental human rights and freedoms. We must reflect seriously on this and  even though it may be difficult  accept the fact that nature itself calls for recognition of the right of all people to enjoy equal rights  and hence the abolition of apartheid must be brought about.24.	The Republic of Equatorial Guinea hopes that African wisdom and the spirit of solidarity will lay the foundation so that the various Governments now controlling the destiny of the continent will avoid any situation that could lead to the collapse of the Organization of African Unity. In this connection  we welcome any peaceful and constructive initiative for resolving the conflicts in Chad and Western Sahara in accordance with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.25.	In the Middle East  Israel's occupation of Arab countries continues  and poverty  hunger and death remain common currency in Lebanon. On behalf of those innocent victims who fall day after day in that solely afflicted area  we appeal to all parties involved in that painful and protracted conflict to end the tragedy  through the use of dialogue and negotiation  in a spirit free of pride and passion and on the basis of realism  recognizing the right of the Palestinian people to establish its own State in the region and the right of Israel to continue to exist within legal and secure borders  as well as Lebanon's recovery of its sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence.26.	We are disturbed at the tension prevailing in Central America. We urge all the parties involved to have recourse to dialogue to find solutions to the differences that have arisen  with strict respect for the right of peoples to determine the political and economic systems most in accordance with their national interests.27.	We support and encourage the efforts of the Contadora Group towards the peaceful and just settlement of the conflict in Central America  a region to which Equatorial Guinea is bound by historical and cultural ties. We hope that the Contadora Group will arrive at a comprehensive solution of the problem so as to bring about a restoration of overall peace and security in that region.28.	We reiterate our solidarity with the Argentine Republic with regard to its just and legitimate claim over the Malvinas Islands  and we hope there will be a resumption of and rapid progress in the negotiations with the United Kingdom in the spirit and the context of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.29.	Kampuchea  a State Member of the Organization  continues to be the scene of violent acts because of the intervention of foreign forces in that country. We reiterate our support for and solidarity with a course of action guaranteeing the return of all Kampucheans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and the search for a peaceful solution ensuring respect for national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  not only of Kampuchea but of all the countries of the region. The relevant resolutions of the five past regular sessions of tin General Assembly and the Declaration on Kampuchea I have laid the necessary foundations for a broad political settlement of the problem.30.	In Afghanistan  there are no signs that the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of that country are being preserved  in spite of the appeals by the international community to the effect that only the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan can guarantee the inalienable right of the Afghan people to determine the form of Government and political and economic system most in keeping with their interests  without outside interference or influence. Accordingly  the efforts of the Secretary- General to find a peaceful solution which could facilitate the return of Afghan refugees to their own country should receive support  so as to establish the necessary guidelines for the restoration of peace and tranquillity both in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries which are victims of the situation prevailing in South-West Asia.31.	The war between Iran and Iraq  brother countries and neighbours  continues to be a cause for considerable concern and anxiety for Equatorial Guinea as for the entire international community. This conflict has gone on for five years. Human lives have been sacrificed  and the results of the efforts of both countries for the reconstruction of their economies have been reduced to naught. This not only impedes the harmonious development of their populations but considerably affects international economic and commercial relations. From this rostrum  we appeal for political will by the Government of Iran and the Government of Iraq so that they may see reason and consider the right to life and the need to preserve human dignity  putting an end to the unjust war imposed on Iranians and Iraqis.32.	We note with consternation that the results hoped for concerning some questions that have been considered by the United Nations in past decades have not been produced. A recent eloquent confirmation of this is the artificial division by outside forces that has been inflicted on the Republic of Cyprusâa sovereign  independent and non-aligned country and a Member of the United Nations. At a time when the international community is promoting the ideals of reunification of peoples divided by political and ideological interests  the partitioning of Cyprus can-not but undermine those ideals. Given this sad state of affairs  Equatorial Guinea appeals for efforts to preserve the unity of Cyprus and bring about harmony between the different Cypriot communities.33.	We call for the peaceful unification of the Korean peninsula and invite the leaders of the respective Governments to create the propitious conditions which would make possible the resumption of negotiations which  we hope  will conclude to the satisfaction of all the Korean people. Interested third countries should work to ensure the success of a process for peaceful reunification so that Korea can take within the concert of nations the place to which it is entitled.34.	Finally  we propose that consideration be given to taking up the observations and proposals of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organizationâhis thirdâconcerning the strengthening of the role of the Organization and the efficient and smooth functioning of its bodies and specialized agencies  with particular emphasis on those which are directly involved in the social  economic and cultural development and advancement of developing countries."
"59",2807,"GRC",39,1984,"ï»¿Let me first of all extend to Mr. Lusaka our warmest congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. At a time when international problems are becoming' increasingly acute  his outstanding qualities  great experience and long and distinguished record within the United Nations are the best guarantees that he will carry out his heavy responsibilities with ability and success.263.	I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Illueca  an old and devoted friend of my country  for his excellent performance during the last 12 months.264.	The Secretary-General also deserves our congratulations and gratitude for his unflinching devotion to duty and his noteworthy initiatives in the service of peace and of the good functioning of the United Nations.265.	Lastly  I would like to welcome the latest Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam  and wish its people and Government happiness and success.266.	The President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  Mr. Peter Barry  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland  has already presented to the Assembly [6th meeting] with eloquence and clarity the position of the 10 member States of the Community on the main questions we face today. I will therefore focus my statement on certain specific subjects to which my country attaches particular importance.267.	The Greek Government shares the general concern over the threats to and violations of peace. We have no illusions as to the possibilities of a small country to influence world developments of such magnitude. We believe  however  that every country  no matter what its potential  bears a major responsibility in fostering an international awareness of the need for peace  especially in an age when the nuclear- arms race has assumed alarming proportions. It is in this context that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has participated in the common appeal contained in the Joint Declaration of the Presidents of Argentina Mexico and the United Republic of Tanzania and the Prime Ministers of India and Sweden to freeze the production and development of nuclear weapons.268.	The Greek Government  however  did not limit itself to an appeal to the super-Powers. It seeks firmly and consistently to create  together with Greece's neighbouring countries  a nuclear-weapon- free zone in the Balkans. In order to promote the establishment of such a zone  a first conference of experts of the Balkan countries was convened at Athens in January and February 1984. My Government attaches great significance to those efforts and intends to pursue them persistently. It is particularly pleased to see that the inter-Balkan dialogue  which aims at further developing the existing friendly and good-neighbourly relations among Balkan peoples  has been enriched with the security factor. My Government is also firmly convinced that the second meeting of experts due to be held at Bucharest will give new impetus to this worthy endeavour.269.	But nuclear disarmament is only one side of the coin. Conventional weapons have acquired such destructive capabilities that had they been reached during the last war one wonders where humanity would be today. In assessing the importance of conventional disarmament  we should also bear in mind that the imbalances in this field are one of the important reasons why many countries had to resort to nuclear weapons in order either to defend them-selves or to gain supremacy.270.	On the other hand  since military build-ups are caused by suspicion and a feeling of insecurity  it is evident that to break this vicious circle all the countries of the world  whether or not they belong to military alliances  should work consistently to pre mote detente and understanding among them. The need for universal support of all peace initiatives  whatever their provenance  can hardly be over-emphasized.271.	While on the subject of world peace  I should like to pay a tribute to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which  despite the Cassandras who so often predict its extinction  thrives and perseveres in its efforts to instil moderation in a world of confrontation.272.	Another main goal of Greek foreign policy is the consolidation of peace and the promotion of co-operation in the Mediterranean. While not sparing any effort to achieve that goal  we must recognize that developments often seem to move in the opposite direction. The areas of tension in the Mediterranean have not disappeared. Foreign armies continue to occupy territories which do not belong to them  while trying to hide the face of the conqueror behind the mask of the protector. It is a matter of gratification that the international community has the capacity to see through such attempts at deception.273.	One typical problem the solution of which is very much hampered by outside interference is that of Cyprus. I would very much have preferred if circumstances were such that I did not need to raise this question once again. After all  the subject has  for a number of years  been on the agenda of the United Nations  which through its various organs has repeatedly reiterated the unequivocal position of the international community in this respect. However  in spite of the fact that the United Nations  time and again  has pointed the way to a proper solution  the sovereignty of the independent Republic of Cyprus is still being violated by the continued occupation of a large part of its territory by armed forces of Turkey. I cannot but once again draw the Assembly's attention to the fact that its numerous resolutions  as well as those of the Security Council  have not been implemented by Turkey.274.	The Secretary-General recently took new steps to find a fair and viable solution to the Cyprus problem  in accordance with his good offices mission  which was most recently reaffirmed by the Security Council in its resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).275.	Greeceâwhich maintains a special relation-ship with the Republic of Cyprus  mainly because of the century-old ethnic and cultural bonds between Greeks and Greek Cypriotsâis following with great attention the evolution of this initiative. My Government has repeatedly stated that it is lending the Secretary-General its full support. We wish him every success in his difficult task. The Government of Cyprus has responded most positively in all phases of his initiative. A new round of talks between the two communities of the Republic of Cyprus will begin on 15 October. Our wish is that the Turkish side will respond in that forthcoming round of talks as positively as the Greek Cypriot side  so that progress can be achieved in this international dispute so fraught with danger.276.	The occupation of Cyprus is  however  not the only violation of international law and order in the eastern Mediterranean. The failure as yet to find a solution to the Middle East problem  which in the past so often threatened peace  even today causes dangerous tensions in that sensitive area  which is of particular importance to my countryânot only be-cause of its geographical proximity but also because of the traditional ties of friendship that we maintain with the Arab world.277.	The elements of the problem are of course well known. My Government's position  which has often been stated in the past and remains unchanged  is also well known. We consider that a basic pre-condition for the achievement of a peaceful settlement is the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967âcontrary  of course  to the wish of the international community as repeatedly expressed in numerous United Nations resolutions. We support the Palestinians' right to self- determination  which includes the right to have their own independent State. We believe that the PLO  as the representative of the Palestinian people  has a significant role to play as a full member in the peace negotiations  which should be undertaken with the participation of all the interested parties.278.	My Government attaches particular importance to the safety of the inhabitants of the occupied territories and to respect for their human rights  which have so often been violated over the past 17 years. At the same time  we believe that actions which would result in changing the legal status  the geographical or natural conditions  and the demo-graphic composition of the occupied territories  including Jerusalem  should be abandoned and all unilateral measures and faits accomplis revoked  because they are contrary to international law and are a major obstacle to peace efforts. Together with the Palestinian people's right to self-determination  we support  without reservation  Israel's right to a secure existence within internationally recognized borders.279.	The situation in Lebanon is an important element of the Middle East problem. Recent developments in that war-torn country may permit some optimism as regards its future. In particular  the Government of National Unity has clearly shown its firm willingness to restore the national consensus. We earnestly hope that that fundamental endeavour will be successful.280.	My Government supports all developments which would guarantee the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the restoration of the authority of its Government over the whole of the Lebanese territory. In that connection  Israel should  without further delay  withdraw its occupation troops from southern Lebanon.281.	The Greek Government deeply regrets the prolongation of the war between Iran and Iraq. We are particularly concerned because hostilities have spread in such a way as to cause heavy human suffering and material damage for both countries and to endanger significantly the interests of third countries not involved in the conflict  especially owing the erection of obstacles to free navigation through the Gulf. Greece appeals once more to both parties to cease hostilities and to start negotiations for a just and honourable settlement.282.	Another cause of concern to my Government in Asia is the continuing occupation of Afghanistan and of Kampuchea. We stress the urgent need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from those two countries and for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions  as well as for a negotiated settlement  which would permit Afghanistan and Kampuchea to regain their independence and non- aligned status and at the same time would allow the Afghans and the Kampucheans freely to choose their social and economic system and their form of government.283.	In South America  there was a very significant development at the end of last year: the restoration of democracy in Argentina. We think that the international community should give President Alfonsin and his Government the support they need to consolidate the rule of law and to overcome the serious economic difficulties inherited from the military dictatorship  and we hope that the example of Argentina will be followed by other countries in that region which are governed by authoritarian and often tyrannical regimes. We are  in particular  worried about the total lack of progress towards the restoration of democracy in Chile  a country which  before the military coup of 1973  enjoyed one of the most genuinely democratic regimes in Latin America. My Government vigorously condemns the unrelenting violation of human rights and the repression in Chile and grants its unequivocal support to the political forces which struggle for the return of their country to democracy.284.	The situation in Central America  on the other hand  continues to be very serious. It is our firm conviction that the problems of the area cannot be solved by military means  but only through a political solution stemming from the region itself  without outside interference. Needless to say  we attach the utmost importance to strict respect for human rights and to the establishment of democratic conditions wherever such conditions do not exist. We should like also to underline the importance of the various initiatives undertaken by the Contadora Group  including the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  which has been approved by the countries of the region and which  if faithfully implemented  could constitute a great step towards the settlement of the crisis in Central America.285.	Next year we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Over the past years  the membership of the Organization has more than trebled as  one after another  various dependent Territories have won their independence. In certain cases  the transition was achieved through comparatively peaceful means. In other cases  the natural desire of the people to obtain their human and political rights was fulfilled only after harsh and bloody struggle. It is our sincere hope that the few Territories remaining under colonial rule will attain independence as soon as possible through peaceful means.286.	I should like to refer more particularly to the problem of Namibia  since the United Nations is actively involved in the efforts for its solution. South Africa continues to keep Namibia under its domination  despite the repeated and unanimous calls of the General Assembly. Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was accepted by the parties  provides both the framework and the necessary mechanisms for allowing the people of Namibia to gain their independence and to decide on their future through free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. If that resolution has not been implemented so far  the responsibility does not lie solely with South Africa. In the last analysis  it is up to us all to see to it that the will of the international community is not indefinitely ignored with impunity by the Pretoria Government.287. But South Africa's wrongdoing is not limited to its illegal occupation of Namibia. It also persists in maintaining the inhuman system of apartheid which has given rise to universal indignation and condemnation. Discrimination  racial or otherwise  is unacceptable  in whatever guise it may appear. It is  however  even more unacceptable when it is made an official way of life  depriving the overwhelming majority of a people of its most elementary human and political rights. Equally reprehensible are efforts to perpetuate apartheid  either through attempts to create fictional political entities or through granting limited rights to sections of the majority  with the ultimate aim of splitting it. We condemn the home-lands policy and the resulting fragmentation of the black population of South Africa.288 I conclude my reference to Africa by stressing the constructive role played by the OAU in promoting co-operation among African countries and in consolidating the national identity of its member States in the economic and political spheres. That organization has proved to be a very important factor for political stability and progress in Africa  and for world peace.289.	One of the main gains in the area of human rights is the agreement on a draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  which has been submitted to the Assembly for approval. Greece  which actively participated in drawing up this draft convention  welcomes the success of the efforts of the Commission on Human Rights and considers the adoption of the convention to be an important step against the practice of torture. We sincerely hope that it will be fully respected by all and that it will not remain a simple declaration of intent.290.	Speaking more generally about human rights  I should like to stress that our vigilance for their respect should not be governed by expediency. We would  indeed  be rendering a dismal service to the victims if we were to adopt a double standard and limit our interest and our concern to countries or areas where this is politically convenient to each of us.291.	The North-South dialogue has unfortunately not justified the expectations of those who had hoped that it would lead to a more equitable economic order. The difficult international economic situation and the slow rhythm of recovery of most developed economies are probably the main reason for this. In spite of recent efforts  it has not yet been possible to launch global negotiations.292.	Our common efforts should continue until this aim has been achieved. It is evident  however that the developed countries have a major role to play. For its part  my Government will do all it can to contribute to this.293.	Greek foreign policy as regards relations with other countries  and the international situation in general  has always been characterized by the strictest respect for international law and treaties. The Charter of the United Nations  which is the corner-stone of our policy  is perhaps the finest code of conduct ever devised to govern relations between States. One of its basic principles is the renunciation of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Greek Government is deeply attached to this principle. If only it could be universally accepted  most if not all of the major problems that beset humanity today could find their solution in dialogue and negotiation.294.	Unfortunately this is not the case. That is why the United Nations is accused by many of failure and inadequacyâeven bankruptcy.295.	Greece is fully aware that the Organization has not been able to fulfil all the expectations of the peoples of the earth and that it has failed to satisfy their deep need for peace  freedom and security  especially after the tragic experiences of the Second World War. We are not prepared  however  to go along with unqualified condemnations and sweeping judgements. As no chain is stronger than its weakest link  so the United Nations cannot be more effective than its own Members allow it to be. My Government therefore firmly believes that  as the fortieth anniversary of this international Organization approaches  our common aim should be to find ways of strengthening it rather than reasons to criticize it; to seek means of enforcing the implementation of its principles  instead of attempting to ignore them; in short  to work together with good will in order to make it possible for the United Nations to carry out the task that was entrusted to it by its founding Members."
"60",2895,"GTM",39,1984,"ï»¿May I first be allowed to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Guatemala  our warmest and most cordial congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the thirty-ninth session. Your great human and professional qualities and well- recognized dynamism and achievements in helping to bring about the unity of the sister countries of Africa  as well as your thorough knowledge of the problems with which we deal in this forum  are a guarantee of the positive results we will.no doubt reach in our work. I offer you my delegation's cooperation in carrying out the sensitive and important tasks entrusted to you.138.	I should like to express the gratitude of Guatemala to Mr. Jorge Illueca for the excellent work done by him as President of the General Assembly at the thirty-eighth session.139.	I carry also the greetings of the people and Government of Guatemala to the Secretary-General  who has been working tirelessly for peace and harmony among the peoples of the world  a task that my country would like to encourage him to continue  with renewed faith in the principles of the United Nations.140.	I wish also to greet the representatives at this Assembly  who will have to shoulder the responsibility for the various items on the agenda of this session.141.	Guatemala would like to join other Members in welcoming Brunei Darussalam most cordially on its becoming a Member of the United Nations and to express its best wishes for the well-being of its people.142.	I should like also to thank all delegations for the resolute support extended to my country to occupy one of the vice-presidencies of the Assembly for the Group of Latin American States.143.	Guatemala  as a founding Member of the United Nations  has always followed with special interest the work done by the Organization over a period of almost 40 years to fulfil the purposes and principles that inspired it. We must recognize the fact that the United Nations  at various times and in various circumstances  has served as an instrument for the preservation of peace and security among peoples and has promoted multilateral co-operation in all fields. There is no doubt that this most important world forum has served as a framework for dialogue and understanding and has fostered the loftiest ideals of today's world.144.	From here efforts have been made to democratize international society and  by means of the peaceful settlement of disputes  the United Nations has avoided confrontations that had endangered world peace. Nevertheless  we must recognize the fact that the United Nations has been unable to avoid a great number of conflicts in the course of its history. We continue to experience regional crises that are a grave threat to peace  as well as tensions which seem to deepen between the two super-Powers  with the ensuing concern experienced by the international community. Despite various attempts and initiatives  not much progress has been made in arms control  nor do we glimpse any significant progress in the Conference on Disarmament  under the auspices of the United Nations. Most of all  there still persists the fear of nuclear confrontation which threatens to unleash the greatest catastrophe in the history of man.145.	Moreover  economic difficulties  which affect mainly the countries of the third world  still exist and  despite the recovery that we see in some highly industrialized countries  there are few short- and medium-term prospects of improvement for most States Members of the United Nations. Natural disasters have also struck various continents  and sometimes we see with frustration that economic and social development programmes are inadequate to meet the most pressing needs of mankind.146.	The international situation is certainly alarming  and it is therefore to be hoped that multilateral co-operation will materialize through the United Nations and thus facilitate the establishment of procedures and formulas that may help us overcome these serious difficulties. It is the duty of States Members of the United Nations not only to adhere to its policies but also to practise them and to adjust their conduct to the requirements which they imply.147.	For our part  we  the countries of the third world  have been establishing closer bonds of cooperation and achieving better co-ordination of our efforts so that our statements may not only be heard but also heeded  as is only just.148.	Despite these imperfections  the United Nations retains its unique universal character and is constantly enriched by the incorporation of new States as they become independent. Guatemala wishes to reaffirm its faith in the United Nations and in the principles of the Charter  but at the same time we believe that an objective evaluation of its achievements and failures should be conducted so that it may truly be the effective instrument for the achievement of peace and security.149.	I shall now briefly set forth the general lines and the most salient features of Guatemala's national and international policy.150.	In my statement last year  at the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  I listed in general terms the political  economic and social objectives of the Government headed by General Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores. Today I can state with deep satisfaction before the international community that what was promised has indeed been done and that the process of political liberalization and democratization has now been set in motion in Guatemala. The law that had established special tribunals  placing limits on the right to self-defence and the principle of due process  has been abrogated  and those who had been sentenced under the law have been pardoned. The amnesty decreed from the very outset by the Government  for the purpose of fostering  facilitating and accelerating the efforts at national reconciliation  is still in force. Thousands of Guatemalans who  directly or indirectly  had participated at some time or other in subversive activitiesâforced to do so by circumstances or misled and confused by false promisesâhave benefited from this amnesty. Peace reigns in areas that had been the scenes of conflict in former years  and this has been made possible basically by the understanding and identity of purpose achieved between the people and their authorities.151.	A spirit of solidarity now exists in Guatemala. It is a spirit that we intend to see prevail in the future also. That will make it possible for us to face  with hope  the task of the comprehensive development of all Guatemalans.152.	The Government has fostered a climate of peace and harmony  which made it possible to appeal to the conscience of Guatemalans so that those able to vote would register to do so and past irregularities would not be repeated.153.	Two and a half million Guatemalans registered to vote  exceeding the most optimistic forecasts. Elections were held for a national constituent assembly empowered to promulgate the Constitution of the Republic  a habeas corpus law and a definitive electoral law. Sixteen political parties and two civic committees  representative of the various ideological trends  having complied with the established requirements  were authorized by the Electoral College to take part in the elections.154.	The political campaign began in January this year. It culminated on 1 July in a great civic celebration  in which 1 856 000 citizensâthat is  73 per cent of those who had registeredâa number unprecedented in the history of the country came to the polling places to vote freely  without any kind of coercion.155.	We are pleased to say that these elections took place in the presence of observers of the Organization of American States  the Contadora Group and many other friendly countries  who congratulated the people and praised the way the elections had been held.156.	The Government remained absolutely neutral and fully guaranteed the honesty of this most important event. The electoral Supreme Court  a body independent of other State organs  had the responsibility for organizing the depositing and counting of the ballots. No political parties challenged the results of the elections. That is clear proof that all sectors agreed that no objections to the elections could be raised.157.	On 1 August  the National Constituent Assembly was solemnly installed  and it immediately began its work.158.	The successful conclusion of this first stage of the policy of liberalization pursued by the Provisional Government of Guatemala confirms the irreversible nature of the democratic process thus initiated. These elections are striking proof that the people of Guatemala believe in democracy and political pluralism and categorically reject violence as a means of imposing ideas.159.	The Government is ready to call for general elections in 1985  to choose a president  a congress and municipal councils  at which time the Constitutor the Republic and the constitutional laws will be promulgated. The Head of State has repeated his decision to hand over power to those who will be elected by the free and sovereign will of the people of Guatemala.160.	The public sector has also been working to strengthen the various forms of people's organizations-âassociations  co-operatives  community groupsâthat will assist in the comprehensive development of Guatemala.161.	Through political parties and their own civic organizations  the ethnic groups are represented in the National Constituent Assembly.162.	The Government has shown respect for the autonomy of the national university and the private universities. It has been in constant communication with them and has consulted them on cultural  economic and social matters of national interest. Similarly  the principle of separation of church and State has been scrupulously observed. We must emphasize that full respect has been maintained for freedom of thought and that there now exists a process of national awareness to ensure respect for human rights.163.	Guatemala demands changes and reforms in order to ensure that all Guatemalans have an equal opportunity to improve their economic and social conditions.164.	We recognize that we are a developing country and that  therefore  we must solve a number of problems deriving from that fact; that is true of most of the countries of the third world. The achievement of peace  democracy and development is a responsibility shared by all Guatemalans. We draw inspiration from the concept of a comprehensive development which  simultaneously  seeks the improvement of material life  respects human rights and preserves freedom.165.	In rural matters  the Government has worked tirelessly to ensure that those who were displaced by violence from their communities of origin are guaranteed the means for their protection  as well as sufficient food and whatever else they need to improve their economic and social conditions. Through effective co-ordination of State institutions  an ambitious programme has been started to establish new bases for development in better circumstances. Thus  in the Guatemalan highlands  model towns and villages have been established  with basic services enabling the people to cultivate their fertile land; they also receive technical and financial assistance in order to make the most of their resources.166.	Nevertheless  we must recognize that the inter-national economic crisis continues to have a negative impact on the people of Guatemala and that the groups promoting violenceâgroups financed and supplied from abroadâare trying to frustrate our efforts to achieve peace and progress in our country.167.	As a consequence of the subversive violence from which certain areas of Guatemala suffered mercilessly  especially in 1981 and 1982  thousands of Guatemalans were displaced; they abandoned their communities of origin and moved into Mexican territory  where they settled in camps close to our border. The present Government is deeply concerned at the situation of these compatriots and has therefore started negotiations with the Government of Mexico  with which it is in constant communication on this problem. By mutual agreement  we have requested the co-operation of humanitarian bodies such as the Guatemalan Red Cross  the Mexican Red Cross  the League of National Red Cross Societies  the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UNHCR for the purpose of adopting some kind of procedure to facilitate the orderly return of these refugees to Guatemala and to supply them with food  medical care and the necessary protection.168.	When they return we shall offer them housing and work  so that  in an atmosphere of peace and security  they may devote themselves to their usual endeavours in their communities of origin or other communities which are being built. Repatriation must be conducted on a voluntary basis in absolute freedom  and each of the refugees must be consulted ahead of time about his or her views on a possible return to Guatemala. Our Government is preparing to begin a procedure for direct consultations as soon as possible  and we hope that this machinery will be adopted and put into effect expeditiously. The Government of Guatemala has accepted supervision of this process by the international bodies that I have mentioned to verify full compliance with the agreed terms.169.	Quite apart from the foregoing  I am pleased to say that many Guatemalan refugees in Mexico are already returning to Guatemala of their own accord. They have been welcomed by the authorities in our country  who have given them the immediate assistance they require and transported them to their places of origin. We have reported consistently on these events at both the national and the international level.170.	To sum up  the policy involving refugees is marked by humanitarian aims and concrete actions  designed to ensure that these Guatemalans may enjoy their legitimate right to live in peace in their homeland.171.	Guatemala shares the view of the international community that respect for human rights is of fundamental importance in contributing to the achievement of individual and collective well-being and security. Respect for human rights is the constant concern of the various national sectors. Hence  my Government continues to adopt internal measures designed to protect and guarantee respect for universally recognized human rights  both individual and social.172.	In keeping with its open-door policy  as compared with other countries  Guatemala has permitted and facilitated visits of representatives not only of human rights committees but also of non-governmental organizations and various other groups concerned with human rights. Our country has nothing to hide from the international community. On the contrary  we want the truth about Guatemala to be widely known  so as to counteract certain campaigns which are encouraged abroad and whose sole purpose is to tarnish our image. In the last few years  we have received visits from various political figures  journalists and foreign correspondents  who have had interviews with leaders of various political parties and of economic  academic and religious groups  as well as with various special-interest groups.173.	My country shares the view that the international community must protect human rights  and for this reason we have co-operated with Viscount Colville of Culross  Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights  who is entrusted with the task of preparing a report on the situation of human rights in Guatemala. In August of this year he visited us again  and as in the past he was given every opportunity to carry out his important functions in the best possible conditions. The Government of Guatemala accepted a renewal of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for one more year  and we reiterate our firm desire to continue to co-operate closely with him.174.	The development of a political process with wider participation has had a very healthy effect in considerably diminishing the political violence that affected my country for a number of years. This was noted by the Special Rapporteur and by many non-governmental bodies concerned with human rights issues. We believe that international understanding and support are extremely important to Guatemala  as it will have a positive effect and help us continue the encouraging trend towards the reduction of violence and the strengthening of the democratic process.175.	Thus  Guatemala is concerned by the fact that human rights problems do not always receive objective  serious treatment by the United Nations. The practice of censuring countriesâfor political reasons or motives or because they are not part of certain military or political alliancesâfor violations of human rights is one which my country cannot accept. We cannot permit the politicization of the debate on human rights or a selective way of dealing with this question. This issue must be dealt with very carefully. The United Nations has lost some of its moral force in this connection because it has not applied the same criteria and parameters in every case. Thus  some States which commit grave violations of human rights are often not even mentioned.176.	As to international economic policy  Guatemala  like most of the States represented in this forum  is suffering the effects of the structural maladjustment of the international economic system  which has a decisive impact on domestic socio-political problems. Unless there is a renewed effort and determination on the part of the developed countries to work with the international community  it will be difficult to overcome this crisis  which has had a serious effect on the well-being of the peoples. We view with deep concern the fact that advantage has not been taken of the opportunities to improve the multilateral dialogue. The developing countries continue to face also such adverse factors as the decline in commodity prices  drastic fluctuations in exchange rates  an increase in protectionism  high interest rates  the flight of capital  the decline in development assistance and the crisis in resources being faced by multilateral financial institutions.177.	Guatemala fully identifies with the third world and supports its cause  which is that of development and peace. It participates actively in initiatives aimed at finding ways and means of establishing a more just international economic order that would eradicate inequality and the scourge of hunger  disease and illiteracy. There can be no political stability without a just and humane international order in which the sovereignty of each country over its natural resources would be recognized and in which commercial relations between developing and industrialized countries would be a reflection of equality  with a sense of co-operation and recognition of the fundamental values of the human being  whose dignity demands that he be well fed and have access to well- being and culture.178.	My delegation would like to highlight its contribution to the cause of development and South- South co-operation within the framework of the Group of 77. Within this framework  my country is actively participating in efforts being made  particularly in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Geneva and in New York  in the implementation of the Arusha Programme for Collective Self-Reliance and Framework for Negotiations  the Caracas Programme of Action  the Buenos Aires Platform5 and the Cartagena Consensus in order to develop economic cooperation among developing countries. In January of this year  Guatemala hosted a meeting of experts  in conformity with the Caracas Programme of Action  at which the issue of trade-related services was broached. Together with Central American countries  we signed the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities10 at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and in response to this common effort financial assistance was provided by Norway to facilitate the joint access of our countries to this Fund. At the same time  we approved and supported the Declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77  adopted at their meeting in New York from 26 to 28 September 1984.179.	Guatemala reiterates its concern at the reluctance shown by industrialized countries to initiate global negotiations  in which the developing countries have high expectations as regards the search for solutions to their serious economic and financial problems. We supported the Quito Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the Latin American Economic Conference  held at Quito from 9 to 13 January 1984  and we have subscribed to trade agreements of limited scope with Colombia and Mexico.180.	Latin America has a very high external debt  which makes it indispensable for the industrialized countries to show understanding and agree to fair renegotiation with the assurance of longer terms and more reasonable interest rates  thus making it possible for our peoples to increase their rate of economic growth and live not merely to pay but rather to develop better living standards.181.	As a Central American country  Guatemala is profoundly concerned about the worsening crisis in our region. There can be no doubt that we are living through dangerous and tense times. Peace and security are jeopardized by severe domestic conflicts in various countries  which could spill over and turn into generalized problems of unpredictable consequences.182.	Political  economic and social problems  indissolubly intertwined as they are  have a negative impact on Central America  but there are also adverse phenomena spawned from abroad that have an impact on our situation  rendering it even more serious.183.	Fortunately  the creative mediation of the Contadora Group has made it possible not only to maintain a frank and permanent dialogue  but also for there to be a political negotiating process  the main thrust of which is to broaden and promote detente and permanent peace in our region. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Central American countries  meeting at Panama City on 7 September last  recognized the invaluable efforts made by the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group and reaffirmed confidence in their worthwhile initiative  which marks a genuine regional alternative and a viable and appropriate framework for resolving our differences.184.	A year ago  on 9 September 1983  the five Central American countries and the Contadora Group countries adopted by consensus the Document of Objectives  which contains political  security and socio-economic principles and aspects  and the revised Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America has recently been submitted for our consideration. This is an extremely worthwhile document  comprising the observations  suggestions and proposals made by the Central American countries.185.	In Guatemala's view  this document constitutes an orderly  systematic approach to the proposals of the Governments individually  and puts forward certain formulas and machinery aimed at reconciling the various aspects of the situation where divergence has arisen. My Government feels that this document can become a binding juridical instrument and  in viewing it favourably  would point out that certain refinements in the procedure for putting into practice the commitments to be assumed must be considered. In any case  good faith and political willingness on the part of the Governments concerned are required to fulfil effectively the commitments assumed  making possible verification and control to ensure that what has been agreed upon in the pact is strictly complied with.186.	Guatemala appreciates and is grateful for the efforts of the Contadora Group and recognizes and fully appreciates its delicate task and its genuine achievements. For these reasons  the Government of Guatemala once again declares its unconditional support for this process of negotiation. We are pleased to note the general backing that has been lent in the Assembly to the Contadora Group  and we urge the international community also to contribute to this vital endeavour of concerted political effort  so that it can be translated into peace  democracy and development for Central America.187.	I should also like to mention that it was a high honour for my country to be chosen as spokesman at the recent gathering which  for the first time in the history of international relations in the Central American isthmus  brought together at San Jose  in the sister republic of Costa Rica  on 28 and 29 September  the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the European Community and of Spain and Portugal and those representing our own sister nations of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuelaâthe Contadora Groupâand the five Central American States.188.	I should like here to reaffirm that Central America is a concert of peoples and countries indissolubly linked by geography  culture  history  tradition  personalities  common interests and  above all  awareness of our common destiny and of the factors that unite us  factors that are much more important than those that may divide us. The permanent interrelation  the common objectives and our specific and tangible needs lead us to act in concert and to promote an integrated development for the benefit of our peoples so that they may achieve a life of dignity with peace  solidarity  justice and progress for allâaspirations which rest on the bedrock of a right which is inalienably ours. Further-more  to preserve Central America's unity is not merely to continue proclaiming a romantic dream or to rehearse anachronistic formulas bereft of any substance. We fully recognize the reality in our region  which is that of a group of small developing countries whose economic capacities and viability are limited by virtue of the limited dimension of our markets. Nor can we deny that various exogenous factors affect us and impinge upon our political order. United we shall have a broader realm of action to cope with the problems of our region; if separated  this possibility becomes minimal.189.	We reaffirm our commitment to achieving unityâan aspiration that is shared by our five peoples. This has been demonstrated in various ways  above all in the following: our process of integration and its institutions function reasonably well; intraregional trade continues to amount to one fifth of our total exports; interconnected electric power systems have been established; we are carrying out joint development projects  and the national experience thus gained is mutually enhancing the activities of the other countries.190.	With regard to Belize  my delegation believes that this is a propitious moment for informing the Assembly that throughout this year we have held informal exploratory meetings with representatives of the United Kingdom  with the participation of Belize  aimed at finding a just and honourable solution that would satisfy and safeguard the rights and legitimate interests of the parties concerned. The Government of Guatemala reiterates its readiness to continue these negotiations in a broad spirit of understanding  and it hopes for a similar stance from the other side. Notwithstanding what I have said  the Government of Guatemala reserves its rights over the territory of Belize and  consequently  does not recognize the independence granted to it unilaterally by the United Kingdom; nor does it recognize Belize as a State or its alleged territorial and maritime frontiers.191.	Moreover  we are in favour of continuing to strengthen our ties with the people of Belize and to lend it all manner of co-operation so that we might in the best way possible resolve the various problems affecting us.192.	The existence of colonial situations in the worldâsome recognized and others disguisedâcontinue to be an affront to the ideal of universal peace. We view with profound concern the fact that the talks between the United Kingdom and the Argentine Republic have led to no positive outcome because of the reluctance of one of the parties to discuss the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. Once again  we appeal for a renewal of this dialogue as the only way to avoid situations threatening international peace. We must not abuse dialogue; nor must we avoid it. Hence the principles of the Charter of the United Nations must be respected and Security Council resolution 502 (1982) implemented.193.	Direct negotiations between the Governments of South Korea and North Korea is the most appropriate way for the Koreans to settle the question of reunification. We consider that this should foster a process of dialogue free from external interference and in a climate of mutual confidence. The international community welcomed the recent contacts between the two countries in the wake of the natural catastrophes in South Korea. We consider this to be a positive indication of co-operation in humanitarian terms and urge the Governments of North Korea and South Korea to ask the Secretary- General to use his good offices to help bring about a solution to the Korean question.194.	With regard to the Middle East problem  the Government of Guatemala has always maintained a clear-cut position which recognizes the existence and respects the independence of the State of Israel. We once again affirm this here. At the same time  we cannot ignore the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to free self-determination or its right to regain its own territoryâthe least that can be demanded by the international community.195.	Guatemala cannot remain indifferent to the agonizing situation of Lebanon. For the last several years  the Lebanese people  once an example of democracy and economic development  have suffered aggression and violence. There must be an end to the occupation of Lebanon  and  therefore  the foreign forces that occupy part of its territory must be withdrawn forthwith. We hope that in the near future the people of Lebanon will be able to re-establish a climate of concord and peace.196.	Guatemala categorically condemns the racist policy of apartheid  which is an affront to the most elementary standards of human dignity. The situation in southern Africa is intolerable  and the international community must show its solidarity with those suffering the effects of this racial discrimination.197.	The war being waged in the Persian Gulf between the neighbouring countries of Iran and Iraq is a source of profound alarm for the international community. We deplore the loss of thousands of lives and the enormous material damage caused by this war  which  regrettably  is being waged with sophisticated and lethal weapons. We believe that the Assembly must once again appeal for dialogue and understanding to take the place of the armed confrontation which has caused such desolation and loss of life.198.	Since we subscribe to the principle of the self- determination of peoples  we support Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which recognizes Namibia's right to independence.199.	Guatemala is profoundly concerned over the arms race  particularly in the nuclear field. That is why Guatemala adhered to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which proscribes the introduction of nuclear weapons into Latin America. If the economic resources devoted by the major Powers to military expenditures and to enlarging their arsenals were used instead for the promotion of development  the living standards of mankind as a whole would markedly improve.200.	The international community  horrified by the effects of the Second World War  which cost millions of lives and caused incalculable material damage  greeted with hope the idea of creating an organization  the United Nations  which would preserve international peace and security in the future. For over four decades  there have been intensive debates in the Organization on subjects and issues of a political  economic  social and cultural nature. At times of crisis and confrontation  small and medium- sized countries  like the major Powers  have come to this forum to set forth their grievances and to ask for understanding and support. The sovereign equality of States  which presupposes the same rights and obligations for every one of the Members of the United Nations  makes this possible.201.	However  the United Nations has not always been able to respond to the challenge of history because  regrettably  strategic interests  among other things  have prevailed over the principles and norms embodied in its Charter. Mankind still has a long way to go before reason and justice can take the place of force. Human beings  by their very nature  can discriminate between good and evil; that is to say  they have free choice and act on the basis of their conscience and convictions. But all human beings do not respect the same scale of values  and the desire for domination over others is manifested in various ways. Human beings are imperfect  but they have been endowed as superior beings with intelligence  a will and feelings; therefore  they must act responsibly and learn to respect the rights of others as they respect their own. To know how to respect others is to know how to live in fellowship and share material  cultural and spiritual well-being with justice and fairness.202.	Without the human being there would be no State; therefore  the rights and duties of States must be a mirror image of the rights and duties of human beings. The State was created not to enslave and subjugate human beings  but to serve them. Thus  the United Nations  in order to realize its full potential  must not only take into account the interests of States but  above all  watch over and work for the well-being of all people. Human beings all over the world must be protected. We must combat hunger and poverty and  to the extent possible in the world of today  provide people with a life in dignity  in which they can attain their highest goals  to which they are called by a higher order.203.	My Government reaffirms its faith in and commitment to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. It is the duty of us all to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to build a new world in which peace will reign and from which hatred  racism  selfishness and lack of understanding will be banished once and for all.204.	It is the duty and obligation of each and every State Member of the United Nations to contribute to the integrated development and harmony of peoples and the elimination of the conditions of social injustice now prevailing in the world. Guatemala reaffirms its commitment to peace  freedom  democracy  and development."
"61",2940,"GUY",39,1984,"ï»¿In electing you  Sir  President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly the international community has honoured a man of remarkable talent and experience  your contribution in the United Nations has been outstanding and you have served Zambia and Africa with distinction. For us from Guyana there is special pleasure in seeing you guide our deliberations for there are long-standing and unshakeable bonds which unite your country  Zambia  and mine. On a more personal note  we greatly appreciate the role you played in cementing those bonds during the period you served as your country's first accredited representative to Guyana.91.	It gives me no less pleasure to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  for the efficiency and dignity with which he discharged his duties as President of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session.92.	With the admission of Brunei Darussalam as its 159th Member  the United Nations has moved another step closer to the goal of universality. In welcoming this new State  Guyana extends the hand of friendship and co-operation.93.	Each year the Assembly's general debate provides an opportunity for a review of the state of international relations. For the past few years  this review has indicated persistent negative trends and tendencies. This year the situation offers little reason for optimism.94.	The scourge of war  from which there is a pledge in the Charter of the United Nations to ""save succeeding generations""  is a danger now more pressing than it ever was. It is a prospect made grim not only by the gruesome rumination over the use of nuclear power on a limited basis  but also  even more chilling  by the awesome capacity possessed by some States to annihilate us all.95.	The Charter also expresses a resolve ""to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples"". This is being seriously undermined  for there is a single-minded determination to demand that all of us pursue the same model of development.96.	The militant resurgence of the power politics of yester-year has done violence to another Charter principle  that of the ""equal rights ... of nations large and small""  and relegated that principle almost to the realm of mythological musings; and the naked use of power is invoked in circumventing ""the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of International law"" sometimes even with the aim of tendering such law effete.97.	A state of generalized crisis permeates international relations. The use and the threat of the use of force in conflict resolution are on the increase. There is today aggravated resort to the military as a means of achieving nationally determined political objectives. Indeed  some Member States may already have reached the stage where  especially in relation to small States  diplomacy and negotiations have been made subservient to the exercise of military might. What we are witnessing is a re-emergence of the militarization of foreign policy and the use of organized violence as an instrument of State policy.98.	Deep-seated economic problems aggravate and are aggravated by political tensions. Freely embraced international co-operation is under serious threat. The evolution of a sense of global community seems to have come to a halt; and there is a frightening tendency to seek recourse almost exclusively to activities within the competence of the individual nation State and a selective bilateralism for development and security.99.	Development is today in many places deferred  and some Governments are faced with the prospect of  or are confronted by  social upheavals and the concomitant political unrest produced by the current environment. Despite the clear need for collective action  there is a resistance to global solutions  a resistance that is manifested in numerous ways. The North-South dialogue  for example  remains stymied by opaqueness and obscurantism.100.	Similarly  in their negotiations with the IMF  developing countries are confronted with inductile prescriptions for economic recovery. General concern over the inflexibility and appropriateness of these measures was highlighted at the Latin American Economic Conference  held at Quito on 12 and 13 January 1984  when leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries  in the Quito Declaration and Plan of Action  urged the necessity for a revision of IMF conditionality criteria which  in their present form  can endanger stability and development. The leaders called for greater importance to be attached to ""the countries' development priorities and their political and social limitations so that they may realistically cope with the internal adjustment need imposed by the present world-wide economic recession""101.	Recently  the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August  failed to yield any results beyond general commitments to greater co-operation and adherence to agreed principles. In effect  what has happened over the past few years is the continued postponement of the democratization of international relations  including reform of relevant institutions and modification of their operations.102.	In the area of international economic relations  many are the interpretations of recent developments  the analyses of the performance of the global economy and the prognoses for its future direction. Signs of recovery are visible in developed market economies  but its durability is uncertain. Furthermore  the impact of incipient recovery remains a matter of some conjecture  tad its benefits have not had a positive effect on die developing countries as a whole.103.	What is undeniable  too  is that the international community continues to face an accumulation of severe economic problems. Indeed  some of these problems have worsened precisely as a consequence of policies pursued in the name of national recovery. I will  however  refer to only a few of those problems: debt  trade issues and interest rates.104.	The international community is divided on how the debt problem should be properly approached. At the heart of this difficulty is the unwillingness of some States to recognize and appreciate that the debt problem is a global one which requires joint action. It is no longer sufficient for individual debtor and creditor countries to meet and agree on general policy guidelines for resolving the debt problem. Rather  a consensus should be found within the framework of a multilateral political dialogue which includes the participation of concerned international banks and multilateral financial institutions.105.	The countries of the Caribbean Community  which met at Nassau. Bahamas  from 4 to 7 July this year  acknowledged this imperative when they agreed that ""the debt problem must be treated internationally  as a matter of urgency  if the developing countries are to play their part in the global economy"".106.	On trade issues  protectionism commands attention. Curiously enough  protectionism is everywhere criticized. When some representatives of the developed countries met in London last June at their annual Economic Summit  they enjoined all States  industrialized and developing alike  to resist continuing protectionist measures  to reduce barriers to trade and to make renewed efforts to liberalize and expand international trade in manufactures  commodities and services. Yet protectionism is being increasingly resorted to  sometimes in quite innovative forms  with the principal effect of denying exports from the developing world access to the markets of the developed countries.107.	Those among us who profess the inherent values of free trade have a special responsibility to promote and effect the dismantling of obstructions to it.108.	The trade problem is  however  wider than that of market access. It encompasses the demand for primary commodities and commodity prices which are today weak and unstable. In our efforts to deal with this question  it is necessary to ensure arrangements which afford developing countries just and remunerative price"".109.	The factor which straddles these issues is that of interest rates  whose high level aggravates indebtedness and inhibits our capacities to discharge our debt obligations. A rise in those rates represents the transfer of resources from developing to developed countries. Such a rise also reduces the resources available to developing countries to be applied to productive activities so that such countries might be better enabled to discharge their debt obligations. Additionally  increased returns from exports can  when applied in some cases to debt servicing  produce the classic treadmill situation  that is  moving faster to avoid falling backwards  and in effect standing still.110.	So dramatic are the consequences of high interest rates that the President of the World Bank noted that the punishing effect of today's high interest rates on developing countries stood out in stark relief  and he called upon developed countries to make their reduction a priority policy matter.111.	One unchallenged growth point of international economic relations  however  has been the progressive development of economic and other forms of cooperation among developing countries. South-South co-operation has been pursued in an effort to reap the value of enhanced self-reliance  both individual and collective. Organs of the United Nations system have rendered valuable assistance in this regard. It is a matter of regret that the postures of some developed countries have been at best ambivalent or at worst downright hostile to the involvement of the United Nations system in schemes and programmes encouraging South-South co-operation. It seems inconsistent to contend that developing countries should do more to help themselves and  at the same time  withhold support from  or deliberately obstruct  efforts at assisting the self-reliance of developing countries through the activities of international organizations.112.	Turning to the course of international political relations over the last year  we note that tension has escalated to new and more dangerous levels  feelings of insecurity have intensified  and an increasingly pervasive fear of the present  and for the future  stalks many a land and grips many a people.113.	The single most disturbing factor has been the sharp deterioration in the relations between the super-Powers. The rhetoric has been shrill and bristling with hostility. A toning down of that rhetoric in favour of constructive dialogue has long been urged by many of us in the international community. It is good to note that quite recently there has been some indication of the possibility of movement in that direction. Guyana's hope is that this is no mere tactic of the moment.114.	The armaments culture  especially in the nuclear field  has developed almost with a logic of its own. It is time for the benevolent intervention of human reason for the sake of human survival.115.	Let us all at this session of the General Assembly issue a stirring call for the embrace of serious dialogue to bring an end to the maddening spiral. I believe that it would be of advantage for the Secretary-General to be given an enhanced role in that dialogue. All humankind has a stake in the successful outcome of such dialogue.116.	Pursuit of dialogue would acknowledge a concern voiced not only in the corridors of international politics  for in offices  fields and factories  in every aspect of human endeavour  the common people are expressing their deep concern about the threat to human survival. They seek to build restraints on policies which can only lead inexorably to a holocaust. The young people who in 1985 will celebrate International Youth Year stand as a potent challenge to policies which promise them little hope and security and which are not based on an ethic of survival. People all over  including the youth  demand a world which is safe  one which offers more hope for the future. Guyana is on their side.117.	In the general field of disarmament  there is a curious situation. No Member of the United Nations speaks against disarmament. Yet in the professed cause of security  armaments become more sophisticated and more numerous. At such levels of refinement  the room for error and recall become* considerably reduced. There is  as a result  a corresponding increase of the likelihood that  by some fickle and faltering twist of fortune  war may become the inevitable consequence of miscalculation. In the absence of agreed restraint  such armaments are themselves purveyors of insecurity and vectors of fear.118.	A prime task is  therefore  to decelerate the feverish preparations for war. International efforts must be urgently intensified to put a stop to the arms race and to accelerate the process towards genuine disarmament.119.	It is perhaps in the Middle East  a continuing hotbed of tension and instability  that we see demonstrated most vividly the futility of policies which seek security based on force of arms. Durable peace in that region will remain an elusive goal so long as Israel pursues  and is encouraged so to do  policies of occupation and annexation and continues to stifle the genuine political aspirations of the Palestinian people  including their right to a homeland.120.	I reiterate here Guyana's support for the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle Hast with the participation of all interested parties  including  naturally  the PLO.121.	The tragic war between Iraq and Iran continues to be a matter of deep concern. Immense losses have been inflicted  and many of us have felt anguish and pain. Its prolongation heightens the level of tension in the region  with consequences already extending well beyond it.122.	Significant changes have taken place in the economic and political configuration of southern Africa. Certain conjunctural factors have shaped and influenced those developments  but the basic generic problems of colonialism and apartheid persist and fester.123.	The recent convulsions within the South African society  engendered through protest by the oppressed  stand as incontrovertible evidence of the disposition of the majority of the people of that country. The lukewarm reaction of the so-called Coloureds and the Indians to the vaunted constitutional changes also point unmistakably to the deep malaise that afflicts that society. The vast army of the disenfranchised and despised in South Africa is entitled to ask whether the international community cannot do more to support their own efforts and so hasten the demise of the abominable apartheid system. Condemnation of apartheid is not enough  what is required is practical action to abolish it.124.	There can be no more temporizing in relation to Namibia. The independence of that country cannot be linked to any extraneous issue. Security Council resolution 43S (1978) must be implemented in its entirety. The people of Namibia  led by SWAPO  must no longer be frustrated in their march to freedom and independence. This vestige of colonialism must be extirpated once and for all.125.	How much longer must the people of Korea suffer the division of their country? The situation in the peninsula remains tense. It can  however  be improved if sincere efforts are exerted for the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea without outside interference. The proposals made earlier this year by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for tripartite talks are constructive and warrant our support126.	General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) continues to be the corner-stone for a solution to the Cyprus problem.  Efforts at the implementation of this and other pertinent resolutions have  unfortunately  not yet produced the desired results. Within the past year  the situation has been compounded by unilateral actions by the Turkish Cypriot community  actions which have no legal validity. The Secretary-General has sustained an intimate involvement in the search for a solution  the vicissitudes notwithstanding. We stand firmly behind him in his current initiatives.127.	My own region  Latin America and the Caribbean  is not immunized from tension and threats to peace and security.128.	In Central America  radical forces are counter- posed in a deepening crisis. Addressing themselves to this issue  the heads of Government of the Caribbean Community when they met at Nassau in July of this year declared: ""Notwithstanding ideological factors  the fundamental crisis faced by the people of that region was rooted in deep-seated social and economic ills."" What is of the utmost importance is the avoidance of external military intervention in seeking a solution to that crisis. I wish to reiterate Guyana's support for the efforts of the Contadora Group in its patient search to find peaceful political solutions to the problems of the sub region. All States should respect and fully support those efforts. Indeed  intervention as a policy mechanism must be abandoned in the region as a whole.129.	The independence and territorial integrity of Belize continue to be under threat from neighbouring Guatemala. Guyana once again affirms its irrevocable support for the desire of the Government and people of Belize to consolidate their independence and to guarantee their territorial integrity.130.	The explosive events in Grenada nearly a year ago caused deep trauma. The General Assembly gave its own determination on those events. Its records  which include a statement of the position of Guyana  speak for themselves. The Commonwealth heads of Government  when they met at New Delhi in November 1983  agreed  in their Final Communique  that ""the emphasis should now be on reconstruction  not recrimination"". Guyana has acted within this framework.131.	The passage of time  in relation to Grenada  can dull the memory and heal wounds  but it should not anaesthetize us to the extent that we either forget lessons or abandon principles. We must take cognizance of the fact that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly is still unfulfilled in all its parts. We must also  in the wake of that circumstance  strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for increasing the security of small States.132.	For the entire period of Guyana's existence as an independent country  relations with our neighbour  Venezuela  have been dominated by the controversy that has resulted from the Venezuelan contention that the Arbitral Award of 1899 which settled the boundary between our two countries  is null and void. Both the facts of the case and their impact on our relations with Venezuela have been presented by us to the General Assembly for the out three years. We are still some considerable way from reaching an agreement on the basis of which we can lay to rest once and for all this ghost of the past.133.	Under the terms of the Geneva Agreement of 1966  the Secretary-General has been entrusted with the task of selecting a suitable means of settlement. If the search for a peaceful solution is to be undertaken in earnest  a climate conducive to success is a prerequisite. Suspicion and distrust  which have too often infected past relations  must give way to understanding. Confidence flows from respect.134.	The Secretary-General was prescient when he asked for and obtained from both countries assurances that we would do everything necessary ""in order to foster and maintain the most favourable climate for the effective application of the Geneva Agreement"". Guyana gave that assurance readily since it has always been our wish to develop friendly relations with Venezuela. Since early this year  we have noted signs from Caracas of a desire to reciprocate and extend the hand of friendship. As it has consistently in the past  Guyana pledges that it will co-operate fully towards the attainment of a peaceful settlement in an atmosphere of friendship.135.	The future of international organizations is at this time a matter of major concern  for notions are abroad that these organizations should subscribe to a single ethos and that national priorities must be imposed upon mutual co-operation in the wider context of international peace  security and development. The practice is also recurring among the powerful of bypassing international organizations  such as the United Nations  in settling issues properly the concern of those organizations.136.	Let us recall that the Charter of the United Nations advocates universality and therefore presupposes pluralism. Diversity of perception  of position and even of posture must therefore logically follow. Thus  if international organizations are to function properly  they must reflect  in debate no less than in decision  the variety of values held by the membership. Therefore to attempt to impose a uniform value system on this or any other international organization is to endeavour to make that organization a clone of that system. Such a development would be contradictory to the purpose of international organizations and therefore self-defeating.137.	No Member of the Organization can assert with conviction that the United Nations system is sufficient to ensure its security and to protect fully all its interests. But it does provide us all with a forum in which the reconciliation of divergent and sometimes conflicting interests can be engineered. For small States like Guyana  the United Nations is also an important part of our security shield.138.	International relations are changing and complex. Our ability to cope with such a dynamic situation will be dependent on the capacity and ingenuity applied to adapting institutions to make them more adequately responsive to current needs. To desire that institutions function as if the objective conditions in which they operate are the same today as in times past is to retreat from reality  to indulge in fantasies and to pursue a chimera. But  in seeking to correct deficiencies and make organizations more effective  we must be careful lest in the fervour of our efforts some of us in effect swim against the tide of human development and perhaps inadvertently bring about a roll-back of democracy.139.	The phenomenon we are dealing with is an assault upon institutions and principles which constitute the very basis of international co-operation. 146. We are also faced with a paradox. The institutions under attack are universalist in nature and generally make extensive use of the majority principle-in decision-making. On the other hand  those institutions based on a different model and dominated by the wielders of economic power are extolled as exemplary.141.	The paradox of the threat to international co-operation deepens when we consider that there is an acknowledged movement towards greater regional and sub-regional co-operation  especially in the economic and other functional fields. Yet it is precisely at this time of enhanced endeavours at regional cooperation that a retreat from multilateral activities that at once transcend and encompass regional cooperation is being vigorously advocated and pursued.142.	In promoting effective democratic international organizations  no one calls for the abandonment of the pursuit of national interests. On the other hand  it must surely be possible through commitment and common purpose to utilize international organizations in a way that can smooth the contours of conflict and confrontation and advance the prospects for co-operation.143.	I suggest that what is required is the elevation to a Universalist plane of the reconciliation of our separate interests and agreement upon appropriate restraints on the application of power in its various forms and manifestations  all in the interest of the common good of mankind.144.	Next year  the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations will be marked. Preparations for that anniversary have already begun. Those celebrations should not be merely ritualistic. They must be invested with meaning and with purpose.145.	Guyana believes that out of our deliberations this year should come agreement on action for strengthening the United Nations and better realizing the purposes and principles of its Charter. In this context  we should also consider measures which will have as their objective the strengthening of regional and sub-regional organizations and which will assign an enhanced role to the United Nations system.146.	Since assuming office  the Secretary-General has expressed profound concern for the vitality and effectiveness of the United Nations and has advanced a number of valuable ideas for action by Member States to achieve this end. Once again  in his report on the work of the Organization  he has provided us with a frank and clear analysis of current deficiencies of the United Nations and ourselves and a framework for activities in the future which shows great insight. As he said ""Let us look back at the road we have travelled  distil the experience and set out again refreshed and with a new determination. The purposes for which the United Nations was set up are essential for the future of our planet. The vision expressed in the Charter remains  and we should rally to it.""147.	There is a serious challenge before us. The imperative is a political no less than a moral one. It is to mobilize the world's people in support of the cause of the United Nationsâthat of survival  of development and of peace.148.	The real alternatives are between the maintenance or the quest for supremacy and the building of a co-operative global partnership. I believe that agreed arrangements are possible through the resolute pursuit by all of us of a policy of active and peaceful coexistence. It is  I venture to suggest  a necessary condition of peace and stability and of the real security of all States. But that condition is not sufficient. Such a policy must be buttressed by complementary ones which do not frustrate actual and nascent processes for securing peace.149.	The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been in the vanguard of the forces working for a harmonious global environment. That Movement  to which Guyana is proud to belong  brings together the collective experience and yearnings of the peoples of more than 100 countries and movements  we are of different ideological backgrounds  but we share a common platform for peace and common aspirations to development.150.	Our Movement  which provides a viable alter-native to bloc politics  has  the odds notwithstanding  indefatigably alerted the international community to the prospects of nuclear disaster and fought strenuously for the adoption of genuine and complete disarmament  a task now made most urgent  Despite external and internal difficulties  we as a collectivity have consistently advocated respect for the fundamental principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  non-intervention and the non- use of force.151.	Non-alignment has never wavered in its support for the strengthening of the United Nations In the attainment of those objectives. Multilateralism and internationalism beckon us forward."
"62",2984,"HND",39,1984,"ï»¿We are on the eve of a great celebration. In 1985 an organization which was set up to respond to the highest ideals of mankind will celebrate its fortieth anniversary: an organization created to strengthen international peace and security  to develop the links of friendship and cooperation among States  to promote respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all human beings  to be the crucible in which all nations might work together to achieve their common objectives.159.	A great deal still remains to be done if we are to bring to perfection a legal community of States governed by an order that effectively ensures the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations: the establishment of ""an order for the promotion of peace""  as envisaged by the Viennese master  constitutes ""one of the most urgent matters of our times  one on the outcome of which depends the destiny of civilization"".160.	In an era characterized by uncertainty  we are obliged to reflect on the facts that prevent us from rising above a legal order which is still primitive  in spite of the advances achieved in the past 39 years. The extremely dangerous situations confronting mankind at large make it essential that we not only speak of disarmament but that we also disarm; that we not only speak of democracy but also democratize; that we not just speak of cooperation  but actually cooperate; that we not just talk of respect for the dignity of man  but dignify him.161.	Our world has changed radically since 24 October 1945. Fifty nations participated in the San Francisco Conference. The admission of Brunei Darussalam  which we are now pleased to welcome  reflects the universal calling of the United Nations with its 159 Members. The world population has doubled since 1945  in just 39 years. The Organization and the world have changed radically. While the borders of the international community have been extending at a dizzying pace  the means of sustenance of the peoples of the world are being reduced in a distressing way  a fact which strikes our conscience and causes us to reflect deeply on the world of tomorrow. The 1980s have been characterized by the worst world economic crisis in three decades  with incalculable social suffering.162.	Our third world  in particular  has been severely affected by fiscal deficits  by the servicing of the foreign debt  alarming unemployment  the high price of energy and of manufactured goods  a decline in our exports and in the prices of raw materials  a decrease in the level of savings and investment  the outflow of capital  natural disasters  the population explosion  hunger and war.163.	As though all this in itself were not extremely disquieting  at the same time the natural resources on which we count are decreasing or deteriorating  warning us that economic expansion at any cost imperils the future of mankind since it undermines the bio-systems which serve to sustain the economy.164.	Together with all these misfortunes  specialized sources report that during the recession in the world economy  from 1979 to 1983  global military expenditures increased from $554 billion to $663 billion  an increase of 20 per cent in barely five years  with world military expenditures reaching an average of $145 per person. The same sources give the discouraging information that in 1980 the third world allocated greater resources for the import of weapons than for grain  in spite of the fact that those countries are agricultural in structure and require the basic means of subsistence.165.	Our world and the world of tomorrow are faced with a dramatic reality  responsibility for which cannot be evaded by any Member of the United Nations or by the Organization itself. The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations should serve as a starting point for an examination of the world's conscience. We must assess the achievements and failures  identify the pitfalls and find ways to overcome them  re-examine plans and policies and redefine them with a view to attaining the higher objectives of internal and international peace  of economic and social development  of world security and cooperation  with mutual respect and interdependence.166.	In this necessary assessment of our conduct as States  we must not fail to consider the unilateral  piecemeal interpretation that we often put upon the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The international obligations stemming from it cannot be distorted in their application on the basis of an odious policy of blocs that distort the common purposes of the United Nations.167.	Hegemonistic ambitions must not render nugatory the principles that determine the conduct of this world Organization. The interests of the North must not prevail over those of the South. The well-being of some must not  and cannot  be based on the poverty of others. The principles of the rule of law among nations must not be separated from one another nor from the obligations of each State towards its own people.168.	It is a matter of a need to return to the sources  to return to the original worldwide vision that inspired the attempt to design a different world. It is also a matter of the will to persist in strengthening the effectiveness and impartiality of the United Nations and the confidence in it as the main international organization  the best means to protect the interests of the community of nations  placing international norms above and beyond the particular interests of any of its Members  with everyone observing those international norms  without any discrimination on the basis of political  economic or social systems.169.	I shall now speak about Central America  about a tragedy of burning concern taking place within the framework of an obsessive confrontation in that strategic strip of land  lapped by the waters of two oceans  which joins the north and the south of the western hemisphere.170.	The Central American region is suffering the consequences of a longstanding  painful abandonment of the principles of justice  freedom and solidarity  which should always inspire its leaders and be the constant inspiration of its peoples. CentralAmerica is suffering the consequences of unequal and disadvantageous relations with the most developed nations  which have exercised their hegemony or influence in the region. It is suffering the consequences of the predominance of economic interests over essentially human interests  which have been overlooked in the selfishness of the dominant domestic and foreign sectors  because greed has no dignity and knows no frontiers.171.	Central America is also suffering today from brutal external aggression  directly sponsored in a desire to acquire positions of political predominance and special strategic value  taking advantage of the conditions of political  economic and social crisis affecting the region.172.	In these very trying times  the Central American people has paid a very high price in blood and tears in its valiant struggle against dictatorship and totalitarianism  inequality and plunder  dependency and alignment.173.	The peoples of Central America share the feeling that such difficult circumstances must give way to a promising future  in a Central America free from foreign interference  whatever the source. The region must not be subject to exploitation  intervention or servitude. It must not fall prey to the expansionism of extra continental Powers that seek to deny for all time its democratic and pluralist future  in a tolerant and open society  to which its peoples aspire with hope and resolve.174.	There is a path open to mutual benefit  respect for one another and honourable cooperation  genuinely democratic and participative  with no room for chains or violence. It is a path that can once and for all eliminate the spectre of totalitarian domination and reconcile peoples with their leaders in seeking freedom  justice  peace and progress.175.	This widespread feeling has found expression in most of the countries of the region  which  in spite of suffering a deep economic crisis and social imbalances  have chosen with wisdom the course of historic reformârepresentative  pluralist and participative democracy.176.	Of course  this is only the beginning of a journey that should have begun long ago. It is the manifestation of a political will struggling to be translated into new economic and social opportunities  but it is significant that when the peoples of Central America have had the freedom to choose they have chosen freedom.177.	The United Nations recognizes  as an essential part of the general order that is the basis of peace  the right to self-determination of peoples. All the peoples of Central America must be able freely to determine their present and future  without decisions being imposed on them  without the force or pressures of the apparatus of the State continuing to violate their right freely to decide their political  economic and social organization through the exercise of their sovereign ability to choose their leaders. This is a prerequisite for the establishment of lasting peace in the heart of that hemisphere.178.	Another requirement for the return of peace is that the Central American States commit themselves firmly and in good faith to reducing their military arsenals to limits strictly compatible with the maintenance of public order and national defence. The establishment of offensive forces in Central America  the introduction of new  heavy armaments and the alienating militarization of society  together with secret  threatening military commitments and the establishment of impressive armiesâthese are all elements that unsettle international peace and security in Central America. They prevent the creation of a climate of detente and trust  and at the same time oblige neighbouring States to find compensating formulas for defence  thus tending to divert huge human"" and economic resources to maintain a balance of security  which implies large social sacrifices and political costs that could be avoided  to the benefit of those that have little or nothing and need so much.179.	The Honduran Government stresses that it is essential to end the arms race in Central America  to limit the number of weapons and troops and to begin immediately general disarmament  under strict and effective international controls. My Government appeals to the conscience of Central American countries and calls on them to declare before the international community their formal commitment to the objective of disarmament as an indispensable condition for peace. At the same time  we urge all Member States to discuss appropriate measures that might be adopted by the United Nations to focus its disarmament efforts on the establishment of an arms regulation system applicable to the countries of the third world  which have an important moral obligation to their peoples to check the arms race and an international obligation to their neighbouring countries to reduce their arsenals and the numbers of their troops  in order to promote the establishment and maintenance of peace and security among nations.180.	Since April 1983 we have been actively participating in the negotiations sponsored by the Contadora Group. Our contribution has been aimed primarily at promoting the establishment and development of democratic  pluralistic and participatory systems in the five Central American countries  at establishing a system of regional security based on the reduction and control of armaments and troops  at eliminating the foreign military presence  and at achieving mutual observance of the principle of non-intervention. We have also advocated cooperation for economic and social development with a sense of deep-rooted solidarity.181.	On 7 September last  the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Contadora Group submitted a revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. That comprehensive draft text provides for the establishment of a series of legal obligations to be assumed by us  the States of Central America  as regards political  security  and economic and social matters and machinery for international verification and control of these obligations.182.	The Government of the Republic of Honduras accepts the substantive obligations in the Act and  as it has already stated  it reaffirms that it is ready to assume each and every one of the responsibilities deriving from the negotiating process which must continue  until the signing of that important document  for the present and future of Central America.183.	Honduras does not shrink from any of the legal commitments it will enter into under the strictest compliance with the principle of the reciprocity of obligations and their fulfilment in good faith by all the Central American States.184.	Honduras is prepared to have its political conduct governed by the tenets of representative  pluralistic and participatory democracy  as established in the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America.185.	Honduras is prepared to accept onsite international verification and control of its electoral processes and of the other political commitments it makes.186.	Honduras is prepared to promote and respect human rights because it is deeply convinced that the guarantee by the State of the dignity of the individual is a moral and pragmatic duty.187.	Honduras is prepared to begin negotiations immediately to limit  reduce and control its arsenal  its troops under arms and its military installations  within 90 days  as proposed by the Act  or sooner  and to agree on applicable timetables for reductions.188.	Honduras is prepared to submit to a strict system of onsite verification and control of all the security obligations ii undertakes.189.	Moreover  Honduras is prepared to demand of any State that undertakes the same obligations that it faithfully fulfils them  for Hondurans are not seeking a truce which  through the kind of deception with which we are familiar  would only mask an opportunity to legitimize a system of oppression. We will not tolerate use of the Contadora initiative to conceal the madness of the arms race  or the preparation of campaigns of domination  or terrorism and sabotage  or intervention  or trafficking in arms. Honduras does not want a truce that merely meets the needs of the instant; it seeks rather a stable and lasting peace based on justice and nourished by freedom.190.	Therefore  we shall insist on three basic points: security in the implementation of any agreement; effective verification and control in respect of the fulfilment of obligations; and determination of the fate of the irregular forces once they lay down their arms and once a solution is found to the internal conflicts in which they are engaged. Those who have already affirmed their acceptance of the Contadora Act must prove their good faith in the negotiations to take place among the five Central American States  so that the Act may become a binding agreement  one that can be fully implemented and verified.191.	Some have already saidâwhile swearing fealty to the Contadora Actâthat they are not prepared for any arms reduction  but rather intend to continue to arm themselves. There are indications that the claimed commitment to democracy is but a new and disgusting publicity stunt. These positions are nothing less than a violation in advance of what they are hypocritically claiming to accept  only to ignore it later in bad faith.192.	In spite of all this  my Government completely shares the view of the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group that: ""The Central American Governments should now display the political will needed to give legal force to the commitments formulated during this process and should therefore adopt whatever realistic and equitable formulas for conciliation they deem appropriate"" In this respect  my country and my Government will spare no effort to help reach agreement on the 21 objectives8 so painstakingly identified by the Contadora Group in its endeavour to promote peace  security and cooperation in Central America  an endeavour which we hold in high esteem and which compels us to reiterate our deep thanks to the Governments of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela.193.	Today  we have extended  on behalf of Honduras  a cordial invitation to the Foreign Ministers of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala and Nicaragua to meet with us on 19 October at Tegucigalpa in order to analyse the Central American situation and to give real momentum to progress towards the signing of the Contadora Act.194.	As a discordant note  just a few days ago from this rostrum bold accusations were made  attempting to involve my country in a supposed invasion of Nicaragua. For three years now we have been hearing that alarmist outcry  whose falseness and inaccuracy are clear.195.	On 19 March 1982  Commandant Daniel Ortega Saavedra  Coordinator of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua  affirmed in a letter to the Security Council9 that an invasion of his country was ""imminent"". The Washington Post  on 20 March 1982  reported that the Sandinist Government was continuing to prepare its people to face possible invasion. It reported that on that same day a programme was being initiated for the building of air raid shelters and that the 70 000 troops which at that time composed the armed forces of that nation were in a state of alert.196.	Subsequently  on 25 March 1982  the Commandant again stated that Nicaragua had called for a meeting of the Security Council  given the ""imminence"" of intervention in Central America  since ""events painted a picture which made it clear that intervention was on the way"".197.	On 10 November 1982  the Financial Times referred to a note which the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry had circulated on 8 November 1982  in Managua  stating that ""those actions were indicative of an imminent invasion of Nicaragua"".198.	On 19 January 1983  an official communique from the Foreign Ministry of that country  transmitted to the Security Council  announced that preparations were under way ""for the launching of even more far-ranging acts of aggression"" against Nicaragua.199.	In another letter addressed to the Security Council on 5 May 1983  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Nicaragua announced ""the launching of a new stage of the invasion"" of Nicaragua."" Four days later  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Nicaraguan Administration said that he could confirm the existence of an invasion which was continuing to spread terror in the country. On 19 May of that year  the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister told the Security Council that an immoral and unjustifiable arms invasion of his country was taking place.200.	In contrast with what  in the view of the Government of Nicaragua  was already a fait accompli  on 8 November 1983  during the debate on the situation in Central America during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly   the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister stated that at the very moment clear preparations were under way for an invasion of Nicaragua. Similar assertions were made at the Assembly's thirty-seventh session.201.	The Financial Times of 18 November 1983 reported that ""an invasion psychosis had taken over the Nicaraguan nation"" and that ""the Sandinist leaders were preparing the population for what they considered to be an imminent invasion by the United States and its Central American allies"".202.	Once again  on 3 February 1984  the representative of Nicaragua stated in the Security Council13 that a war between Honduras and Nicaragua was being provoked by the United States to justify intervention.203.	Then again  on 2 April 1984 in the Security Council  the representative of Nicaragua stated that in the next few days another invasion was expected from Honduran territory.14 Months later  on 7 September  he stated again that the political terrain for the invasion was being prepared.15204.	It is because of all these unfounded assertions that it comes as no surprise to me that once again an attempt has been made to take advantage of the credulity of States represented here with a paranoic statement of a much announced but never realized invasion of Nicaragua.205.	A consideration of the dates when these accusations were made clearly draws attention to the link between them and some of the meetings in the peace making process of the Contadora Group  and  curiously enough  the invasion which is now claimed to be ""imminent"" coincides precisely with the date when we  the Central American States  are due to decide on a revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America.206.	None the less  we must acknowledge that there is a basic difference between earlier affirmations and the most recent one made  since  in the latter  in addition to a date being givenâ15 Octoberâwe were told the number of invaders  the number of planes and helicopters  the types of weapons that will be used and the routes that will be followed. There was one thing missingâan indication of the exact hour when the operations will begin and the places where  in the generous land that nourished the inspiration of Ruben Dario and encouraged the now frustrated ideals of Sandino  the new pass of Thermopylae in these imaginary Spartan battles will be.207.	In clear contrast to this attitude  on the date for which this hypothetical invasion of Nicaragua is announced  the President of the Republic of El Salvador paid tribute yesterday  in this forum  to the efforts of the Contadora Group in convening the armed opposition to a dialogue of internal reconciliation in his country. That example should be followed by those who proclaim unconditional acceptance of the Contadora Act but who offer to negotiate in the language of weapons.208.	Since international peace is an asset that links us closely with the nations of other continents  Honduras has promoted closer relations between Central America and other regions of the industrialized world so that  through international cooperation  tension in the region may be reduced.209.	In September 1983  representatives of the Central American Governments attended a meeting at Brussels so that  together  before the representatives of other Governments and international organizations  we might reflect on the needs and expectations of the countries of our region. That gathering was a palpable demonstration of the fact that the countries of Central America share common interests with the world outside and that intraregional cooperation may establish solid links between us and provide benefits for all our peoples.210.	That belief in joint action prompted the President of Honduras  Roberto Suazo Cordova  in March of this year  to propose to the President of Costa Rica  Luis Alberto Monge  the promotion of a cooperation agreement between the European Economic Community and Central America. The President of Honduras stated to his Costa Rican counterpart:""I feel that Central America should avail itself of your visit to Belgium to express  on behalf of our countries  the great importance we attach to the negotiation and signing of a cooperation agreement with the European Communities. . . .""I need not enumerate all the advantages that the entry into force of such an agreement would have for Central America. ... It would widen and deepen the already significant level of aid and make it possible to extend it to new sectors  thus enabling the extension of its benefits to those countries of the region now receiving little or no aid. . . . Your action in an area of common interest for all Central Americans is a factor that could contribute to a relaxation of tension in the area.""211.	The response of European democracy has been positive  and a political and economic dialogue has already begun which we hope will continue and provide short-term benefits.212.	Indeed  only a few days ago  on 28 and 29 September  an historic meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the member States of the European Community  of Spain and Portugal and of the countries of Central America and the Contadora Group was held at San Jose. On that occasion  Western Europe emphasized its interest in contributing to democratic development in Central America as the best way of achieving the stability of the isthmus. This is clear evidence of international solidarity  for which Honduras pays a tribute to the European nations that attended that meeting. At the same time  my country expresses its fervent hope that permanent formulas for mutual benefit between the two regions  which have historic links and share growing expectations  may be achieved.213.	In Latin American economic and financial matters  Honduras supports the provisions of the Declaration of Quito  adopted at the Latin American Economic Conference  held on 12 and 13 January 1984  and the Cartagena Consensus  signed on 22 June 1984 by the representatives of 11 Latin American countries  which reflect the progressive strengthening of Latin America's capacity to respond to the international economic crisis and to buttress their systems of cooperation in order to promote and encourage the economic development and social progress of our countries.214.	The Latin American efforts cannot be dissociated from the efforts that have been made and are being made by the Group of 77. On the occasion of the celebration of one more anniversary of the establishment of that body  we must insist on the need to bring about closer cooperation among the developing countries and to promote global negotiations  making it possible to find appropriate solutions to the problems hindering the establishment of a world economic system based on justice. We must begin to overcome the most harmful effects of the economic crisis  which calls for urgent responsesâ above all  from the industrialized countries  since  to a great extent  external factors beyond the control of our countries seriously limit our capacity to overcome them.215.	My country attaches particular importance to the activities of the Economic and Social Council  whose fundamental role is to contribute to the creation of conditions of stability and wellbeing  which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations. Honduras believes in the need to promote the principle of multilateral cooperation  which has provided so many benefits for our countries. To that end  we must re-examine the existing instruments of cooperation so as to adapt them to the dynamics of contemporary society and to isolate them from any attempt at politicization which could adversely affect the positive and multifaceted work done by the specialized agencies of the United Nations.216.	I should like also to emphasize the humanitarian work carried out by ICAO. In particular  I should like to stress the agreement to amend the Chicago Convention so as to include a rule recognizing categorically the principle of non-use of force against civilian aircraft in flight.217.	At the thirty-eighth session  I expressed my Government's indignation at  and strong repudiation of  the downing of a Korean civilian aircraft and the deaths of 269 innocent persons. This year the national conscience of Honduras has been greatly concerned over a similar event  in which  without prior notice  the Nicaraguan army downed an unarmed Honduran helicopter which was carrying a group of civilian professionals. That condemnable act was praised by the Government concerned when it declared itself responsible for that odious crime.218.	Two recent conferences  the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City in August  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna also in August  recalled to us the close links between development  population and industrialization. My country urges the continuance of the efforts in these fields of vital importance  particularly for the developing countries  and we are encouraged by the interest that is increasingly shown in finding solutions to these very complex problems.219.	On 9 December  the time for the signing of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea will expire. So far  135 countries have signed it. That Convention constitutes an outstanding example of renewed international cooperation. We urge those States that have not yet signed the Convention to do so and to respect its contents and its unity.220.	For some years  Central America has been experiencing a distressing phenomenon caused by prevalent instability and violence in the region. This has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of persons from their places of origin. In view of the tragedy dividing families in our region  my country and my Government have accepted the obligation  imposed by humanitarian feelings  which have always characterized Hondurans  to give refuge to more than 50 000 refugees and displaced persons of various nationalities. These are being cared for by Honduras  with the valuable assistance of international organizations and specialized agencies  such as UNHCR World Relief Refugee Services  Caritas Internationalis  Medecins sans frontieres  Catholic Relief Services  the Mennonite Church  the International Red Cross  the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration and many others that are contributing directly or indirectly to improving the living conditions of the refugees and displaced persons. My Government is deeply appreciative of all these efforts.221.	In recent days  and because of political change in El Salvador  which now has a democratic  freely elected Government  my Government has provided for the voluntary repatriation  under international supervision  of 18 000 Salvadorians now in my country. This will be done with respect for the relevant criteria and norms established at the international level. None the less  Honduras will keep its borders open to all human beings who feel insecure and seek protection outside their own territory.222.	I should like to express just and well-deserved appreciation to the United Nations for its invaluable assistance  to the specialized agencies and to the Governments that have supported us in meeting the needs of refugees. I appeal to all Members of the United Nations to maintain and increase their economic and moral cooperation with the agencies that assist in mitigating the plight of these unfortunate people.223.	We have followed with concern the development of situations of tension that threaten peace in other regions of the world. We share the anguish and suffering that conflicts cause to other peoples and nations.224.	My Government reiterates the need to find a just solution  negotiated in good faith  to the South Atlantic conflict. It is of the utmost importance for the strengthening of peace that comprehensive negotiations be resumed in respect of the sovereign  historic claim of Argentina to the Malvinas Islands. We ask the Secretary General to persevere in the use of his good offices to promote understanding on the basis of justice.225.	We reiterate our forceful condemnation of the foreign occupation of Kampuchea and of Afghanistan. Their peoples must be enabled to exercise their right freely to determine their own destiny. We appeal to all free nations to repudiate the barbarous foreign intervention in those suffering regions of the world.226.	With regard to the question of Korea  my country believes that the remaining manifestations of the cold war must be ended calmly and fairly. The Republic of Korea  like any other State that meets the conditions set out in Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations  has a right to be admitted as a Member of the Organization. The South and the North of Korea should resolve their differences purely by peaceful means and direct negotiations. The international community should encourage an approach designed to establish trust and bring about reconciliation between the two parties so that the barriers of fear and controversy may be overcome.227.	Honduras rejects the presence of foreign troops in Namibia and deplores the delay in establishing an independent  sovereign State. The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia is the basis for a lasting  peaceful solution.228.	Similarly  we reject the racist policy of apartheid applied in South Africa and deplore the recent violence that caused further loss of life in that tormented region of the world.229.	Our conscience has been shocked constantly by the bloody and irrational struggle that continues in Lebanon. The recent tragic  senseless acts of terrorism against the forces entrusted with maintaining the peace and against diplomatic representatives in Beirut cost hundreds of lives  creating an international problem to which the United Nations should pay particular attention and which should be repudiated by all its Members.230.	In this context  I remind the General Assembly of an event that shocked the entire civilized world. I refer to the attack on United States diplomatic staff in Teheran by armed elements  who occupied the embassy and held the officials hostage in the building for many months  making their release conditional on the payment of an infamous ransom. This was a challenge to the most fundamental principles of diplomatic law and conduct. There has also been a wave of international violence against the embassies of Honduras in different countries. The embassies have been dynamited  causing material damage and physical injury to diplomatic officials. Such cruel acts must be severely condemned by the community of nations.231.	The causes and extent of the reckless war between Iraq and Iran are incomprehensible. This is war which must come to an end  a war between two partners in the Movement of Nonaligned Countries which  instead of opposing each other  should strengthen their cooperation  for the benefit of the third world countries. This struggle of unheard-of fanaticism leaves fields desolate and interferes with important strategic channels of communication and international supplies.232.	The President of this session of the General Assembly is an outstanding representative of Africa  that vast region of the world which is still experiencing the fever of emancipation which derives from the establishment of the United Nations. A representative of Zambia  he will have the responsibility of guiding our debates at what is a dramatic time for the human race. In this he can rely on his efficiency and skill  as well as the support of the international community.233.	As we review the present state of international relations  our spirits are indeed troubled. There is hardly a region in the world which is not affected by the scourge of war  by lack of respect for human rights  by the negation of the right of peoples to self-determination  by hunger  injustice and oppression.234.	We must together undertake the task of regaining the faith that has been lostâfaith in mankind  faith in its future  faith that history will be able to forge nations free from blindness and hatred.235.	We hope that that deep feeling of faith in our ability to overcome our problems will illuminate the work of the President  as head of the General Assembly  so that the purposes and principles decided upon almost four decades ago will give strength to our debates  thus increasing understanding and hope.236.	Let us therefore reflect on assessments that have been made by experts on the historical development of the United Nations on the essence and importance of this forum of universal debate.237.	Thus  it has been said that the two minutes of meditation or prayer at the beginning and the end of the session every year are too short ""to acknowledge how much this vast undertaking  with all its complications and difficulties  must rely on divine assistance"". We have also been invited to imagine what a revelation it would be ""if we could in some way form a joint impression of what is going on in those many minds at that extremely important moment"" when the General Assembly is beginning or ending its sessions. ""What hopes are contained therein  what determinations  what destructive intentions and what legitimate calls for assistance and guidance? A glance would be enough to reassure the fearful minds outside of the sum total of patience  valour  loyalty with respect to what is right and pure integrity that go into this common effort which perhaps represents the sole hope left to mankind.""238.	It has also been said that that ""would be the faithful reflection of the United Nations  but only God sees that"". We might see the true and final design of peace  visible thus far only as an incomplete outline  but taking shape as the message of the United Nations is brought to the world. The disbelievers will see how many hearts are echoing the words of Saint Paul to the Corinthians: ""For a great door and effectual is opened unto me  and there are many adversaries""."
"63",3053,"HTI",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  Sir  on behalf of the Haitian delegation  I wish to offer you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  where you will not fail to display the eminent qualities which won you this honour and which are already your hallmark as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia. In choosing you  the Assembly has paid a well-deserved tribute to your diplomatic skills and  through you  to your country  Zambia  which remains a symbol and a model in the struggle against racism and apartheid in southern Africa.146.	I also wish to express once again to the Secretary-General the total confidence and profound respect of the Haitian Government for his tireless efforts throughout the year in the service of peace and international co-operation. We shall continue unreservedly to support all his initiatives with a view to strengthening the often thankless task of the Organization in the indispensable and so difficult dialogue that is the corner-stone of relations among peoples and States.147.	We also joyfully welcome Brunei Darussalam to the great family of the United Nations. We are sure it will make an active and valuable contribution to the work of the Organization.148.	On the eve of the assessment of the first 40 years of the work of the United Nations  we must once again confess that our most profound hopes have been dashed and that the world of peace  justice and brotherhood to which we naturally aspired seems to recede daily. We must recognize that hotbeds of tension have increased  East-West tension has never been so high and the arms race has taken on the look of a crazy  dangerous adventure  the cost of which is a constant insult to the third world in its misery.149.	We must also emphasize that the international community has never possessed so many different resources and that today  towards the end of this twentieth century  men have never had such mastery over matter  thanks to the spectacular progress in science and technology.150.	We must therefore seek the true sources of these repeated failures in the implacable selfishness  excessive ambition and senseless fanaticism of many and in our deepest and most ingrained prejudices  and we must finally understand that in these circumstances it is indeed difficult for the Organization to fulfil the noble and delicate mission entrusted to it.151.	Thus  fully convinced of our unavoidable common destiny  the Haitian Government would like to restate its firm belief that  despite its institutional flaws  the United Nations continues to represent the most appropriate instrument for the achievement of our ideals  and we urge all States Members  and particularly those who are members of the Security Council  faithfully to abide by the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations. For  despite our disappointments and feelings of frustration  there is no alternative to the methodical pursuit of dialogue and consultation in full respect for the rules of law and the universally acknowledged principles of equality  justice and sovereignty which undoubtedly constitute the most precious asset of our common heritage.152.	It is thus against that background  and with an awareness of the gravity of recent developments in the international situation  that the Haitian Government proposes to restate its position on the principal items on the Assembly's agenda  in the hope that it can make a contribution  however modest  to the solution of the problems that seem to be jeopardizing the future of mankind.153.	In this connection  the recent events in South Africa  in the course of which new martyrs were added to the blood-stained list of the victims of apartheid  have in a very special way drawn our attention to a state of affairs that constitutes not only the most flagrant of violations of fundamental human rights but also a standing challenge to the Organization  which since 1946 has found itself powerless to eradicate from the face of the earth this last vestige of racism and colonialism.154.	Availing itself of the indifference of certain nations  the Pretoria regime continues to build up its arsenal of constitutional and legal provisions enshrining the de facto inferiority of the black majority and opening the door to the most violent manifestations of unbridled despotism.155.	Faithful to its historic traditions  the Haitian Government most strongly condemns the indefensible conduct of the racist minority of Pretoria and welcomes the recent adoption of General Assembly resolution 39/2  which rejected as null and void the so-called new constitution of South Africa. We are deeply attached to the people of South Africa and we reaffirm our unconditional solidarity with them in their heroic struggle to bring about the total elimination of the apartheid regime.156.	We cannot fail to denounce the open complicity of which countries lending political  economic  military and nuclear co-operation to the South African regimeâon the highly suspect pretext of maintaining strategic interestsâare guilty. We call upon them no longer to oppose the adoption of comprehensive mandatory sanctions that alone can prevail against Pretoria's brutal arrogance and lead to the establishment of an open  democratic and multiracial society in South Africa.157.	Moreover  confident in its great military and economic power  encouraged by the success of its destabilization campaign against neighbouring States  South Africa is persisting in its occupation of Namibia  in violation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council  particularly resolution 435 (1978)  which laid the foundations for a peaceful  negotiated settlement of the Namibian question. With recourse now to violence  now to intimidation  now to trickery  the South African Government seeks by every possible means to consolidate its hold on Namibia.158.	In these circumstances  we must congratulate SWAPO  the sole authentic and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  for its spirit of moderation and for the great flexibility and political maturity it has demonstrated in the face of the bad faith and intransigence of South Africa throughout the negotiations designed to implement resolution 435 (1978).159.	In solidarity with the Namibian people  the Republic of Haiti categorically rejects any attempt to link the independence of Namibia to any geopolitical considerations and to the solution of matters that fall exclusively within the purview of the sovereignty of other States. We advocate the genuine independence of Namibia on the basis of resolution 435 (1978)  and we call upon the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities by adopting the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  We solemnly appeal to the international community to see to it that the Namibian people are enabled fully to exercise their sovereignty over their own territory and that they are guaranteed their inalienable rights to freedom  dignity and happiness.160.	Elsewhere in Africa  other hotbeds of tension jeopardize political stability and delay the social and economic development of countries of the region.161.	While particularly deploring the internal struggles that have divided Chad  the Government of Haiti hails with satisfaction the announcement of the withdrawal of foreign troops as an indispensable step towards the establishment of a lasting peace that will enable that nation to return to unity through dialogue and to exercise its sovereignty over the whole of its territory.162.	With respect to Western Sahara  the Republic of Haiti continues to believe in the possibility of a peaceful solution based on the principle of self- determination  in keeping with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and with the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  which we hope will be implemented without delay with the active assistance of the States most directly concerned.163.	In the Middle East  as we have often repeated  the solution of the crisis is to be found in the establishment of an overall peace on the basis of the principles of law  morality and justice  a peace that will include recognition and respect by all its neighbours of Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries. Similarly  the Haitian Government feels that there can be no question of challenging the right of the Palestinian people to true self-determination within a physical  legal and administrative framework in keeping with their legitimate aspirations. In this connection  discussion and dialogue are  in our opinion  the best means for making progress towards that goal  and certain rather encouraging  albeit somewhat timorous  events lead us to feel that good faith and reason may yet prevail over hatred and blindness in that part of the world of such importance in the history of mankind.164.	As for Lebanon  a martyred country in which a particularly explosive situation prevails created by the presence of two armies of occupation  there can be no doubt that the withdrawal of those troops  in keeping with the wishes of the Lebanese Government and people  would contribute to establishing conditions favourable to national reconciliation and reconstruction.165.	The question of Cyprus continues to occupy an important place in the discussions of the United Nations. Our position on this question remains unchanged; we advocate respect for the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of that island  as well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The Republic of Haiti welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General in carrying out his mission of good offices and we hope that that mission will be crowned with success.166.	In Asia  there are continuing hotbeds of tension created and fed by the expansionist aims of certain States which are clearly determined to impose their will upon others by means of an illegal military presence  in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. How can we fail to mention in this connection the tragedy occurring in occupied Afghanistan and Cambodia? Haiti warmly hails the patriotic struggle of the Khmer and Afghan peoples and wishes to express its deep gratitude to the Secretary-General and his representatives and to all those who  in one capacity or another  are working for the restoration of peace and security in that sorely tried part of the world. We join the international community in calling for the total  immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all occupation troops  thereby enabling those States freely to choose the form of government they wish  free from any kind of foreign pressures.167.	The Republic of Haiti also wishes once again to express its strongest support for the Korean people. We are convinced that the problems between the North and the South must be settled by negotiation  and we therefore call upon the parties to show good faith in renewing their dialogue. We noted with satisfaction the courageous initiatives of the Government of South Korea for the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation  and we remain convinced that direct bilateral contacts  without outside interference  are the only way to reduce tension and create the conditions that will lead to reconciliation.168.	I cannot complete this brief summary without giving Central America the special attention that it deserves from a Caribbean country which is following with concern the development of a tragedy whose devastating effects could quickly extend well beyond the region now involved.169.	It is important first to stress that  as we have often stated  the present crisis has its roots in the many serious socio-economic difficulties affecting the region  difficulties whose solution requires an exemplary effort of international solidarity  particularly on the part of the regional Powers  concerned about the continent's future. Therefore  there is no question of reducing to the single dimension of the East-West conflict a whole body of fundamental problems that can be resolved only by the peoples of the region themselves  who have the exclusive right to decide their type of society and establish their own development model.170.	In this spirit  the Haitian Government  in keeping with the principles that have always inspired its foreign policy  continues unreservedly to support the constructive approaches courageously made by the Contadora Group to restore  by means of dialogue and negotiation  peace and security  which are the irreplaceable foundations of all economic and social progress. We are happy to note that patience and goodwill have led to the elaboration of a coherent and balanced body of concrete proposals  grouped together in the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  the final version of which will have to be adopted soon if we want to avoid a general conflict breaking out before long.171.	It is therefore essential for the protagonists not to hesitate to add deeds to their words-âthat is  faithfully to respect their commitments and effectively to reduce the level of armaments  for any other attitude could bring about reactions and could upset the balance of forces and regional security.172.	In the South Atlantic  despite the lesson of the Malvinas  Great Britain is pursuing a policy of military expansion  which leads us to believe that it is prepared to maintain its colonial presence  in disregard of Argentine sovereignty. In so doing  it is failing in its fundamental obligation to seek a peaceful  negotiated solution to the problems between it and the Argentine Republic and to abstain from any measure that might increase tension in the area. We regret that the first contacts have not been followed up  and we urge the parties to resume the negotiations in earnest  in order to achieve  with the assistance of the good offices of the Secretary-General  a just and equitable solution to a dispute that has gone on for more than a century.173.	Just below the surface of all these conflicts  in the background of the bloody confrontations which plunge the world into mourning  there is the terrible problem of the arms race  which every year assumes more tragic dimensions  despite the appeals  recommendations and condemnations of the world's highest moral authorities. It is clear that the great Powers bear the full responsibility for solving this harrowing question and that only dialogue and consultation can settle the matter satisfactorily  it being borne in mind that the security of some cannot be assured at the expense of others.174.	While noting with interest the recent proposals put forward by President Reagan from this rostrum to reduce tension and strengthen peace  we earnestly call for the establishment of multilateral machinery which will allow the transfer to international development institutions of the enormous resources which would be released by a programme of general  gradual and balanced disarmament.175.	The importance that most delegations have attached to an examination of the world economic situation shows the extent of the concern which continues to be caused by the unprecedented crisis which is affecting our countries and which in the final analysis is manifested by a disturbing worsening of the already precarious living conditions of the deprived peoples of the third world.176.	We well know the current manifestationsâthe spectacular deterioration of the terms of trade  the resultant drop in export earnings  the obvious slowing down in rates of investment and the considerable worsening of the debt problem  together with a drastic reduction in capital flows. All of this is leading to a marked decrease in per capita growth rates and production  leading to an alarming increase in unemployment and areas of poverty.177.	Thus  in Latin America and the Caribbean  in 1983  the gross domestic product fell by 3 per cent and the per capita income dropped by 6 per cent. At the same time  there continues to be such a reduction in international aid  in real terms  that there is reason to wonder how the third world can double its per capita output in the mid-1990s  as had been contemplated in the context of the Third United Nations Development Decade.178.	Without stressing the underlying causes of this state of affairs  we cannot but repeat that the industrialized nations bear a heavy share of the responsibility for the origins of this tragic situation  which so severely punishes the poor countries for crimes that they have not committed. Therefore  it is up to the rich countries to play a decisive role in creating an international environment capable of bringing about a healthy and lasting recovery which would be of benefit to all. Above all  it is their duty to show their political will to undertake the structural reforms that are indispensable for the establishment of a new order  which is not only a moral imperative but an economic necessity.179.	We are convinced that if the rich nations really wished to contribute more effectively to the development of the poor countries  and if they were truly convinced that it was in their interests and that perhaps their survival depended on it  those nations  which have successfully met extraordinary scientific and technical challenges  would find formulas  ways to intervene and suitable programmes to wipe hunger  ignorance and disease off the face of the earth.180.	Moreover  the recent excellent performance of certain Western economies gives reason for new hopeâprovided  however  that some basic truths are seriously borne in mind and are the foundation of policies for recovery.181.	First  it would be wrong to think that the strong growth of the rich countries can automatically bring about a revival of the weak economies of the third world  for there are in our regions certain structural deficiencies which prevent the mechanisms of the market from working normally and necessitate the intervention of the public sector and international co-operation.182.	Secondly  it is now recognized that the adjustment policies advocated by the West  and characterized in particular by drastic reductions in budgetary expenditures and imports  involve an excessive social cost  without  as one would expect  leading to the growth process that is sought. From one point of view  these are easy solutions which consist of provoking a global contraction of demand in the poor countries  to a degree difficult to support  while the industrialized nations shoulder only a derisory portion of the sacrifices. How can we fail to mention that some of the richer countries refuse to submit to the fiscal discipline that they would impose on others?183.	We believe that the adjustment process must be synonymous with dynamic reconstruction rather than passive constraint because  first and foremost  it must be designed to be productive and not to bring about poverty. Consequently  as a priority  in addition to the objectives already mentioned  it must include the creation of new jobs  the establishment of new industries  and  through the World Bank and IMF acting in close concert  the financing of new programmes  particularly in the key sectors of education  health  housing and agriculture.184.	Thirdly  it has been demonstrated that the economic recovery of the third world assumes that the rich countries will maintain a growth rate of more than 3 per cent  avoid protectionism  and act in such a way as to bring about a gradual lowering of interest rates  an improvement in the terms of trade  and the provision of adequate financing. Regarding this last point particularly  we deem it important to emphasize  in order to see the problem clearly  that whereas the non-oil-producing developing countries paid $52 billion in 1983 to private creditors  they received $20 billion in loans  $15 billion more than had been contemplated by IMF under the system of transfer of net resources.185.	External financing should  therefore  be in-creased to help debt-servicing  assist investment and stimulate exports. A world in which the developing countries are confronted simultaneously with a lowering of their standard of living and a draining of their capital is extremely volatile.186.	Fourthly  with regard to the least developed countries  there is little doubt that the success or failure of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries constitutes the most eloquent test of the desire of the rich countries to restore the credibility of the North- South dialogue. If the international community is not in a position now to help this small group of countries  whose needs are relatively few  one may well ask oneself when and for whom it can do so.187.	On the eve of the mid-term review of the implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action  we must admit that none of these objectives has been reached and that the level of aid remains far below that of the firm commitments made by the representatives of the donor countries. The Republic of Haiti therefore urges the United Nations to take special measures immediately  for two purposes at least: first  to maximize the aid given to the least developed countries by reducing the percentage of funds allocated to technical assistanceâfor which the experts are too costly in comparison with the services they renderâand then apportioning most of the money thus made available to structural investments  which will have an irreversible effect in modifying the standard of living of the populations that benefit therefrom; and  secondly  to increase the number of programmes designed to bring back qualified personnel  the scarcest and most important of all resources  to their place of origin  that is to say  back to our own countries.188.	We must struggle against the flagrant contradiction of a promise of aid coupled with budgetary cuts  which inevitably brings about a decrease in the amount of money available for development. Clearly the time has come for the percentage of local resources required from the least developed countries to be systematically maintained at a level of less than 10 per cent.189.	Fifthly  the third world must now  more than ever before  rely on and reaffirm its own strength and systematically explore the many possibilities of South-South co-operation. Here  the Quito Plan of Action and the Cartagena Consensus constitute excellent initiatives  as evidence of our willingness to assume responsibility for our own destiny and to attain our collective autonomy  especially with regard to food  through the promotion of interregional exchanges and the exploitation of our immense resources.190.	The Republic of Haiti  in its capacity as Acting Chairman of the Caribbean Development and Co-operation Committee  would like to reaffirm its faith in the underlying unity of our region as an historical  geographical and cultural entity  called upon to develop with full respect for all the socio-political options of each and every member.191.	We have greeted with great hope the implementation of the initiative on the Caribbean Basin designed to attract numerous investments and facilitate access of our products to the American market. However  while recognizing the merits of this plan  which is based on the dynamism of free enterprise  we must admit that  while it contains provisions necessary for our economic development  those provisions are  nevertheless  insufficient and inadequate when viewed against the backdrop of the many needs of the region.192.	For its part  Haiti remains firmly convinced that the solution of our problems is to be found first and foremost in the effort which each one of our countries continues to make to maximize the utilization of its own national resources.193.	Hence  the Haitian Government  in keeping with the formal commitments of the life President of the Republic and with the profound wishes of the nation  is pursuing  successfully and with perseverance  a very important twofold effort  despite the precarious nature of the means available and the complexity of the many obstacles we face. We continue  on the one hand  methodically to establish a process of genuine democratization which takes into account our own specific characteristics  our historic traditions and our social and cultural realities. On the other hand  our Government is also trying to mobilize our unfortunately inadequate national resources to promote economic and social development  the purpose of which is  first of all  to satisfy the basic needs of the population before the year 2000. It is in the light of this dual purpose that we must view two major events in our present policy  namely  the unprecedented reform of the judicial system and the solemn launching  in August  by the Head of State  of the agricultural reform  designed to achieve self-sufficiency in food within 10 years.194.	The summary examination of the world situation which we have just given leads us to say in conclusion that there will be no progress towards peace and economic development in an increasingly interdependent world without true international solidarity  a true will for change  and genuine determination on the part of the larger countries to implement the various resolutions to which they have subscribed.195.	In this context  the role of the United Nations remains most important and the Haitian delegation is ready at all times to make an active contribution to any initiative which might bring us closer to our objectives. As was stated by President Jean-Claude Duvalier:""It is our dearest hope that 1985 may be the year of peace and that an important stage may be reached in negotiations to reduce international tensions and restore security wherever bloody conflicts are bringing about tragedy and suffering."""
"64",3099,"HUN",39,1984,"ï»¿Let me congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Aware of your competence and rich experience in international life  I am convinced that you will guide our deliberations with efficiency. I should like to assure you of my delegation's co-operation as you carry out your responsible task.66.	I also extend a welcome to Brunei Darussalam  the newest Member of the United Nations.67.	During the nearly four decades of the existence of the Organization  the world has been faced on several occasions with rising international tensions and with developments contrary to the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations. The sharpening of international tension  the acceleration of the arms race and the increasing attempts from outside to disrupt the internal social and political order of sovereign States have reached dangerous dimensions in our times  and this is a legitimate source of concern for people not only in a particular country or region but throughout the world.68.	The strategic arms limitation agreements already signed are in jeopardy  and no new agreement has been reached. The start of the deployment in Western Europe of United States medium-range nuclear missiles is one of the gravest developments of the recent past. It increases the feeling of a nuclear threat in Europe and serves not only to stir up more tension in international life but also to augment distrust between countries of the European continent.69.	In this situation  a positive reaction by the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to the reasonable proposals of socialist countries  proposals that take into account the rightful security interests of all parties  would be of particular importance. The member States of the Warsaw Treaty Organization seek no military superiority  but cannot allow the historically established military balance to be upset. Therefore  my Government  while expressing concern at the situation created by the deployment of missiles  considers that the countermeasures taken by the Soviet Union were justified. On the other hand  we think that the goal to be sought should be to maintain military parity at the lowest possible level of armaments and armed forces. Progress towards this goal requires the creation of conditions that will make possible the resumption of arms control talks that were broken off as a result of the deployment of missiles in Western Europe.70.	The Hungarian Government is of the view that the unfavourable processes in international life are not irreversible. In our nuclear age there is no reasonable alternative to the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems. We hold that in the prevailing situation  fraught as it is with danger  there are objective factors that make it indispensable for the dialogue between the countries of the world to be maintained and even widened. This  however  calls for a tangible manifestation of political will  a serious study of proposals seeking to reduce tension  and a substantive response to such proposals.71.	The paramount significance attached to relations between the two great Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  has been emphasized by many speakers here in the Assembly. The course of Soviet- American relations is seen by Hungary  too  as a determinant factor of the international situation. I believe that all members of the international community would welcome a genuine turn towards a more realistic and more responsible relationship between the two countries. We are convinced that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States can be normalized only on the basis of respect for the principles of equality and equal security.72.	My Government believes that the international conditions of today make it even more imperative that everything possible be done to stop the deterioration of the situation. It is therefore regrettable that some quarters are questioning the realities that emerged since the Second World War  thus further straining the already tense political situation. The peoples do not want to give up the benefits of detente and the beneficial atmosphere generated by that period for all of us. Governments should rely on this enormous moral asset in order to reverse the unfavourable processes that promise nothing but danger for the whole world and could lead to a waste of material and intellectual resources  postpone solutions for pressing global problems  worsen the conditions of life for peoples and cause our entire civilization to sink into decay.73.	In international forums  including the General Assembly  the socialist countries and other States have been exerting considerable efforts towards disarmament. Unfortunately  it has so far not been possible to achieve concrete results and  moreover  the results already achieved are in danger. It is a cause for worry that the international forums destined to elaborate disarmament and arms control accords are doomed to failure by the unwillingness of NATO to reach substantive agreements.74.	The Hungarian Government holds that efforts should be redoubled despite the failures. The political significance of the disarmament forums is increasing rather than diminishing. The deliberations on disarmament and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly  even if they do not produce immediate results  point emphatically to the desire for peace of the peoples and numerous countries of the globe and to their pursuit of a peaceful and secure world in which to live and work.75.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic considers that removing the danger of war  particularly a nuclear war  and curbing the arms race are the most urgent tasks of international politics.76.	As regards the efforts to avert the danger of a nuclear war  we attach particular importance to the proposal that every nuclear Power should renounce the first use of nuclear weapons. Such a commitment would make a significant contribution to the improvement of the international atmosphere and to the strengthening of trust among States. Inclusion by the nuclear Powers of their unilateral commitments in an instrument of international law would considerably enhance the political weight of that step.77.	Strengthening the security guarantees for non- nuclear-weapon States is an extremely important task. My Government also believes that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe and other parts of the world is useful and timely.78.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic continues to attach great importance to the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We hope that the forthcoming Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will contribute to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. General and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapons tests would equally help to curb the arms race.79.	The extension of the arms race to outer space is a dangerous development that gravely threatens world peace. We support the efforts to have talks on its complete demilitarization started as early as possible  as well as the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the question of the exclusively peaceful use of outer space.80.	While laying special emphasis on nuclear dis-armament  we deem it necessary to speed up the talks on the prohibition of such instruments of mass destruction as chemical  radiological or other weapons and to complete them successfully as soon as possible. Ending the rivalry in conventional weaponry is a similarly important task.81.	Concerned with the maintenance of peace and the promotion of constructive inter-State relations  the Hungarian Government devotes increased attention to strengthening security and co-operation in Europe and to fostering the spirit of Helsinki. With the approach of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act  my Government remains convinced that the most effective way of defending detente and deepening co-operation in Europe is the full and balanced implementation of the provisions of that document by all the participating States.82.	The vitality of the process initiated at Helsinki is evidenced by the fact that the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europeâeven under conditions of tensionâconcluded its work with the adoption of a substantive and balanced document and thereby opened the way to the convening at Stockholm of the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. My Government deems it important that those talks produce results and contribute to the reduction of tension and military confrontation.83.	A constructive response by the NATO countries to the proposal concerning the elaboration of a treaty on the renunciation of the use of armed force and on the maintenance of peaceful relations would have a positive influence on the development of the all- European process. In their appeal published in Budapest last April  the Warsaw Treaty member States proposed that multilateral consultations on this question be started as early as possible. The Hungarian Government has sent the text of the appeal to all parties concerned and is awaiting their substantive replies.84.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic has been doing its utmost to help unfold the Helsinki process and to promote the full implementation of the principles and recommendations contained in the Final Act. The fact that  in conformity with the decision of the Madrid meeting  the European Cultural Forum will take place at Budapest in 1985 is seen by us as international recognition of our activity in this direction. We are preparing for that Forum in the hope that it will be a further contribution to the development of co-operation in Europe  to a better acquaintance with one another  and that thereby it may be an important step towards the strengthening of confidence.85.	Hungary has sought to preserve and develop the results of detente through the channels of its bilateral relations as well. It has endeavoured to contribute to the improvement of the international atmosphere and to the practical implementation of the policy of peaceful coexistence by maintaining dialogue as well as by preserving and further developing its relations with States having a social system different from its own. We remain ready to continue a substantive dialogue.86.	The situation in the Middle East and the Israeli aggression against Arab countries continue to pose a grave threat to the entire world. My Government considers that further international efforts are required for the solution of the problems in that region. It believes that the Middle East situation calls for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement that would ensure for the Palestinian people the exercise of its legitimate rights  including the right to establish a State of its own  and would create all the conditions and guarantees that are necessary for all States of the region to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders.87.	Developments in the past year  particularly the aggression against Grenada and the actions threatening the sovereignty of Cuba and Nicaragua  have introduced more tension in the Caribbean region. My Government is increasingly concerned at such developments in that part of the world and lends its support to the efforts to find a peaceful  negotiated solution for the crisis in Central America.88.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic continues to be in favour of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and of respect for its sovereignty and non-aligned status. It supports the endeavours of the Secretary-General on behalf of a peaceful  negotiated settlement of the question of Cyprus in the spirit of the relevant United Nations resolutions and on the basis of respect for the interests of both ethnic communities.89.	Unfortunately  South-East Asia is still a source of tension in international politics. We are of the view that the controversial issues of the region should be resolved peacefully by the States directly involved  on the basis of respect for their mutual interests and of the existing realities. The constructive proposals of the Indo-Chinese countries provide an appropriate framework for such efforts. Progress would similarly be enhanced by a general international recognition of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and by a move to ensure its legitimate representation in international organizations  including the United Nations.90.	The intervention of international reactionary forces in the internal affairs of Afghanistanâthe undeclared war against that countryâshould be ended as soon as possible. The Hungarian Government follows with great attention the activity of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General and it hopes that the interested States will find a way of reaching a negotiated settlement on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.91.	My Government supports the initiatives by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful and democratic reunification of the country without external interference.92.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic calls for the elimination of the vestiges of the colonial system wherever they still exist. We believe that concerted international efforts and more resolute action are needed to achieve that goal. The just struggle of the national liberation movements has our support.93.	My Government attaches great importance to achieving a fuller measure of social justice and a more complete exercise of human rights in the world. Proceeding on the basis of its socialist system of society  Hungary is working to comply fully with the international obligations it has undertaken in this field. We regard the policy of the racist Republic of South Africa as the most striking example of gross and mass violations of human rights. We consider the adoption of the new South African constitution as a manoeuvre designed to perpetuate the system of apartheid. Responsibility for the delay in the settlement of the question of Namibia rests with the South African regime and its supporters.94.	The Hungarian People's Republic supports the anti-imperialist endeavours of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and is ready to co-operate with it in the realization of its just demands for the establishment of a more peaceful and more democratic world order and for equitable solutions to the problems besetting the developing countries.95.	The unfavourable trends in the international situation have had their impact on the world economy as well. International economic and technological relations are seriously damaged by the growing tendencies to embargo  increasing protectionism  the difficulties in the international currency and monetary systems and the artificially high interest rates  which affect almost all countries and groups of countries but hit the developing nations hardest.96.	In the prevailing situation  further delay is being experienced in dealing with the numerous global problems of the world  the settlement of which is possible only if international co-operation improves. The accomplishment of pressing tasks such as food supply for the world's population  protection of mothers and children  reasonable use of raw materials and energy  exploration of new sources of energy  and environmental protection is put off even further. All this may have unpredictable consequences for the future of our globe. The specialized agencies and the other organizations within the United Nations system should have a major role to play in the alleviation of these problems.97.	At their conference held at the highest level in Moscow last June  the member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance advocated more intense work for the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. They proposed that global negotiations on the most important economic issues be started at an early date within the framework of the United Nations  with the participation of all States.98.	Hungary  which earns nearly one half of its national income in foreign trade  is also severely tried by the unfavourable trends in international economic and trading conditions. We seek to develop and expand our external economic relations and we are against discrimination and protectionism. My Government maintains that world trade should be conducted on the basis of most-favoured-nation treatment  non-discrimination and fulfilment in good faith of contractual obligations. We are convinced that in the present tense international situation the establishment of such economic relations can have an important stabilizing role to play  thereby exerting a favourable political effect as well.99.	Last spring we had the opportunity to welcome the Secretary-General in our country and to hold useful talks with him. My Government continues to attach paramount importance to the activities of the United Nations and remains ready to take an active part in the work of the world Organization for the solution of the ever more complex problems facing the globe. It is our conviction that the United Nations must play an effective role in the settlement of international disputes  in the solution of global problems and in the efforts to raise peaceful interstate relations and manifold international co-operation to a higher level. Compliance by all Member States with the obligations they have undertaken under the Charter of the United Nations and other international documents and joint efforts by them to tackle the existing problems would be of decisive importance. If such were to occur  the Secretary- General would be able a year from nowâon the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nationsâto prepare a report on a world that is considerably more peaceful and more secure than it is now."
"65",3146,"IDN",39,1984,"ï»¿It is most gratifying to my delegation that the President of this session is a seasoned diplomat  with a long association with the United Nations  and an outstanding representative of Zambia  with which my country has always enjoyed fraternal and friendly relations. Our confidence in your abilities  Sir  has long been established by your leadership of the United Nations Council for Namibia  as President of which you have for so many years tirelessly dedicated yourself to the execution of its mandate. I take this opportunity to express to you the warm congratulations of my Government  as well as my own congratulations  on your unanimous election and to pledge my delegation's full cooperation in the discharge of your formidable task.225.	To your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  I wish to convey our deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he has guided the deliberations of the thirty-eighth session.226.	I am particularly privileged to extend a special welcome to Brunei Darussalam on its accession to membership in the United Nations. Our pleasure in seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brunei Darussalam  Prince Mohamed Bolkiah  in this Hall is all the greater since Brunei Darussalam  in January this year  joined ASEAN as its sixth member State  an event that further deepened the bonds of friendship and cultural kinship that have traditionally linked our two peoples. The admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations underscores not only the universality of the Organization but also the continuing hope that mankind reposes in this unique forum for multilateral cooperation in the resolution of pressing global problems.227.	Once again we are here to address ourselves to the concerns of our time  to seek new avenues to strengthen global peace and security  to increase international cooperation and to chart a better future for the nations of the world. Our task  however  has been rendered infinitely more difficult by the awesome dangers and challenges that continue to cast a pall over our hopes and aspirations. The past year in particular was marked by great uncertainty and a deepening chill in great Power relationships  further threatening the already fragile structure of international peace and security. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the context of the overriding fear of nuclear war  which today hangs like the sword of Damocles over all humanity.228.	Against this background  the persistence of conflict and tension in various regions has reinforced the negative trend towards power politics and so called strategic alliances. The current tendency to resort to military solutions in pursuit of questionable interests has seriously eroded the principles of non-interference and non-intervention and has led to the imposition faits accomplis. As a result  some States have been forced into spheres of influence and dependency relationships reminiscent of a bygone era.229.	The intensification of the arms race remains at the centre of our collective concern. A heightened sense of insecurity pervades the entire international community before the prospect of an irreversible spiral of escalation. We are today confronted by a virtual deadlock in all negotiating forums on disarmament and the suspension of crucial arms control negotiations already under way. Even the sanctity and integrity of existing agreements are now in danger of being undermined  and on the horizon looms the real threat of an uncontrollable arms race in outer space. At this critical time for the future of disarmament  we are duty bound to respond with even greater determination and commitment to the pleas of mankind for a halt to this headlong rush towards self-extinction.230.	My delegation is convinced that a new  integrated approach  as distinct from the piecemeal disarmament efforts of the past  should be adopted  comprising both quantitative reductions and qualitative restrictions. The wider the range of weapons covered the greater would be the value of such an initiative. At the same time  while continuing to accord the highest priority to nuclear disarmament we should ensure that conventional disarmament measures  especially by the major Powers  are simultaneously pursued. In this context  we welcome the report of the Secretary General containing the study in conventional disarmament as a positive contribution. Conclusive progress can be gauged by linking reductions in military budgets to cuts in specific weapons systems and related activities in research and development. With a view to stemming the qualitative improvement and preventing the development of new types of weapons  the need for a comprehensive treaty banning the testing of all types of nuclear weapons in all environments has become even more urgent.231.	The main responsibility for initiating this comprehensive approach rests with the nuclear Powers  which should agree as a first step on an immediate freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons. This should be followed by substantive arms reduction negotiations in the context of the Conference on Disarmament. Such a redirection would not constrain but rather strengthen bilateral and regional talks in the efforts to achieve the ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. In this regard  we underline the Joint Declaration by Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania of 22 May 1984  which stressed that while it is the primary responsibility of the nuclear weapon States to prevent a nuclear catastrophe  this problem is too important to be left solely to those States. World disarmament  peace and security are the responsibility of mankind as a whole.232.	Ever mindful of the nuclear threat that confronts our strategically significant region  my Government has long advocated the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in South East Asia as part of our regional approach to security and disarmament. In this regard  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the annual meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers held at Jakarta last July endorsed this initiative as an essential component in the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in the region. The ASEAN Working Group created to promote the zone is undertaking a study to identify various aspects and modalities for the realization of the nuclear weapon free zone concept.233.	Indonesia  as an archipelagic State situated at the crossroads of two oceans and of important international waterways  is also deeply disturbed by the increasing naval build-up and the rapid development of new naval arms systems. In past years these aspects have not been conspicuous on the international agenda of arms control and disarmament. Yet  the steady expansion and modernization of the navies of the two superpowers in particular  the technological advances and the increased sophistication of naval based weapon systems are adding a new and potentially destabilizing dimension to the overall arms race. My delegation therefore welcomed the decision of the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session to carry out a comprehensive study on all aspects of the naval arms race with a view to analysing their possible ramifications and  more important  facilitating the identification of areas for disarmament and confidence-building measures. Indonesia is actively participating in the Group of Governmental Experts constituted for this purpose.234.	Also in this context  my delegation has long worked with likeminded States for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.However  despite the many years of concerted effort  we have witnessed an unprecedented build-up of foreign forces in the Indian Ocean proper and in its vicinity. Thus  the Indian Ocean is moving inexorably in the direction of unbridled strategic competition  constituting an imminent threat to the security interests of the littoral and hinterland States. This dangerous slide must be arrested through the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean called for by the General Assembly. I appeal to the great Powers and the major maritime users to review their positions and allow the Conference to take place in the near future  thereby initiating negotiations to promote a relaxation of tension and to bring durable peace and security to the region.235.	We may count ourselves fortunate that the world has thus far been spared the horrors of nuclear war. However  there can be no satisfaction whatsoever in seeing the many unresolved conflicts employing conventional arms which continue to rage m many regions of the world.236.	From the beginning of the Kampuchean conflict  member States of ASEAN have adopted a position based upon internationally recognized principles. Likewise  our actions have clearly demonstrated a genuine desire to contribute to a peaceful solution of the problem through comprehensive negotiations taking into account the legitimate interests of all the parties. In this regard  I should like to recall the various concrete proposals advanced by ASEAN in its appeal for Kampuchean independence of 21 September 1983."" These include  in particular  the offer of a series of initial steps  such as partial withdrawal of foreign forces on a territorial basis and within a specific time frame  a ceasefire and the introduction of peacekeeping forces.237.	In its efforts to bring about the adoption of this approach  ASEAN has demonstrated its flexibility and rationality. For  although ASEAN remains fully committed to elements contained in the Declaration on Kampuchea  adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York in July 1981 we are none the less open with regard to the modalities for arriving at a political solution. Nor has it ever been ASEAN's demand that the proposals contained in its September 1983 appeal be taken as the only basis for a solution  as has been alleged. Regrettably  this reasonable approach continues to be spumed. We believe that there is no point in calling for a dialogue which evades the core aspects of the Kampuchean problem and submits it to unrealistic demands amounting to preconditions.238.	The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchean soil and the establishment of a Kampuchean Government of the people's own choosing should continue to form the basis for a solution. Without it  the nationalist forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  under the inspired leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  will have no choice but to continue their legitimate struggle against foreign intervention and occupation. We further believe that national reconciliation of all Kampuchean factions is essential for the restoration of independence and the maintenance of the national unity of Kampuchea. It was in this light that the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Joint Statement on the Kampuchean Problem  issued at Jakarta on 9 July 1984 called upon Viet Nam to support such national reconciliation. We hope that Viet Nam will respond positively and sincerely to ASEAN's appeal to seek a comprehensive political settlement to a problem which  apart from the principles involved  is basically a conflict between the Kampuchean people and Viet Nam. The alternative would be the persistence of foreign intervention  instability and turmoil in Southeast Asia. 239.	In Southwest Asia  the continued presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan has caused great tension and anxiety in the region and beyond. In the interest of restoring regional confidence and stability  Afghanistan must be allowed to resume its historical nonaligned role.240.	In the Middle East  Israeli aggression and expansionism has constituted the most formidable obstacle to peace in the region. Hence  various attempts at partial solutions have been manipulated by Israel as a convenient cover for the consolidation of its entrenchment in the occupied territories. Most important  they have proved inadequate and failed to address the question of the fundamental rights and legitimate aspirations of the Arab people.241.	This bitter reality continues to stir the cauldron of enmity in the Middle East  and the region continues to be a focus of East West confrontation. My Government therefore welcomed the decision of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983âand endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 38/58Câthat an international peace conference on the Middle East should be convened. Only through such a forum  with the participation on an equal footing of all the parties concerned  including the PLO  can a comprehensive  just and durable peace be achieved.242.	In preparing for the conference it is crucial that clear and agreed terms of reference be established on the basis of the core issues of the conflict: that is  the legitimate right of self-determination and sovereign nationhood for the Palestinian people; Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem; and the need of the States in the region to live in peace  within internationally recognized boundaries. It is our fervent hope that the negotiations at the conference on these terms of reference will lead to the implementation of a just and comprehensive settlement.243.	Given the complexity of the issues involved  it is critical that the major Powers demonstrate their concurrence and support by actively and constructively participating in the preparations for the peace conference.244.	A full two years after the brutal Israeli invasion  the Lebanese people have found no respite in their suffering under occupation. The past year has even recorded an increased incidence of repressive measures and arbitrary violence.245.	It is unfortunate that the most recent efforts by the Security Council to redress the desperate situation of the civilians in occupied Lebanon were thwarted by a single negative vote  especially in the light of the Council's unanimous call in 1982 for the total withdrawal of all Israeli forces.246.	Israel's stranglehold on southern Lebanon has tightened to the point of threatening the country's economic viability  by isolating southern* Lebanon from the rest of the country.247.	The arduous task undertaken by the people of Lebanon of restoring their unity through national reconciliation and bringing a sense of normalcy through national reconstruction is being seriously challenged by these Israeli actions. Indonesia therefore fully supports Lebanon's demand for the immediate  unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Israeli occupation forces.248.	In the same region  we continue to be seriously concerned that the conflict between two brotherly nations  Iran and Iraq  has not abated  after four years of incalculable bloodshed. The continuing hostilities now threaten the Gulf and may well lead to the involvement of extra regional Powers. Despite these negative trends  we are heartened by the Secretary Generalâs success in achieving an agreement for the cessation of military attacks against civilian population centres. We trust that this agreement will endure and eventually bring about the cessation of hostilities on a wider scale  paving the way towards an honourable and just peace.249.	Just a month ago we were confronted with yet another scheme by the Pretoria regime for further entrenching its apartheid policy through a so-called constitutional change. However  the people boycotted the sham elections and courageously confronted the military might of the racist regime to manifest before the world their solidarity and determination to oppose the constitutional fraud.250.	The United Nations has categorically condemned	as contrary to the Charter and a crime against humanity. It is the moral duty of all Member States  particularly those that have continued to lend credence and support to Pretoria  to take resolute steps to secure the objective of a non-racial democratic society in South Africa.251.	As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Indonesia has grave misgivings that  as time passes with no real progress towards Namibian independence  the United Nations plan for Namibia is moving ever closer to becoming a dead letter. As the plan continues to languish  the Pretoria regime has become even more emboldened in its reliance on pretext after pretext and manoeuvre after manoeuvre to impose its own illegal internal solution on the Territory. Despite the many broken promises by the colonial regime  the valiant Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  have demonstrated their determination to achieve the total and genuine liberation of Namibia.252.	South Africa must not be allowed to pursue its tactics of further undermining the terms of the plan  particularly in the light of the Security Council decision [resolution 539 (1983)] unequivocally reaffirming that it is utterly unacceptable to link the United Nations plan to extraneous and irrelevant issues  for they can only have a disastrous impact not only on Namibia itself but also on the States in the region of southern Africa as a whole. Namibia remains the only colonial Territory for which the United Nations has assumed total responsibility  and we  the Members  have a solemn obligation to the Namibian people to fulfil our common commitment to achieve the genuine decolonization and independence of Namibia.253.	A full two years have passed since the armed confrontation over the Malvinas Islands. We note with appreciation the initiative of the Swiss Government in July last to facilitate direct contact between the two parties. We hope that negotiations will be renewed to resolve this festering problem in the context of the geopolitical realities and the long-term interests of the two countries.254.	In facing the specific manifestations of the challenges and problems in Central America  my delegation believes that only through the mechanism of negotiations and dialogue can the misunderstandings and misperceptions that have led to tension and conflicts in the past be removed. Indonesia therefore continues to support the initiative of the Contadora Group  which offers the most comprehensive and balanced approach  taking into account the unique political  economic and social conditions prevailing in the region. My delegation lauds the dedication of the Group's member States to achieving solutions  particularly the current efforts to arrive at a consensus on the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. We are hopeful that this Act will become a basis for peace  stability and good neighbourliness throughout the region.255.	The quests for peace  security  disarmament and development are inextricably linked. Malaise  fear and uncertainty are not the exclusive features of the political arena. They also pervade the domain of international economics and  as in politics  they can be effectively overcome only through close international cooperation. To act otherwise is to court disaster.256.	Ten years have now passed since the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 3201 (S-VI)  calling for the establishment of a new international economic order  which gave us hope for a new era of multilateral development cooperation. Four years have elapsed since the General Assembly launched the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Regrettably  both initiatives are now apparently side-lined in favour of unilateral expedience and opportunism. Their failure stands as an indictment of our times. Instead of an increase in international cooperation  we see multilateralism on the retreat  development cooperation on the defensive and the gap of economic disparity and inequality continuing to widen. This anomalous situation is the major challenge facing our collective wisdom and resolve at this Assembly session.257.	The state of the world economy also reflects this dilemma. The headlines in the media of the developed countries have generally characterized the world economy as one well embarked on a course towards recovery. In consequence  the developing countries are urged to wait patiently for the transmission of the recovery's benefits down to them. But there is another world and another perspective. For three quarters of mankind the realities stand in stark contrast to this optimistic scenario. The economic upswing has  for the most part  continued to elude them. Stagnation and retrenchment are in general their common plight. High interest rates  protectionism  sharp declines in commodity prices  unemployment  debt crises and liquidity problems compose much of the injurious mosaic of difficulties that currently afflict their economies.258.	In the field of international trade  it is a cruel paradox that the developed countries counsel developing countries on the benefits of increased participation in global trade while at the same time erecting more restrictive barriers to their products. The communiques of the economic summits held at Williamsburg in May 1983 and in London last June notwithstanding  protectionism continues to exact a heavy toll. Compounding this dilemma  the sharp decline in commodity prices and a corresponding decline in access to development financing have forced the developing countries to effect severe contractions in their development programmes. Prolonged high interest rates too have seriously aggravated their liquidity problems and  if those rates are not markedly reduced in the near future  the tentative recovery could very well be aborted and the current difficulties of the developing countries rendered more intractable.259.	A brief word on the region of Asia  to which my country belongs. It is true that many of the countries in this region have  against tremendous odds  managed to retain their economic resilience throughout the depths of the recession and are again posting satisfactory growth rates. But that overall assessment masks many externally induced problems. Some 900 million people in Asia are still living tenuously under the poverty line. Problems of population and massive unemployment still pose grave challenges to any development scheme  however well-conceived. The magnitude and thus the gravity of these problems cannot be discounted. Any downturn in the world economy therefore could have incalculable costs in human terms for this region.260.	For those reasons and more  Indonesia strongly believes that the developing countries cannot stand and wait for a dubious trickling down of an uncertain recovery. Hence  recovery and the reactivation of development should be jointly stimulated. Concerted and collective action by each and all members of the international community  and particularly by the economically powerful  are indispensable if a sustained  global economic recovery is to be achieved.261.	In this era of interdependence no country can develop in isolation  and indeed the developed countries are also dependent on the economic health of the developing countries for their own prosperity. However  one important lesson that we can draw from the past several years of extremely difficult times is perhaps the fact of a persistent asymmetrical interdependence in international economic relations. Therefore  the aim should be genuine economic interdependence in which the developing countries are active and equal partners and their economies not merely by-products of the economic advances of the North.262.	On the issue of institutional and structural change in the world economy  the outlook remains deeply disappointing. Procedural hurdles continue to block the launching of the global negotiations and their resolution seems more remote than ever. There is no denying  however  that global problems necessitate global solutions. Indonesia therefore remains strongly convinced that unless the issues of trade  money  finance and development can be treated in their inseparable interconnection  the results can only be  at best  provisional. Some issues need to be dealt with on an individual basis through an immediate measures policy. This we realize. None the less  we should never lose sight of the imperative need for an integrated global approach.263.	In the North South context  two important international conferences took place this year. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August  addressed population problems that have emerged since the World Population Conference held at Bucharest 10 years ago. Indonesia  as the fifth most populous nation on earth  is acutely aware of the complexity of the population issue and of its vital interrelationships with resources  food  the environment and development. In our national development strategy  therefore  we believe a two-pronged approach is essential. First  a population centred development policy is necessary in which decisions are designed to encompass all aspects of the population problem; and  secondly  development oriented population policies should be formulated to stimulate and promote development. It is important that we do not allow the momentum generated at Mexico City to dissipate. The recommendations for the further implementation of the World Population Plan of Action' and the Mexico City Declaration on Population and Development  adopted by the Conference  should be vigorously implemented both for our mutual benefit and in trust for the generations to come.264.	The outcome of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August  fell far short of our expectations. The preamble to the Conference's conclusions and recommendations ' describing the world economic situation and its influence on the industrialization process in the developing countries  failed to achieve consensus. Likewise  two extremely important  indeed outstanding  issuesânamely  the mobilization of financial resources for industrial development and world industrial restructuring and redeploymentâembodied in two draft resolutions  met with a similar fate. These two issues will be taken up at this session of the General Assembly. Indonesia still strongly believes that the goals and targets set out in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Cooperation' and the New Delhi Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrialization of Developing Countries and International Cooperation for their Industrial Development' are of critical importance for the accelerated development of the developing countries.265.	As a country actively engaged in national development  Indonesia attaches the utmost importance to the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Consequently  we voice our deep concern over the crucial lack of political will demonstrated at the meetings of the Committee on the Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. To our regret  despite the unanimous recognition of both the dismal performance in the implementation of the International Development Strategy to date and its dire consequences for the economies of the developing countries  those States that could play a leading role in resolving the situation seem to be at best indifferent. However  we continue to believe in the validity and authenticity of the goals  objectives and general orientation of the Strategy. In its further implementation  the political determination of the international community is pivotal.266.	Another issue which deserves the urgent response of the international community is the critically depressed economic situation in Africa caused by the prolonged drought  rapidly expanding desertification and the severe global recession. We are deeply disappointed that the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council  held at Geneva from 4 to 27 July 1984  failed to reach consensus on the desperate plight faced by millions of people in the affected countries. This session of the General Assembly should reach agreement on measures to enable the international community to overcome this crisis of catastrophic proportions.267.	While uncertainty and intransigence reign in the world economy and in the North South negotiations  South South collective self-reliance has acquired even greater urgency and significance. Economic cooperation and technical cooperation among developing countries are essential instruments for promoting the rational and efficient use of resources available in developing countries for their autonomous development. The meeting at Cartagena in June this year on South South cooperation once again demonstrates the strong determination of the developing countries to implement the Caracas Programme of Action  adopted by the High-level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries  held at Caracas in May 1981.268.	Let me now touch briefly on some social issues of deep concern to my country. The year 1985 will mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women. Considerable progress has already been achieved in enhancing the role and responsibilities of women in society in general. But other and more formidable challenges embodied in the Programme of Action for the Second Half of the United Nations Decade for Women still lie ahead. We trust that these challenges will be effectively addressed at the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace  to be held in 1985 at Nairobi.269.	One of the most important and concrete achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women was the adoption by the General Assembly in 1979 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Indonesian Government has ratified this Convention not only because its tenets are in full accord with the rights already guaranteed to women by our Constitution but also because it will reinforce the effectiveness of those rights universally.270.	On the problem of refugees  the considerable response of the international community was once again demonstrated at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984. As in Asia  while pertinent assistance has been forthcoming  the continued support of the international community is paramount.271.	Another area of deep concern to Indonesia is that of childrenâa most vulnerable sectorâin which millions of lives have been threatened by the global economic downturn. UNICEF's child survival and development strategy stands as a beacon of hope for further reducing mortality among infants and young children. The recent supportive public statements from world leaders  including the Secretary General  are important factors in creating a climate conducive to making substantial progress in child health throughout the world. The opportunity to accelerate child survival and development should not be allowed to pass  even in these difficult times. Indonesia  in cooperation with UNICEF  has achieved important breakthroughs. Consequently  infant mortality rates have been significantly reduced in Indonesia.272.	Last January my Government had the honour to host at Jakarta  the Conference of the Ministers of Information of Nonaligned Countries  which underscored the importance that Indonesia and all nonaligned countries attach to the often repeated goal of a new international information and communication order. Indeed  the nonaligned countries pioneered the initiative of the new order  as we have long been the victims of the unbalanced flow of information and communication. With regard to the United Nations  the Declaration of the Jakarta Conference pledged the full cooperation of the nonaligned countries with efforts by the United Nations to provide technical assistance to the developing countries  study the relevant policies and activities of the United Nations and promote the rapid development of the new order. Indonesia remains convinced that the spirit of cooperation and the will to reach consensus  which have gradually increased over the past years  will hasten the advent of the new international information and communication order.273.	As we approach the halfway mark of the decade of the 1980s  mankind's vision of an international order of greater security and stability  of larger prosperity and justice  appears as distant as ever.274.	Heightened major Power contention has exacerbated the unresolved flashpoints of conflict and violence in many regions of the world. The prolonged world economic crisis with its particularly adverse effects on the developing countries and the growing threat of an ever escalating arms race continue to paralyse the collective capacity of nations to develop the necessary consensus on concepts and policies to meet the exigencies of our present predicament. Yet  when the need for a concerted approach in dealing with our global problems is most urgently felt  we instead witness an astonishing retreat from multilateralism and a wilful weakening of the mechanisms and structures for international dialogue and cooperation. What is more  the United Nations  the universal embodiment of the concept of multilateralism  is increasingly being bypassed or ignored.275.	My delegation fully agrees with the Secretary General that  at this critical juncture in the life of the Organization  the overriding need is for all Member States to rededicate themselves to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations by making them the basis of their day-to-day relations between Governments and between peoples.276.	The impending fortieth anniversary of the Organization provides us with a timely opportunity to renew our faith in the United Nations system as the unique and indispensable forum for harmonizing the interests and actions of nations in the realization of mankind's hopes for peace and equitable development for all. Beyond this act of rededication  however  there is also an undeniable need to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its functions as outlined in the Charter and to enhance the validity and utility of its organs. Only if all Member States join in this effort  through actions rather than words  through concrete proposals for reform rather than rhetoric  can we ensure that the Organization will again resume the role for which it was created: a central and solid framework for a new and revitalized world order. Thus its fortieth anniversary commemoration may yet become a true celebration."
"66",3193,"IND",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are particularly gratified to see you  a distinguished son of Africa and an eminent representative of a country with which India has traditionally close and cordial relations  preside over the proceedings of this Assembly. We are confident that under your able stewardship we shall be able to deal effectively with the many important questions on our agenda.186.	I should like to take this opportunity also to place on record our appreciation of the effective and statesmanlike leadership provided to the Assembly's thirty-eighth session by your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Illueca  of Panama.187.	I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the indefatigable energy and quiet competence he has displayed in his stewardship of the United Nations during the past year. His patience and perseverance are characteristic of a style of functioning that has added much prestige and honour to the office of the Secretary-General. He has won our admiration for his skilful handling of several crisis situations. We wish him every success in the future.188.	We welcome to the United Nations family its newest member  Brunei Darussalam. Its admission as the 159th Member is a reaffirmation of the principle of universality of membership of the Organization. We look forward to working in close co-operation with that country's delegation in the United Nations.189.	We are at the threshold of the fifth decade of the United Nations. As the United Nations approaches its fortieth anniversary it is but appropriate that we pause to review the historic role the Organization has been playing. This is also a time for introspection and reflection so that we can improve our own performance and make the Organization more effective.190.	In November 1948  the first Prime Minister of India  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  addressing the General Assembly'"" on behalf of newly independent India  stated that the Charter of the United Nations  in noble language  had laid down the principles and purposes of that great Organization  and he thought it would not be possible to improve upon that language. The objectives were clear  he said  and yet it had often happened that the main objectives had been lost sight of amid matters of secondary importance. He further stated that he was convinced that the best of objectives could not be reached if men's eyes were bloodshot and men's minds clouded with passion. The lesson of history  he noted  and more especially the lesson of the last two great wars  which had devastated humanity  was that out of hatred and violence could come only hatred and violence. The Assembly was in the midst of a cycle of hatred and violence  he said  and it was obvious that if that cycle persisted and war  which the Assembly was specially intended to prevent  broke out  not only would there be tremendous devastation all over the world  but no individual Power or group of Powers would achieve its objective.191.	The words of Jawaharlal Nehru are valid even today. The optimism that was generated in the early years of the United Nations has in recent years been sadly dissipated. We are facing not only an acute and troubled international situation but  more important  a period when faith in the world Organization appears to be weakening. There is today in some quarters a cynical disregard of the role and contribution of the United Nations  as  indeed  a profound suspicion of all multilateral approaches where these do not coincide with or directly promote the interests of these countries. We are facing the danger of a retreat from multilateralism which can only adversely affect the prospects of international peace and security and undermine the very foundations of this unique Organization. India and other non-aligned countries are determined to reverse this trend. As India did at the outset of the establishment of the United Nations  I would like now once again to reaffirm  on behalf of the Government and people of India  our undiminished faith in the United Nations and our continued commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter.192.	In his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization [A/39/1]  the Secretary-General has reiterated the need to preserve and strengthen the Organization for harmonizing the actions of nations and to enhance the concept of multilateralism  which is a basic premise of our activity in the United Nations. He has rightly asserted that the realization of the full potential of the United Nations depends upon a willingness to take active steps to experiment with new approaches on the assumption that our common and agreed objective is human survival in reasonably decent conditions. We need to ponder over this issue. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations should provide us with a unique opportunity for rededication  but also for a reassessment  some soul-searching and  above all  concrete remedial action. Our commitment to the multilateral approach is important and must be strengthened if we want the vision of the founding fathers to be realized.193.	Throughout the years of our freedom struggle  India's leaders viewed independence not merely in national terms but as a part of the struggle of oppressed peoples everywhere for justiceâpolitical  economic and social. In the course of its transformation  India has built up a vast industrial infrastructure which has enabled it to keep pace with the scientific and technological advancements taking place in the world. Our democratic institutions  evolved over the years  have given the people of India a deep sense of participation and commitment in determining the nation's economic  social and political priorities. India's economy envisages a predominant role for the public sector in areas of basic industry as well as a flourishing private sector consistent with our socio-economic philosophy  which aims at prosperity and growth with social justice. The planning process adopted by India as an indispensable instrument for the development of all sectors of our economy involves the full participation of our people.194.	In our international relationships  adherence to the policy of non-alignment has been both instinctive and inevitable. Even before the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries held its first summit in 1961  the essential principles of non-alignment had become the basis for the conduct of our foreign policy.195.	Today the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with its membership of 101 countries  constitutes the vast majority of the membership of the United Nations. It is an indication of the intrinsic appeal and relevance of this Movement  as well as its significance and its achievements to date  that almost every newly independent nation seeks membership.196.	As Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said in her address to the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983:""Its significance is not to be measured by the number of divisions or the megatons of destructive power we command  but by the intensity with which we desire peace and freedom  development and international justice.""Other Governments may have conflicting opinions on right and wrong. We the non-aligned have chosen peace  which surely is the right and inevitable choice. We have sought and continue to seek friendship with all  except Governments which are racist or threaten the hard-earned freedom of others. Non-alignment is not vague  not negative  not neutral.""Non-alignment is national independence and freedom. It stands for peace and the avoidance of confrontation. It aims at keeping away from military alliances. It means equality among nations and the democratization of international relations  economic and political. It wants global co-operation for development on the basis of mutual benefit. It is a strategy for the recognition and preservation of the world's diversity.""197.	The question of disarmament has always remained a basic concern of India and other countries of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Governments and peoples all over the world are becoming increasingly aware of the grave threat posed to the very survival of mankind by the development  accumulation and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Two special sessions of the General Assembly have been devoted exclusively to this question. Yet new weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems are continuously being researched  tested  produced and deployed. A new arms race has begun in the chemical weapons field. New technologies are being developed which would make space  which has hitherto remained largely peaceful  a dangerous arena of military confrontation. Striking advances are also being made in conventional weaponry  giving it a versatility and lethal quality unknown in previous years.198.	The escalating arms race  the rise in international tensions and the absence of willingness for constructive dialogue among the major nuclear- weapon Powers have increased the risks of the outbreak of a nuclear war. Clearly  the dangers of the total annihilation of mankind  indeed  of any life on this planet  are so great and increasing with such inexorable rapidity that we cannot permit ourselves the luxury of either indifference or despair. Dangerous doctrines  such as those of nuclear deterrence and of limited nuclear warfare  are being propounded. No country will remain unaffected by the horror of nuclear conflict once it is unleashed. By the same token  none of us can remain indifferent to the need to speed up disarmament negotiations. It is ironical that the principal justification for adding new and costly weapon systems to the arsenals of the great Powers has been that it provides better negotiating positions for those countries in any arms limitation talks. The logic of this position is that disarmament can commence only after countries have armed themselves fully. Such bizarre logic cannot be expected to serve as a basis for any serious arms limitation exercise.199.	A fresh and concerted world-wide effort must therefore be made to halt the arms race. Nuclear- weapon States bear the greatest responsibility and must adopt urgent  practical measures to prevent a nuclear war. Specific proposals have been made by India and other non-aligned countries for a convention under United Nations aegis prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. The idea of a freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons is gaining popular support and needs to be given a practical shape in order to break the present impasse in arms negotiations. Efforts for a comprehensive nuclear-weapons-test-ban treaty must be expedited. Existing arms limitation agreements must be observed and new ones negotiated. At the same time  a concerted effort ought to be made to prevent a new and potentially more dangerous and destabilizing round of the arms race in the area of space-based systems. Diplomats and experts engaged in arms limitation and disarmament negotiations must now take due note of the mass popular upsurge in the world against nuclear weapons.200.	A major peace initiative in this regard was taken recently by the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  together with the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania. This five- continent initiative  launched on 22 May 1984  states  inter alia  in the Joint Declaration [A/39/277]:""As leaders of nations  States Members of the United Nations  we have a commitment to take constructive action towards halting and reversing the nuclear-arms race. The people we represent are no less threatened by nuclear war than the citizens of the nuclear-weapons States. It is primarily the responsibility of the nuclear-weapons States to prevent a nuclear catastrophe  but this problem is too important to be left to those States alone."" 201.	The Joint Declaration urges  as a necessary first step  the five nuclear-weapon States to halt all testing  production and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems  to be immediately followed by a substantial reduction in nuclear forces. This first step must be followed by a continuing programme of arms reduction leading to general and complete disarmament  accompanied by measures to strengthen the United Nations system and to ensure an urgently needed transfer of substantial resources from the arms race into social and economic development. The essential goal must be to reduce and then eliminate the risk of war between nations. The six- Power peace appeal has received the overwhelming support of the international community. People all over the world have an overriding interest in collective security and the avoidance of nuclear war. The appeal represents a significant step in mobilizing wider world support for the objectives of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on disarmament  as set out by the New Delhi Conference.202.	Non-aligned and like-minded nations must now think of other forms of action. The bulk of the global military expenditure of $1 trillion a year is accounted for by a handful of industrialized countries. A significant reduction in this enormously wasteful expenditure would not only help ease tensions the world over but also contribute to recovery and growth in the world economy and could be used to augment the currently decreasing levels of assistance to developing nations. The proposal for a world conference on disarmament and development de-serves to be taken up seriously by Member States.203.	India attaches great importance to general and complete disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  and the prevention of nuclear war. A number of proposals submitted by my delegation to begin a serious nuclear disarmament programme are already before the General Assembly. It is our earnest hope that during this session our proposals  as well as others in this field  will be considered in all seriousness and that meaningful decisions will be taken.204.	In our own neighbourhood  the Indian Ocean continues to be an area of competitive attention and mounting great-Power military presence  posing a direct threat to the security and integrity of the littoral and hinterland States. The increasing militarization of the Indian Ocean and its use as an arena for strategic power-play is a matter of immense concern to us. The establishment of new command structures has been accompanied by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry into the area. The 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace remains unimplemented.205.	Ever since the expansion of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean in 1979  it has been the earnest hope of the littoral and hinterland States that the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean would contribute towards the early convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean and to the early realization of the objectives of the 1971 Declaration. The evidence of the last few years has belied this expectation. On the contrary  efforts are afoot to distort the fundamental structure and elements of the 1971 Declaration. We believe that the Conference  to be held at Colombo  should be convened urgently to begin the process of elimination of great-Power military presence from the Indian Ocean in realization of the objectives of the Declaration. During the current year  the non-aligned countries have made serious efforts to complete necessary preparatory work for the Conference and have submitted a framework for its agenda. We hope all members of the	Ad hoc Committee will display the necessary political will and address themselves to this question in a constructive manner.206.	The countries of South Asia are currently engaged in an active search for regional co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit. This is in consonance with our own policies over the years of reinforcing the fabric of understanding and co-operation among the countries of the region. At the South Asian Regional Co-operation Meeting of Foreign Ministers  held at Male on 10 and 11 July of this year  a detailed review of the implementation of programmes was undertaken. We recognize that this will be a long process and will call for much patience and perseverance. Even now the induction of sophisticated arms in our neighbourhood serves external strategic interests and is complicating the task of peaceful co-operation in our region. Notwithstanding that  we have no doubt that the process of regional co-operation will continue to gain strength in the months and years ahead and will not only assist the economic and social development of the countries of South Asia but also ultimately promote good-neighbourliness and harmony in the whole area.207.	While on the subject of South Asia  it is with considerable regret that I find it necessary to refer to recent developments in Sri Lanka which have taken a turn for the worse  have caused us deep anguish and have aroused global concern. There has been a recrudescence of indiscriminate violence and killing by the armed forces on a scale which recalls the tragedy of July 1983. Reports indicate that the armed forces in that country have conducted large-scale operations in areas where the Tamils constitute the overwhelming majority of the population  resulting in heavy loss of life and property of the innocent Tamil population. If the spate of violence in the northern province continues  it is bound to have serious repercussions in other parts of Sri Lanka and precipitate an influx of refugees into our country. We already have 40 000 Sri Lankan refugees in Tamil Nadu.208.	The ethnic problem in Sri Lanka cannot be solved by military action. It is a political problem involving the just rights of the Tamil minority  md only the determined pursuit of the political process of consultation and mutual accommodation can lead to a constructive way out.209.	After the communal violence of 1983  the Prime Minister of India offered her good offices to help find a political solution to the problem. President Jayawardene of Sri Lanka accepted that offer  and the efforts of our special envoy to promote the process of dialogue have been undertaken with the full concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka. While talks within the framework of the All Party Conference are continuing  innuendos and insinuations are repeatedly being made against India.210.	We have reaffirmed our stand in favour of Sri Lanka's integrity and unity and have expressed opposition to all forms of violence and separatism. Because of the large number of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and because of the many age-old links between the Tamil populations of the two countries  the repression and denial of human and political rights of the Tamils in Sri Lanka give rise to repercussions in our country with which we are trying to deal as best we can. But it is a travesty of facts to suggest that we are in any way responsible for Sri Lanka's problems. The problem exists right there in Sri Lanka and it has to be resolved there. For our part  we do not and will not permit any activities directed against Sri Lanka from our soil. It is therefore regrettable that leaders of Sri Lanka continue to make baseless allegations against India that it is providing sanctuary and support to Tamil militants. India is doing no such thing. I should like to reiterate that such false and unfounded allegations can only create unnecessary and avoidable difficulties and misunderstanding in the relations between the two countries.211.	The Prime Minister of India has categorically stated that India does not intervene in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka or  indeed  of any other country. India does not support any separatist movement; it does not support or condone resort to violence of any kind. It is our sincere hope that  through consultations  a viable political solution will soon be found assuring the safety and legitimate rights of the Tamils as full and equal citizens  so that the people of Sri Lanka can live together in peace and harmony.212.	I cannot over-emphasize the necessity for the utmost restraint on the part of all concerned and a determined pursuit of the political process to find a viable and acceptable solution in which the fundamental human and civic rights of the Tamil population of Sri Lanka will be safeguarded.213.	The efforts for a political settlement in Afghanistan are continuing  though progress has been slow. While there is universal reaffirmation of the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States  as also of the induction of foreign troops in any country  there is no doubt that the situation in South-West Asia can be resolved only through an overall political settlement based on principles set out in the Political Declaration adopted at the New Delhi Conference.' The efforts of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General in past months have sought to impart momentum to this process and deserve our support.214.	Of equal concern to us are the continuing difficulties that have come in the way of peace in South-East Asia. The events of the past year have made us only more conscious of the opportunities  as well as the pitfalls  that lie in the search for a solution of the problems afflicting that region. India is convinced that there can be no military solution to this question. What is needed is a balanced approach that takes into account the security and other considerations of all the countries in the region and eliminates outside interference. We are hopeful that the new processes of dialogue opening up between the countries of Indo-China and ASEAN will yield positive results in coming months and make for a much-needed sense of trust and reconciliation among the countries of the region.215.	The futility of war as a means of settling disputes has been highlighted in the tragic fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq. The continuing war has involved great sacrifices by both sides  resulting in enormous losses not only of material wealth but also of precious and irreplaceable human lives. The critical situation in the region threatens not only the security of the Gulf but also the safety and economic well-being of much of the world. As Chairman of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries  India has remained in touch with both sides to bring an end to this conflict which weakens the Movement's unity and solidarity. We are heartened that the Secretary- General's call for a halt to bombings in the civilian areas has met with a positive response from both sides. We hope that the two sides will continue to show restraint and see the inevitability of getting down to negotiations for the settlement of their differences. We are convinced that there can be no victor or vanquished in a conflict of this nature. Its continuation will only weaken the ability of the two countries to meet the challenges that face them as developing countries.216.	The events in West Asia continue to arouse our anguish and indignation. The continued denial to the Palestinian people of their basic and inherent right to self-determination and nationhood  Israel's arrogant defiance of the will of the international community  the critical situation in Lebanon  the consolidation by Israel of its stranglehold over the occupied territories  including its settlements policyâall constitute sordid chapters in a seemingly endless tragedy.217.	The turmoil in West Asia remains a most serious threat to world peace today. Recent months have witnessed deterioration in the situation  resulting in further acts of aggression and intimidation by Israel against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. We remain firm in our support for the brave homeless and harassed Palestinian people  led by the Palestinian Liberation Organization  their sole authentic representative. Occupation of the territory of neighbouring States will not guarantee Israel security; it can if anything  only have the opposite effect. A comprehensive solution comprising the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable national and human rights  including the right to establish an independent State in their homeland  and mutual guarantees of security among States of the region must be achieved.218.	We support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices for finding a comprehensive  just and lasting solution in accordance with well-established principles laid down in United Nations resolutions. The situation in the region does not brook any delay  and urgent preparatory measures should be undertaken so that the conference can be convened at the earliest possible time. In this context  India is appreciative of the efforts being made by the Secretary-General towards the convening of the conference and the process of consultations initiated by him with the parties concerned to find a comprehensive solution. We stand ready to extend our full support and co-operation in this connection.219.	It is now a century since Namibia fell prey to colonialism at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. For the larger part of the period and up to the present day  this Territory and this valiant people have suffered a particularly brutal and repressive colonial presence  an extension of the abhorrent system of eighteen years of direct United Nations jurisdiction over Namibia have brought the Territory closer to independence only in theory  as the United Nations plan for Namibian independence remains unimplemented in spite of its universal acceptance as the basis for a peaceful settlement. Sadly  the question of Namibia has become embroiled in the web of East-West tensions  with entirely irrelevant and extraneous considerations being introduced into what is  and must essentially remain  a question of decolonization. The South West Africa People's Organization	the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  has shown admirable restraint  flexibility and statesmanship. South Africa's answer has always been characterized by arrogance  defiance of world opinion  and prevarication. The non-aligned believe that only sanctions can force Pretoria to pay heed.220.	We believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question. India  along with other non-aligned countries  rejects any kind of linkage or parallelism in regard to the implementation of this resolution. The Security Council must consider more resolute action in the exercise of United Nations responsibility over Namibia to ensure the implementation of its own resolutions. Meanwhile  we remain steadfast in our support for the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative  and in our resolve to assist them in all possible ways in their valiant struggle for liberation.221.	We are being increasingly confronted with the proposition that racist South Africa is moving towards reform of its policy of apartheid. Mr. Botha found platforms to proclaim this to the world during his visits to several Western European countries  visits that should never have been permitted to take place and have had the effect of undermining the international campaign to isolate Pretoria. The charade of elections on the basis of a ""new dispensation"" was organized in an attempt to confirm this impression. A country known for its indiscriminate and repeated acts of aggression against neighbouring independent States is projecting itself as a votary of peaceful coexistence. This propaganda  which emanates from Pretoria and finds an echo in capitals of some of South Africa's powerful friends and allies  will deceive no one. South Africa's attempts to hoodwink the world will not succeed.222.	The root cause of all the problems in southern Africa is the policy and practice of apartheid. The international community must not let flag its vigilance against apartheid or its efforts to counter it by every possible means. In this context  we are happy to note the clear-sightedness shown by the Coloured and Asian communities in rejecting  despite pressures of all kinds  the so-called constitutional reforms mooted by the racist regime. As the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  stated in a recent message: cannot be reformed; it must be ended.""223.	The front-line States of southern Africa have long been a bastion of resistance against racist South Africa  though it has meant great suffering and sacrifice on the part of the peoples of those countries. The world must take urgent and resolute action to fortify the front-line States and strengthen the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference so that those States could better withstand Pretoria's repeated acts of aggression and destabilization and its threats and blandishments.224.	The adoption of a resolution on Central America by consensus in the Assembly last year [resolution 38/10] augured well for peace and reconciliation in that troubled region. So also have the untiring endeavours of the Contadora Group of nations. The non-aligned countries have pledged full support to the Contadora exercise. We commend the Contadora countries for their perseverance and dedication and for the progress so far achieved.225.	Nevertheless  the situation in Central America remains tense and delicate  capable of explosion at the next spark. Again this year  Nicaragua felt compelled to take recourse to the Security Council following continuing hostile acts directed against it  in particular the mining of its ports and harbours. We would like to see the endemic problem of the region resolved by its own peoples without meddling from outside quarters. We hope that accord will be achieved before long on a comprehensive agreement along the lines contained in the draft Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.226.	Efforts to resolve the vexed question of Cyprus have received a serious set-back in the last year following the proclamation of a so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and subsequent steps taken with a view to consolidating that unilateral declaration of independence. The Government and people of India have deplored the unilateral declaration of independence and firmly support the unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty  independence and non-alignment of Cyprus  a country with which we have traditionally had friendly and co-operative relations. We believe that the unilateral declaration of independence must be rescinded and intercommunal talks resumed under the auspices of the Secretary- General with a view to arriving at a lasting settlement  taking due account of the rights and aspirations of both the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot communities. In this context  we welcome the steps recently taken by the Secretary-General aimed at a resumption of the intercommunal dialogue as well as the positive response of both sides to the call of the Secretary-General.227.	The international economic situation continues to cause great concern. When we met here in 1983 there were claims that respite from the severest recession in post-war history was in sight. The industrialized countries may be experiencing some recovery  but it remains uneven in its spread and there are doubts about its durability. The vast majority of the developing countries have not experienced any improvement. As a group  their gross national product has remained stagnant and many of them have experienced declining growth rates. Falling commodity prices  adverse terms of trade  rising debt burdens  barriers to trade and declining financial flows continue to affect them adversely.228.	These conditions have resulted in sharp reductions in imports and postponement of investment in projects and human resources development programmes which may have set back their growth prospects for years to come. Austerity measures compelled by circumstances over which they have had little control have precipitated social disruption and political instability in a number of countries. The net effect of these measures has been to attract a transfer of resources from these countries to the financial institutions of the developed countries. The appalling costs in terms of human misery and destitution that these measures have implied are not brought out in the adjustment figures put out by international agencies. These adjustments  as the Committee for Development Planning has put it  have taken place ""at the margin of life and death"".229.	The gravity of the economic situation in Africa is a cause of particular concern to the international community. The critical conditions there have been further aggravated by adverse climatic factors leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition. In the clearest sense  this represents a test of the will and ability of the international community to meet this challenge through international co-operative endeavour and to make it a part of the overall struggle of developing countries against hunger and poverty.230.	It is common wisdom to say today that  in an interdependent world  the progress of the rich cannot be achieved at the cost of the poor. This interdependence was again acknowledged and emphasized at the London Economic Summit of the industrialized countries in June this year.231.	The test of the faith in interdependence lies in the willingness to take co-operative action. As a group  developing countries are larger markets of the European Economic Community  the United States and Japan than each of these three is for the other two. When import volumes have had to be reduced by as much as 50 per cent in many developing countries  its dampening effect on recovery in some industrialized countries should be evident. Sustained economic recovery of the developed countries is dependent on the reactivation of the economic development of the developing countries. But the actual policies pursued by many developed countries seem frequently to reflect a rejection of the concept of interdependence and the policy measures that this would entail.232.	At a time when financial resources for development are needed by developing countries  net private flows of resources to them have in several cases become negative. Official development assistance has declined in real terms  as is evident from the fact that  in the case of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries  aid as a share of their gross national product has fallen from an average of 0.38 per cent to 0.36 per cent in 1983. Multilateral financial institutions are facing the worst crisis of resources since they were created. A case in point is the IDA  which is of paramount importance to the poorest countries. The level at which it has been possible to agree on its seventh replenishment is 20 per cent less m nominal terms and 40 per cent lower in real terms over that of its sixth replenishment.233.	Protectionism is steadily on the increase. The United Nations World Economic Survey 1984 estimates that over half of world trade is now subject to some form of non-tariff barrier. The practical effect of protectionist measures is particularly intense in sectors like textiles  in which developing countries are the most efficient producers. We are thus blamed for our alleged inefficiency and penalized when we are efficient.234.	We cannot but express our disappointment at the attitude demonstrated by some developed countries during meetings of the Economic and Social Council and at the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  in their approach both to substantive issues and to the conduct of negotiations. It is difficult to avoid the impression that this was part of the systematic and persistent efforts by certain countries to make the United Nations system the scapegoat for their lack of political will. We strongly urge the developed countries to reconsider their positions and to work to restore the norms and consensus on the basis of which the United Nations system can continue to play its rightful role as a central forum for joint action for mutual benefit.235.	It is legitimate to expect that now that recovery in developed countries has started  even though in an uneven and limited way  Governments in developed countries will deal in a more comprehensive and co-operative manner with the deeper structural problems of the world economy. It is necessary to adopt and implement a comprehensive set of measures for reactivating growth in developing countries. We must recognize the realities of the situation and work towards the establishment of a real dialogue between the North and the South. Policies which are recognized to stand in the way of the resumption of the development momentum in the developing countries need to be rectified. The ultimate objective of any good policy must be the contribution it can make towards the removal of existing inequalities and in achieving better growth rates for all.236.	Deliberate measures have to be taken now to attain more normal levels of growth. This cannot be achieved merely by the trickle-down effect. The agenda for global economic recovery and development suggested in the Economic Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries"" provides a balanced set of actions. Intensive consultations have taken place on the two-phase approach towards global negotiations put forward by the non-aligned and developing countries  but agreement on its launching has been impossible to obtain. While this matter is being pursued  we propose in the meantime that at this session of the General Assembly serious negotiations take place to provide action-oriented content to the Programme of Immediate Measures contained in the Declaration. Particular attention would have to be given to an improvement in the terms of trade of the developing countries and to a roll-back of protectionism. We have to tackle the crushing debt burden of developing countries in its global context and in a comprehensive manner  dealing with both the financial and the developmental aspects. Agreement needs to be reached for a substantial increase in the net flow of financial resources  particularly official development assistance  to developing countries. The resource position of multilateral development institutions would need to be considerably strengthened to meet the growing needs of developing countries.237.	This session of the General Assembly has several other important tasks ahead of it. In its most fundamental sense  development has to be achieved in human terms. The prevailing imbalance in which 47 per cent of the world's population has only 5 per cent of the world's share of resources has grave implications for the future of humanity. The close link between population policies and economic and social development has been long recognized. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  adopted useful recommendations for the further implementation of the World Population Plan of Action. My delegation attaches great importance to its quick and effective implementation  and we urge the international community to give full support to the national efforts of the countries in attaining its objectives. Similarly  in a related field  we welcome the support extended by the child survival and development strategy of UNICEF to national efforts  including those of my own country.238.	Access and acquisition of modern scientific and technological knowledge is essential to carry out the economic and social transformation of developing countries. Because of our colonial past  many of our countries missed out on the industrial revolution. We have no intention of being left out of the technological revolution. We think that the area of science and technology is particularly suitable to devise new and imaginative mechanisms of international co-operation for mutual benefit. In this respect  we attach great importance to the establishment of the long-term financing system for science and technology for development. My own country is fully prepared to meet its responsibilities in this regard  and we urge all other countries  particularly the developed countries  urgently to finalize the financial arrangements which would enable the launching of the United Nations Financing System for Science and Technology for Development.239.	It is more than a year and a half since the Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries  at their New Delhi Conference  called for the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development. Since then  the idea has gathered further momentum and gained w\der support. It has been pursued in a number of forums both within and outside the United Nations system  such as the Economic and Social Council; the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at its sixth session  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983; the General Assembly; the Conference of the Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at New Delhi in November 1983; and the Williamsburg and London Economic Summit Conferences of the major industrial countries  held in May 1983 and June 1984. Recently  a group of five eminent experts appointed by the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  completed a detailed study of the substantive and procedural issues that would arise in the context of convening such a conference. This report has been made available to the member Governments of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  as well as those of other countries. The need for improvement in the system  whether it be described as evolution or adaptation  reform or restructuring  is now widely recognized. It is now time to set in motion the preparatory process  with the participation of all interested parties  for moving towards serious negotiations on the subject. We sincerely hope that a consensus in this direction will soon evolve. It would be in keeping with the urgency of the situation and the international community's commitment to the multilateral process for these consultations to conclude in a preparatory process to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.240.	India's commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations is firmly grounded in the traditions of our foreign policy. As the Prime Minister of India said at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the non-aligned countries: ""Firm faith in the United Nations is central to the non-aligned"". The observance of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations next year should provide us all with an opportunity for rededication to the ideals that have animated the founders of this Organization.241.	The non-aligned countries will be in the fore-front of preparations for the commemoration of that anniversary. It would be fitting if participation in the commemorative session by Member States was at the highest level  in order to enhance the significance of the occasion.242.	The non-aligned countries also suggested at the New Delhi Conference that 1985 should be observed as the Year of the United Nations. Such an anniversary should not become an occasion for mere celebration. Member countries and their peoples need to consider carefully the contribution of the United Nations system over the past four decades  its continuing relevance in the current international situation  and the ways and means by which the Organization can be strengthened in order to meet more effectively the challenges facing contemporary society. Its procedures and methods of work should be improved in order to enhance its overall performance.243.	Human institutions may and do face temporary set-backs. Rather than give way to despair and allow things to drift  we should make relentless efforts to reinvigorate the United Nations. In this endeavour  the abiding faith in it of the peoples of the world remains its strongest support  and we should do all we can to mobilize it.244.	The year 1985 will also mark the silver .jubilee of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  enshrined in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). That the membership of the United Nations has grown so impressively in recent decades is due in no small measure to the endeavours of the Organization in the field of decolonization. We hope that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration will be appropriately observed. As a country with a deep and abiding commitment to decolonization  India looks forward to participating in that exercise.245.	The year 1985 will also be observed as International Youth Year. Youth  which constitutes a crucial segment of the population  can make a valuable contribution to the development process and to the promotion of international understanding  co-operation and peace. It is therefore imperative that the younger generation be provided with all the necessary conditions for participating in national development activities and in the study and resolution of major national  regional and international problems. The observance in 1985 of International Youth Year is indeed timely  as it will serve to draw attention to the specific needs and aspirations of the future generation.246.	In her address to the General Assembly last year  at its thirty-eighth session  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi referred to a new order struggling to be born amidst the upheavals of the present-day world:""For us  the non-aligned  and for all who are deeply concerned with the future of humanity  the question is whether we help the birth of this new creation or throttle it before it can draw breath. The matter is not simple  because history has proved time and again that ideas and movements can be obstructed  but not stopped. How long can a few pockets of affluence continue to exert influence on the large populations  the natural resources  the cultural strength of the others? How long can allies and supporters  who may not have a base in their own countries and who are not in tune with the changing times  be perpetuated? You cannot kill an idea by killing its adherents. The new-born will not die; the birth can be delayed but the cost will be much higher and the affluent will have to pay. When peaceful change is thwarted  violent upheaval occurs. Previously  the end of a civilization brought destruction and trauma in its trail. If we keep to past trends  we too will be engulfed by circumstances. But today we have the opportunity  which may well be the first in human history  for humankind to bridge the transition from the old to the new in a conscious way  to build a new era  to move together to a new future."""
"67",3239,"IRL",39,1984,"ï»¿104. I have the honour of addressing the General Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its 10 member States.105.	In this capacity  it will give me particular pleasure if you  Sir  will convey to the President my very sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with his considerable experience of the United Nations and his personal skills he will carry out successfully the important and difficult tasks which lie ahead.106.	I should also like to convey the Community's appreciation to the outgoing President for his efficient and skilful conduct of the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.107.	The 10 member States of the European Com-munity also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary- General for his dedicated efforts over the past year m the service of the United Nations and in the cause of peace.108.	Finally  I wish to extend our warmest congratulations to the newest Member of the Organization  Brunei Darussalam.109.	The United Nations is now almost 40 years old. The European Community is younger than that by 10 years. Both organizations were born out of the same experienceâthe agony and destruction of the Second World Warâand both have one essential aim in commonâto prevent the recurrence of war. Surveying the international situation over the past 40 years we can take satisfaction from the fact that the continent of Europe has escaped another large-scale war and that the world has avoided global conflict  which in a nuclear age would have disastrous consequences for the future of mankind. But our satisfaction must be tempered by the realization that  even though global war has been averted  millions have perished in regional conflicts and civil strife  millions more continue to suffer under tyrannical and repressive regimes and  in a wealthy  scientifically advanced and resourceful world  millions of our fellow men are subjected to poverty  malnutrition and disease. Beyond these conflicts are the growth in nuclear and conventional armaments  the lack of success in arms control  and the state of the political relations between the super-Powers. None the less  there are hopeful signs  notably the forthcoming meeting between the President of the United States and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union. In this connection also the Ten were encouraged by the tone and the content of the address to the Assembly yesterday by President Reagan.110.	Despite these encouraging signs  the international community and the Ten must remain concerned at the persistence of negative trends in international life  and for this reason they will persevere in their efforts to halt and reverse them.111.	The principles underlying the Ten's approach to international issues are clear. Indeed  they may be simply stated.112.	First  we are committed to promoting the purposes and upholding the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In recent years the international community has been subjected to a series of crises which has tested the will and capacity of the Organization to keep the peace and deter aggression. Moreover  there has been a deadlock on a number of international and regional issues of fundamental importance. The United Nations has not responded to these challenges as well as it might; and Member States have not sought to use the Organization as they should. For their part  the Ten will continue to promote the United Nations  which  because of its universal character  is a unique forum for the resolution of conflict. We will continue to support also the endeavours of the Secretary-General to increase the relevance of the Organization and to improve its functioning.113.	A second set of principles  linked to the first  derives from our commitment to the rule of law and to dialogue in international relations. The European Community is itself constructed on these principles  and the Ten wish to see them applied more thoroughly and effectively in all areas of international life. In this connection  we believe that a renewal and deepening of political dialogue between East and West is an urgent necessityâurgent and necessary because of the awesome level of military forces; urgent and necessary also to prevent miscalculation or misunderstanding in sensitive areas of the world escalating into an international crisis. We are ready to extend our dialogue and co-operation with all States and regional groups.114.	Thirdly  the Ten recognize and respect the right of all States to security  independence and the determination of their own destiny. These principles  which have informed the work of the United Nations since its foundation  are central to the Ten's approach to international issues. We believe that all States should be permitted to develop their human and natural resources free from external threat  in accordance with their own history and traditions  and without interference in their internal affairs.115.	Fourthly  the Ten believe in the fundamental importance of human rights and in the need for States to respect  in deed as well as in word  internationally agreed human rights standards. I shall have more to say about human rights later in my statement  but at this point I wish to emphasize that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs should notâindeed  cannotâbe invoked by States to ignore or reject international concern at human rights abuses on their territory.116.	Fifthly  the European Community and its 10 member States are committed to promoting the economic and social advancement of all peoples  to working for the elimination of poverty  hunger and disease throughout the world  and to alleviating the plight of displaced persons. We believe that dialogue  co-operation and partnership hold the key to the promotion of more equitable and more even development  which would also contribute significantly to economic progress for all.117.	The principles I have just outlined underpin and give coherence to the work of the Ten on the major issues facing the world today.118.	Nowhere is the need for dialogue and co-operation more evident than in the area of East-West relations. These relations have continued to undergo considerable strain in the past year. The Ten regret this. Earlier this year they declared their determination to maintain and intensify their contribution to the improvement of relations between East and West. They appealed to the Soviet Union to co-operate in progress towards genuine detente on the basis of a balance of forces  of respect for the interests of all States and of the faithful implementation of the Helsinki Final Act' in all its aspects  including effective abstention from the threat or use of force. They recall  in this connection  their position on the continued military build-up by the Soviet Union and on the question of Afghanistan.119.	The Ten have sought to keep open all possible channels of dialogue with a view to contributing to an improvement m East-West relations. Despite the difficulties  the Ten will persist in their efforts to return these relations to a more stable and predict-able basis. They will continue to work for a lessening of mistrust and to seek constructive and comprehensive political dialogue with the Soviet Union and its allies in central and eastern Europe. They will seek wherever possible to build on existing co-operation with each of those countries. But  to bear fruit  the efforts of the Ten to improve East-West relations will need to be reciprocated in the same spirit.120.	As European countries  the Ten attach great weight to the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a forum for contacts and negotiation which gives all participating States  large and small  possibilities for contributing to a dialogue on matters of vital importance to them. That process this year has acquired a new dimension at Stockholm in the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. Full implementation of the Helsinki and Madrid provisions by ail States participating in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe would significantly assist the restoration of confidence in East-West relations. It is disturbing to note  one year after the conclusion of the Madrid meeting of representatives of the participating States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  and with a Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe experts' meeting on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms due to take place in the first part of next year  an increase in the disregard by some participating States for the provisions agreed to at Helsinki and Madrid in these areas  including freedom of religion.121.	It has been a consistent wish of the Ten to return to a more normal relationship with Poland as actual developments there permit. In this regard  the Ten welcomed the Polish Government's amnesty decision of last July. The Ten hope that the Polish authorities  in a spirit of national reconciliation and tolerance  will follow that decision with further measures designed to meet the aspirations of the Polish people for dialogue and reform and that all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document  including those on trade- union freedom  will be implemented by Poland.122.	For the 10 member States of the European Community the achievement of balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament agreements  as well as the full implementation of such agreements  is a matter of the highest importance. We shall continue to work for such results and to lend support to the efforts of others to achieve them.123.	The problems of achieving effective agreements on arms control and disarmament are difficult at any time. The pursuit of such agreements is made all the more difficult in a climate of mistrust and strain in political relations. Nevertheless  there is no alternative to determined and painstaking pursuit  at the negotiating table  of concrete results in the form of substantial  balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament agreements. In the field of disarmament  statements of good intentions are not enough  and declaratory undertakings are a poor substitute for specific  concrete and verifiable measures. When one takes account of the continuing growth in armaments  certain potentially destabilizing technological advances in weaponry and the grave social and economic consequences of the arms race  it is evident that all countries  including the nuclear Powers  should have a strong common interest in the negotiation of effective measures of arms control and disarmament resulting in stability at lower levels of forces. The Ten profoundly regret the suspension of the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on intercontinental strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate nuclear forces. We consider that these vitally important negotiations should resume and be pursued actively with a view to reducing nuclear weapons to the lowest possible level.124.	Measures to curb and reverse the nuclear arms race should be complemented by efforts to maintain and improve the effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime  which has served the international community well since it was instituted in the 1960s. In this context  those members of the Ten which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  will work actively for the successful outcome of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty in 1983.125.	The danger of an arms race in outer space is a matter of deep concern to the membership of the United Nations. Given the pressing need for agreement on steps to avert this danger  the Ten can only regret that bilateral talks between the leading space Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  have not yet taken place. They hope that such talks will commence without delay. In parallel  multilateral consideration by the Conference on Disarmament of questions relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space is also desirable.126.	At the same time  we must take full account of other aspects of the disarmament equation; conventional disarmament and arms control are also necessary if the common desire for peace and stability is to be satisfied. The continent in which we Europeans live contains the highest concentration of conventional weaponry and forces in the world. This is one of the main reasons why the Ten  in conformity with the agreed mandate for the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  which began work at Stockholm last January  are seeking negotiated agreement  in the first stage  on a set of militarily significant and verifiable confidence- and security-building measures. These measures would be designed to diminish the risk of a military confrontation in Europe and would thereby pave the way to a second stage of the Conference  at which the participating States would continue their efforts for security and disarmament in Europe  in particular by controlled reductions of armaments.127.	Those members of the Ten participating in the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe consider that the submission last April of a new proposal which seeks to resolve some of the more basic issues of those negotiations should permit real progress to be made towards agreement on conventional force reductions.128.	The Ten will continue to support realistic and concrete disarmament efforts in the sole multilateral negotiating body  the Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva. We attach particular importance to the successful conclusion of negotiations taking place at the Conference on a convention to prohibit chemical weapons. Member States of the European Community have contributed actively to this work. In this connection  we welcome positive developments which have taken place this year: the United States has submitted a draft convention to outlaw these weapons and the Soviet Union has accepted the principle of on-site inspection of the destruction of stocks of chemical weapons. Although important differences remain to be resolved  the Ten hope that it will be possible to move towards the conclusion at an early date of a convention on the elimination of chemical weapons.129.	The importance of the relationship between disarmament and development has been underlined in the deliberations of the Disarmament Commission this year. The Commission agreed that the world economyâand particularly the economies of developing countriesâwould benefit from appropriate international action that takes into account the close relationship of disarmament and development. The Ten hope that it will prove possible to reach a broad measure of agreement at this session of the Genera! Assembly on how the important question of giving concrete expression to this relationship should be pursued.130.	The Ten have a historic concern for and interest in peace and stability in the Middle East. We have spoken out consistently on the problems of the area and how they might be resolved in a fair and durable way. Individually and collectively  we have contributed to attempts to make and to keep peace in the Middle East.131.	It is appropriate here at the Headquarters of the United Nations to note the Organization's involvement in the area over the years and the experience and expertise that it has developed. The United Nations has a vital role to play in establishing and maintaining peace in the Middle East  and the Ten will continue to encourage and assist in the activities of the United Nations to this end.132.	Conflict and tension continue in three areas in particular: between Israel and the Arab States  in Lebanon  and in the Gulf. Each dispute has brought its own toll of human suffering and destruction. Each also poses wider threats in the region and to international peace and harmony. The international com-munity  notably through the Security Council  has at various times set down guidelines for the solution of these problems in part or in whole. What is needed now is movement by the parties concerned in each case  with the support and assistance of the international community  towards negotiation of peaceful solutions in accordance with the guidelines.133.	With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict  Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) set out fundamental principles for a settlement of that conflict. The Ten believe that  in essence  such a settlement must further take account of both the right to existence and security of all States in the Middle East  including Israel  and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that implies.134.	A negotiated settlement requires the continuing and independent expression of the will of the Palestinian people  and the Ten have repeatedly said that the PLO should be associated with the negotiations. The resolution of the problems between Israel and its neighbours should be based on the principles  widely accepted in the international community  of non-recourse to the use of force and the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. For the Ten  this means that  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  Israel must put an end to the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967.135.	For some time now  because of events on both sides and developments elsewhere  there has been a hiatus in attempts to find a settlement of the Arab- Israeli conflict. The Ten regret this. Each year that passes without a solution makes its achievement more difficult. Attitudes of hostility become more entrenched and the problems arising from the long occupation become more serious. Outside parties  including the Ten  can play a part in facilitating negotiations and can assist and support constructive steps by the sides. A number of proposals have been set forth  and remain on the table  which could be helpful for a comprehensive settlement. But it cannot be escaped that the parties themselves-âIsrael  the Arab States and the Palestiniansâmust sooner or later grasp the  nettle and come to terms with each other's existence and legitimate rights. The Ten urge those involved to take steps in this direction. We believe that a start could be made with the renunciation by all parties of the threat or use of force and with the abandonment by Israel of the policy of establishing settlements in the occupied territories contrary to international law.136.	The Ten regard the progress which has been made towards reconciliation in Lebanon under the Government of Prime Minister Karame as encouraging and worthy of support. But violence nevertheless continues to flare up  and fundamental problems remain to be addressed if the goal of an independent  sovereign country enjoying territorial integrity affirmed so many times by the United Nations  and endorsed by the Ten  is to be achieved.137.	Israel remains in occupation of a considerable part of the country  which is a cause of a great deal of human suffering and economic disruption in Lebanon. In the view of the Ten  Israel should withdraw its troops in accordance with the call of the Security Council. In this connection  we note that in his address to the Knesset the new Prime Minister of Israel said that one of the main objectives of the new Government is an early return of Israeli forces from Lebanon. The Ten believe that other foreign forces on Lebanese soil whose presence is not authorized by the Government should also be withdrawn. The Ten  some of which contribute to observer and peace-keeping operations in Lebanon  reaffirm their willingness to assist that country towards peace and normality. They take this opportunity to express their appreciation of the work of UNIFIL aimed at carrying out its mandate and its efforts to maintain stable conditions and protect the population in its area of operations. They support the renewal in October of UNIFIL's mandate and hope that conditions will be created which will allow the Force fully to carry out its tasks.138.	The Ten are concerned at the continuation of the conflict between Iran and Iraq and the resultant increased tension in the Gulf area. There has been great loss of life on both sides among combatants and the civilian populations. Enormous material damage has been done. Shipping in the Gulf  including traffic to and from States not parties to the conflict  has been subjected to attacks. Of particular concern was the report in March of this year by an expert team dispatched by the Secretary-General which ascertained that chemical weapons had been used in areas inspected in Iran. The Ten condemn without qualification any use of chemical weapons and earnestly hope that they will not be used again in this or any other conflict. We call on both sides to comply with the principles and provisions of humanitarian inter-national law in armed conflicts. We have underlined to Iran and Iraq the importance we attach to freedom of navigation and commerce in international waters  and we recall that the Security Council has more than once addressed this question.139.	More positively  it is noted with satisfaction that the undertaking by Iran and Iraq not to attack purely civilian targets is holding up well. We compliment the Secretary-General on bringing this about and on his work and that of the observer teams in maintaining it. A certain willingness to compromise and thus spare the civilian population further suffering is an encouraging sign. One of the possibilities offered by the United Nations has been utilized. The Ten urge both sides to extend this process  leading to a general cessation of military activities in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and numerous appeals of the international community. Negotiation could then begin aimed at finding a peaceful solution  honourable for both sides. Many intermediaries have offered their good offices in this area. The Ten hope that these efforts and those of the Secretary-General will be continued and intensified  and they are ready to support them.140.	The situation in Cyprus remains an important matter of international concern. The Ten once again express their unconditional support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. In particular  they reiterate their rejection of the declaration of 15 November 1983 purporting to establish an independent State within Cyprus. They deplore the fact that neither this declaration nor the subsequent purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership has been withdrawn  in disregard of Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).141.	The Ten attach particular importance to the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General  and they call on all concerned to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in his current efforts to bring about constructive dialogue aimed at a just and lasting solution to the problems of Cyprus.142.	It is now almost five years since the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan. It remains a source of great concern to the whole world and continues seriously to affect the stability of the region. The Ten remain deeply concerned at the continuing occupation of that traditionally neutral and non-aligned country and at the violation of its independence. Despite repeated calls from the inter-national community to respect the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations  the Soviet Union refuses to heed the appeals to withdraw its troops  which is the key requirement for any satisfactory political solution. The Ten regret that the Soviet Union has shown no willingness to make a positive contribution to a settlement based on successive United Nations resolutions but has instead intensified its military efforts against the resistance forces  which have resulted in many civilian casualties and further suffering and destruction in a country already ravaged by war. The Ten are also deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians and Afghan refugees have been killed in attacks on Pakistani territory from within Afghanistan  and they deplore those violations of Pakistan's border.143.	There can be no military victory in Afghanistan. There can only be a political solution which will ensure the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops  and the restoration of Afghanistan's independence and non-aligned status and the right of the Afghan people to self-determination. In this regard  the plight of the refugees must not be forgotten. The exodus of more than a fifth of the Afghan population  driven from their homeland and forced to seek shelter in neighbouring countries  is a tragedy of immense proportions. Any solution must enable the refugees to return home in safety and honour.144.	The Ten are committed to supporting any initiative which aims at a lasting and principled solution  based on successive United Nations resolutions  to the problem of Afghanistan and recall their proposal of June 1981 in this regard. We continue to follow with interest the efforts of the Secretary- General's representative in his search for a political settlement within the United Nations framework  and we regret that to date those efforts have not met with significant success.145.	The Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea continues to threaten the peace and stability of the South-East Asian region. The reason for the failure over the last five years to make any progress towards a comprehensive political settlement which would bring an end to the suffering of the Kampuchean people lies in Viet Nam's refusal to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The Ten consider that the basis for a just and lasting solution is contained in the Declaration on Kampuchea  adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York from 13 to 17 July 1981.6 That Declaration calls for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops  recognition of the right of the Kampuchean people to choose freely their own destiny  respect for the independence  neutrality and non- alignment of Kampuchea  and a commitment by all States not to interfere in its internal affairs.146.	The Ten are prepared to support any constructive efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of the problem of Kampuchea. This cannot be achieved without the participation and co-operation of all those concerned with the conflict. We believe that a solution can be reached which accommodates the legitimate security concerns of all the States of the region.147.	The unresolved Korean question still constitutes a potential danger for the peace and stability of the region. The Ten reiterate their belief that a peaceful reunification of Korea should be pursued by means of dialogue and negotiations based on the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972 The Ten believe that the Korean people should have their place among the countries represented at the United Nations.148.	The Ten hope that democracy and full respect for human rights will be established throughout Latin America. They welcome the movement towards democracy in South America  which has been especially noteworthy over the past year. This progress has been achieved at a time of great economic difficulties. The Ten particularly welcome the restoration of democracy in Argentina following the elections of October 1983 and the achievement of the Government of President Alfonsin in consolidating democracy in that country. Elections have also taken place elsewhere in South America and these have served to strengthen the democratic process. Our hope is that those remaining countries in South America where democracy has not yet been restored will in the near future follow a similar evolution.149.	The Ten welcome the recent steps towards national reconciliation in Colombia and are following with interest the process of democratization in Uruguay  where elections are scheduled to take place in November of this year. I regret that  on the other hand  the repeated appeals of the international community to the Chilean authorities to take meaningful steps to restore democracy to their country continue to fall on deaf ears. Violent incidents continue. These have their origin in the denial of democratic freedoms to a people which has a long experience of democratic Government. 150.	The Ten continue to be deeply concerned at the situation in Central America  especially in certain countries where murder and other atrocities are perpetrated  particularly on the civilian population  by the armed forces and by irregular armed bands  and where social and economic injustice continues to undermine the political consensus which is a condition of peaceful stability. The Ten have on many occasions expressed their full support for the efforts of the Contadora Group to achieve a peaceful solution to the problems of the region. I wish today to reiterate our support for those efforts  which are based on respect for the independence of sovereign States  the right of States to freedom from outside interference  the inviolability of frontiers  the establishment of democrat b conditions  and the strict observance of human rights.151.	The Ten are convinced that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by armed force but only through a political settlement springing from the region itself. The Contadora initiative offers a clear opportunity for such a settlement  and the Ten urge all those in positions of political responsibility in Central America to work towards a final settlement on the basis of the Contadora proposals. In this connection the Ten consider that the elaboration of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America is a significant and hopeful development.152.	The Ten note recent developments which have brought some degree of hope to the Central American region  such as the statements made after his election by President Duarte of his intention to promote respect for human rights in El Salvador  and the forthcoming elections m Nicaragua  which it is hoped will lead to the establishment and consolidation of a genuine democracy in that country.153.	The Ten look forward to the meeting at San Jose later this week of the Foreign Ministers of the Ten  Portugal and Spain and of the States of Central America and of the Contadora Group. This meeting will mark the commencement of an intensified political and economic dialogue between the Ten and Central America.154.	The Ten are deeply concerned at the many problems confronting the African continent.155.	In South Africa  the black majority continues to suffer the injustices and indignity of apartheid  with no real prospect of change in its political status. South Africa's new Constitution fails to meet the aspirations of black South Africans for equal treatment and the demands of the international community for justice. The black majority is completely excluded from the political process  and only a small number of Coloureds and Indians were prepared to participate in the recent elections. The sense of alienation and frustration of the black population was demonstrated by the violence which surrounded those elections. There is an urgent need for an early move towards the full and equal involvement of all citizens in the political process if further conflict and violence are to be averted. The Ten will continue to press for constitutional arrangements founded on the principle of equality and acceptable to all the citizens of South Africa.156.	During the past year  the South African Government has continued to implement its homelands policy. Families and entire communities have been forcibly removed from the homes which they have owned and developed over many generations. In the process  many South Africans  through their removal to the bantustans  have been rendered exiles in their own land and deprived of the livelihood they once possessed.157.	The Ten have  individually and collectively  expressed their abhorrence of and opposition to South Africa's actions. We reject the homelands policy  as we do all other aspects of apartheid and we shall continue to put pressure on South Africa to abandon the apartheid system.158.	The Ten have noted with satisfaction the agreement between Angola and South Africa reached at Lusaka on 16 February 1984 on the strengthening and monitoring of the military disengagement in southern Angola. They have also noted the Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good-Neighbourliness between Mozambique and South Africa  signed at Nkomati on 16 March 1984. They have commended the efforts of all parties concerned to bring about increased security and stability in the region. They stand ready to welcome other positive moves. However  genuine and lasting peace must be founded on justice and guaranteed by the removal of the fundamental causes of conflict. The recent agreements can have only limited impact if they are not accompanied by early and substantial progress in the elimination of racial discrimination and by independence for Namibia.159.	The Ten hope that the southern African agreements will contribute to a climate of mutual confidence which would facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We regret deeply that our hopes for an early settlement remain unfulfilled and that South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia. The Ten do not accept that the United Nations plan should be delayed or set aside for extraneous reasons or for arrangements inconsistent with resolution 435 (1978). We shall continue to work for the immediate implementation of that resolution because it alone embodies a universally accepted framework for a peaceful transition to independence in a manner which is guaranteed by the United Nations to be free and fair.160.	The European Community and its member States will also continue their aid to the Namibian people  particularly through their support for the United Nations Institute for Namibia. They reaffirm their readiness to assist in the development of a free and independent Namibia.161.	The Ten hope that peaceful solutions can be found to the situation in the Horn of Africa. They believe that such solutions should be based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU].162.	Throughout Africa  the Ten continue to co-operate with Governments  regional organizations and the OAU in their efforts to promote stability and economic and social advancement. The OAU plays an important role in the promotion of peace on the continent  and the Ten support in particular its efforts to find peaceful solutions to the problems of Chad and Western Sahara.163.	The problems caused by the severe drought which has struck large parts of Africa  together with the connected problem of desertification and other factors have contributed to the deterioration of the continent economy and its ability to produce food. The European Community and its members are conscious of the necessity to assist the victims of this calamity  and they will continue to provide substantial emergency and development assistance to alleviate its effects.164.	The Ten endorse the efforts of the international community to alleviate the situation of the 4 million refugees in Africa. Their sufferings evoke our concern  as do the many problems which confront those States which give them shelter. The Ten and the Commission of the European Communities have already stated at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  that they will continue to provide assistance to African economies to help their economic and social structures to cater effectively for refugees and returnees. They will also continue to support and encourage international co-operation to prevent the political conflicts and economic distress which are among the primary causes of refugee flows. The problem of refugees is  of course  a world-wide phenomenon. The Ten expect fruitful results from the work of the Group of Governmental Experts on International Co-operation to Avert New Flows of Refugees.165.	I referred at the outset to the Ten's commitment to human dignity and to the defence of human rights as a principle underlying the Ten's approach to international issues. Many of the political problems I have just described derive from a failure to recognize the dignity and worth of the human person and to uphold the rights and freedoms set out in the Charter of the United Nations  in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in the International Covenants on Human Rights and in other international human rights agreements. Our task as the Ten and the task of the United Nations is to ensure that States adhere to their obligations to promote and protect all categories of human rightsâcivil and political as well as economic  social and cultural. The Ten believe that all these rights form an integral part of a global system for the protection of the individual. They are indivisible and interrelated and must all be defended. The promotion and protection of one category of rights can never excuse a State from promoting and protecting other rights or exempt it from its obligations in this regard.166.	Unfortunately  the obligations entered into by States are too often broken. Numerous reports and surveys testify to the continuation of torture  political imprisonment  disappearances  arbitrary arrests  summary executions and racial and religious discrimination as instruments of State policy. The failure to match our aspirations with achievement weakens the human rights system so carefully and painstakingly developed over the past 40 years and calls into question the seriousness of our commitment. It is difficult to imagine the impact on those who suffer injustice and repression of the feeling that the world is indifferent to their plight and has abandoned them to their fate. For their part  the Ten will continue to speak out against violations of human rights whenever they occur  to work for the protection of the victims  and to promote international agreement on standards and procedures.167.	In this connection  the Ten welcome the progress which has been made on the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.^ We look for-ward to the adoption of the draft convention at this session of the General Assembly. Effective measures to enforce the prohibition on torture are necessary. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment affront the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and undermine the primary aim of international co-operation on human rightsâthe achievement by each human being of a life of freedom and dignity.168.	While the Ten are convinced that international co-operation contains the greatest potential to eradicate abuses of human rights  they are also conscious of the important role played by individuals and groups. It is a matter of grave concern that the most serious abuses are often inflicted on those who actively work to expose violations and remedy injustice. The Ten believe that the international community has a special duty to protect those who risk their life  health and liberty in defence of the rights and freedoms agreed by all.169.	I turn now to the international economic situation.170.	The beginning of this decade saw the worst recession since the 1930s. Recently there has been a recovery which has been strongest in some of the larger industrialized countries and  of course  particularly here in the United States. The effects of this recovery are now beginning to be spread more widely. Last year there was a resumption of growth in world trade  and it has apparently been accelerating further in 1984. However  uncertainty remains concerning the likely evolution of the international economic situation.171.	Nevertheless  considerable progress has been made in reducing rates of inflation in almost all the industrialized countries. Despite the uncertainty I have mentioned  the prospects seem generally favourable. In addition  significant progress has been made recently in adjusting fiscal and external imbalances in many countries  both developed and developing. Many non-oil-producing developing countries have achieved a remarkable adjustment in their balance-of-payments positions.172.	As was noted in the London Economic Declaration  issued at the London Economic Summit held from 7 to 9 June 1984  a continuation of the recovery requires unremitting efforts. We need to spread the benefits of the recovery widely  in the industrialized countries as well as to the developing countries  especially the poorer countries  which stand to gain considerably from a sustained growth in the world economy. Progress has been made in laying foundations for sustained growth  but in the future we shall need to work for greater financial stability  notably in interest rates and exchange rates  and to make further efforts to liberalize trade and to combat protectionism.173.	The very high level of real interest rates is a matter of particular concern. This directly affects economic activity  distorting exchange rates and capital flows and exacerbating problems of indebtedness. To ensure the continuation of a strong and sustained recovery  it is essential that interest rates internationally come down to more acceptable levels. At the same time  it will be essential to ensure adequate transfer of resources to developing countries.174.	In assessing the economic outlook  no one can afford to be complacent. There are sizeable disparities in fiscal policy and growth performance among industrialized countries. There is growing imbalance in the current account positions of some major countries. There is the weakness of growth in many developing countries and the associated decline in their real per capita incomes. There is the still precarious financial position of many heavily indebt-ed countries.175.	The debt problems of developing countries have rightly been the focus of attention at a number of recent international gatherings. These are problems of crucial importance. Progress has been made  but developing country indebtedness is likely to be prominent on the international economic agenda for some time to come  ft is clear that progress towards resolving debt difficulties depends to a large extent on the evolution of interest rates and the rate of expansion of exports of the developing countries  and on the evolution of some other variables. AH countries should work to create the conditions in which the key variables can move in the right directionâ and here we should not overlook the importance of appropriate economic policies in the debtor countries. We recognize  of course  that there is a link between adjustment and development  and the efforts of developing countries to adjust their economies should be supported by the international community.176.	The very high level of unemployment in both developed and developing countries is a major source of concern. This is so particularly in Europe  where we are undergoing a difficult period of structural adjustment. We must currently tackle the lack of employment opportunities for the millions of people who are willing and anxious to obtain employment. In the Community and world-wide  we must devise a consistent strategy which  while resisting inflationary pressures  aims to reduce the massive unemployment problem. Medium-term projections  on the basis of present policies  indicate that w in the European Community can expect no significant reduction in unemployment for some time to come. The costs of sustained unemployment at present levels are enormous  not just in terms of lost output and incomes but also in terms of their detrimental effects on attitudes in our societies.177.	In all these problems we are bound to recognize the increasing degree of interdependence of different countries and areas in the world economy and the consequences of economic policies pursued by individual countries or groups of countries for developments in other parts of the world. At the same time  we should be aware of the interrelation-ships of different policy areas  which all too often in the past had been considered separately. Given the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating  it is important that we retain flexibility in our economic policies and that we be prepared to act to counter any threat to world recovery.178.	In the Community we feel that the problems of development should be tackled in an integrated way and over the longer term. It is against this back-ground and in this spirit that the Community has approached the various issues raised during the year in the framework of the North-South dialogue. Many of the issues considered remain unresolved and are on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. In this connection  the Community recalls its position in favour of global negotiations  which should of course be on a basis acceptable to all.179.	The review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is another issue before the General Assembly. Despite considerable efforts within the framework of UNC-TAD  in the Economic and Social Council and here at United Nations Headquarters  that important exercise is not yet complete. The recent economic recession has held back progress towards the growth and development for which we all hoped and planned in 1980. The review should allow us to take advantage of the improving economic climate and give a new impetus to the implementation of the Strategy for the remainder of the Decade.180.	On behalf of the Community  may I say that we  for our part  firmly hold to our commitments made in the context of the International Development Strategy. In particular  we reaffirm our commitment to maintain and  where possible  increase the levels of official development assistance  especially in favour of the less developed countries.181.	I have already spoken of the concern of the European Community at the terrible problems of Africa  in particular sub-Saharan Africa  where drought and desertification have exacerbated an already difficult situation. I should like to underline that in recent years more than 50 per cent of the total aid received by African countriesâthat is  over $5 billion a yearâcame from the Community and its member States. We heartily welcome the growing determination of African countries themselves to engage in further concrete efforts to come to grips with the various problems besetting their economic and social development.182.	We regret that it was not possible to reach agreement in the Economic and Social Council on a declaration drawing attention to Africa's problems. We have confidence  however  that the General Assembly will successfully conclude the negotiations on the declaration. We believe that such a declaration will be a signal to the world of the international community's concern at the plight of Africa and will encourage action to alleviate that plight.183.	We recall that at the meeting of the World Bank a few days ago the Development Committee expressed strong support for the proposed action programme contained in the Bank's report "" emphasizing that its implementation would require the concerted and sustained efforts of African Governments  bilateral donors and international organizations.184.	At the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  the world community considered the relatively limited progress of industrialization in the developing countries since the Second General Conference in 1975. In the Community's view  faster progress in industrialization world-wide is necessary  and the benefits of industrial growth should be spread more widely among developing countries. We regret that it was not possible to reach agreement on the chapeau or preamble to the report of the Fourth Conference  although we were very near to achieving a consensus. We are pleased that the Conference provided an opportunity for a thorough examination of problems facing developing countries in their efforts to industrialize. It concluded with a consensus agreement on nine resolutions aimed at helping the developing countries to overcome those problems and at defining the role of UNIDO.185.	We in the Community welcome the opportunity to give further consideration to the two resolutions on which agreement was not reached and which have been transmitted to this session of the General Assembly. We hope it will be possible to achieve consensus agreement on them. We believe it appropriate that  on the eve of the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency  the industrialization of developing countries should continue to be in the forefront of our attention here.186.	The effect of demographic patternsâin particular the rapid growth of the world's populationâon development and the utilization of resources continues to be a cause of concern. The second half of the twentieth century stands out in history for its unprecedented population growth. Growth rates are still very high in many developing countries  and  even though the global rates have now begun to decline  the result  combined with the rapid growth of previous decades  will be a doubling of the world population over the course of the next 50 years  which will add to the difficulties of overcoming the obstacles to economic and social development. This will necessitate increased international attention now and in the years to come to the problems of improving the balance of resources between the peoples of the world. The International Conference on Population was held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984 against this background. In reviewing and refining the World Population Plan of Action  the Mexico Conference provided  in its recommendations adopted by consensus  many useful guidelines to Governments in both developed and developing countries.187.	For the Community's own part  and in the context of strengthening our links with the developing countries  our efforts have been largely devoted this year to negotiating a third Lome convention with African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. As in the case of its predecessors  the third convention will cover a whole range of trade and aid provisions for over 60 African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. We take pride that this co-operation convention represents an unprecedented effort to create a new model for relations between North and South  encompassing almost half of the international community  including most of the poorest nations. The negotiations have now entered their final stage and it is envisaged that the new agreement will be signed in December at Lome  the capital of Togo. We do not claim that this convention will provide definitive solutions to all the development problems of the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. It is  however  a contribution  based on a number of fundamental principles  which should enable both the Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries to continue to build the kind of co-operation that will be beneficial to both sides. The objectives of the convention make that clear. We have agreed that we will support and promote the efforts of the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries to achieve self-determined  self-reliant and self- maintained development. Our efforts take account of local needs and local resources. Development must be encouraged from within and not imposed from without.188.	Finally  I should like to refer briefly to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Community and its member States believe that the Convention constitutes a major effort in the codification and progressive development of international law in various fields.189.	The Convention has now been signed by five member States of the Community. Some concern persists with respect to the deep-sea-bed mining regime of the Convention and should be dealt with in such a manner as to make the Convention universally acceptable. In fact  we attach great importance to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. I hope that the Convention will become a useful instrument for the promotion of co-operation and stable relations between all countries in this field.190.	The Ten appreciate the importance of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to which over two thirds of the General Assembly now belong. The Movement exercises a considerable influence on international affairs. We believe that genuine non- alignment can contribute significantly to international-al stability and to the peaceful settlement of the problems which face the international community.191.	These problems  some of which I have touched on in this statement and most of which appear on the agenda of this session of the Assembly  present a distressing catalogue to those who believe that the United Nations could and should play a more important and decisive role in international life. It is therefore entirely appropriate and necessary that the Secretary-General should draw attention again this year  in his report on the work of the Organization to the dangerous breakdown in the multi-lateral approach to international questions. The Ten agree with the Secretary-General's diagnosis of the problem. We also agree with his prescriptions for a solution. We have supported his efforts in the past and we shall continue to help in whatever way we can to restore respect for the Charter of the United Nations and to strengthen confidence in the Organization. 192.	As the United Nations enters its 40th year there is an evident need for a recommitment to a multilateral approach which would draw on the energy  the imagination and the potential for co-operation of the majority of the Assembly. Other approaches have been tried and have failed. The Secretary-General  in his report  has sounded a warning about the risks of continued failure. We ignore that warning at our peril.193.	I should like now  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland  to turn to a problem of supreme importance for all who live in Ireland  whether in the north or the south.194.	During the past year more lives have been lost in Northern Ireland  and the alienation of the nationalist minority there from the system of political authority  security and justice has continued. The urgent need to promote a political solution which will end the violence and alienation remains the most pressing problem confronting my Government. When I addressed the Assembly last year  at the thirty-eighth session I expressed the hope that  following the completion of the work of the New Ireland Forum  its members would be able to present to all the people of Ireland and to the British people a clear and realistic analysis of the Northern Ireland problem  together with imaginative  generous and workable ideas for new arrangements in my country with which all sides could identify. As one of those who worked in the New Ireland Forum over a period of 11 months  I am very honoured to inform the General Assembly that my hope has indeed been realized.195.	The report of the New Ireland Forum was published on 2 May 1984 and has been presented to the Secretary-General. It represents the position of the overwhelming majority of Irish nationalistsâ that is  almost 75 per cent of the entire population of Irelandâregarding the problem of Northern Ireland. Eleven major realities are identified in the report's analysis and 10 requirements are proposed as necessary elements of a framework within which a new Ireland could emerge. The British Government is invited to join in a process that will recognize those realities and give effect to those requirements and thus promote reconciliation between the two major traditions in Ireland. The Forum report suggests three possible models for creating a new Ireland which would be based on these realities and requirements. As a document reflecting the view of Irish nationalists  the preferred solution is naturally that of a unitary State  achieved by agreement and by consent and embracing the whole island of Ireland. However  other solutions along federal-confederal lines or involving a joint authority of the Irish and British Governments in Northern Ireland are also outlined in the report.196.	Further evidence of the realism and openness of the Forum parties is clear from their stated readiness to consider other views which may contribute to the political development that is so urgently required. The four major Irish nationalist parties which reject violence took part in the New Ireland Forum  and the Government of Ireland  formed by two of those parties  has decided that the findings and conclusions of the report are in accordance with its policy. We have brought the report in all its aspects to the attention of the British Government  and we now await its considered response. The report has already been the subject of a useful debate in the British Parliament  and it has stimulated a new interest on the part of many in Britain in working with the Irish Government to create a durable solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.197.	We have been encouraged  too  by the positive international response outside Ireland and Britain to the Forum's report. The Irish Government believes that the interest of those international institutionsâ to which both Ireland and Britain belongâin the problem of Northern Ireland can be of positive support in our search for a solution. The sympathetic interest of the United Nations  as well as the recent adoption by the European Parliament of a report on Northern Ireland  are examples of such helpful and constructive interest.198.	The debate which was inaugurated by the publication of the New Ireland Forum report has already shown that there is much that is now common in the British and Irish perceptions of the Northern Ireland problem. It is encouraging that the British authorities now acknowledge the importance of the Irish Government's concern for the interests of the minority community in Northern Ireland. My Government is concerned for the needs of all the people of Northern Ireland  and in recent months we have welcomed signs that some spokesmen in Northern Ireland  representing the people of the unionist tradition there who value their British heritage  are ready to be more open to their fellow citizens of the other Irish tradition.199. Since I last spoke before this Assembly  the heads of Government of Ireland and Britain have on a number of occasions had the opportunity to review the situation in Northern Ireland. Following a substantive discussion in November of last year they expressed their deep concern about the continuing violence and their joint determination to take all possible means to end it. The two heads of Government  Mr. Fitzgerald and Mrs. Thatcher  will meet again shortly for a summit session on of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council. Should the two Governments jointly determine in the months ahead to meet the requirements of the Northern Ireland problems identified in the New Ireland Forum reportâand it is my conviction that only such an urgent joint approach can succeed in resolving this tragedyâthen we will need the support and understanding of all in the United Nations. A lasting commitment on the part of the Irish and British authorities to a realistic settlement will be difficult for both Governments. I believe  however  that we can  together  as two Member States inspired by the ideals of the United Nations  overcome those difficulties  meet the risks involved and bring peace at last to the suffering people of Northern Ireland."

I wish  Sir  to offer my congratulations on your election as the President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I also wish you success in the administration of the Assembly's work  which contains many important and crucial issues. It also gives me pleasure to witness the admission of an Islamic country  Brunei Darussalam  to the United Nations.220.	The thirty-eighth session of the Assembly was also faced with a variety of important problems  and although there was no lack of honest and sincere attempts to solve those problems  the obstruction and opposition of the imperial-minded Powers of the world prevented the desired achievements from being reached. In spite of this  there is no room for despair; we believe that sincere human action will certainly bear fruit in the long run. After all  our life  if devoid of continuous struggle for the establishment of justice throughout the earth and without tolerance of hardship and sacrifice to attain this sublime objective  would be completely meaningless. I stress the continuity of the struggle in order that those who usurp the rights of nations will not make the mistake of relaxing for a moment. Today  practically all the oppressed and tyrannized people of the world  and particularly their fighting vanguards who have risen to fight back  rarely think of immediate victory as their motivation for action  and this hopeful development is an indication of the rapid growth in the consciousness of the oppressed of all continents.221.	It is hoped that we may in this Assembly turn ourselves into defenders of truth and justice and perform this noble duty patiently through ceaseless efforts. The path before us is quite clear  and we shall  in all cases and vis-a-vis all questions raised in this Assembly  follow the renowned Islamic dictum: ""Always an enemy of the oppressor and always a friend to the oppressed.""222.	Allow me to begin our investigation of the international situation  as usual  with the great human tragedy of contemporary history. The question of Palestine has become an old wound in the body of humanity and particularly in the body of the Islamic Ummah  but in the course of the past year it has become more painful because of the behaviour of certain opportunistic and compromising elements.223.	Verbal protests would be in order if we presumed that the nature and the actions of imperialism and Zionism were separate categories and the latter could be modified and corrected by criticism or well-intended counsel. But we all know for certain that their only logic is the logic of force and their performance is always guided by this satanic logic. Does the experience of the fruitless conduct of talks  negotiations and verbal attacks against Zionism in international forums for many  many long years  which were not matched by action  point to any other conclusion?224.	Thus I would request that in our review of the question of Palestine at the present session of the Assembly we concentrate on the investigation of our own past record  and in this request I am especially addressing the delegations from the Islamic countries and others who  regardless of their political doctrines  have decided to defend truth and justice.225.	Prolonged discussions  successive conferences and even the vociferous forms of objection and criticism offered for the apparent discharge of responsibility and the diversion of attention from the fundamental issue  namely  the necessity of a practical and decisive confrontation with zionism  are empty gestures from which zionism would benefit the most.226.	The experience in Lebanon has already under-lined this lesson most clearly. While the Lebanese people heroically resisted the continuous  savage attacks of the Zionist regime  while Lebanese men  women and children spent their days and nights under the constant downpour of Zionist bombs and bullets  certain Islamic rulers  despite their immense financial  military and human resources  were busy delivering slogans and fiery speeches while in practice they abandoned neither their display of reverence for the aggressors nor their continuous offers of compromise.227.	Had this process continued for a while longer  the Zionist aggressors would have subjugated the Lebanese land completely and permanently; but the aware and dedicated people of Lebanon heroically rose against the occupying forces and their supporters  forced a retreat on the aggressors and added a golden page of epic resistance to contemporary history. For the first time  part of the occupied lands was liberated by force. It will not be long before southern Lebanon will be free from the aggressors' presence.228.	Instead of adding a few more resolutions to the record of the regime occupying Palestine  let us put an end to the presence of its representatives in this world Assembly  a presence which  in itself  should be considered an insult to each and every member of the delegations that value the concepts of freedom and justice.229.	Regrettably  what has helped blot out the hideousness of an Israeli presence in this world Assembly is the policy adopted by the previous ruler in Egypt that climaxed in the signing of the treasonable Camp David accords and brought shame and humiliation to the Islamic nations. The sorry fact that certain third-world countries have recently decided to establish relations with the usurper regime in Palestine should be considered as the most direct consequence of this notorious action by the previous Egyptian administration. I am convinced  however  that the righteous and dedicated Muslim people of Egypt will  at a propitious moment  not only nullify this illegitimate recognition of the usurper regime occupying Palestine but will also undoubtedly declare all the consequences of this recognition void.230.	An investigation of the tragic history of Palestine in the present century shows that the most effective factor in the consolidation of the usurper rule of Zionism in this holy land was the presence of certain dependent and submissive ruling figures in the region. The cause of defeats in the 1948  1956 and 1967 wars did not lie in the Israeli strength; those defeats were due mainly to the treacherous acts committed by certain nominally Islamic Governments. The infamous Camp David accords must be cited as the most scandalous of those acts. The Egyptian regime played the role of a vanguard in that adventure  and several dependent regimes supported it from behind the scenes. These supporters are doing their best today to bring Egypt out of isolation. Do they need to be reminded that the Egyptian regime  as a result of its complicity in the Camp David conspiracy and because of its treason in humiliating the Egyptian people  was dishonourably removed as a disgrace from the landscape of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States? What is happening to the Arab and Islamic world today? Why are they abandoning the cause of Palestine and going back on their commitments to the oppressed Palestinian people? I declare to the whole Islamic Ummah  from this international rostrum today  that in some Islamic countries the superpowers and their local stooges and protÃ©gÃ©s are foolishly playing with the destiny of the Islamic nations.231.	Palestine is still occupied  and holy Al-Quds is not under our control. The illegal Israeli regime destroys and demolishes the houses of Muslims in Al- Khalil  Nablus and Ramallah with bulldozers sent as gifts from the United States  and is busy building kibbutzim in their places. Their Arab residents are exiled; the number of innocent refugees increases daily  and Zionist thugs continue to usurp their lands. Lebanon has been under Zionist occupation for more than two years. Today Palestine  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are looking to Lebanon with hopeful anticipation. All this is happening around us  and we  irresolute as a mesmerized group  are waiting for the outcome of events that are out of our control. I declare here  loud and clear  that the regime in Egypt which hoists the Zionist flag in its capital is the shame of the Islamic world; I declare that the Government in Morocco which plays host to Zionists is a traitor to Islam; I declare that the mercenary regime in Jordan  which has recently re-established relations with the notorious Egyptian regime  is an enemy of Islam.232.	As the revolutionary centre of the Islamic world and as a nation that has historically made the greatest contribution to the elevation of Islamic civilization and the advancement of Islamic causes  the Islamic Republic of Iran declares its extreme detestation of the abominable invitation by the Organization of the Islamic Conference to the Egyptian regime to re-join that organization without demanding that it first dissociate itself from the Camp David accords. It is especially regrettable that the Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee  selected by the Islamic Conference  is a person who persuaded and pushed the previous Egyptian ruler towards signing the ignoble Camp David accords and is at the present time the main instigator of many humiliating measures of compromise with Zionism.233.	We must warn the Islamic Governments that if we do not move quickly  tomorrow will be too late. The Israeli cancer is spreading fast in the body of the Islamic world but our campaign against the Zionist regime does not go beyond talks  slogans and political compromises. The Palestinian people are prepared to start a vigorous  unwavering struggle against Israel and to revive the heroic resistance they showed against the Zionist enemy at Karama. Is it not shameful that thousands of Palestinian combatants in Lebanon  despite sufficient supplies of arms and ammunition  despite their strategic positions and despite their resolute determination  were ordered to stop fighting and to retreat in the face of the Zionist invaders? Is it not an unforgettable disgrace to give in to pressures exerted by the United States  by zionism and by reactionary regimes and to send Palestinian combatants into exile in far-off places in Asia and Africa and then jubilantly raise one's fingers in the sign of victory?234.	What victory? We warn those elements that are busy making deals on Palestine  the holy land of our divine prophets  that the Islamic Ummah will not remain silent any longer and that the Palestinian people will not allow those elements to auction their destiny. The soil of this holy land is mixed with the blood of our ancestors and other Muslims of the world who fought long  bloody wars for their integrity in the history of Islam. We have deeply-felt ties with this holy land and we in our turn will not let political players manipulate the destiny of this sacrosanct centre of the Islamic world. Any Islamic Government that gives in to compromises with the Zionist regime will be responsible before the Islamic Ummah. A vote by any Islamic Government in favour of the Zionist non-entity's remaining in the United Nations will be totally unacceptable. I wish to remind third- world countries that the establishment of relations with the usurper regime in Palestine will only consolidate bases for United States imperialism in their countries and will not be of any benefit in the long run. And  finally  I should warn other nations that giving support to the perverted Israeli regime only strengthens the foundations of racism and destroys human values.235.	As a representative from a third-world country  I must admit here that if imperial-minded Powers succeeded in expanding the range of their aggression in the course of the previous year the blame should to a large extent be put upon the disarray and disunity in the third world.236.	Consider the statistics concerning the arms expenditures imposed on the third-world countries exposed to the ambitious policies of the imperial- minded Powers of the world. Impartial observers will be amazed at the plight of the peoples of these countries while spending on arms sky-rockets. Can those Governments with abundant petrodollars at their disposal feign ignorance of the monstrosities committed by the Zionist regime in southern Lebanon  the imperialist plundering of the African and Muslim countries of the world or the aggressive acts of the occupying forces in Afghanistan? May we inquire about the purpose of these immense arms expenditures  which according to one estimate have reached the annual figure of $100 billion?237.	This enormous capital not only provides research opportunities  military and technological development and the potential for destruction and mass murder by the dominant Powers who act as the main supporters of Israel  but also helps enrich the aggressive machines for future purposes.238.	What factor except the lack of unity and co-ordination among Islamic countries could have given the Soviet Union the opportunity to occupy Afghanistan?239.	The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly declared that the following four principal conditions justifiably requested by the people of Afghanistan can never be realized at negotiating tables without the participation of the true representatives of the people of Afghanistan: the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the foreign occupying troops; non-intervention of other forces in the internal affairs of Afghanistan; the return of Afghan refugees to their land; and future self-determination by the Afghan people. Events of the last year prove the validity of this view.240.	Although the continued occupation of Afghanistan is taking its toll and thousands of Afghan Muslim people have already sacrificed their precious lives in defence of their independence  honour and dignity  their struggle has certainly helped them approach the final solution of their problem and continue their struggle with even more determination. If the United States aggressors had been kicked out of Viet Nam through negotiations and without a prolonged struggle  it would have been reasonable to assume that the Soviet occupying forces would evacuate Afghanistan because of peaceful persuasion.241.	The adventure in Afghanistan is a result of a compromise between the super-Powers over the division of the world. While one invades Palestine and Lebanon the other attacks Afghanistan. When the Soviet Union invaded that Islamic country  the United States used it as an excuse for consolidating its bases in other countries of the region. It is catastrophic for the Islamic world that the Soviet Union does not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan  using the pretext of imaginary United States intervention in that country  and that the United States drives Islamic Governments into submission using the scarecrow of communist threat and domination.242.	In the midst of all this  what are the Islamic Governments doing? Is it not a fact that Afghanistan  a country almost as ancient as the religion of Islam itself  is invaded by the world of atheism? Why are we then wasting time in exchanging platitudes  empty gestures and useless compromises? Unfortunately  at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  we also witnessed a painful compromising attitude towards the vexing question of Afghanistan. A third-world country has been under occupation for some five years  its civilian areas are being bombed and destroyed  hundreds of thousands of its people are being massacred and some 25 per cent of its population has been made homeless and sent into exile. It is unbelievable that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should ignore its fate and bypass the question. This type of treatment of the Afghanistan tragedy amounts to nothing short of sacrificing a whole nation at the altar of world imperialism.243.	It is now the fifth anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq's continued aggression against our people. Considering our experience in previous years  I wonder how useful it would be to describe the dimensions of this monstrosity in this international Assembly. For the last 12 months  we have constantly reported all cases of Iraqi violations and aggressions to the United Nations  and we have previously documented our fundamental objections for the Security Council. We have already given the necessary warning concerning the dimensions of the violations of international conventions and regulations  particularly the use of chemical weapons by the aggressor Iraqi regime.244.	The reports of the United Nations mission to Iran concerning the destruction of civilian and residential areas as well as the reports submitted to the United Nations by the International Red Cross about the situation and treatment of Iranian prisoners of war in Iraq  both civilian and military  have left no reasonable doubts about the true nature of the Iraqi regime. Under such circumstances  it was hoped that such a world institution would  in view of its raison d'etre  mobilize all its potential to stop the continuation of the unprecedented Iraqi violations. But reality took a path contrary to our hopes and expectations.245.	The Security Council persisted  as usual  in being most partial and unprincipled and thereby provided the Iraqi regime with heartening encouragement for its inhuman actions. If there is any reservation in accepting our statement  I would request of you kindly to reconsider Security Council resolution 552 (1984)  and particularly the operative paragraphs  to find out how this so-called Security Council  which is duty-bound to work for the establishment of peace and security in all parts of the world without discrimination and regardless of the interest of the super-Powers in the different regions  has shamelessly undermined the security of the Persian Gulf.246.	The Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran  in a communique published immediately after the appearance of this resolution  announced that it was nothing but a green light to the Iraqi regime to continue creating tension and trouble in the region. The Iraqi attack on a Turkish oil tanker following the announcement of this resolution confirmed the truth of our view. The Security Council should be questioned as to how it intends to discharge its responsibility regarding the continuation of Iraqi attacks on international shipping in the Persian Gulf. As we all know  two months before this resolution was approved  Iraqi aircraft had already attacked ships in international waters belonging to some of the countries which had sponsored the resolution in the Security Council. Could those who approved Security Council resolution 552 (1984) tell us why they did not condemn the Iraqi attacks at the time? 247.	Is attacking ships belonging to non-belligerent countries not a violation of international law? Did the instigation of trouble in the Persian Gulf that was considered as threatening international peace and security as well as the stability of the world economy in the fifth preambular paragraph of resolution 552 (1984) not commit the Security Council to take immediate action for the cessation of those aggressive acts? Did the Security Council not have the obligation to declare its position most clearly regarding those dangerous attacks? Regrettably the negligence on the part of the Security Council in fulfilling its obligations is not confined to the few cases already mentioned. Months before the victims of the Iraqi chemical war were to be sent to European countries for treatment  the Islamic Republic of Iran  on the basis of irrefutable evidence  internationally raised the question of the imminent use of chemical weapons by the criminal Iraqi regime. A case in hand was the published reports about certain loud-mouthed chicken-hearted Iraqi generals who talked of our valiant Islamic soldiers as ""pests"" and proudly advertised the use of ""insecticides"" against Iranian soldiers.248.	Unfortunately  once again  the negligence and lack of appropriate reaction on the part of international bodies  and particularly the meaningful silence of the Security Council  encouraged the Iraqi regime to employ chemical weapons on a large scale without any fear of the consequences of its action. The reaction of the Security Council after several months and under the pressure of world public opinion should become the subject of a serious study. Instead of deciding on a resolution which would contain effective measures to prohibit the reuse of chemical weapons  the Security Council was satisfied to issue a statement which did not have the slightest effect in inducing the Iraqi regime to discontinue its chemical massacres.249.	A study of the performance of the Security Council with regard to resolution 552 (1984)  dealing with security in the Persian Gulf  as well as the very first resolution of the Council concerning the war imposed on Iran  which confined itself to a request to both parties to forgo the use of force  without any reference to Iraq's explicit aggression against Iran and its occupation of large parts of our territory and without requesting the aggressor to withdraw its troops to international borders  and a comparison with Council resolutions 514 (1982) and 522 (1982)âadopted after a two- year-long silence  only when Iranian forces had defeated the aggressive enemy and liberated substantial parts of our Islamic homelandâwhich requested the withdrawal of troops from occupied territories  warrants a new definition of the Security Council.250.	The Security Council is a body that acts on the basis of the joint interest of the super-Powers only following certain events which aim at securing the demands of the super-Powers but eventually threaten international peace and security and  under circumstances when the pressure of world public opinion doesnât allow its continued silence  its actions take the form of resolutions which have very little effect on the restoration of international peace and security. This is a true description of the Security Council and it is terribly depressing because it is clear evidence of the bitter fact that  in spite of all international efforts since the end of the First World War for the establishment of institutions to protect and guarantee the rights and security of nations  the international community is still absolutely defenceless in the face of inhuman violations and aggressions.251. Allow me to provide you with a small list of the aggressive acts of the Iraqi regime in the course of the last four years in order to shed more light on what I have just stated. The Iraqi regime has threatened international peace and security and flagrantly and openly violated the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law in numerous cases  including the following: first  violation of the Charter of the United Nations by resorting to force to settle disputes and invading the Islamic Republic of Iran with the intention of occupying it and overthrowing its regime  and failure to seek arbitration as stipulated in the 1975 Algiers Treaty signed by Iran and Iraq and the unilateral abrogation of this Treaty followed by all-out aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran; secondly  violation of humanitarian principles by destruction of civilian and residential areas in the Islamic Republic of Iran  as stated in the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 June 1983; thirdly  repeated violation of the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949  as stated in that report  and the statements by the International Red Cross regarding the treatment of Iranian prisoners of war by the Iraqi regime and missile attacks against residential areas; fourthly  violation of all international regulations and conventions regarding the environment and endangering marine life in the Persian Gulf; fifthly  violation of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating  Poisonous or Other Gases  and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare  signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 "" as detailed in the report of the specialists appointed by the Secretary-General  dated 26 March 1984; sixthly  violation of international laws concerning commercial shipping by attacking commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf for the purpose of causing tension throughout the Persian Gulf region with the consequence of endangering peace and security and the stability of the world economy in view of the vital role of the Persian Gulf region in this respect.252.	The aforementioned cases  which testify to the continuous Iraqi aggression  prove that the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  for reasons obvious to all  has failed to take the necessary steps to prohibit these aggressive acts. This impotence is mainly due to the lack of adherence by the permanent members of the Security Council to their own resolution because of the unfair right of veto. In paragraph 5 of resolution 514 (1982) of 12 July 1982  paragraph 6 of resolution 522 (1982) of 4 October 1982 and paragraph 6 of resolution 540 (1983) of 31 October 1983  the Security Council requests all Members of the United Nations to refrain from any action which would result in the continuation of war and escalation of tension. Have the permanent members of the Council practised what they preached? Representatives in the Assembly are fully aware that certain permanent members of the Council  having supplied the Iraqi regime with the most sophisticated weapons  have clearly helped prolong the war and increase tension in the region and have flagrantly violated resolutions they themselves approved.253.	The cases of violation and acts of aggression by the Iraqi regime also help us raise another question concerning the Middle East countries in general and the countries of the Persian Gulf region m particular. How could those countries  being familiar with the aggressive record of the Iraqi regime  have the slightest trust in a regime which is fully supported  like its expansionist Zionist counterpart  by the imperial-minded Powers in the political  economic  military and propaganda fields? The Iraqi regime  like the racist Zionist regime  is always ready to go to extremes to achieve its inhuman objectives. Does not the fact that the Iraqi regime has not yet replied to the request by the Secretary-General concerning the prohibition of chemical weapons  despite the sensitivity that the international community has shown so far  indicate undeniably that that regime does not respect international laws in the least and has no respect for its own commitments?254.	The Islamic Republic of Iran need not reiterate its bitter experiences. Those that insist on the declaration of a cease-fire cannot possibly deny the fact that the establishment of a lasting peace without the eradication of aggression has no meaning and is simply an empty gesture. The people in our region  as a result of constant experience of the Iraqi regime  have reached the conclusion that aggressiveness  expansionism and adventurism are not the sort of qualities to be removed by advice; they are  rather  the intrinsic characteristics of the Baathist Iraqi regime.255.	No doubt representatives are already informed about the latest Iraqi adventure in continuing its aggressive policy against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am of course referring to the Iraqi regime's open participation in recent hijackings of Iranian civil aircraft. The Iraqi Government has not only violated the existing conventions and regulations governing civil aviation by complicity in these cases of hijacking  but has also provided the hijackers- known terrorists working for foreign Governmentsâ with all sorts of facilities  granting them political asylum and the opportunity to give press conferences. These incidents prove once again that the Iraqi regime has absolutely no respect for international laws or humanitarian considerations. The Iraqi regime has rejected all requests by relevant international organizations to return the hijacked aircraft or to put the culprits on trial in accordance with international conventions. It recently announced that that aircraft would be used inside Iraq.256.	Such adventures  including the criminal action of the Iraqi regime in shooting down the aeroplane carrying the former Foreign Minister of Algeria  the late Mr. Benyahia  are but a few examples of crimes committed by the regime ruling Iraq.257.	As far as the Iraqi regime is concerned  the Islamic Republic of Iran has exhausted all appeals to reason and logic. On the one hand  favourable response to the Secretary-General's requests to respect all international laws and regulations  and  on the other  the behaviour of the Iraqi regime these international norms have proved beyond a shadow of doubt the identity of the warmonger.258.	It is rather amusing that all mediators and supporters of the Iraqi regime  when discussing the war with us in private or in public  request us to pardon the Iraqi regime for having started this bloody war against us  but that the Foreign Minister of Iraq Stated the other day in this Assembly that it was Iran that had started the war. In my view  he seems to have confused this international gathering with the Baath Party conferences at Baghdad  at which exchange of nonsense is the usual procedure.259.	We believe that  from among international laws and provisions  those that are the result of long years of suffering by humanity and the product of the joint endeavours of all nations must be respected and safeguarded in all circumstances. The violation of those laws and principles is an insult to the whole of human society. Every one of us has the duty and responsibility to do his best to prevent the violation of those principles and laws through joint efforts. Actions speak louder than words. The Islamic Republic of Iran has proved in action that it stands ready to safeguard those principles  and it once again declares that it is prepared to co-operate with every institution or authority which does not aim at supporting colonial interests of aggressive intent.260.	On the question of disarmament  there are many noteworthy points that may be raised with special regard to developments and international agreements in the course of the previous year. However  in our opinion the point that should attract our attention most is the bitter experience we have gained in this respect  which could have serious effects on the process of negotiations and developments concerning the question of disarmament. The use of chemical weapons by the Iraqi regime on an unprecedented scale has shown us that  if compulsory international laws on disarmament are not coupled with the appropriate international means to prevent the violation of these commitments  the mere signing of such agreements would be absolutely useless. Moreover  the continuing violation of those commitments would discourage international interest in such efforts. If the authors of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons could possibly know that some 60 years later the result of their efforts would be ridiculed so openly and shamelessly by an unscrupulous  unrestrained regime such as that of present-day Iraq  they would hardly think their Protocol worth the paper it was written on.261.	Among the achievements of the Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva last year  the relative progress in the preparation of a convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and on their destruction raised some hopes. However  the subsequent use of these weapons by Iraq was most discouraging. When those who use such weapons are not immediately punished but rather  as a result of the negligence of responsible international authorities  are determined to continue with their evil action  what guarantees are there to assure the world community that shortly after the signing of the new convention the producers of chemical weapons will not continue their production?262.	A vivid case of such lack of compliance was clearly shown when  as noted above  the United Nations mission to Iran submitted a report on the use of chemical weapons by Iraq  followed by the condemnation of those horrible crimes by many countries. Nevertheless  the Iraqi regime used those weapons again  with unprecedented shamelessness. All relevant reports have already been submitted to the United Nations. 263.	The use of chemical weapons in some countries  more extensively in Iran than in other places  underlines the urgent need for the international community to commence effective  collective action to prevent the continuation of these crimes. In his speech of 5 July 1984 at the Conference on Disarmament  the Foreign Minister of Switzerland proposed that in order to consolidate the 1925 Geneva Protocol it would be absolutely necessary for all countries of the world to condemn the use of chemical weapons unilaterally and later  in an appropriate international forum  to reaffirm their commitment in a collective manner. I believe that the present time and place are most appropriate for this.264.	With due respect to those who left us the honourable heritage of the Geneva Protocol some 60 years ago  I hope that my proposal will meet with a welcome from delegations. I request the Secretary- General  who has shown appreciable sensitivity and made competent efforts in this respect  personally to undertake the execution of this proposal.265.	As the Assembly knows  a considerable number of reports have already been published about plants manufacturing chemical weapons in Iraq. While expressing my deep concern and regret about this  I request the Secretary-General  on the basis of his international responsibility and certainly on humanitarian grounds  to send a mission of experts from volunteer countries to inspect those plants and to submit their findings to the General Assembly.266.	I have had to deal with the exceptionally important question of chemical weapons in relative detail. As a result  other important subjects concerning the disarmament question  such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the extension of the arms race into outer space by the super-Powers  which seriously threaten the fate of humanity  have been left out.267.	However  despite the shortage of time  the question of the economic consequences of the astronomical arms expenditure cannot be disregarded. The division of the world into East and West  the formation of power blocs and military alignments and  finally  the current insane arms race  which  in addition to the creation of the potential for massive destruction and genocide  requires immense human and natural resources  as well as enormous capital allocations which could be utilized in a rational  humane manner for the economic and social welfare of deprived nations and their development  have led to grave economic imbalances. There is no doubt that only a portion of the annual military budgets of the super-Powers  resulting from militaristic trends on a world scale  would meet many of the basic needs of the deprived peoples and prevent hunger and starvation suffered by millions.268.	Last year's economic crisis was of great concern to all of us. Regrettably  not only has it not been reduced in the course of this year but it has intensified and become further institutionalized. The re- emergence of the ""debt crisis"" much earlier than anticipated might be considered an outstanding manifestation of a global economic crisis. However  it should be noted that the real meaning of the ""debt crisis"" should be sought in the unbearable suffering and deprivation imposed on the peoples of the debtor countries by paralysing socio-economic difficulties and not in the tremors felt by United States banks and the international financial system.269.	The continuing Current economic crisis is rooted in the existing unjust world system and the historical control of a minority over the economic levers and natural resources and  consequently  over a toiling and deprived majority. Furthermore  the deliberate destruction of resources and economic order  which threatens the livelihood of future generations  lies in the hands of the imperialistically minded powers of the world. The very nature of the crisis makes it clear that  contrary to the claims of the oppressors  short-sighted solutions and the application of palliatives cannot solve the existing problems. What better example is there in this respect than the emergence of the reverse ""capital transfer"" phenomenon from the debtor countries to the rich ones?270.	The present unjust world order operates in such a way that the economic prosperity of oppressor countries cannot be achieved except through intense exploitation of the developing countries and the further institutionalization of their underdevelopment. There is no doubt that comprehensive global negotiations could be considered as the first step towards the alleviation of the international economic crisis  but we believe any success in this field depends on the complete eradication of the oppressive domination of the super-Powers over the third-world countries. We further believe that limited and partial solutions and so-called crisis management  avoiding multilateralism for the sake of bilateral financial arrangements  do nothing but intensify and further institutionalize the current crisis.271.	The super-Powers also constantly create tension and engage in aggressive acts which help to intensify the economic crisis. We are certain that the security of international waterways is of paramount importance for the preservation and continuity of international economic activities. Unfortunately  we have witnessed the creation of tension on a very large scale in vitally important international waterways m the course of the last year. The tension began with the mining and blockading of the Nicaraguan waterways; it intensified with the movement of fleets in the Indian Ocean and the shooting at commercial vessels and oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. The United States  having been defeated in Lebanon on several occasions  was searching for new excuses to strengthen its military influence in the region and the excuse it found was a publicity ploy regarding alleged mine laying in the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. The United States pretended that it was too dangerous to navigate in this region  while its obvious objective was to gain new footholds for the execution of its aggressive schemes and the extraction of fresh concessions from the countries of the region.272.	We reaffirm the responsibility of the regional States for the protection and security of navigation in the Red Sea but give warning that this plot was hatched primarily to dominate that waterway and to internationalize the responsibility for its security. Undoubtedly  this alleged act of mining the Red Sea cannot be separated from other lawless actions off the shores of Nicaragua and in the Persian Gulf.273.	For the imperial-minded Powers of the world  it is quite permissible and justifiable to commit any act or hatch any plot that may help satisfy their boundless ambitions  regardless of whether such actions endanger the economic security of others or deprive them of their natural rights. The only thing that matters to those Powers is the continuity of their dominance in different parts of the world. Hence  the United States has had the audacity to violate the basic principles of the Convention on International Civil Aviation  signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944 ' and other conventions concerning navigational rights by its proclamation of 22 January 1984  in which it claimed new zones for international aviation and shipping and special zones in the Persian Gulf for its fleets. Further  by raising the so- called question of mobile sovereignty  the United States has flagrantly violated the obvious natural rights of the States entitled to special privileges and priority in their own coastal waters. It is important to note that the United States commits these violations in such partially closed waterways as the Persian Gulf and inside the exclusive economic zone of adjacent countries.274. With regard to other parts of our troubled world  I deem it necessary to call the following to the attention of this Assembly. First  having turned Diego Garcia into an imperial military base  the United States has become a serious threat to the peace and stability of the Indian Ocean region. We strongly oppose all and every kind of intervention by arrogant Powers in our area and declare the region of the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace. Next  while extending our full support to the oppressed people of Namibia  we demand the immediate withdrawal from Angola of the occupying forces of the racist regime of South Africa.276.	The Islamic Republic of Iran whole-heartedly supports the struggle of the Muslim people of Western Sahara for independence  in line with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations.277.	United States intervention in Latin America and in Caribbean countries is in violation of all International norms. We fully support the struggle of the peoples of Nicaragua and El Salvador and consider the Contadora declaration's to be an appropriate framework for solving the problems of that region.278.	In our view  the division of countries is an imperialist trick  one often played for the purpose of cultural  economic  political and military domination. The Korean peninsula is a victim of such divisive policies. We strongly oppose the division of Korea and demand the withdrawal of those foreign forces which under the pretext of peace-keeping have placed their evil barrier in the way of the unification of the people of that country.279.	It is regrettable that the United Nations has been practically unable to solve any of the aforementioned problems. It seems that the United Nations  too  is a victim of the arrogance of the imperial- minded Powers"
"69",3333,"IRQ",39,1984,"ï»¿At the outset  Sir  I extend to you my sincere congratulations upon your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that your long experience in the United Nations will enable us to achieve positive results during the session. It is even more gratifying that the office of President is assumed by a representative of an African country with which we have such close friendly relations as those maintained between the Presidents of our two countries  President Kenneth Kaunda and President Saddam Hussein. The delegation of my country wishes to assure you of its readiness to extend to you its full co-operation with a view to facilitating your tasks and bringing the work of the present session to a successful conclusion.158.	I also extend our congratulations to Brunei Darussalam  a fellow member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  upon its accession to membership of the United Nations and wish it full success.159.	Every year the representatives of the peoples of the world come to this important international forum to set forth their concerns. The most important matters emphasized by members of the international community are peace and the right of peoples to security  sovereignty and dignity. These principles and norms are at the very root of the United Nations: they form a foundation without which the world would be exposed to dangers  to chaos and to the absence of justice.160.	I must speak at length of the dangers threatening my country and our region  namely  the Iranian aggression against Iraq  which has continued for more than four years. We meet here for the fifth time to discuss this aggression which Iran insists on continuing and which the United Nations and its various organs  as well as other organizations  have been unable to end.161.	Iran bears the full responsibility for kindling the fires of war  just as it bears the full responsibility for continuing it for this long time. The regime that has come to power in Iran has arrogated to itself some bizarre privileges which have no basis in international law or in the rules governing relations among peoples. This regime persists in its aggressive acts and in its desire to impose itself as guardian not only on Iraq but also on the peoples of the region and  indeed  on all the world. It has used every available means to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq and the countries of the region and  indeed  many other countries of the world. It seeks to export its blood-stained and backward system to others  ignoring the fact that that system is the purely internal concern of Iran and that no one in the world has the right to impose himself as guardian of others.162.	In pursuing this unnatural course  the Iranian regime has resorted to all possible means of destruction  sowing anarchy and launching open aggression. Instead of renouncing the expansionist policies and imperial ambitions of the former regime  it has adopted them as its own. It has upheld the privileges of the former regime and has used the military power that it has inherited from that regime to achieve its own expansionist aims.163.	For its part  Iraq has tried by every means at its disposal to convince Iran of the necessity of establishing good-neighbourly relations between the two countries and has avoided confrontation with Iran. The Iranian regime  however  has persisted in its aggressive and expansionist policies and has continued to fan the flames of dissension  conflict and war.164.	From 1979 to the start of the armed conflict on 4 September 1980  the Iranian regime committed 249 violations of Iraqi airspace and 244 acts in which it opened fire on  attacked and shelled Iraqi border towns; it obstructed navigation in the Shatt Al-Arab  and committed three acts of aggression against civil aircraft and seven acts against economic facilities  including oil installations. AH those acts of aggression are documented in official memoranda the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent at the time to the Iranian Embassy at Baghdad and to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Teheran. In a total of 293 official memoranda  we drew the Iranian side's attention to the gravity of such practices and acts and pointed out that the Iranian authorities bore responsibility for their effects on the future of neighbourly relations between our two countries.165.	On 4 September 1980  Iran started actual war against Iraq by opening heavy artillery fire on Iraqi border towns  causing losses in lives and severe damage to property and threatening the sovereignty and security of Iraq. In the following days  Iranian armed forces attacked Iraqi oil installations  and Iranian military aeroplanes launched an air raid against the border town of Mandali. On 12 September  Iranian armed forces opened fire on an Iraqi ship in Shatt Al-Arab and on Iraqi territory in the Basra area and in Khanaqin. On 17 September  the Iranian authorities announced the closure of Iranian airspace to civil aviation and the Straits of Hormuz to Iraqi navigation. Iran also announced general mobilization  deployed its armed forces in massive concentrations along the Iraqi border and openly used its regular military forces in aggression against Iraq. In the period from 18 to 22 September  Iran opened Ore 19 times on Iraqi military boats from Iraqi territory in the areas of Basra  Khanaqin  Qoratu and Mandali  as well as on the Coast Guard Command headquarters at Basra and the control towers of Iraqi ports along Shatt Al-Arab. The Iranian authorities also used their air force to attack the oilfields in Naft Khaneh. Between 4 and 22 September 1980  Iranian military leaders issued statements threatening to occupy Iraq and its capital  destroy the Iraqi armed forces and erase Iraq from the map of the region.166.	Iraq was obliged to defend itself against this flagrant aggression and the blind insistence of the Iranian regime to threaten its security and stability and interfere in its internal affairs.167.	The Iraqi people cannot accept guardianship by anyone and cannot submit to threats and aggression. It had no choice but to fight to defend its sovereignty and dignity and to protect the achievements it had realized by the free exercise of its will and creative endeavours in the political  economic and cultural fields.168.	Iraq has undertaken most faithfully and sincerely to submit the dispute to the United Nations and to other organizations  such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries. On 28 September 1980  Iraq accepted Security Council resolution 479 (1980)  which called for a cease-fire and settlement of the conflict by negotiations. Iraq expressed its full willingness to reach a just agreement that guarantees the rights and sovereignty of both parties and provides for non-interference in their internal affairs.169.	However  the Iranian regime rejected that resolution  as it later rejected all resolutions on the matter  whether adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly or by other international organizations such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other bodies which made concrete efforts towards peace. Iran has set absurd conditions which are contrary to the rules of international law and the norms governing relations among States. Those conditions had no other meaning in reality than insistence on war  on aggression and on expansion.170.	By insisting on taking such a position  the Iranian regime alone bears responsibility for this war  for its continuation and for all the losses suffered by both peoples in human lives and material damage. Similarly  that regime alone bears the responsibility for threatening security and stability in the region.171.	Permit me to remind the Assembly of what happened a year ago. At the thirty-eighth session  in this forum  I addressed  in the name of the Iraqi Government  a call for serious action to ensure security and stability in the Arab Gulf area; for respect of the right of the Gulf States to use their ports and port facilities and of their right to free commerce; and for respect of the right of foreign States trading with the countries of the region. That call by Iraq was welcomed by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council and by many other States concerned with security and stability in our region and in the world. Those views have been embodied in Security Council resolution 540 (1983) of 31 October 1983  which  in particular:the right of free navigation and commerce in international waters  calls on all States to respect this right and also calls upon the belligerents to cease immediately all hostilities in the region of the Gulf  including all sea-lanes  navigable waterways  harbour works  terminals  offshore installations and all ports with direct or indirect access to the sea  and to respect the integrity of the other littoral States;the Secretary-General to consult with the parties concerning ways to sustain and verify the cessation of hostilities  including the possible dispatch of United Nations observers  and to submit a report to the Security Council on the results of these consultations;"".172.	That wise and balanced resolution was welcomed by Iraq  by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council and by all international quarters  but Iran rejected it and scorned the Security Council. When Iraq used its natural right of defence and threatened the vita! interests of a regime which insists on war and on depriving Iraq of its right to utilize its Gulf ports and obstructing free navigation  Iran threatened to use armed force against the interests of two Statesânamely  Saudi Arabia and Kuwaitâwhich were not parties to the dispute by way of an aggressive and extortionist military demonstration which met with universal condemnation in the form of Security Council resolution 552 (1984).173.	As a result  during the past months the Gulf area has known insecurity  uncertain navigation and escalation of the risks of foreign military intervention in the region's affairs.174.	The events of the past year provide a clear illustration of the nature of that regime and its policies which are the cause of all the dangers which the region is now facing.175.	Iraq has abided by the principles of peace and good-neighbourliness  as well as the principles of mutual co-operation and respect for common interests. If it were not for Iraq's resolute stand against the tide of evil  aggression and expansionism brought about by the Teheran regime  the whole area would have been reduced to ruin and the interests of the whole world would have been jeopardized. It is thanks to their courage and heroism that the Iraqis are not only protecting their country but are also safeguarding the security and stability of the area and helping it to continue its fruitful and constructive relations within the region and with the other countries of the world. Therefore  to support Iraq  to co-operate with it in all fields and to assist it in maintaining its firm stand must not be taken as alignment with it against the other side but rather as alignment with the principles of peace and respect for sovereignty and the free will of peoples and also as a contribution to safeguarding security and stability in the area and to protecting it from the dangers of chaos and destruction of which the slogans of the rulers of Teheran and their irrational policies warn.176.	Iraq has proved that its strength is a force for peace  stability and constructive co-operation between the countries of the region: it is a force for justice and international law. By contrast  the force of our adversaries is a force for evil  for chaos and for ruin.177.	Now that this insane war waged by the Khomeini regime against Iraq and the countries of the region is entering its fifth year  it is the duty of the United Nations  together with its Member States  and of the Security Council in particular  to take the necessary practical steps to keep that demented regime within bounds and to force it to accept peace and good-neighbourly relations with Iraq and its other neighbours and desist from its aggressive  destructive and expansionist course.178.	Diplomatic methods have failed to produce the desired results. On the contrary  they have encouraged the rulers in Teheran to persist in their conceit  in their aggressive policies and in their contempt for international organizations and the rules of international law. The irresponsible actions of certain Governments  which have provided Iran with weapons and military equipment in order to realize petty commercial gains  have directly contributed to the continuation of this war with all the losses in lives and property it has entailed. Any call for peace cannot be sincere and serious unless combined with refusal to supply the Iranian regime  which insists on war and expansion  with the military and material means that enable it to continue to pursue those policies.179.	The erroneous policy of being tactful with this anomalous regime and conniving with its crimes and constant violations of the rules governing relations among States has encouraged it  as it has encouraged other similar regimes in the region  to persist in its destructive activities  in exporting terrorism and in defying all the norms of international relations in a manner which has no precedent in modem times.180.	A striking example of this fact is to be found in the joint statements issued by the head of the Iranian regime and the heads of the two other similar regimes in Syria and Libya when the former visited them this month. For the first time in the history of relations among States  a joint statement issued by heads of State provides for agreement on and concerted action towards changing the system of government in another State.181.	I should like to express here  in the name of both the people and leadership of Iraq  our scorn for this abnormal action  which  among other things  rejects the disappointment and frustration bitterly by its authors  and to denounce it as a flagrant - violation of the rules of relations among States and a dangerous precedent which  if not met with the necessary firmness  will certainly lead to chaos and pose a threat to the sovereignty  security and stability of the region.182.	It is high time now that a new approach was adopted in dealing with the Iranian regime. Otherwise  that regime will continue its pernicious policies  whose harmful effects will not be confined to my country aloneâmy country has  indeed  been able to repulse the aggressors  to teach them the lessons they deserve and to crush all their attacks on our territory one after the otherâbut will extend also to all the countries of the region and to the legitimate interests of the international community and the security and stability of the world.183.	Our region suffers most severely from racist and expansionist policies as well as contempt for international organizations and the rules of international law. Such are the policies arrogantly applied by the rulers of Tel Aviv and Teheran. It is no wonder then that the rulers of Tel Aviv should supply their fellow rulers in Teheran with weapons and technical assistance in order to enable them to continue their aggressive war against Iraq and thus threaten the security and stability of the region.184.	The Zionist aggression against the peaceful Iraqi nuclear installations in 1981 was only one more example of the common political objectives of the rulers of Tel Aviv and Teheran. In launching their aggression against Iraq  and consequently against the entire Arab nation  their purpose is to keep both in a state of backwardness and weakness  thus forcing them to submit to those who covet their lands and their natural resources. The Zionist leaders have most impudently threatened to repeat their aggression against Iraq or any other country as they please. The least that the United Nations  and specifically the Security Council  can do is to deter this particular aggressor from repeating such a flagrant aggression. It was the first aggression of its kind committed against a nuclear installation and one which would have had grave nuclear consequences had it not been for the scientific and other precautionary measures we had taken.185.	Certain Western countries try to exonerate and rehabilitate the good name of the aggressor country on the grounds that statements issued by its representatives to the effect that it is not part of its policy to attack nuclear installations devoted to peaceful purposes are tantamount to a withdrawal of its previous threats. Nothing could be farther from the truth. As a matter of fact  those statements were made only to reaffirm the position taken by the Zionist entity in its attempt to justify its criminal aggression  namely  that it has the right to decide unilaterally the nature of nuclear installations in various countries and retains freedom of action with regard to such installations. We give warning that to accept those Zionist statements as an adequate response to the resolutions of the General Assembly and the IAEA will be considered by the Zionist leaders as an acceptance of their own justifications for launching the aggression and will give them a free hand to repeat the aggression as and when they please.186.	The Zionist aggression against our sister country Lebanon was the first step in implementing the Zionist plan to fragment the Arab countries and annex more Arab territory to the State of ""Greater Israel"". That aggression was also directed against the PLO as the legitimate and sole representative of the Palestinian people.187.	While calling for increased support for the PLO and its legitimate leadership  Iraq also condemns all the plots concocted in an attempt to weaken the national Palestinian movement  place it under guardianship or divest it of its power to make independent decisions. In no circumstances can the existence of the Arab people of Palestine be ignored; nor is there a way to ignore its inalienable rights  including its right to return to its homeland and its right to self-determination. Similarly  there is no way to ignore the fact the PLO is the legitimate and sole representative that people. To ignore this fact can only mean in reality total alignment with the Zionist aggressors and the obstruction of the efforts aimed at the restoration of peace and justice in the Middle East. 188.	Although there are clear indications of economic recovery in certain developed countries  the world economy continues to experience an acute crisis. The terms of trade continue to be low and the rates of interest and inflation continue to be high. The difficulties of servicing external debts have increased because of diminishing access to capital markets. The developing countries continue to be severely affected by the current world recession  which has blocked development efforts.189.	It is time for the United Nations to adopt  during the current session  urgent international measures to deal with this disastrous situation in the economies of the developing countries and to restore confidence in the concept of international economic co-operation  which has suffered a severe set-back in recent years because of the failure of the General Assembly to initiate global economic negotiations.190.	As a developing country  Iraq will work with other developing countries to develop positive and realistic solutions that will serve the world economy as a whole. Iraq will also support all initiatives aimed at overcoming the present economic crisis.191. In conclusion  I should like to state that the experience Iraq is undergoing in defending itself  its interests and its rights has served to enhance our faith in the necessity of upholding the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. I assure the Assembly that we are committed to these principles and rules and that we shall work for their application with a view to reaching peaceful solutions to existing problems and ensuring security  peace and stability in the region and in the world."
"70",3380,"ISL",39,1984,"ï»¿I take pleasure  Sir  in joining previous speakers who have warmly congratulated you on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your wisdom and experience will be of great value.182.	Allow me also to take this opportunity to welcome Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations and to extend to this newly independent State my country's sincere wishes for a peaceful future.183.	The General Assembly  at its sessions each year  could be the most important forum in the world. It is a unique gathering where representatives of a great variety of States express and exchange views on a great variety of issues.184.	But how successful are we in making use of this unique forum to advance our basic ideals of peace  prosperity and human rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations? How successful have we been in creating the kind of world our peoples have so long wished for but been denied in this twentieth century of two world wars and almost innumerable armed conflicts? Are we making progress towards our goals or are we drifting away from them?185.	At the end of last year  when the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly had pondered the world situation for three months  your predecessor  Sir  Mr. Illueca  of Panama  summed it up by saying that that session had been: ""the mirror in which mankind has seen reflected the multifaceted aspects of the profound crisis of the modem world"". Nothing very positive seems to have occurred since then. Some might even be tempted to say that we have rather been moving still further in the wrong direction. On this first day of the Assembly's general debate  it seems appropriate to ask the following questions. Where are we heading? What is this session likely to accomplish? Is it going to accomplish anything truly important?186.	In a very noteworthy interview not long ago one of the veterans of this Organization  the former representative of Singapore  Mr. Koh  said: ""Nothing is moving at the United Nations at the moment."" Is this to be the case also in the monthsâor even yearsâto come? Are we going to deal with the great number of important issues on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly by wrapping them into fine words or drowning them in inconsistent or unrealistic resolutions  and then forget all about them until the opening of another equally unsatisfactory session?187.	Are we now  as in last year's sessionâand similarly before thatâgoing to adopt 63 resolutions on disarmament without any real effort to reconcile our differences or to point a way out of the present impasse? Should that be the case  the prospects would really be bleak.188.	In his very interesting appraisal of the current world situation  the Secretary-General mentions the ""tendency to side-step major problems in a way which is likely in the long run to increase frustration and bitterness"" and also ""an apparent reluctance to make the effort required to use international organizations effectively"". 189.	At the outset of the thirty-ninth session the situation in many parts of the world calls for new methods and fresh efforts in an attempt to attain genuine improvement. Action will have to replace words and active negotiations the passing of hollow resolutions. All States  without regard to their size but based on their ability to contribute honestly  should participate in this process. This session of the General Assemblyâwhich will be attended by so many influential political leaders and officialsâwill offer us an opportunity to start moving again. Let us all try to the best of our abilities to contribute to such a serious new effort to eliminate some of the great problems besetting our nations and the world community as a whole.190.	The five Nordic countriesâDenmark  Finland  Iceland  Norway and Swedenâwhich were not always friendly in past centuries have now over a long period derived the benefits of close and effective co-operation in a great number of fields. Living conditions and daily life in this area of the world reflect an evolution which would be beneficial to all who adopt a similar course.191.	The gavel you use  Sir  in presiding over this world Assembly  which was created by an Icelandic sculptor  Asmundur Sveinsson  also reflects the changes that have occurred among the Nordic peoples through the centuries. The gavel's head shows a Viking praying for peace  a theme chosen by the artist.192.	The Nordic peoples  who in olden times raided and fought against other peoples  now wish to live in peace and to share with others a life-style which has its origins in the noble ideals that all of us  the signatories of the Charter of the United Nations  have declared as our goals.193.	The current situation in world affairs and some of the major issues on the agenda of this session were the subject of a traditional meeting of the five Nordic Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Reykjavik earlier this month. A communique giving the Ministers' views on these matters has been distributed to all delegations at the United Nations and to the Secretary-General. The Ministers reaffirmed the strong support of the Nordic countries for the United Nations. They underlined the essential role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace and the need to strengthen the Organization's effectiveness in conflicts and crisis situations. They reiterated that respect for the fundamental principles of international law as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations must be the guideline for the conduct of all States. They also stressed the importance of preserving the universal character of the United Nations.194.	It is self-evident that all nations desire peace. In so far as peoples themselves are free to decide  it should thus be possible to preserve the peace. However  not all peoples are masters of their own fate. Under such circumstances our gravest concern is the relentless arms race and the paradox that military spending this year will reach a trillion dollars while a large part of mankind is starving. It is therefore a matter of the greatest urgency that the leading military Powers multiply their efforts to limit and reduce conventional and nuclear weapons.195.	It is to be hoped that the Soviet Union  having for almost a year been unwilling to continue negotiations on some of the most threatening types of weapons now in existence  will reconsider its attitude. It would indeed be fortunate if contacts during this session of the General Assembly could bring about such a basic change of atmosphere  mitigating the agony that the current state of affairs is causing mankind.196.	Our aim must be a comprehensive solution of the disarmament question  the attainment of which must be dealt with effectively as a matter of the greatest urgency and priority. Partial or regional arms limitation agreements which only lead to the transfer of arsenals to new locations are bound to have limited value and can even create new dangers.197.	As a spokesman for a country like Iceland  which derives its livelihood from the precarious living resources of the sea  I must voice our grave concern at the acceleration of the naval arms race. This aspect of the current military build-up world-wide may become the subject of further debate during next year's session of the General Assembly  when it is hoped that the study on the naval arms race  which was decided upon at the thirty-eighth session will be completed.198.	Any arms control agreement reached must contain adequate provisions for effective verification. Any State which accepts mutual treaty obligations in disarmament or other fields with the intention of fulfilling them does not have to hesitate about committing itself to reciprocal verification procedures.199.	I totally share the view of the Secretary-General that the main obstacle to disarmament and arms limitation is the insecurity of nations. Its origins may be found in the distrust between leading nations that took its current shape soon after the Second World War. Ail attempts to ameliorate this most unfortunate situation have until now been in vain. No durable confidence has been built between the leading Powers of the world. The building of confidence is therefore the single most important task now before the international community. Our attempts to move forward on this narrow and difficult road to a new and more peaceful world situation must be intensified. For that purpose  full use must be made of this unique forum where we are gathered now and its various organs and of the on-going Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. However  the possibility of success depends above all on the behaviour of Statesânot just on words spoken from this rostrum or elsewhere.200.	The building of genuine democracy among the world's nationsâthat is  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to self-determination  the rule of law prevailing over the rule of force  and a more just distribution of economic resourcesâ is the overriding pre-condition from which increased confidence will flow. All this and much more is pledged by all States when signing the Charter of the United Nations joining the Organization  but a different degree of implementation causes imbalance and insecurity.201.	First and foremost  each and all of us must put our own house in order. Since  through bilateral or multilateral treaties freely entered into  we have undertaken mutual obligations  we have no right to expect immunity from criticism if we fail to live up to our commitments. In this context  I must say that it has been most deplorable to see the peoples of many countries suffer from flagrant breaches of human rights obligations. For instance 	and the treatment in a number of countries of individuals who have been claiming basic human rights for themselves and their fellow citizens cause us the gravest concern. A case in point is the sad affair of Andrei Sakharov and his wife  Yelena Bonner.202.	The need to improve the lot of the least developed countries of the world and to strengthen the basis for their economic survival cannot be overemphasised. The developed countries must open up their markets for products from the third world. Development assistance from the industrialized countries will not alone solve the serious difficulties of the developing countries; they must also be granted  infer the benefits of free trade. Similarly  the industrialized countries should  in their overall trade relations  eliminate barriers and other protectionist measures  such as government subsidies  which hamper the normal  efficient division of labour between countries.203.	On this first day of the Assembly's general debate there are on the list of speakers representatives of some of the biggest and some of the smallest States Members of the Organization. This truly reflects the variety of the membership  as well as the fact that all nations  large and small  have a stake in United Nations efforts to build a better world.204.	Through experience mankind has acquired knowledge of forms of democratic government which  however imperfect  guarantee as far as is humanly possible the well-being of the peoples. Nevertheless  totalitarian  undemocratic methods deny such well-being to large populations on many continents.205. We still have a long way to go. Let us not  however  underestimate the progress we have made during the almost four decades since the United Nations came into being. Our inability in past years to reverse the arms race throws a shadow over our hopes for immediate improvements. Nevertheless  let us not lose faith in a still brighter and better future. Let that faith give us strength to renew our pledges and to seek the fullest possible implementation of the noble ideals which are the comer-stone of the United Nations."
"71",3427,"ISR",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure  Mr. President  to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself  as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that  under your leadership and guidance  the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive  positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year  reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow  selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that  despite the disappointments of the past  we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago  the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we  in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition  look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future  buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985  as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people  who still carry so many scars of that terrible war  will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations  as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi  Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger  and they should be dealt with firmly  but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare  present and future  of humanity  with special attention accorded to the underprivileged  the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women  with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations  but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge  the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge  but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry  in the development of infrastructure  transportation  education and health  but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions  mainly children  suffer malnutrition  their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa  for instance  has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and  as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy  their true independence has become endangered.108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact  Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country  the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments  international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home  and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence  in its laws and in the conscience of its people.112.	We are aghast at the fact that  40 years after the eradication of Nazism  rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day  a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts  deprived of their livelihood  harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism  officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy  which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity  nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.115.	In our own part of the world  the Middle East  the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights  the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews  either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities  maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.116.	In Ethiopia  an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage  culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government  which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community  and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.117.	On 13 September 1984  a Government of national unity  encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel  was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic  defence and political domains.118.	In its foreign relations  Israel is dedicated  as always  to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north  we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless  we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east  we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south  of course  we have peace with Egypt  but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised  however  in the context of the realities of the region.120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence  bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border  more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet  as everyone in this Hall knows full well  a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict  the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.121.	In the last two decades  the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism  hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism  we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably  it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism  sanctioned by these Governments  has been thus allowed  through neglect and indifference  to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently  we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut  a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s  its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily  aircraft bombed  passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda  but it is debated ineffectively  shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support  sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities  to appease rather than punish  to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them  to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity  the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place  as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut  a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice  the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather  it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose  pre-empt  weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense  a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.125.	For its part  Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO  which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon  from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents  was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror  we must fight it together. If we do not  terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians  the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression  such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.127.	Sadly  such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty  for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently  an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.129.	Recently  the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals  and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations  which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours  from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peaceâdirect negotiations with Israel.131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon  but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer  brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon  the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.132.	Today  some 40 000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously  Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon  subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.133.	By now it should be clear to everyone  including the Arab States in our area  that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon  the terrorists will not return to attack us.134.	Let me repeat: anyone  any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords  Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan  Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately  Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks  while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.136.	From this rostrum  I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts  rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.137.	Until this call is heeded  Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance  tolerance  understanding and dialogue  which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief  we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.141.	In the vital field of disarmament  we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out  but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons  once they exist  are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war  new non-conventional weapons  such as gas  have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies  against established international conventions and basic decency  cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral  both conventional and non- conventional  will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind  in particular that of the developing countries.142.	In conclusion  our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world  especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant  Utopian future. But  if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstaclesâhunger and terrorismâfrom our path  the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced  our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
"72",3474,"ITA",39,1984,"ï»¿Sir  I should like first of all to extend my warmest congratulations to you on the high office to which you have been called. Your election is testimony to the esteem in which your country  Zambia  is held by the entire world  and to the efficiency and realism of its international commitment.85.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express our warm appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who presided over the deliberations of the thirty-eighth session with skill and competence  and at the same time to express our conviction that under your presidency  whose firmness and efficiency we have already begun to appreciate  the General Assembly will be able to accomplish significant progress on many of the questions on the agenda of this session.86.	It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam upon its admission to the United Nations. Italy views that admission as a new step towards the objective of the Organization's universality. We intend to establish fruitful relations of co-operation with this new Member.87.	The international situation is increasingly in contradiction will the objectives of peace  social justice and human development set out in the Charter of the United Nations. While recognizing this contradiction  we must not become discouraged. Unfortunately  as we all know  the United Nations does not have suitable means of coercion  and we must therefore work to influence the conscience of individuals  in particular those of the young.88.	However  we firmly believe that in their policies all States must show the will to give the Organization a chance to work in defence of peace and respect for human rights. We feel that the common good must take precedence over specific national interests when certain questions are being considered. We all have a primary interest in ensuring that the United Nations is able to act. I will give some examples of this.89.	The question of the mines recklessly scattered in the Red Sea last summer is  in our opinion  a typical problem which the United Nations should and could have tackled because the security of such a vital waterway is of concern to every State. To our great disappointment  this was not the case  and Italy  like some other countries  felt it necessary to respond to the appeal of Egypt and the other States directly affected. It was for that reason  and because Italy is a Mediterranean country  that we decided to help clear that waterway.90.	There is another source of international tension that from time to time becomes acute. It concerns the fact that the norms relating to the extension of territorial waters and the rights of States over those waters and the contiguous zone are far from universally respected. We believe that even in this delicate area the United Nations could work effectively to uphold the law within the framework of existing international provisions and to promote desirable improvements.91.	Finally  another field in which the United Nations could effectively intervene  in addition to the good work it is already doing  is that of the fight against drugsâa scourge that affects all the peoples of the world. It is  above all  our youth and their future that are threatened. We must therefore combine our efforts and use all possible means to ensure the success of such joint action.92.	In his annual report  the Secretary- General has drawn a clear picture of the work of the Organization since September 1983. He stresses  among other things  that: ""The past year has been a time of a great-Power tension accentuated by a lack of progress in disarmament and arms limitation"".93.	I believe that the suspension of negotiations on the control and reduction of nuclear weapons when international relations are going through such a difficult phase causes universal concern. Other disarmament negotiations  such as those on the prohibition of chemical weapons and the prevention of an arms race in space  are almost at a standstill. The halting of the arms race would be in the interest  and would meet the aspirations  of all our peoples. The important statement in this respect made in this Hall by President Reagan on 24 September contained constructive proposals that we hope will find a favourable response.94.	The Italian Government believes that every disarmament agreement has two crucial aims: first  to achieve a balance of forces at the lowest possible level  taking into account the progress made in  and the complexity of  weapons technology; and  secondly  to ensure verification of compliance with the agreements. We believe also that Governments  without renouncing their own prerogatives  could take advantage of scientific advances in carrying out their task. Thus  it would seem to us advisable to encourage high-level contacts between scientists of different nationalities  who could discuss the problems of disarmament and control objectively and make appropriate suggestions. The experience of recent years  especially in the field of nuclear arms reduction  has shown how difficult it is to keep the concept of the balance of forces  which must be based on accurate and objective data  free of historical and psychological prejudice.95.	In my opinion  the General Assembly would be able to play an important role in encouraging agreements on this subject  even outside the framework of the world Organization. However  a prerequisite for that is  first of all  the renunciation of proposals which are not likely to win a consensus. Furthermore  we must recognize that there is a close link  especially for the two major military alliances  between conventional and nuclear disarmament. Today  more than ever  it is unrealistic to hope for genuinely significant reductions in one field without parallel progress in the other. The main thing is to prevent war  whether nuclear or conventional  especially since today it is conventional wars that really threaten international stability and co-operation.96.	The Conference on Disarmament has a direct responsibility for the negotiations on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons  which my Government considers to be of the highest importance. For our part  we requested and have supported the initiative taken by the United States in preparing a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  based on the principal results achieved at Geneva during long years of negotiation. We believe that that document represents a solid basis for continuing efforts. We have also noted with interest the signs that the Soviet Union is ready to accept the principle of inspection to verify the destruction of stockpiles of chemical weapons.97.	Positive results in this field  if they can be achieved  would to some extent be testimony to the ability of the Conference to respond to the worldwide desire to prevent an arms race in space. My Government had sincerely hoped that by the middle of September a dialogue could have begun at Vienna between the United States and the Soviet Union on the repercussions that research programmes in the field of space weapons could have on the strategic balance. Obviously  that dialogue cannot ignore the objective being pursued also in the field of conventional and nuclear weapons. The Vienna meeting could not be held because of the general climate of misunderstanding surrounding the disarmament negotiations  but we trust that more careful reflection will lead in the near future to the beginning of a dialogue which we believe to be both important and necessary. We hope that the high-level political meetings that have taken place in the past few days between the United States and the Soviet Union have provided an opportunity for a constructive clarification of their respective positions on the main problems of our time.98.	Notwithstanding the difficulties that I have indicated  I feel that in the field of security and disarmament there is a promising framework for dialogue in which the neutral and non-aligned European countries are actively participating. I refer to the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. The high political level of the delegations present at the Conference has given rise  since January  to some optimism among the participating States  which also reflects the state of mind of the general public.99.	By ensuring the transparency of military activities in Europe and thereby reducing the ""risks of a surprise attack or of a conflict caused by a misunderstanding  the Stockholm Conference could contribute to the establishment of a climate of understanding and detente in the European continent. The preparation of an instrument which strengthens and gives specific content to the principle of the renunciation of the threat or use of force would provide a suitable basis the adoption of technical and military measures designed to increase confidence among European countries.100.	One of the prerequisites for the successful development of the process started by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is that it should continue harmonious work in all the fields considered in the Helsinki Final Act  including that of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this respect  we cannot conceal our concern at the lack of progress and  even more  at the regressive trends in regard to the solution of these problems. This is all the more unfortunate because  at the beginning of next year  a meeting of experts will be held precisely in order to make progress in those fields.101.	The problems of development and of relations between the industrialized and the developing countries also affect the international balance. This is a challenge we had to face even during the recent recession in our countries. But our task remains just as complex and arduous in present economic conditions. While there have been encouraging signs of recovery in some economic areas  difficulties nevertheless remain  and much work is needed to consolidate the economic recovery and extend its benefits to a broader range of countries.102.	We have never believed that the crucial problem of economic relations between the industrialized countries and the developing countries can be solved by unilateral measures taken in a paternalistic spirit. We should keep this in mind when we tackle the imbalances and disorder caused by the recession. The interdependence of our economies has significance far beyond the strictly economic aspect. It involves a completely new idea of international co-operation  of its spirit and its instruments. Interdependence requires a concept of co-operation based on dialogue  whose participants must be all the members of the international community.103.	The Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  was an important stage in that dialogue. Its results may not have satisfied all the expectations. For our part  however  we take the overall view that they were positive  even though some of the discussions must be continued by the General Assembly at this session. In many respects  the Fourth General Conference did good work  which should facilitate the future task of UNIDO when it becomes a specialized agency.104.	The economic difficulties plaguing the whole world have struck with particular harshness the regions now suffering the scourge of drought and other natural disasters. Entire populations are compelled to struggle for mere survival.105.	Italy  despite its own problems  has increased its bilateral efforts. We are convinced  however  that those efforts should be made in the context of international co-operation. We hope that such cooperation can assist in reviving the North-South dialogue. At the London Economic Summit  held from 7 to 9 June 1984  the Italian Government unequivocally reiterated its support for all initiatives likely to revive this dialogue. Also  we proposed that a world summit conference be held for a comprehensive and basic review of long-term North-South relations.106.	More decisive international action would seem to be necessary to tackle the core of the problemâ that is  the indebtedness of the developing countries.More appropriate trade regulations must also be defined. Italy has already ratified the agreement for the increase in the quotas of the IMF and has agreed to the principle of the cancellation of the debts of the least developed countries  which have particularly serious balance-of-payments problems. For many years  Italy has been emphasizing in UNCTAD the need for the adoption of appropriate machinery to stabilize raw material prices.107.	Among our initiatives  I shall mention only the Italian project for the Sahel  which  because of the techniques chosen and the magnitude of the financing  seems to us to be an effective means to wage the struggle against famine in that vast region. We have also given high priority to problems affecting children. This has enabled us to co-operate even more closely with UNICEF.108.	I turn now to the question of the Middle East. After decades of negotiations and conflict  that region is still plagued by crisis; the Arab-Israeli conflict has not been solved. We cannot but note that during the present year there has been a dangerous stalemate in the situation. The prospects for negotiation opened by the proposals put forward on 1 September 1982 by the President of the United States  as well as by the decisions adopted on 9 September 1982 by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  have faded. Bitterness and frustration have taken over  especially among those who have so far worked the hardest for a political settlement  as a member of the European Community and as a Mediterranean country; Italy is prepared to do everything possible to help to bring about a resumption of negotiations. The parties must not be given any reason to be tempted once again by confrontation  which could only bring more sorrow and ruin to all the peoples of the region.109.	We believe that any lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict must take into account the security requirements of all the States of the region  as well as the requirements of justice  which necessarily entails the creation of a Palestinian homeland. The Palestine question must return very soon to its rightful central position in the Arab-Israeli problem. In this respect  we address an urgent appeal to Israel  for which only peace can open the way to the genuine security to which it is entitled and to great possibilities of co-operation within the region.110.	Even in the present phase of stalemate  some positive elements can be seen. There is a greater trend towards unity in the Arab world. We think that this is a positive sign  because divisions do not lend themselves to any serious political commitment. Egypt has returned to the Organization of the Islamic Conference: that is another positive sign  because the work of that organization will undoubtedly benefit from the contribution of such an important country. Still another positive sign is the policy that Saudi Arabia  a country of such great traditions  is pursuing in favour of Arab unity. Finally  we are following with keen interest the dialogue between Jordan and the PLO. We hope that the Palestinian movement will regain its unity and will advance towards negotiations  for it is only through negotiations that prospects for a successful solution to the important Palestine question can be opened.111.	We view with deep concern the prolongation of the conflict between Iraq and Iran. The military operations of recent months have clearly shown the serious risks entailed  particularly for the Gulf States  in an intensification and expansion of the conflict. But  over and above the harm done to political balances and economic interests  it is the spectacle of the death and useless destruction caused by this conflict for more than four years that so disturbs us. Yet it is possible to do something at the humanitarian level to relieve the suffering of the peoples of the two countries involved in the conflict.112.	We have therefore warmly welcomed the efforts of the Secretary-General to guarantee respect for civilians. The entire international community must join efforts to achieve a reconciliation of the positions of the two parties to the conflict  so that there may be a negotiated settlementâindeed  on this point the two major Powers are not in disagreement.113.	As a Mediterranean country  we have traditionally close ties with Lebanon. In the past  Italy has willingly made specific contributions to the efforts to bring peace to Lebanon and to protect the local populations. The work of the Italian peace contingent has been appreciated by all the parties concerned.114.	We took a positive view  at the time  of the process of national Lebanese conciliation worked out at the Geneva and Lausanne conferences. Those conferences resulted in the establishment of the present Government of National Unity  in which all the Lebanese factions are finally adequately represented. For our part  we are committed to supporting the efforts to ensure the country's reconstruction. Finally  in my opinion  Syria's contribution to the process of conciliation must be recognized.115.	There remain  however  complex problems which have not been solved: not only the domestic problems due to the wounds caused by a decade of civil war  but also the terrorism which lurks with tragic consequences  as proved by the recent attack on the United States Embassy at Beirut  a crime we strongly condemn.116.	But all these problems will remain unsolved as long as part of Lebanon's territory stays under foreign occupation. Hence  we are convinced that a lasting settlement can be worked out only when the Israelis withdraw from southern Lebanon as a first step towards the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese soil. The United Nations  in particular UNIFIL  has an important role to play in this regard.117.	At the invitation of the Italian Government and in conformity with the provisions of the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting of representatives of the participating States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  a seminar on economic  scientific and cultural cooperation in the Mediterranean region will be held at Venice from 16 to 26 October  within a political framework designed to achieve and maintain detente in the Mediterranean region. Apart from the States which signed the Helsinki Final Act  the eight coastal countries of the Mediterranean which are not part of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the five competent organizations of the United Nations system have been invited to the seminar.118.	Italy attaches great importance to the success of the Venice seminar and intends to work actively for the continued development of Mediterranean cooperation.119.	In this same region  unfortunately  another crisis situation remains the problem of Cyprus. The Italian Government wishes to reaffirm its full support and encouragement for the good offices of the Secretary-General aimed at solving the problems of the island  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We address a warm appeal to all the interested parties that they do not fail to make their own specific contribution of goodwill.120.	In the last few days I took part  at San Jose  in an international conference whose goals of promoting peace  co-operation  development and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights in as tormented a region as Central America are certainly in conformity with the ideals of the United Nations. The conference was attended by the 10 member States of the European Community  together with Spain and Portugal  in anticipation of its forthcoming enlargement. I am glad to be able to announce that we reached constructive conclusions in the fields of political support and economic aid  which are the beginning of a closer relationship between Europe and Central America. In the economic field  trilateral initiatives are possible between the countries of the region  the European Community and the United States or other industrialized countries. This important political result was made possible by the invitation of the President of Costa Rica and the ability shown by the five Central American countries to rise above the differences which divide them.121.	A few days earlier  the countries of the Contadora Group which were present at the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at Geneva did good work  resulting in the unanimous adoptionâfrom Nicaragua to the United Statesâof a proposal regarding Central America. The work of the Contadora Group at San Jose was also of vital importance. Italy offers all its support so that the Contadora plan for peace may be realized as soon as possible.122.	The various processes of democratic normalization that have begun in South America  which can be seen in the affirmation of pluralism and freedom  reflect positive changes in a region where authoritarian and military regimes were  until recent times  in the majority.123.	Thus  we have welcomed with particular satisfaction the conclusion of the difficult process of restoration of democracy in Argentina  a great country with which we have deep ties of blood  tradition and culture and which is now playing a new role not only on the continent but also on the international scene. We are following with sympathy and solidarity the difficult progress towards democracy of another Latin American county  Uruguay  to which we are also linked by deep ties.124.	With regard to the dispute which still divides Argentina and Great Britain  whose harsher aspects result from the-deadly conflict unleashed by the military regime  we appeal to the parties once again to resume dialogue as soon as possible  without prejudicial positions  as a first step to future negotiations.125.	In other Latin American countries  however  the development of democracy and respect for human rights are impeded in spite of the profound aspirations of their peoples for a better political system. We express the strongest disapproval of this state of affairs. In this respect  we are thinking particularly of Chile.126.	I come now to the economic problems. The enormous foreign debt of Latin America may hinder these encouraging political developments if the inter-national community and institutions do not make an appropriate response. Also at the request of the countries concerned  we have advocated in the appropriate international forums  in particular at the London Economic Summit that  in agreement with other Western countries  possible solutions to this problem should be studied.127.	Turning to Africa  we note that in addition to the crises  tensions  conflicts  natural disasters and nutritional problems which have become very serious and weigh heavily on the development of that continent  new elements have recently emerged which  although insufficient and limited  open up new prospects in the search for peace and stability.128.	The agreements concluded in southern Africa are positive. They are a step in the direction we have always advocated  namely  towards a political and negotiated settlement of the problems of that part of Africa within a framework of respect for sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. The withdrawal of the South African forces in Angola is not yet complete; other signs could even make one think of the possibility of a regression. We also note with regret the slow progress towards the independence of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That resolution should  on the contrary  be implemented rapidly and unconditionally. The independence of Namibia represents the touchstone for definitely assessing in a positive way the new elements of detente between South Africa and its neighbouring States. Our condemnation of the intolerable system of apartheid and of the policies of forced resettlement remains very firm.129.	The recent agreement to withdraw the French and Libyan troops from Chad opens up prospects for peace in that country  which we hope will be achieved. This agreement will obviously have to be followed by concrete action aimed at national reconciliation. Italy supports the efforts undertaken by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to promote an understanding between the Government and the opposition.130.	We also hope to see negotiations based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of Africa Unity to settle the conflicts in the Horn of Africa  a region with which we are closely linked by historic ties and ever-growing co-operation. Ethiopia and Somalia must rediscover the path of dialogue and co-operation; they must also free themselves from the crushing burden of hostility  in terms of human and economic resources  which impedes development and the struggle against poverty. We hope that the solutions to the problems of that region will be based on respect for the territorial integrity of States within existing frontiers and for non-interference in internal affairs. These solutions should also take account of the historical and cultural identities of the peoples concerned.131.	Italy is following events in Asia with the greatest interest. We are convinced that that immense continent  with its history  culture and wisdom and the capacity for work of its peoples  can make a fundamental contribution to peace  stability and progress in the world. Italy is linked by ties of esteem and friendship with the Asian countriesâ from Japan to the People's Republic of China  to the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The Pacific region may take off economically for the benefit of all the peoples of the world.132.	In this context  we believe that a political solution of the Cambodian crisis  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  could free the Asian continent from a very serious regional problem  thus releasing its energies for economic and social development. Our position is the same with respect to the Afghanistan crisis.133.	The Italian Government is carefully watching events in the Korean peninsula and hopes for the resumption of direct dialogue between the two parties  without external interference. Such a dialogue in favour of peace could promote initiatives likely to help attain the priority objective of the unification of the peninsula. The recent contact between the Red Cross Societies of the two Koreas seems to us to be a positive step. Another step forward might be an understanding between the two parties on their joint participation in the next Olympic Games at Seoul  thus giving back to the Olympics the universal character which was missing in the last two Games. We also believe that the two Koreas should be admitted to the United Nations. This would not compromise  but would on the contrary help  prospects for reunification of the peninsula.134.	Like its nine partners in the European Community  Italy is contributing to the expansion of an economic and political community open to co-operation with all other peoples. Our Community is a factor for peace  equilibrium and progress in international society. Its aims thereforeâas explained by the President of the Council of Ministers of the European Communityâare in harmony with those of the United Nations.135.	The prospect of the admission of Spain and Portugal  which Italy regards as a historical turning- point  and the proposals to build a more advanced institutional structure and lay the foundations of European Union are likely to have a positive influence at the world level.136.	In helping to overcome differences and find ways to resolve the difficulties and instability of the international situation  the European Community believes it can also assist other peoples. Through our efforts to establish close relations between countries on both sides of the Atlantic and within a united Europe  we are convinced we can strengthen the capacity of the West to contribute to the creation of a better future for all mankind.137.	The building of Europe is aimed at consolidating co-operation within our continent and  on a basis of equality  with the States of other regions. Italy is working to give new impetus to the process of European integration  in the conviction that  together  our nations can more effectively offer the contributions of their culture  historical tradition and political experience.138.	The good intentions and efforts of the Europeans will  however  prove insufficient without coordinated action  for which all Members of the United Nations are equally responsible. That is why we offer our full co-operation to this great institution  without which  as the Secretary-General stated in his report on the work of the Organization  ""the world would certainly be a much more dangerous and disorderly place""."
"73",3520,"JAM",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to see you presiding over this  the thirty-ninth  session of the General Assembly with the skill  competence and assiduity we have come to associate with you. The deep pleasure it affords my delegation to see you seated there reminds me that the middle passage did not break the ties that join the peoples of the Caribbean to the peoples of Africa. Time has served to affirm and strengthen the links of ancestry and historical experience between the Caribbean and Africa. The Jamaican delegation is certain that your rich experience will serve us well as you carry out your important task.3.	I take this opportunity to convey our appreciation to Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who deserves our praise for the competent manner in which he carried out his duties as President during the past year.4.	It is also a pleasure to welcome Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations.5.	The Caribbean  like Africa itself  has been much analysed but not well understood. If some of the contributing reasons in the case of Africa have been the sheer vastness of the continent  its long and rich history and the complexity of its indigenous social and cultural traditions  with us in the Caribbean the reasons are very different. We are mostly small islands  and in the main a transplanted people. Despite our size  we have often found ourselves at centre stage in the turbulent unfolding of events  not just during the past few years  but indeed over the past few centuries.6.	We were at one time both the pawns and the prize in the struggle amongst the European Powers for economic and political hegemony in the New World. And still  today  we are close to centre stage. For while islands do not change hands any more  the struggle continues  this time for the political allegiance of the Caribbean. The axis and basis of competition have shifted. The protagonists are no longer to be found in rising European Powers  but in the super-Powers to the East and the West  locked in ideological struggle.7.	Our historical role and importance in the turbulent events of several centuries  events which now continue in different forms  have been out of all proportion to our size. Small and at history's centre stage  we have been continually buffeted by cross-winds and swirling currents. But we have refused to be overwhelmed. The response of our people to the events which have shaped our sub region has been evolving slowly but with certainty  especially over the past two decades or so of our independence.8.	During this period  we  in the English-speaking Caribbean  have seen the ingenuity and vitality of our people at work  weaving a democratic  political culture out of the varied skeins of our past; carrying out with confidence the important process of institution-building in our young societies; moulding economies which  despite their size  limited resource base and manifold problems  are among the more successful in the developing world; and  perhaps above all  cultivating in our sub region a deep appreciation of the civil and political liberties and a just respect or the human rights of all  which include the unfettered right of all citizens to change their Governments by ballot.9.	In summary  during the two decades of our independence we have been defining for ourselves for the first time  as Caribbean people  the Caribbean reality  and determining for ourselves the ethos that infuses that reality. This is a difficult process. There have been and will necessarily be many impediments and disagreementsâsometimes serious ones. But Jamaica believes that the record of the Caribbean countries which came to independence during the past two decades or so  countries which emerged from the longest period of modern  colonial history in either the New World or the Old  is commendable.10.	For small countries such as Jamaica  economic interdependence can be no mere slogan; it is the key to our survival. Let me illustrate. In the three years between 1980 and 1983  bauxite exports  upon which Jamaica depends for 70 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings  fell from 12 million to 7.3 million tonsâa decline of approximately 40 per cent. This dramatic reduction was directly attributable to the international recession  and the contraction of markets in the industrialized world. Debates will continue among academics and politicians as to whether the recession could have been avoided. There will be arguments about whether its depth and severity were caused by the particular mix of policies adopted by industrialized countries  and even whether the recovery which we now discern will be self-sustaining. But one question Jamaica need not debate is the severity of the impact of the recession on our economy  particularly on our major exports  and the consequent adverse impact on indices and targets which relate directly to my Government's determined effort to improve the social and economic welfare of our people.11. Against a background such as this  developing countries such as my own have no choice but to take seriously the mandate of the Charter of the United Nations regarding international co-operation as a means of solving international problems. There is no escape from multilateralism. We are thus disturbed not only by the impasse that has been reached  but by the confusion and obfuscation  some deliberate  that now seem to bedevil discussions of international economic co-operation.12.	It would be quite obvious to any onlooker who descended to this planet that different development strategies in the developing world have met with varying degrees of success. This is hardly an earth- shaking conclusion. It is true of strategies adopted by any group of countries. It is also clear that some countries in the developing world have chosen the strategies which they regard as optimal and the domestic conditions which they regard as most conducive to growth and development. This is their right and  indeed  it is as much the right of the smallest developing country as it is that of the major Powers in the international economy. Against considerable odds  Jamaica has chosen to pursue an outward-looking export-oriented strategy and to do so in consonance with domestic policies sensitive and responsive to the social and economic interests of the Jamaican people. But the choice of development strategy is not and should not be the main issue in matters of international economic co-operation or a weapon used to blunt efforts at institutional and structural reform of the international monetary  trade and payments system.13.	Despite varying growth records amongst developing countries  the evidence over the years indicates clearly that the development process will be greatly assisted by increased flows of aid  capital and technical assistance to the developing countries; by appropriate reforms of the monetary  trade and financial systems; and by buoyancy in the economies of the industrialized world. If we cannot agree on these concerns  which  in the light of the historical evidence  are almost axiomatic  then we fear that it is not only the international economy which is in crisis; equally disturbing  our thinking about the international economy is itself in crisis.14.	This latter concern is not inconsequential. How else can we explain some of the paradoxes which bedevil our approaches to international co-operation and to the functioning of the international economy? To cite just a few: countries which show no growth are blamed for bad policies  and countries which do show growth are met with bad policies in the nature of protectionist barriers of various sorts. This catch- 22 belongs in the sphere of fiction from which it emerged  not in international economic relations. Increased South-South trade is regarded as a key element to offset secular trends in trade between North and South. Yet policies which entail simultaneous constriction of the imports of a large number of developing countries can have no other consequence but the throttling of trade amongst them.Indeed  when in the 1960s the rallying cry of trade  not aid  was heard  very few of us could have envisaged that by the 1980s the implied choice might not exist. High real interest rates and significant differences in these rates amongst the industrialized countries induce trans-Atlantic capital flows among capital-rich industrialized countries  while the same phenomena serve only to add to the flow of resources out of the capital-poor and debt-ridden South.15.	World inflation seems to be a problem when it comes to a new issue of special drawing rights; but the problem all but disappears when the question is budget deficits in the industrialized world or  indeed  massive armaments spending.16.	This catalogue of paradoxes  only a few of which have been cited  does not augur well for the future. Much depends at this juncture on both sidesâNorth and Southâcoming once again to see the problem of development in essentially the same perspective  and agreeing generally on the consequences of failing to address together some of the most pressing problems of international economic co-operation that confront us.17.	In this context  we should be able to agree that there is ample evidence that the situation of the developing countries in general is worsening. The statistical data charting the decline are there to be seen. But  as is often the case  the figures do not fully reveal the facts. The situation which confronts developing countries is even more ominous than the statistical evidence might indicate. The sobering truth is that the industrialized countries have already begun to employ the technologies of the future in areas such as micro-processing and bio-technology while much of Asia  Africa and  indeed  Latin America and the Caribbean is still dependent on the technologies of the past.18.	Differences in technological and scientific sophistication  productive capacity and levels of development are certain to grow  not diminish  in such circumstances.19.	Were this bleak prognosis the inevitable outcome of existing differences among countries  Jamaica might accept them passively  but we are convinced that there are other more desirable and  indeed  attainable solutions. There are at least three key elements of an approach that will lead to mutually beneficial growth based on the synergistic potential of economic activity rather than the exacerbation of existing differences which  in the long run  will only seriously limit the overall potential for growth in the international economy. These elements are: first  a renewed will to co-operate on the part of the developed countries; secondly  a readiness on the part of the developing countries  many of which are already making extraordinary sacrifices  to intensify their efforts to achieve  with external assistance  the levels of living to which they aspire; and  finally  an understanding on the part of all members of the international community that existing economic structures and institutions are neither ends in themselves nor sacrosanct and therefore shielded from even beneficial change. These structures and institutions must be moulded to meet better the goals and objectives which the international community might set from time to time.20.	There is a clear obligation on the part of the international community to ensure that vital institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank function as effectively as possible and that their modalities of operation are always in the interest of those members of the international community that need them mostâthe developing countries. The international recession will indeed be an ill wind that blows nobody good if it does not act as a catalyst for certain measures of reform. One clearly demonstrated shortcoming is the continuing inadequacy of the resources of both institutions  even taking into account the recent increases under the IMF Eighth General Review of Quotas and the selective capital increase in the case of the World Bank. Twenty years or so ago  quotas in the IMF represented about 12 per cent of world trade. At the end of 1983  the figure had declined to about 5 per cent of world trade. At the same time  we find that drawings by IMF members have attained record levels for the second straight year  indeed  with drawings in 1983 being over 69 per cent higher than in 1982. The inadequacy of the resources of the IMF is of concern to my delegation not only because of the upward trend in the demand made on those resources  caused by the recession and the debt and payments difficulties of developing countries  but  equally important  because the rigidity of IMF conditionally and the harshness and sharpness of the adjustment process which countries such as my own have had to endure require for amelioration the lengthening of the time available for adjustment  more flexibility with regard to special circumstances and increased resources to the IMF. One immediate measure which should be taken to ease the liquidity problem of developing countries and to promote the revitalization of our trade is a new issue of special drawing rights by the IMF.21.	In addition to providing for adjustment on a longer-term basis  the role of the IMF itself should be adjusted  so as to place more emphasis on investment and growth. The need for this emphasis is almost self-evident when we consider that  at the end of 1983  43 developing countries had either stand-by or extended arrangements in effect with the IMF  making excessive emphasis on demand management intrinsically self-defeating.22.	Jamaica wishes to emphasize that the international community must ensure that the key role of the World Bank is not eroded now  at a time when private lending has fallen off dramatically and when many developing countries are pursuing painful adjustment. We are disturbed that current projections are for a decline in the net disbursements of the multilateral lending institutions over the next few years. Now may be an opportune time for a general increase in the capital resources of the World Bank so as to enhance its borrowing and lending capacity and  further  to re-examine its gearing ratio with the aim of augmenting the level of resources that will be available to developing countries in the next few critical years.23.	Jamaica fully understands that there are no ready-made solutions to the economic problems that confront the international community  the developing countries in particular. Neither North nor South  no countryâ-no matter how large or how powerfulâ is in possession of a set of prescriptions that can guarantee international prosperity. We fully recognize that entrenched attitudes  varying perceptions  goals and objectives  misplaced trade-offs between short- and long-term benefits and between short- and long-term solutions  can not only hinder the development process in the case of the developing countries but  in the case of the developed ones  create paralysis or lead to action inimical to the interest of the international community as a whole. Nevertheless  a renewed commitment to international economic co-operation is not misplaced idealism  for these are not arguments against  but arguments for international co-operation. It is also a recognition that buoyancy in the international economy  with the promotion of development  is a two-tiered process involving interdependent members of the international community in vigorous and appropriate action at both the national and international levels.24.	Jamaica fully accepts the view that a substantial part of the solution must  indeed  be generated within our own economies in the South. And for our part  we intend to press ahead vigorously with our efforts to restructure the Jamaican economy so as to make it more broad-based  more productive  less protective and more competitiveâelements we view as essential for the achievement of self-sustaining growth.25.	Two world wars in this century forced the international community towards consensus on the need to try to manage rationally political relations among States. We should not await a second collapse of the international economy  as was the case in the 1930s  to recommit ourselves without further ado to a similar consensus in respect of international economic solutions.26.	The United Nations is the foremost expression of our commitment to an enlightened approach to relations among States. For this reason  the stake that countries such as my own have in this institution and our commitment to its principles and ideals cannot be overstated. We view the retreat from those principles and ideals as clear signs of a regression towards more irrationality in international affairs and an increased search for spheres of influence and pursuit of militaristic policies and solutions. Jamaica is profoundly disturbed that these dangerous trends are once again gaining strength and momentum in the international community. They are reflected in the deadlock over arms control and disarmament  in regional conflicts and tensions and in the attacks on the Organization. We know from historical experience that the level of tension in the Caribbean sub region  while not explainable solely in those terms  is directly related to the state of relations between the major power blocs  and particularly between the super-Powers.27.	Our view is that  if we wish to avoid the costly errors of the past  it is incumbent upon Member States to use fully and in good faith the multilateral institutions and arrangements at our disposal.28.	Year after year  from rostrums such as this  appeals have been made on behalf of arms control and disarmament. Year after year they go unheeded. The frantic pursuit of ""parity"" or ""superiority"" or ""balance"" in the name of security goes r n. Perhaps at no time in the past were the prospects for some movement in this area more gloomy.29.	The past year has seen the suspension of bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union  with very little indication of early resumption; and negotiations within the Conference on Disarmament continue to yield meagre results. There is no question that the arms race and the proliferation of weapons require our urgent attention  first  because of our concern for peace and survival in this nuclear age and  secondly  because of our conviction that the massive expenditures now being devoted to the procurement of arms should be diverted towards the economic and social benefit of mankind. It is essential that a start be made  particularly with regard to the control of nuclear weapons. To begin with  we need a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty as an essential first step in the process of nuclear disarmament. Since it now appears that the technical problems of verification can be resolved  there is no reason why any nuclear Power should fail to co-operate in achieving this objective.30.	There is  as well  a clear need to advance the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention which would ban the manufacture  acquisition and use of such weapons. In addition  we cannot ignore the persistent increase in conventional weapons and particularly the expansion of the arms trade to developing countries. There has to be some restraint. It is Jamaica's view that regional initiatives could be usefully pursued to make progress in the restriction of conventional weapons. We recognize that such initiatives would themselves require political accommodation and a framework of regional co-operation would have to be worked out to facilitate the process.31.	On 30 April 1982  when the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted  a new chapter was opened in multilateral co-operation for the management and exploitation of resources which are the common heritage of mankind. The implementation of the arrangements provided for in the Convention  which is now the task of the Preparatory Commission for the International Seabed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  is one of the most important tasks before the international community. The Preparatory Commission held a formal session and an informal session in the past year and we are satisfied that it has made good progress and should continue to be fully supported by Member States. We urge all States which have not yet done so to sign the Convention before the closing date for signature on 9 December this year  thereby becoming full participants in the work of the Preparatory Commission. We also urge signatories which have not yet done so to ratify the Convention as soon as possible. It is our belief that the most effective response to those who would wish to undermine the Convention is early ratification  thus allowing its provisions to come into effective force.32.	It should be clear that there can be no viable or legal arrangements for sea-bed mining outside the Convention. We therefore warn against any attempt to conclude a mini-treaty or other arrangements which purport to confer legal rights for sea-bed mining. The position of the Government of Jamaica is that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is the only legally acceptable international regime applicable to the sea-bed and its resources. We reiterate our opposition to documents based on national legislation and reciprocal agreements that purport to regulate activities in the deep sea-bed. Such agreements are contrary to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and have no legal validity. In this regard  the Jamaican delegation must express its concern at the conclusion of a so-called provisional understanding between eight Member States on 3 August this year. In our view  this goes beyond its avowed purpose of conflict resolution and contains terms which are incompatible with the provisions of the Convention. We urge all States to join together to resist any selective application of the Convention and any attempt to undermine the arrangements being made for the establishment of the International Sea-Bed Authority.33.	Conflicts and turmoil in various regions of the world continue to hamper prospects for peace and should be a matter of great concern for all of us. In Central America  there has not yet been an end to the fighting. We are alarmed at what seem to be insidious attempts to whittle away the hopes of the Contadora process and to undermine the process itself. Jamaica continues to give its fullest support to the ongoing efforts of the countries of the Contadora Group to conclude a regional agreement for peace among the States in the region. They deserve the fullest support of the international community. It is therefore our hope that the revised Act will be signed by all concerned.34.	In the Middle East  Jamaica continues to urge the parties to co-operate in reaching a comprehensive solution involving the implementation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  the withdrawal of Israel from Arab territories occupied since the war of 1967 and the adoption of arrangements whereby all States in the region can live in peace and security within recognized boundaries.35.	In other parts of Asia  there are continued problems caused by intervention and foreign occupation. In Afghanistan and Kampuchea  intensified diplomatic initiatives are needed to restore normalcy and peace. In the Korean peninsula  there is growing recognition that dialogue and accommodation involving the two sides is the only realistic means of achieving peace and the possibility of reunification.36.	The current wave of unrest in South Africa confirms the warnings that have been so often repeated to the South African regime. The system of apartheid is doomed because its fundamental precepts are evil and offensive to human decency. Its practitioners are perpetrating a crime against humanity. It cannot be maintained indefinitely by resorting to violent tactics of repression and intimidation. It cannot be saved by futile and superficial changes in a system that is fundamentally immoral. The Government and the people of Jamaica are unalterably opposed to that wicked system. The so-called new constitutional arrangement introduced by the racist regime is another pernicious attempt at strengthening and reinforcing apartheid. They have fooled no one. The response of the people of South Africa is a clear and unequivocal rejection  as shown by the recent disturbances. The reaction of the South African regime has been the familiar one of indiscriminate shooting  detention and banning orders intended to terrorize the people into submission. It is important for the international community to apply the greatest pressure on South Africa and not collaborate in any way in the current wave of brutality on which the regime has embarked. South Africa should be left in no doubt about international condemnation of its abhorrent policies. We can find no distinction between accommodation and constructive engagement. It should be clear to all that the record of the South African regime is one of deception  hypocrisy and treachery.37.	Look at Namibia. There  we continue to be faced with South Africa's defiance which has for so long prevented progress towards self-determination and independence for the Territory. The international community has a plan which enjoys the support of all countries except one. We say to the Members of the United Nationsâlet us implement that plan  or take the necessary action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  and end the long nightmare of oppression.38.	There is no obligation so exalted  yet so humbling  and none to be taken more seriously than an obligation to posterity. We can choose the path of irresponsibility or we can work diligently through the Organization to bequeath to succeeding generations a world consonant with our vision of a community of nations free from strife  free from repression and free from want. Let us therefore use wisely the power we have now to shape the future so that the hopes of this generation will be realized in the next."
"74",3566,"JOR",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me  Sir  to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. I am certain that your wide experience in international affairs and your commitment to the principles of justice and peace will ensure the success of this session.2.	I also wish to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for the outstanding skill and dedication with which he conducted the work of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session. His wise leadership contributed immensely to the achievement of positive results during that session.3.	The efforts of the Secretary-General  aimed at achieving international peace  also deserve our full appreciation. Despite the difficulties faced by the United Nations and the attempts made to undermine it  he has managed  through his sincere and persistent efforts  to keep alive the hope of collective action.4.	I also wish to welcome Brunei Darussalam on its admission to the United Nations.5.	A brief review of international events and developments since our meeting here last year reveals the extent to which international peace and security have deteriorated. As the old international disputes continue and even intensify  new ones have emerged. Despite the efforts to solve some of these disputes and the attempts to prevent the worsening of others  international relations remain fraught with tension. Danger is still hanging over the world's security and stability. Efforts to minimize the risks of existing conflicts and disputes have not yielded the desired results. On the whole  those efforts have failed to reduce the tension in the international situation; an atmosphere of helplessness and stagnation still hampers attempts to achieve peace on our planet and to prevent a world disaster.6.	I would say in all humbleness that we are moving in a direction opposite to universal peace and security. The repeated appeals and statements about the dangerous international situation  emanating from all parts of the world and demanding action to halt the drift into the unknown have not been heeded. Rather  the escalation of international disputes has been accompanied by a dangerous trend  characterized by a lack of enthusiasm and desire for collective action and a disregard for the principle of collective security. The situation has been aggravated by the persistence of some States in ignoring their commitments to the principles of international law and to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  in particular  those principles and provisions which prohibit the use or the threat of the use of force and provide instead for the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-intervention in internal affairs  maintenance of good-neighbourly relations  and respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States.7. A swift glance at the situation reveals the fact that war and the preparation for it remains the main instrument used by States in their foreign policies. Many States act on the implicit assumption that peace can be achieved only through military superiority and continuous preparations for war.8. Despite the interdependence prevailing in relations between States  we are still looking for solutions to the problems that arise as a result of this very interdependence by using conventional concepts  in particular  the concept of power  which very often leads to unwise political prescriptions. Some believe that the security impasse resulting from the nature of the international system can be solved through armaments  alliances or the division of the world into spheres of influence by attracting supporters to one camp or another. Planning for war and the development of strategies to conduct war have overshadowed our capacity to determine the needs of our peoples for security and prosperity and to respond to their concern about their fate and their yearning for peace.9. The present arms race between the two superpowers and the freezing of efforts aimed at its containment are considered the greatest dangers to international peace and security today. In addition^ the increased rivalry between East and West  the lack of detente  the revival of the cold-war atmosphere and the dangerous polarization prevailing between the two super-Powers have all had negative repercussions on international relations  particularly on various regional disputes. The cold-war atmosphere has resulted in an increase in and intensification of regional disputes  as well as in the faltering of efforts made to tackle them. It has also distorted the perception of the real causes of these disputes and of their origins. The legitimate interests of the aggrieved peoples have been relegated to second place in favour of the requirements of the rivalry between the two super Powers. This rivalry  in turn  has overshadowed the economic  social and political causes of many regional disputes. Many have been led to view world problems only within the context of superpower competition. The super-Powers  in turn  have come to the conclusion that the easiest way to solve their differences is through the acquisition and development of nuclear arsenals. 10.	One of the most dangerous aspects of the intensification of rivalry between the two super-Powers is the paralysis that has afflicted the United Nations  in which we place great hopes for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has affected regional problems as well  especially by preventing a clear perception of their causes. The Security Council  the international organ entrusted with the task of safeguarding international peace and security  has become hostage to the rivalry between the two super-Powers  and its role has been subverted and paralysed  pending the achievement of detente. Consequently  the dangerous situation in which we live has now been made concrete  a situation characterized by the lack of deterrence to dissuade the aggressor and the lack of protection for the victim. As a result  aggression-prone States are now able to act with complete impunity. This has led to a loss of confidence on the part of peace-loving States in the efficacy of the United Nations  and those States have  in tum  been forced to seek protection through the formation of regional or international alliances and blocs.11.	We are required to choose between the use of force  on the one hand  and negotiation and compromise  on the other  as the way to achieve our legitimate goals. The future of humanity as a whole depends on which path we choose. Moreover  a prerequisite for the achievement of international stability is the renewal of mutual confidence and the elimination of fear and doubt. No State or bloc car be permitted to seek to lead the world and unlawfully influence the international system. This requires us to abide by the principles of the Charter  to respect its provisions and to support the United Nations as the practical framework of our commitment to the principle of collective action. We must curb the tendency to place narrow national interests above the higher interest of preserving the stability and advancement of the international system. Strict observance of the principles of the Charter and dedication to the United Nations through the acceptance and implementation of its decisions are the true measure of peaceful intentions and belief in constructive action. To ignore the role of the Organization and to refuse to comply with its decisions is a defiance of the international will and a violation of international law. Those who persist in doing so bear a political and moral responsibility for the existing state of despair and confusion in the world. We have among us a Member State which has set a record for disregarding the international will and the judgement of the majority.12.	Our concern over the aggravation of the international situation stems  basically  from the situation prevailing in our regionâthe Middle East. In fact  this region  comprising States from two continents with peoples of different cultures and schools of thought  has been plagued with a chronic and explosive dispute: the Arab-Israeli conflict. I should like once again to discuss the root causes of this conflict and the reasons why it has remained obstinately insoluble to this day  after yet another year full of numerous important developments. The events of the past year  as far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned  have reconfirmed three basic facts.13.	First  the Arab States and the Palestinian people have expressed  on more than one occasion  their desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on an international consensus which guarantees the legitimate rights of all parties.14.	Secondly  it has become clear that Israel not only rejects peace  but actively resists its achievement.15.	Thirdly  the super-Powers bear a basic responsibility for the achievement of a just and comprehensive political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The position of some of those Powers is responsible for Israel's continued aggression against the Arab nation and its persistence in rejecting all peace initiatives put forward to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian problem.16.	Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which was adopted unanimously and was reaffirmed in resolution 338 (1973)  embodies the basis for a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  namely  territory in exchange for peace. That resolution satisfies what Israel demands or pretends to demand: its right to live within internationally recognized boundaries. It also satisfies legitimate Arab demands: withdrawal from the Arab territories that Israel has occupied since 1967. Since the adoption of that resolution  the Arabs have shown on more than one occasion their acceptance of the conditions for peace  while Israel has rejected the Arab demandâthat it withdraw from the Arab territories occupied since 1967. Israel claims that the Arabs neither want peace nor accept its conditions  while the Arabs have declared repeatedly their willingness to accept peace and its conditions provided that Israel does the same.17.	Let us see now what was the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  a resolution which Jordan accepted and for the implementation of which it has worked diligently. What was the basis of the declaration of the European Community  issued at Venice in 1980; of King Fahd's initiative of 1981; of President Reagan's initiative of 1982; of the resolutions of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez the same year; of the Geneva Declaration on Palestine adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine in 1983; and  lastly  of the Soviet proposals of last July? In our opinion  all those initiatives and efforts were based on one sole principle: territory in exchange for peace.18.	While the Arab side has accepted the principle of those initiatives and we in Jordan have endeavoured to realize that principle and maintain it as the basis for international political action  Israel has not only rejected all those initiatives but has also worked to foil them  thus undermining all prospects for peace. In fact  when Israel rejected those initiatives and endeavoured to block them by any means at its disposal  it not only rejected their form and framework but actually rejected the principle on which they are based  that is  ""recognition in exchange for withdrawal"". Thus it is evident that Israel wants both recognition and territory. That is why it has resorted to various means to justify its conduct  emphasizing the form at the expense of substance so as to thwart the real intent of the proposed agreement.19.	We have no doubt whatsoever about the real intentions of Israel. Israel seeks to annex the West Bank and Gaza  just as it has annexed the Holy City of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. However  Israel cannot have both territory and peace.20.	As Jordan has stated  Israel must publicly declare  as the Arabs have done  that it accepts peace and its conditions  that is  accepts the principle of complete withdrawal from the territories it has occupied since 1967 in exchange for the recognition and security it demands. With full awareness of our national and pan-Arab responsibility  we have declared that  although we are fully ready to take part in any peace process dealing with the modalities for implementing the principle embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  we are at the same time determined not to bargain or negotiate away this principle  which has been articulated and adopted by the international community as the basis for a political settlement between the Arabs and Israel. The principle of ""territory in exchange for peace"" is an international one  approved by the international community and elaborated over the past 17 years  that is  since the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories. This principle is also an embodiment of a pillar of international law  that is  the inadmissibility of acquisition of territories by force and the need to prevent an aggressor from reaping the fruits of his aggression.21.	This concept stems from a careful and objective evaluation of the conduct of Israel since its occupation of the Arab territories in 1967. Israel's intention of annexing those territories has long been evident from its various practices. Since its occupation of those territories  Israel has embarked upon evacuating the indigenous Arab population from the West Bank  Gaza and the Golan Heights. It has perpetrated acts of repression continuously and systematically against the Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza and against the Arab citizens of the Golan Heights in order to create unbearable psychological and physical conditions that would compel them to emigrate. Paramount among the illegal practices resorted to by Israel are acts of terror it has assigned to its settlers in those territories.22.	The methods used by Israel in its policy of oppression against the Palestinian people in their own land are numerous and well known to the international community. But what is important now is to draw the proper inference from those practices: they are meant to force the Palestinian people to abandon their homes. Israel is seeking to implement this objective  while at the same time trying as much as possible to avoid creating any international outcry. The control of 80 per cent of the water resources of the West Bank  the closing down of universities  the confiscation of lands  the demolition of houses  the creation of a dual legal statusâone for the Arab population and the other for the Jewish settlersâ arbitrary arrest and torture  and the desecration and indiscriminate demolition of religious and historic placesâall these interrelated and integrated methods are designed to achieve Israel's primary goal of forcing the Arab population permanently to leave the West Bank and Gaza.23.	This aggressive policy has recently taken the form of an Israeli plan to uproot tens of thousands of Palestinians from refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza and to resettle them in the Jordan River region. We have every reason to be concerned about the consequences of this Israeli plan  particularly in view of Israel's previous practices and deliberate attempts to empty the West Bank of its legitimate owners. This act represents Israel's conception of the Palestinian problem  which it considers a simple demographic one to be solved at the expense of others.24.	Israel's plan to ratify its occupation  to impose a fait accompli and to annex the Arab and Palestinian territories  has been exposed to the whole world. More than one Israeli leader has revealed this intention and has made the plan the corner-stone of their campaigns in the recent Israeli elections. This has been evidenced once more in the outcome of those elections  in which those blocs and parties that explicitly called for the expulsion of the Arabs from their countryâPalestineâwere elected.25.	The salient aspect of Israel's rejection of the principle of exchanging territory for peace is the Israeli settlements policy. Israel's plan to annex and Judaize the occupied Arab territories is based on the establishment of colonial and settlement zones on the outskirts of West Bank cities  in order to encircle them  and in the midst of Arab villages  in order to divide them  as well as along the Jordan River Valley and around water sources. That plan is also aimed at bringing in large numbers of Jewish settlers so that they will soon become the majority in the occupied Arab territories  with the indigenous Arab population consequently becoming a minority. At that point  the problem will cease to be that of the number of settlement colonies and will become  rather  one of the presence of a Jewish majority. The Israeli settlements already number 182 and occupy approximately 55 per cent of the West Bank area.26.	I need not emphasise again that that policy is contrary to the principles of international law governing military occupation and that those settlements are illegitimate and illegal. The explicit international position on this question is testimony to the credibility of the United Nations and a guarantee of the success of its efforts and of any other efforts exerted to find a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.27.	The security argument evoked by Israel from time to time to justify its settlements policy is baseless. The international community knows that peace cannot be achieved through expansion  aggression and the denial of the legitimate rights of others. Rather  expansion  intransigence and failure to recognize the legitimate demands of the Arabs are all a threat to the security of the entire region. In fact  it was the Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories and its policy of forced transfer of civilians which in the first instance caused the threat to Israel's security.28.	To justify its use of force  Israel has invented the myth of an Arab threat to its existence and has exaggerated its need for security in an attempt to rationalize its military build-up. That has served also to project an image of Israel as always being in a situation in which it has no choice. However  Israel's aggression against Lebanon and its continued oppression of the Palestinian people have proved again that Israel has chosen to wage war against the Arabs.29.	Another aspect of Israel's rejection of peace and its desire to expand at the expense of the Arabs is its construction of a canal linking the Mediterranean Sea with the Dead Sea. That canal  which begins in the occupied Arab territories and ends in the Dead Sea  violates and threatens Jordan's vital and legitimate national interests  besides being an act of aggression against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. It is but another example of Israel's consistent tendency to threaten the stability of peace by undermining its foundations. 30.	The danger of this Israeli project is not only that it is contrary to the principles of international law concerning the riparian rights of States and to the laws governing military occupation but also that it is another manifestation of a consistent Israeli policy of controlling the water resources of the region and refusing to recognize their legitimate owners. The problem of water is an important aspect of the Arab- Israeli conflict  and Israel has resisted every regional solution to it. Israel seeks to control the greatest possible quantity of water and to use that water to serve its expansionist settlements policy. One reason for its present occupation of southern Lebanon and its resistance to all pressures for an early withdrawal is its desire to realize its historic ambitions regarding Lebanon's waters. The increasing Israeli ambitions regarding Arab waters in southern Lebanon  the Golan Heights and the Jordan River region represents a dangerous escalation of the situation in the area.31.	Israel could not have persisted in its expansionist policy had the international community as represented by the United Nations been allowed to fulfil its responsibilities. The great Powers which have special relations with Israel bear direct responsibility for the failure of peace efforts because of Israel's intransigence and insubordination with regard to the international will. The complete bias of the United States in favour of Israel and its acquiescence in all the latter's illegal and aggressive practices have caused a set-back to the chances for peace and could destroy those chances. That bias has also undermined the effectiveness of a super-Power which has a fundamental role to play and must bear special responsibility for the deterioration of the situation and the lack of peace in the region.32.	One of the requirements for achieving a political settlement is the restoration of the balance by and between the great Powers	the Arab-Israeli conflict and the establishment of a balance between the Arabs and the Israelis. The experience of past years has proved that the imbalance which characterizes the role of the super-Powers in the region  in terms of both their relationship with each other and their relations with some of the parties in the conflict  is one of the main reasons for Israel's intransigence  its persistence in challenging the international will and its rejection of all peace efforts and initiatives. The history of relations between States and peoples contains not a single example of a situation in which genuine peace was achieved in a state of imbalance. We hope that the United States will reconsider its prejudicial position vis-Ã -vis certain parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This would not only enable it to regain its ability and effectiveness as a neutral mediator but also increase the chances of the success of its efforts to serve its true interests and those of both regional and international peace. There is still a chance  although it is quickly receding.33.	Peace is the central goal of Jordan's foreign policy. We have striven in various circumstances  by every legitimate means and within all international forums for the promotion and encouragement of sincere and balanced peace efforts. We have declared our commitment to Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and our willingness to implement it fully  asserting that the implementation of that important international resolution provides a good opportunity for satisfying the demand of the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination in its homeland  Palestine  and ensures for all the States and peoples of the region  including Israel and the Israelis  the right to live in peace and security. For that reason  Jordan has supported the United Nations call for the convening of an international peace conference with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and the permanent members of the Security Council.34.	President Reagan's proposal a few days ago from this rostrum for United States- Soviet consultations on regional problems was a positive suggestion to facilitate the achievement of an indispensable political solution in the Middle East. It is consistent with Jordan's view on the usefulness of convening such a conference.35.	Consistent with its quest for peace  Jordan has worked with many Arab and other parties to create conditions for promoting our chances of achieving a permanent and just peace.36.	While world attention is focused on the Palestinian question  which is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict  Israel is endeavouring to add a new dimension to that conflictâsouthern Lebanon. We are gravely concerned over developments in the situation there resulting from the Israeli occupation of the region. That occupation represents a grave danger to the unity  independence and national resources of Lebanon. We would like to repeat here our earlier warning that Lebanon is being turned into a means of draining the resources of the Lebanese and Arabs and of diverting attention from the Palestinian problem  thus becoming a smoke-screen behind which Israel is swallowing up the West Bank  Gaza and the Golan Heights. We again emphasize the urgency of ending all practices affecting Lebanon's sovereignty and independence and impeding its efforts to attend to its wounds and proceed along the path to unity and reconstruction  thus enabling it to reassume its role among the Arab nations and in the international arena.37.	Regarding the war between Iraq and Iran  which is in its fifth year  we again warn all countries of the dangers involved in the continuation and widening of that war. During recent months we had the opportunity of witnessing the consequences of such expansion and its implications for the security and stability of the world if we do not hasten to terminate it. We therefore call upon all nations to help bring that war to an end  not only because of fear of a stoppage of oil production but also out of concern for the bloodshed that is taking place there. We believe that political and moral considerations in both the short and long run require us to make sincere efforts to help find an honourable solution to that war.38.	While Iraq has co-operated with the efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and the Secretary-General and while it has accepted United Nations resolutions in regard to the conflict  Iran has so far rejected all efforts at mediation and all attempts to solve the dispute by peaceful means. For these reasons and  frankly speaking  for the sake of our credibility  we must commend our brother country Iraq for its positive response to all those efforts aimed at a cessation of the war  and we hope that Iran will also hasten to express a similar acceptance. 39.	We are aware of the deteriorating situations in other regions of the worldâin Asia  the Mediterranean  Africa and Latin Americaâregions where a number of international disputes are still simmering. In Afghanistan  no concrete progress has been made in the efforts exerted by the parties concerned  with the help of the Secretary-General. The problem of Cyprus is still awaiting resolution. Namibia remains under foreign occupation  and South Africa's policy of apartheid is continuing. In the Korean peninsula  there are still obstacles to the efforts to unify the two parts of Korea by peaceful means. In Central America  we support the efforts of the Contadora Group and hope that all countries will find it possible to support them.40.	The first steps to be taken in order to avoid the dangers involved in the aggravation of disputes and to prevent further deterioration are to work for the implementation of United Nations resolutions  to facilitate the role of the Secretary-General and respond positively to his valuable efforts and  finally  to revitalize the Security Council  thus putting an end to its current state of paralysis.41.	In conclusion  Jordan  which considers the problem of Palestine its own problem and has borne  together with the Palestinian Arab people  all the consequences of the Israeli occupation  expresses its firm commitment to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine and declares its readiness to co-operate with all sincere international efforts to end the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieve a just and comprehensive peace on the basis of international consensusâthat is  territory in exchange for peace. Jordan emphasizes once again the basis for peace spelt out by the international community as follows: a comprehensiveânot a partialâpeace; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  including Arab Jerusalem; the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in Palestine; the right of all States in the region to live in peace within internationally recognized borders.42.	Jordan declares its full willingness to work on the basis of these principles and towards their implementation within a comprehensive and balanced peace process."
"75",3613,"JPN",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of Japan  I wish  Sir  to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that  given the wealth of your experience and the wisdom of your views  this session will prove fruitful indeed. Please be assured that the delegation of Japan will spare no effort in cooperating with you as you carry out your important duties.87.	At the same time  I should like to express my deep appreciation to the President of the thirty eighth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for the very capable manner in which he discharged his awesome responsibilities.88.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary General. As we begin this third year under his leadership  I am most encouraged by his determined efforts and capable leadership in the face of the harsh international situation.89.	I am pleased to be able to extend a sincere welcome to Brunei Darussalam as the 159th country to be admitted to United Nations membership. As an Asian country itself  Japan is most happy to welcome this new Member.90.	Nearly 40 years have passed since the end of the Second World War. This has been a period of unprecedented political  economic and social change throughout the world. The scale and gravity of these ever accelerating changes make it impossible for any one country to respond adequately on its own  yet the urgency of the situation demands that we respond without delay. There is a crying need for fresh perceptions and international cooperation. Nevertheless  the international situation remains tense.91.	East West relations  especially relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  are languishing  and the arms control and disarmament talks between the two countries are suspended. Regional conflicts and disputes continue to foster instability worldwide.92.	In the world economy  the problems of unemployment and massive governmental deficits remain unsolved and protectionism is firmly entrenched even as the recovery  centred in the industrialized countries  takes held and gains strength. The developing countries continue to face a myriad of difficulties  as may be seen in their cumulative foreign indebtedness and the critical food situation in Africa. 93.	At the same time  however  patient cooperative efforts to bring about the relaxation of tensions and economic recovery are continuing here in the United Nations  as well as in multilateral and bilateral forums  and these efforts are gradually gaining momentum.94.	Looking back  Japan's post-war peace and prosperity were considerably facilitated by the prevailing international situation. Today  the changes in the international climate and the growth in the Japanese economy mean that Japan is increasingly expected to fulfil new international responsibilities commensurate with its national strength.95.	Since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs  I have sought to bring about peace and prosperity in Asia and throughout the world by stepping up Japan's diplomatic efforts to promote disarmament and the relaxation of tensions; seeking to revitalize the economies of the developing countries through economic exchange; strengthening the bonds of cooperation and solidarity within the free world; promoting Japan's relations of friendship and cooperation with the countries of the Asia Pacific region; and seeking mutual understanding through dialogue with the Eastern bloc. With the international situation becoming increasingly difficult  I am resolved to respond to the hopes which the international community has placed in Japan by developing a creative diplomacy for a more active and more constructive approach in keeping with the five goals just enumerated.96.	From this perspective  I should like to say a few words now on some of the international issues which I regard as especially important and to explain Japan's foreign policy and its efforts on these issues.97.	The first is the creation of a climate conducive to peace. With the world as unstable as it is today  the best and surest way to avert a potentially catastrophic war is to deter expansion and  more important  to prevent escalation of the various regional conflicts that erupt all over the globe  and then to alleviate these conflicts and find some way to resolve the underlying issues.98.	The tense situation surrounding the Iran Iraq conflict persists. The Secretary General's initiative last June produced agreement by both sides not to attack civilian population centres.  Believing that such agreements are important steps toward inhibiting further escalation  Japan has the highest regard for the Secretary General for having taken this initiative  as well as for Iran and Iraq for having acceded to his proposal. However  my Government finds it regrettable that attacks were recently made on industrial and economic facilities in both countries.99.	For the future  the issues before us are  first  how to prevent any escalation of the conflict and then how to build upon present efforts to scale down the conflict further. I hope the Secretary General will continue to play an active role to that end. I am confident that the steady weight of such efforts goes far towards ensuring the success of the peace process. From this perspective  I would hope very much that the following two points would be promptly settled.100.	The first concerns the issue of chemical weapons. Given the present circumstances  it seems to be essential to reach a clear understanding that there will be no future violations of the 1925 Geneva Protects prohibiting the use of chemical weapons.101.	The second concerns the issue of safe navigation in the Gulf. This is important not only to Iran and Iraq but to all countries. Ensuring safe navigation requires that the principle of free navigation be observed in international waters in the Gulf and also that the safe use of ports and harbours be respected. It is of vital importance that the ports and harbours of both countries should not be subject to attacks of any kind. Past United Nations resolutions may provide reference in defining ports and harbours in this connection.102.	I am confident that the settlement of these two points would contribute to the creation of a climate conducive to the just and honourable settlement of this conflict  now in its fifth year  and I strongly hope that these issues will be accorded comprehensive and serious consideration.103.	I have been very much concerned with the situation in this region throughout my tenure as Foreign Minister. I have met with the leaders of both Iran and Iraq several times  developed a sympathetic understanding of their positions and appealed to both sides for an early peace. In consultation with the Secretary General and all other countries which seek peace in this region  I intend to continue to make every possible effort to create a climate conducive to peace.104.	Turning to Asia  the problem of Kampuchea remains unresolved. Japan has consistently supported a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem based upon the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from Kampuchea and the exercise of the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination. At the same time  Japan believes that it is important to continue to explore various means in search of a clue to the solution of this problem  while maintaining its basic position. From this point of view  I made a three point proposal centring upon financial support to the dialogue partners at the ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] at Jakarta in July.105.	To summarize the proposal: the first point concerns financial cooperation for peacekeeping activities in the event of last September's ASEAN appeal being implemented  with the consent of all the countries concerned; the second concerns cooperation  such as providing personnel  if free elections are held throughout the whole of Kampuchean territory under international supervision; and the third concerns Japan's  co-operation in the reconstruction of Indo China after peace has been restored in Kampuchea.106.	While fully aware that there are many difficulties on the road to peace in Kampuchea  Japan hopes that this proposal will be helpful in creating a climate conducive to peace in IndoChina  and we intend to continue our dialogue with the ASEAN countries as well as with the other countries concerned  including Viet Nam.107.	While the tense situation continues in the Korean peninsula  the Korean question should basically be resolved peacefully through direct dialogue between the authorities of both North and South. Japan strongly hopes that substantive dialogue will be resumed between the two sides as soon as possible.108.	Earlier this month  President Chun DooHwan of the Republic of Korea paid an official visit to Japan. On that occasion  Japan reiterated its welcome and support for United Nations membership for both North and South Korea  if both sides would consider such membership as one step on the road to reunification of the Korean peninsula  as contributing to the relaxation of tensions and as enhancing the universality of the United Nations. For its part  Japan will continue to cooperate in every way possible to create a climate conducive to the relaxation of tensions in the Korean peninsula.109.	Elsewhere in the world I find it most regrettable that in the past year no concrete progress has been made in resolving the problems in Afghanistan and the Middle East. In Afghanistan  I call upon all parties concerned for a prompt withdrawal of Soviet troops  the restoration of self-determination for the Afghan people and a safe and honourable return for the refugees. On the issue of peace in the Middle East  I again appeal to all the principals involved to make even greater efforts for the attainment of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.110.	Despite the implementation of the plan for civil order in Lebanon in July  the United States Embassy annex was brutally bombed just last week. This deplorable incident shows how fragile the peace in Lebanon is. For the sake of stability in Lebanon  I hope that all the parties concerned will redouble their efforts for the withdrawal of all foreign military forces and the attainment of national reconciliation.111.	Japan strongly calls upon the Republic of South Africa to abandon its policy of racial discrimination. Likewise  we hope that the issue of Namibian independence will be promptly resolved through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and that the United Nations will exercise its leadership on this issue.112.	In Central America  where tensions continue high  Japan strongly supports the efforts being made by the Contadora Group and other intraregional efforts.113.	The Soviet Union being an important neighbour of Japan  I would like again this year to touch upon relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. I find it most regrettable that the Soviet Union has not only refused to sit down to discuss the still unresolved issue of Japan's Northern Territories  but has even deployed and strengthened its military forces in our Northern Territories in recent years. Japan very much hopes to resolve this territorial issue and conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union and hence to promote the establishment of a stable relationship based upon true mutual understanding and trust. We therefore intend to continue to expand and strengthen the dialogue with the Soviet Union  and I hope that the Soviet Union will show a similar willingness.114.	I would next like to speak of the search for long-lasting and structural peaceâanother priority of Japanese foreign policy.115.	The excessive stockpiles of nuclear weapons existing today threaten the very survival of mankind. We must find some way to eliminate this threat.116.	Last June I attended the Conference on Disarmament  at Geneva  the first Japanese Foreign Minister ever to do so  and appealed to the United States  the Soviet Union and all countries of the world to make serious efforts for disarmament. Especially regarding the negotiations on intermediate range nuclear forces and the strategic arms reduction talks  which are currently suspended between the United States and the Soviet Union  I strongly called upon the Soviet Union to fulfil its grave responsibilities as a nuclear superpower by returning to the negotiating table as soon as possible and without preconditions  both in response to the global popular demand for peace and to maintain and strengthen the regime of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 117.	As a means of advancing the goal of a comprehensive nuclear test ban  I proposed a realistic approach whereby the ""threshold"" for a nuclear test ban would be gradually lowered as multilateral capabilities of verification are improved. I very much hope that this proposal will be taken up and discussed in greater detail at next year's meetings of the Conference on Disarmament.118.	In the nonnuclear weapons field  the world is now more keenly aware than ever before of the need for a ban on chemical weapons.119.	The issue of preventing an arms race in outer space has also become a matter of increasing international concern  and there was recently hope that talks might soon start between the United States and the Soviet Union. These hopes reflected the fervent desire of the people of all countries for the arms control and disarmament negotiations to resume. I earnestly hope that  in response to these wishes  the nuclear disarmament talks will progress and East West relations will improve.120.	The United Nations  where we are gathered today  is the only institutional foundation for peace agreed upon by the many countries of the world. Having experienced the horror of the Second World War  Japan proclaimed its renunciation of force as a means of settling international disputes and has been working ever since to settle disputes peaceably. Reaffirming this basic policy stance  Japan is resolved to contribute even more actively to the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the preservation and strengthening of peace through the Security Council  the International Court of Justice and other organs of the United Nations.121.	Although some people have recently been critical or scornful of the United Nations  we must never forget that the scale and complexity of the political and economic difficulties facing the global community today are intractable to solution by any one country acting alone and can be resolved only through multilateral cooperation.122.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary General has written:""To make the United Nations work better  what is needed  above all  is a determined and persistent effort to strike a balance between national and international interest.""... therefore  I wish to repeat my call for a multilateral and rational approach to the problems of international peace and development.""I am in complete agreement with the Secretary General's views  and I intend to continue to seek peace and prosperity for Japan within the context of peace and prosperity for all the world.123.	The United Nations will be 40 years old next year  and I think this is an excellent time for all Member States to give serious consideration to how we can best invigorate the United Nations organization and functions as we look ahead to the twenty first century. Japan pledges to fulfil its international responsibilities and to work with other Member countries for the revitalization of this world body.124.	Thirdly  I would like to say a few words about actions which must be taken in order to cope with the new age and which will always be required for the survival and prosperity of mankind.125.	The new nations of Africa  which appeared so youthful and robust in 1960âthe ""Year of Africa""â face almost unbearable difficulties today. Over 150 million people have been stricken with malnutrition and starvation on the African continent  and more and more unfortunate people are dying every day. This situation is even worse than warâit is an affront to peace. How can we speak of peace while this tragedy continues? I feel it was therefore most timely for the Secretary General to call early this year for relief for the crisis in Africa. The question before us now is whether or not the world will respond sympathetically to this tragedy  and the very value of the United Nations itself is on the line.126.	This unprecedented crisis does not arise solely from a quirk of nature but is rooted in a variety of structural causes. Accordingly  while the need to relieve starvation is of obvious urgency  it is imperative on a more fundamental level that our reach extend to the complex web of structural factors and that we treat this not with a bewildering array of contradictory policy responses  but with a cooperative and comprehensive solution involving the international community.127.	Allow me to propose that all United Nations agencies be mobilized to draw up a unified plan of action for Africa making effective use of the total range of United Nations capabilities. At the same time  allow me to call upon all United Nations Member States for their support and participation as the Organization moves to implement specific actions in accordance with that plan.128.	As a start  Japan has already pledged over $100 million in food assistance to Africa this year  and we are engaged in candid discussions with African countries to explore what we can do to help promote food production in the region and cooperate effectively with their nation building. Over the past 10 years  Japan has achieved dramatic increases in its economic cooperation with the countries of Africa  and we are already the second largest non-regional subscriber to the African Development Fund and the African Development Bank. In the field of technical cooperation as well  over 40 per cent of all Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers are sent to Africa  where they promote cooperation at the grassroots level. Within Japan itself  the month beginning 28 September has been declared the ""Month of Africa""  and we intend to publicize African cultural  social and historical traditions so as to enhance further Japanese understanding of Africa's present plight  to spark a broad-based fundraising drive and to arouse popular support and cooperation for the countries of Africa.129.	I hope that this session's debate on the problems of Africa will be an opportunity for bringing our various national efforts together and generating the momentum needed to overcome the crisis on that continent.130.	I should like next to turn my attention to the world economy. Today all countries  industrialized and developing  find their economies irrevocably interdependent. Effective cooperation among countries is indispensable to resolving the complex difficulties afflicting the world economy.131.	One of the problems demanding effective international cooperation  one of the most important issues facing many of the developing countries today  is that of their cumulative indebtedness. This problem has the potential of wreaking havoc not only on the debtor countries but also on the entire world economy. !t is a problem that we ignore at our own peril.132.	Because there is such great diversity in the economies of the debtor countries  it is necessary that the responses be patiently and carefully crafted to meet each situation. Although the determined cooperation of all the parties concerned has averted collapse so far  we are still considerable time and effort away from a fundamental solution. Looking at the essential elements of the problem from a long term perspective  I believe we need efforts by the debtor countries to adjust their economic structures for expanded exports and cooperative efforts by the creditor countries to maintain the smooth flow of capital to the debtor countries and to improve further their access to the markets of the industrialized countries.133.	I am  however  encouraged by recent developments. With the Latin American countries emphasizing the urgent need for a solution at this year's meetings of the debtor countriesâsuch as those held at Quito in January and Cartagena in Juneâthe industrialized countries are encouraging multiyear rescheduling for the private sector debts of countries making effective efforts to help themselves. There is a spirit of cooperation in the air  and Mexicoâ which I visited just before coming to New Yorkâ recently reached a rescheduling agreement that is a model of its kind.134.	Trade expansion is indispensable to any long term solution of the debt problem and to the sustained development of the world economy. To achieve this we must roll back protectionism and preserve and strengthen the free trade system. Realizing that  Japan proposed the beginning of preparations for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations last November  and we have been working hard ever since to advance that idea.135.	At the London Economic Summit of industrialized countries  held last June  it was agreed to consult partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with a view to deciding at an early date on a new round of negotiations. Japan intends to continue its efforts to commence a new round in which as broad a range of countries as possibleâ both industrialized and developingâwill participate.136.	Because it views official development assistance as an important international responsibility  Japan has been endeavouring  despite its tight fiscal situation  to expand its official development assistance in line with the medium-term target of doubling the total amount of that assistance in five years. Our official development assistance figure for 1983 represented a 24.4 per cent increase over the figure for the previous year.137.	Japan attaches importance to the development of human resources and has made special efforts in the field of technical cooperation with the developing countries. I believe that technical cooperation is in itself a creative process; it promotes technological progress to meet the actual needs of each developing country in harmony with its traditional way of life  and we intend to continue such technical cooperation. ""Human resources development"" has long been an important element in Japan's economic and technical cooperation with the ASEAN countries. When the problems of cooperation in the Pacific region were discussed at ASEAN's ministerial meeting in July with the dialogue partners  I emphasized the need for ""human resources development""  and I am delighted that this was then accepted and thereafter became a major theme for broad regional cooperation in the Pacific.138.	If we are to achieve a much needed breakthrough in the North South problem and  in particular  if we are to promote further economic and technical cooperation between North and South  I believe that  in addition to the efforts for the expansion of development assistance and ""human resources development""  we need what I would call a concerted effort by both North and South based on a new perspective. For example  closer and more substantive dialogue between donor and recipient countries  if it were conducted in a concerted manner by both sides  would greatly enhance effectiveness and efficiency in economic cooperation. At the same time  positive use should be made of the dynamism of the private sector in tackling the difficult problems of development. In technology  as in capital cooperation  efforts to establish a more organic link between government level cooperation and private sector cooperation are certainly of increasing importance to both North and South.139.	We all stand today at an important juncture from which  availing ourselves of the wisdom of both North and South  we can embark upon creative efforts based on a new perspective  for the solution of the North South problem.140.	Where are we to derive the energy needed to create the new world of the twenty-first century? Obviously  it must come from within ourselves. Of all the forms of life on this earth  only man has the power to shape his own destiny. We must draw upon this power today. When one realizes how the mutual stimulation of differing cultures has sparked new possibilities among peoples  propelling history through the ages  it should be clear that  in drawing together all countries  large and small  to argue their cases on an equal basis  the United Nations is indeed a reactor generating new historical forces. Advances in communications and transportation technologies are bringing people in all parts of the world ever closer together  and contacts among different cultures are on the increase. I believe that this wealth of contacts contributes importantly to realizing the potential of all peoples.141.	The world is admittedly faced with great difficulties. It is for us to overcome those difficulties and go on to a new era. Drawing upon the imagination and vitality of all of our peoples  we must harness the forces of human creativity to generate a new era of hope for all mankind."
"76",3685,"KEN",39,1984,"ï»¿Permit me  Sir  to join other representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you most warmly on your election to the high office of President of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is clear proof of the confidence placed in you personally by the General Assembly. It is also a great honour to your country  Zambia  and Africa as a whole. On behalf of my delegation  I wish you and the other officers of the Assembly success in your endeavours to guide the work of the thirty-ninth session to a successful conclusion.197.	I wish also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who with singular distinction led the General Assembly successfully through the thirty-eighth session. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his untiring efforts and the wisdom he displayed at all times.198.	In welcoming the State of Brunei Darussalam  the 159th Member of the United Nations  I congratulate it and also extend the hand of friendship and co-operation.199.	Allow me to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General and the entire staff of the United Nations system for the good services they have faithfully continued to render to the international community.200.	In opening my remarks at this session of the General Assembly  I should like to start with a vision of world peace. We in Kenya hold the view that the future of the planet we all jointly share depends on the strengthening of peaceful co-operation in relations among States and on such relations being devoid of unnecessary frictions.201.	Whenever international peace and security have been threatened  the General Assembly has not failed to exert maximum pressure on the side of peace  justice and mutual understanding. It is Kenya's sincere hope that this session of the Assembly will continue to respond favourably to the general will of the international community to maintain peace and stability for all nations.202.	The guiding spirit of my Government  under President Daniel Arap Moi  is the advocacy of peace  democracy and justice for all under the rule of law and the uplifting of the economic and social welfare of our people in unity  freedom and love for one another. This is the springboard and the foundation of our people's aspirations  and all our actions  both domestic and international  are tuned to promote  project and vigorously defend these goals. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all nations which in turn do the same to us.203.	The problem of the apartheid system of South Africa has been on the agenda of the Organization for a long time. The racist regime in Pretoria continues to defy United Nations resolutions on this critical issue. The regime deprives the black people of that country of the right to enjoy basic human rights in their own land. In all walks of life  the black people in South Africa have no say in the conduct of the daily affairs affecting them. Their demands for social  economic and political changes for the benefit of all the people of the country are always ruthlessly suppressed by the racist regime in its desperate efforts to protect its inhuman apartheid policies. Measures are carefully designed for the forceful exploitation of the black man's human and material resources. These inhuman practices are the most basic causes of political tension and social conflict in the whole region. The stage has been progressively set for unavoidable social violence  with potential consequences for international peace and security. The world witnessed dozens of people being killed and many more injured in early September this year  when unrest and violence occurred in the black townships of Sharpeville  Sebokeng and Evaton  south of Johannesburg. Thus  the racist regime is continuing to sharpen its weapons of terror further to undermine the demands of the black people for democracy  equality and justice for all.204.	The apartheid system has been condemned by the General Assembly as a crime against humanity. It is the moral duty of every country to do its utmost to achieve total destruction of this abhorrent system. In the efforts to achieve this objective  Kenya will not be found wanting. As my President  Daniel Arap Moi  said at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly:""Across the whole spectrum of impact and meaning  apartheid torments the conscience of all civilized men. It violates those universal principles of human dignity and conduct which the United Nations has been authorized to codify and to harness. And there is no doubt that it affronts the very foundation of international law. On these three grounds alone  and there are many more  the only conclusion to be reached is that apartheid must be destroyed. In any case  there should never be any compromise with evilâand apartheid is  in every aspect  evil."" 205.	My delegation  which represents a people that fought a bitter and costly war for the freedom and independence of our own country  is deeply concerned over the economic and military co-operation South Africa receives from some States Members of the United Nations. This support enables the regime to maintain its oppressive system against the African people. We appeal seriously to those countries to reconsider their position and adopt appropriate measures directed towards total isolation of South Africa in order to compel it to dismantle its apartheid system.206.	The reported development and possession of nuclear devices by South Africa is a matter of extreme concern to Africa  which has repeatedly warned against assistance being given to South Africa to develop nuclear capability. None of the previous pretensions that the arms and military assistance given to that country were for self-defence has stood the practical test. South Africa wants nuclear capability and huge arsenals of armaments to intimidate  destabilize and carry out aggression against neighbouring African States  and in particular the landlocked State of Lesotho. We refuse to accept that possession of weapons will ever deter the Africans in their resolve to fight for freedom  dignity and equality.207.	We cannot allow ourselves to be deceived by the enactment of the so-called new constitution in South Africa. We are resolved to continue our support to the liberation movements of South Africa until victory is won and democracy re-established in that country. We call upon other States to' do the same until South Africa abandons the inhuman practices and policies of apartheid.208.	The international community has been seriously frustrated in its efforts to bring to an end the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. It is not my intention in this debate to dwell on the sad history of South Africa's aggression against Namibia. The records of this speak for themselves. Even friends and allies of South Africa should now agree with us on the imperative need for South Africa to evacuate Namibia and for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The international community must not waste any time; we must seriously examine why resolution 435 (1978) has not been implemented and then decide on the appropriate course of action to take. South Africa must not be allowed to continue using Namibia as a springboard for aggression and for destabilization of the neighbouring States.209.	The United Nations and all its organs  particularly the Security Council  must focus attention on bringing about the earliest implementation of the Security Council plan for the independence of Namibia provided for in resolution 435 (1978). We all agree that the plan envisaged in that resolution remains the only basis for the peaceful transition to independence of that Territory.210.	In his report on Namibia pursuant to Security Council resolution 532 (1983)  the Secretary-General confirmed that all the outstanding issues relevant to that resolution had been resolved. He also made it clear to South Africa that the linkage of Cuban troops in Angola with the independence of Namibia introduced an irrelevant and extraneous issue. Kenya fully agrees with the Secretary-General and hopes that Namibia will attain its independence before the end of this year.211.	Allow me to comment briefly on the Horn of Africa. Kenya is part of the Horn  and we are naturally deeply interested in all developments in that region. The area is still plagued by tensions and conflicts which adversely affect economic  political and social development and relations among States in that part of the world.212.	The Government of Kenya pursues a policy of good-neighbourliness with all its neighbours. We are convinced that without peace and mutual understanding there can never be significant progress in all aspects of human development. During the past few months  my President  Daniel Arap Moi  has personally held consultations with all the leaders in the Horn of Africa. The leaders of the area are dedicated and experienced statesmen  deeply devoted to the welfare of their peoples. This is an asset. My President found the experience both rewarding and encouraging. Consequently  Kenya feels duty-bound to continue the quest for peaceful relations  good- neighbourliness and economic co-operation in our region. We are convinced that these objectives are paramount and stand above any political persuasion or differences. Kenya therefore appeals to all the States in the area to redouble their efforts in the search for lasting peace  co-operation and mutual security. Any encouragement by other States towards these noble goals would undoubtedly attract our support.213.	I now turn my attention to the area of the Middle East. Like the peoples of southern Africa  the peoples of the Middle East have not enjoyed any peace for many years. The core of the problem is the denial of the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's refusal to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. We have stated time and again that no durable peace can be achieved in the area until the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and to an independent State of their own in the region are realized. The right of others in that region also to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders must also be respected.214.	The problem in the Middle East has been further aggravated by Israel's invasion and occupation of Lebanon in June 1982. Israel owes its legal existence to the United Nations  and it should not flout the Charter and resolutions of the Organization with impunity.215.	Elsewhere  the international political situation has not taken a turn for the better. We are disappointed that  despite the Organization's call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea  those countries still remain under foreign military occupation. In the Gulf area  a devastating war between Iran and Iraq continues unabated  with heavy losses of human lives and material on both sides. Farther afield  North and South Korea have yet to find a peaceful solution to their unification problem. We recognize the complexity of the problem  but we see no alternative to continued dialogue and the improvement of mutual trust and confidence between the two countries.216.	The tragedy afflicting Cyprus also deserves our attention. In this respect  we refer to Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984)  in which the Council condemned all secessionist actions. Kenya has always called and will continue to call for respect for and recognition of the territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of the State of Cyprus.217.	It is clear that super-Power rivalry is evident in the Indian Ocean. This rivalry is a threat to the countries in the region and undermines the efforts of the international community to convene an international conference on the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. An international conference on this subject would bring together all the concerned States and maritime Powers to harmonize their views and to resolve issues that are impeding the establishment of a zone of peace in the area. We believe that the success of such a conference could be facilitated through a firm commitment by the countries of the region  by great Powers and by maritime users to the principles of the Declaration. Kenya has called and will continue to call for the implementation of the Declaration.218.	Disarmament has become an absolute and urgent necessity  particularly in the field of nuclear weapons. The pressing task which confronts the international community is to seek the reversal of the arms build-up and ultimately to bring about the complete elimination of these man-made objects of self-destruction.219.	Indeed  there are two elements in Kenya's perception of disarmament. First  we believe that there is an intrinsic correlation between progress towards disarmament and the international political situation. Goals of disarmament cannot be reached in a political climate devoid of mutual confidence and characterized by tensions and breaches of the peace. Secondly  no moral  ideological or political explanation is sufficiently convincing to justify the present diversion of colossal human and material resources to improving and augmenting the already formidable nuclear and conventional arsenals.220.	The time has come for the General Assembly to adopt a convention that would give unqualified guarantees of the security of non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons against them at any time. The nuclear Powers and all militarily significant States must be persuaded to desist from the production of these weapons and to channel the vast and invaluable resources so released to the economic and social development and the well-being of all mankind. Kenya stands ready and willing to continue playing its part in strengthening international understanding. To this end  Kenya wishes to make a special appeal to the super-Powers to increase their efforts towards relaxation of tensions  mutual understanding and greater co-operation in the search for world peace and development.221.	For the last 10 years  the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization has been searching for an acceptable formula for strengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations. Despite the very slow progress and the minimal results achieved over the years  we still have some hope of progress. Preventive diplomacy  although provided for in the Charter  is a question that had not previously been given detailed attention. We note that discussions have now opened on this matter  and we expect future proceedings to adopt the serious and purposeful approach demonstrated at its session last April. In its search for structural improvements  the Special Committee should not lose sight of its original objectives. These include: strengthening of the role of the Security Council and serious assumption by the Council of its responsibilities  including those provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter; strengthening of the role of the General Assembly  including a timely examination of the question of non-implementation of General Assembly resolutions; and analysing early-warning mechanisms for prevention of friction and international disputes. It is my Government's view that these issues cannot be considered in isolation from one another  but need to be examined concurrently.222.	On the question of developing a mechanism for dispute settlement under the United Nations  my Government fully supports the efforts of the members of the Special Committee to provide for a mechanism which is effective and efficient. We feel that this would enhance the role of the United Nations  promote negotiated solutions to conflicts and provide a useful mechanism for making contacts between parties to disputes. Such a proposal would also be in line with the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.223.	In our region  we are systematically engaged in serious efforts to find peaceful solutions to various disputes and tensions. Successful completion of the work of the Special Committee will greatly enhance peaceful relations among neighbours in our part of the world.224.	I turn now to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Kenya supports the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as an important instrument that represents a codification and progressive development of international law. Kenya continues to follow keenly the steps taken by the United Nations and its Member States to implement this Convention. Consequently  we have participated actively in the work of the Preparatory Commission  which continues to serve as an important link between the objectives of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the activities of Member States in and beyond the waters under their national jurisdiction.225.	We urge all signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and those to the Final Act of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that are participating in the Preparatory Commission to display the same political will and resolve as they demonstrated during the negotiations on the Convention to enable the Preparatory Commission to pave the way for the early coming into force of that Convention. In this connection  we call on all States to refrain from taking any action that would delay the early entry into force of the Convention or impair its universality. Kenya supports the work of the Preparatory Commission and reaffirms its commitment to participate actively in its future deliberations.226.	As we meet here today  developing countries continue to be faced with critical economic problems  including serious balance-of-payments problems  un-favourable terms of trade  debt problems  high interest rates  foreign exchange shortages  high rates of inflation  rapidly rising unemployment  and prolonged and devastating drought and famine.227.	Kenya has followed with great concern the depressing international economic situation. In the last few months  a few industrialized countries have appeared to be on the threshold of economic recovery and one hopes that these indicators point to long and lasting prosperity.228.	Nevertheless  these signs of economic recovery in some major industrialized countries must not be allowed to distract our attention from the need for co-ordinated and world-wide efforts to bring about economic growth in the developing countries as two inseparable activities. We in Kenya cannot therefore accept the premise that if economic recovery is achieved in the developed countries the developing countries will automatically benefit as a result of such recovery. We do not accept the ""trickling down"" theory in modern international economic relations. While we welcome the signs of recovery in some parts of the world  that recovery is not likely to have much effect on the economies of the developing countries for some time to come.229.	The recent economic recession in the developed countries inevitably had an adverse effect on world trade and hence upon the economic fortunes of most developing countries. The very depressed state of demand in industrialized countries meant the continuing decline in world commodity prices. The terms of trade of non-oil-producing developing countries remained at about 20 per cent below the 1977-1979 average.230.	In reviewing the global economic situation  therefore  we cannot disguise our exasperation at the rather protracted malaise that continues to afflict the world economy. The crisis  which has now reached unprecedented proportions  is threatening the stability and stifling the economic growth of all countries. Consequently  the economic resilience and margin of safety once available to many developing countries continue to be severely eroded. The harsh realities besetting the world economic scene today  compounded by cyclical factors  are in truth symptomatic of more fundamental inadequacies plaguing the international economic system. Since the sixth special session of the General Assembly  in 1974  many initiatives have been taken and numerous conferences and meetings held in vain attempts to redress these structural imbalances. The failure of these efforts to improve the international economic order does not negate their validity  nor should it diminish our commitment to the eventual achievement of their aim. Kenya once more reiterates its strong commitment to the establishment of the new international economic order. We should like to see equitable participation by ail nations in the productive and decision-making processes of the global economy.231.	Kenya fully supports the efforts of the non- aligned countries and the Group of 77 to address these problems  as manifested at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  and the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires from 28 March to 9 April 1983. Immediate measures to stimulate world economic recovery and to accelerate development in the developing countries are urgently needed. Prominent among these measures is the proposal to convene an international conference on money and finance for development. We feel that the launching of global negotiations is long overdue  and we continue to advocate the early launching of such negotiations. My delegation therefore calls upon all the parties concerned to iron out their differences without undue delay.232.	As we gather here to take stock of events of the last 12 months  it is impossible not to note the following. First  the outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  was a disappointing experience for the developing countries. Secondly  not much meaningful progress has been achieved in the attempts to launch global negotiation. Thirdly  an attempt to review and appraise the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade in May of this year was not much of a success. Fourthly  the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development and the Committee on the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy have also not made much progress in their respective areas of competence  as envisaged by the General Assembly when they were set up. Fifthly  the recently concluded Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August  failed to reach a consensus regarding policy guidelines and the mobilization of resources for the industrialization of the developing countries.233.	We therefore feel that there is a need to sort out collectively the differences and difficulties that continue to obstruct meaningful progress in our dialogue. We feel that negotiations rather than confrontation should be our central theme. I feel obliged to emphasize this point because we have been criticizing the outcome of many conferences  year after year  without giving thought to the persistent confrontation between groups. This is the root cause of our failures. The solution is flexibility and accommodation of each other's views. We have a collective responsibility  as members of the international community  to find ways and means of improving the quality of life of all the peoples of the world.234.	We are all in general agreement that now more than ever before the developing countries are faced with serious economic problems. We see international trade as a very important component of economic co-operation. Its decline has deprived the developing countries of the much-needed foreign exchange essential for the importation of capital goods and other relevant inputs for their development efforts. Additionally  their terms of trade have seriously deteriorated since 1980  when prices of primary commodities collapsed. The wave of protectionism in the developed countries  particularly the developed market economy countries  has been more evident since 1980 than ever before. This has been due to the inward-looking policies practised by most of these countries. We note  with dismay  that neither the November 1982 ministerial meeting of the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade nor the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reached the sort of liberal consensus which had characterized the earlier trade rounds.235.	Collective self-reliance as expressed through economic and technical co-operation among developing countries is a dynamic process. Such a process should prove critical for the revitalization of the development of their economies and also contribute greatly to sustained global recovery. Economic and technical co-operation among developing countries is indeed an integral part of Kenya's foreign policy. Within our limited capacities we have extended technical co-operation programmes to various developing countries  both within and outside our region. We continue to call repeatedly on developing countries to intensify their co-operation at sub regional  regional and interregional levels in all fields.236.	Kenya urges the developed countries to view activities connected with economic co-operation among developing countries and technical co-operation among developing countries as being complementary to North-South co-operation. The developed countries should  there accord all necessary support to both such activities. It was in the spirit of South-South co-operation that developing countries adopted in 1981 the Caracas Programme of Action  the implementation of which has been enhanced by the many intergovernmental economic and technical meetings in the last few years.237.	In a number of regions also  new initiatives in connection with South-South co-operation have been undertaken. To this end  my country  together with other countries of eastern and southern Africa  concluded at Lusaka in December 1981 a treaty establishing a preferential trade area for the sub region. The area  which has a potential membership of 20 countries  has been operational since July of this year. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of sub regional trade and co-operation in agricultural  industrial  transport and communications development.238.	Let me say a few words about our efforts in east Africa in the area of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries. We recognize that the primary responsibility for solving our economic problems rests with ourselves. We therefore actively co-operate with our neighbours in an effort to exploit our potential. I am delighted to say that Kenya has undertaken joint projects with neighbouring countries in various fields. I am also pleased to say that since November of last year the east African sub region has made notable progress towards South- South co-operation. Early this year  the Governments of Kenya  Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania agreed on modalities of co-operation. I am confident that we shall be able to intensify our economic activities and achieve tremendous revitalization of our economies in the sub region. This cooperation will serve to enhance the preferential trade area and other forms of co-operation in Africa.239.	Kenya attaches great importance and meaning to the industrialization of the developing countries  particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. The Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization is still fresh in our minds. Our immediate reaction to the outcome of that Conference is that it failed to agree on the fundamental issue of financing the industrialization of the developing countries. We hope that when this item is discussed in the Assembly an acceptable solution will be found.240.	Kenya views science and technology as crucial vehicles for development in developing countries. It is regrettable that  five years after the adoption of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development  no meaningful agreement has been reached to implement the programme  in particular as it relates to mobilization of financial resources. We therefore urge Governments to intensify their efforts towards early implementation of the Programme.241.	Energy is an essential component of the development process. The need to shift from dependence on conventional sources of energy to much greater reliance on alternative sources cannot be over-emphasized. It was in view of this that the international community adopted  in 1981  the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable sources of Energy. The Programme called in particular for the mobilization of financial resources for harnessing new and renewable sources of energy. Kenya is seriously concerned at the slow pace of its implementation.242.	I now turn to the area"" of environment and human settlements. We continue to associate ourselves with the decisions of the General Assembly to establish an environmental commission to look into the world Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and beyond  and to observe  in 1987  the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.243.	The African continent  from which I come  is the home of many low-income developing countries. Most of our countries are still net exporters of primary commodities  on which we depend for our foreign-exchange earnings. We are concerned that many African countries are still faced with continuous food shortages  malnutrition  disease  poverty  unemployment  underemployment  deteriorating terms of trade  indebtedness and a host of other difficulties.244.	We would recall that in April 1980  at its second extraordinary session  the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  in recognition of the developmental problems facing the African continent  adopted the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa and the Final Act of Lagos. We appeal to all gathered here to continue to give the Lagos Plan of Action the support it deserves.245.	Early this year  the Secretary-General visited countries in Africa and had an opportunity to see for himself and to assess the difficulties facing most of our countries owing to the climatic and ecological situation. It was as a follow-up of his visit that in March this year he appointed a Special Representative for Africa's Economic Crisis  to monitor all emergency and humanitarian aspects of the prevailing economic crisis in Africa and to report directly to him  and established a temporary office at Nairobi. We warmly welcome the Secretary-General's initiative. It was in the same spirit that the Economic and Social Council  at its second regular session  considered as a priority item Africa's economic crisis.246.	We feel that the very critical and serious economic problems facing Africa call for concerted international attention. The problems have been further aggravated by the prolonged drought which has been spreading throughout the continent  the encroaching Sahara desert and other natural disasters. Of all the developmental problems facing Africa  my delegation would especially like to highlight the acute food shortages  which have continued to increase in recent years. We see food and agriculture as the most important sectors of human life  since they affect the very survival of man. We urge the international community to take urgent collective measures to step up assistance to African countries to combat desertification  alleviate overall critical food shortages and achieve self-sufficiency in food production in the continent.247.	It will be recalled that the Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted on 26 May 1984 by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africaâthe Ministers responsible for economic development and planningâdid not receive the serious attention it deserved during the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council  held at Geneva. As a result  the African countries were deeply disappointed that the Council failed to agree on any measures to alleviate the economic and social problems in Africa. My delegation proposes that this session of the General Assembly should take concrete measures to achieve short-  medium- and long-term solutions for the current economic crisis in Africa.248.	Kenya will be greatly honoured and privileged to host next year the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women. The aims and objectives of the United Nations Decade for Women include the raising of the status of women by involving them at all levels in the affairs of their societies and their integration into the overall development processes at both the national and the international levels. This is in pursuance of the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year  adopted at Mexico City in 1975.249.	Kenya attributes great importance to the convening of the World Conference. We are confident that Member States will seize the opportunity provided by the forum at Nairobi to discuss the many issues on the agenda in a constructive manner. In this connection  my Government is in close touch with the United Nations Secretariat regarding the necessary preparations for the Conference  and we look forward to welcoming representatives of Member States and participants to the city of Nairobi."
"77",3756,"KHM",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  I wish to extend my cordial greetings to all delegations which are concerned about the tragic fate of the Khmer people and which are now attending this meeting of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The steadfastness and energy with which so many nations have for many years supported the just cause of Democratic Kampuchea  which has been invaded  occupied  plundered and half colonized by an imperialist  annexationist foreign Power  represent for all the patriots of Kampuchea invaluable encouragement in their struggle for independence and freedom.164.	Mr. President  your noteworthy election to guide the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly is a well-deserved tribute to your well known ability and your outstanding work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia. It is also  through you  a tribute to your valiant country  Zambia  which  under the successful leadership of President Kenneth Kaunda  has been carrying out courageous action on the front line against racism and apartheid and for the independence of Africa.165.	I should like  on behalf of the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea  to address to you our warmest congratulations and best wishes for success in your important and difficult duties. I wish also to express our sincere and profound gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who conducted our work with great wisdom and efficiency.166.	I should like  further  to express to the Secretary-general our profound esteem and deep appreciation for his tireless efforts to ease the tensions which have arisen in various parts of the world and his continuing work in the interest of security  justice and peace  which are primary objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. The Secretary-general has demonstrated on many occasions his impartiality  skill and courage. The Organization  to which he does credit  is greatly indebted to him.167.	It is a great pleasure for me  on behalf of the Coalition Government and the people of Democratic Kampuchea  to welcome the admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations. Its accession to independence  its membership in ASEAN and the general esteem it enjoys enable it to make a valuable contribution to the maintenance of peace and security in that region of the world and in the Pacific. We wish its eminent sovereign  Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah  and the people of Brunei peace  happiness and prosperity  and we assure them of our determination to develop ties of friendship and cooperation between our two peoples  our two nations and our two Governments.168.	Finally  it is my duty and my privilege  on behalf of my Government and our people  to pay a warm tribute and offer heartfelt thanks to all the countries that have given shelter to Khmer refugees. First among these is the Kingdom of Thailand  which since the early days of our misfortunes has generously opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of our compatriots who have sought refuge on its territory. Many of them later found other countries of asylum  but Thailand is still housing about a hundred thousand of them and at present is receiving groups of hundreds of fugitives who have fled from zones controlled by the enemy. The protection accorded by the Kingdom of Thailand to our refugees is not only costly to it but also dangerous sometimes  when Vietnamese forces infiltrate its territory or bomb it. That neighbouring Kingdom has shown us exemplary compassion and solidarity  thereby winning our undying gratitude.169.	I should like also to thank the many more distant nations which have given asylum and assistance to tens of thousands of Khmer refugees  enabling them to build  often with their families  decent and peaceful new lives. We owe undying gratitude to those nations which took pity on our unfortunate people and treated as brothers all those who sought refuge in their territories.170.	Many countries  Governments and peoples  international bodies  associations  groups and even private individuals have given our people humanitarian aid which is greatly appreciated. Others have given us essential diplomatic and material assistance m our struggle for national liberation. On behalf of the Government and people of Democratic Kampuchea  I wish to express my deepest gratitude to ail those great and generous friends of Cambodia.171.	This year  our liberation struggle has scored new successes in the battlefield. Since the beginning of the last dry season  our armed forces have increased their activities and intensified their attacks in the centre of the country  particularly in the provinces surrounding the Tonle Sap (the Great Lake)  a region of great strategic and economic importance. It is  in fact  a junction of railways  roads and waterways  whereby the enemy supplies its units stationed in the northwest and the west  near the border of Thailand. Our resistance forces have waged fierce battles  harassing the enemy and destroying many depots of military supplies  up to the heart of the provincial towns of Battambang  Siem Reap  Kompong Thom and Pursat.172.	As a result of our constant attacks on the railway lines and roads  up to Tonle Sap  more than two thirds of the enemy supply convoys have been dispersed or destroyed. A large part of the ""rice granary"" of Battambang province has been freed from Vietnamese control  causing serious supply problems for the occupying forces and reducing almost to nothing the rice levy that they have tried to charge in order to benefit Viet Nam itself  whose economic difficulties  as is well known  are considerable.173.	Viet Nam had thought that it had found a solution to its setbacks by carrying out the large scale installation of Vietnamese ""peasant soldiers"" on the best lands of Kampuchea. Foreign observers who managed to visit the so-called People's Kampuchea led by the puppet team of Mr. Heng Samrin  under tighter and tighter control of Hanoi's cadres  have reported that the process of pure and simple colonization of Cambodia has reached a very alarming degree.174.	It has been reported by reliable witnesses that almost half of the inhabitants of our capital  Phnom Penh  are now Vietnamese and that  in some regions under Vietnamese control  the occupiers have established purely Vietnamese zones in which most of the ""settlers"" are armed and participate in suppressing the resistance activities of the Khmer patriots.175.	This policy  favoured by some hundreds of Mr. Heng Samrin's followers  who have become mere collaborators with the enemy  imposes the compulsory teaching of the Vietnamese language in schools and the use of Vietnamese at all levels of the puppet administration  and promotes mixed marriages. The thousand year history of Kampuchea has been outrageously distorted by the new masters so that schoolchildren learn how to feel as members of the ""Great Viet Nam""  that is  of the ""IndoChinese Federation"" conceived by Ho Chi Minh.176.	The famous French naturalist and ethnologist  Marie Alexandrine Martin  a researcher at the National Centre for Scientific Research  author of several authoritative books on Cambodia  contributed a very valuable study to the review Politique Internationale in the summer of 1984  entitled ""The Process of the Vietnamization of Cambodia""  which all those who are interested in the problems of our country would do well to read. She pointed out  in particular  that in 1982 ""the maritime borders were shifted to the detriment of Cambodia"" and that in July 1983 a ""treaty on the solution to the border problems between the two countries"" was signed by the leaders of Hanoi and their puppets in Phnom Penh.177.	She recalled that another text recognizes the existing borders  but it considers a ""new delimitation of the land borders""; corrections to the borderlines have already been made  particularly in the province of Svay Rieng  the Parrot Beak district.178.	According to witnesses  and thanks to the prevailing influence of their representatives in Kampuchea  the Vietnamese freely cross over into Kampuchea and settle there. On the basis of their own findings and of considerable reliable testimony by Khmer refugees  foreign observers estimate the present number of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia to be 500 000 or 600 000. At a meeting in Phnom Penh attended by high level administrative cadres  the heads of districts and provincial communes learned of a decree (prakas) specifying that the Khmers must ""share their lands with the Vietnamese civilians  help them to settle down and to build their houses""; otherwise they would be imprisoned for anti-Vietnamese activities. There have therefore been many incidents  and many Khmer civilians have fled into the maquis or to Thailand.179.	Mrs. Martin stated that some Vietnamese civilians  particularly those who speak Khmer as a result of having lived in Cambodia  ""have already taken Cambodian nationality and can pass themselves off as Khmers . . . They  of course  have the right to vote."" She added that the Phnom Penh leaders  as reported by many officials who escaped  do not even have the pretence of authority. They encounter ""the inertia of the Khmers  who are less and less willing to cooperate with the occupiers and are more and more sympathetic to those who are offering resistance"". The number of Vietnamese advisers in the administration has ""doubled"". Mrs. Martin concluded: ""The people of Kampuchea  who have undergone all kinds of humiliation and repression  are admirable for their dignity in the test of strength which is now going on.""180.	The correspondent of The Washington Post in Bangkok  confirming this information a few months ago in a dispatch to Japan Times  stressed the growing resentment of the Khmers inside the country against the Vietnamese occupiers. The Vietnamese have aroused the aversion of the people because of the lack of discipline of their troops and the increasingly large settlement of Vietnamese in the provinces of Kampuchea. Last year  according to that journalist  15 000 Khmers fled to Thailand as a result of a ""purge"" by the occupiers  the provincial administration and the military forces of Heng Samrin.!81. The correspondent of  The Washington Post stated that whereas the Vietnamese and the puppets in their service stated that only 56 000 Vietnamese had settled in Kampuchea since 1979  Western diplomats gave the figure of 200 000 to 400 000  and the resistance movements gave the figure of 500 000 to 600 000.182.	For his part  Mr. Sek Yen  an important personality of the Heng Samrin regime  former Deputy Director of the Political and Propaganda School of the regime  fled to Thailand with 15 members of his family and was transferred to Bangkok.183.	Sek Yen revealed in a press conference that most of the Khmer senior officials were married to Vietnamese women  who met once a week and reported on the activities of their husbands to the Vietnamese authorities in Phnom Penh. The children born of those marriages had been sent to study in Viet Nam.184.	With regard to Vietnamese influence in Cambodia  Sek Yen said that from the central administration down to the lowest levels  ""all decisions were made by the Vietnamese. The home of every Kampuchea official  or of those who want to please the occupiers  must have a portrait of Ho Chi Minh displayed in a prominent place.""185.	He stressed also that ""ordinary Cambodians are starting to find ways to support the (anti-Vietnamese) resistance forces"". Sek Yen concluded that the Khmers ""are increasingly supporting the Coalition Government  because they want to eliminate the Vietnamese and liberate their country  a task they believe to be possible"".186.	I felt that I should sum up the remarks of Mrs. Martin  a real expert on our problems  whose intellectual independence is beyond doubt  and of Sek Yen  a personality of the pro-Vietnamese regime of Heng Samrin who fled his country in protest against the Vietnamese domination of Cambodia  which has been reduced to bondage by the Hanoi Government.187.	It is interesting to note that  unlike almost all foreign observers and journalists who have been able to penetrate Vietnamese-controlled Kampuchea  some persons still repeat the propaganda themes of the Vietnamese  to the effect that the Phnom Penh regime is desired and supported by the whole Khmer people and that the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea is rejected by everyone. So that international public opinion can judge the validity of that statement  I repeat a proposal I have been submitting for several years nowâthat is  that after the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  general elections under strict United Nations supervision be organized in my country  elections in which all parties and political groupings  including the Heng Samrin team  could freely participate. This democratic suggestion should have been taken up right away by the Heng Samrin government and its Vietnamese allies. It was a golden opportunity  since the Khmer people  according to them  would vote massively in favour of the present Phnom Penh leaders  getting rid once and for all of the three component parts of the resistance. Crushed and laminated by a vote of the people supervised by the United Nationsâand therefore with irrefutable resultsâthe resistance groups would simply have to leave Khmer soil and reflect upon the humiliating defeat in exile.188.	Unfortunately  neither Phnom Penh nor Hanoi wanted to hear of any such free elections  nor do they want to hear of them now.189.	I would add that the very logical and reasonable proposals that I have presented over the years have had no more success; they have been met with the same categorical refusal. For example  in order to pave the way to the reconstruction of our countryâ three quarters of which has been destroyed by warâI suggested the creation of a government of national reconciliation  through the inclusion in the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea of all the other Kampuchean parties that would agree to work for an independent  neutral and nonaligned Kampuchea.190.	This government of national reconciliation would become a member of ASEAN  with the status of a neutral  nonaligned State  in order to prove to the Vietnamese and their great Soviet friends that a reconciled Kampuchea would not be part of the so called Chinese threat  about which Viet Nam pretends to be so concerned.191.	It is clear that  for the time being  Viet Nam and its allies reject any political solution to the problem of Kampuchea. That is shown by the recent Vietnamese proposal to embark on so-called unconditional talks between the ASEAN countries and the IndoChinese Statesâalias the Vietnamese Indo Chinese Federation. In fact  this Hanoi proposal  which some people describe as a breakthrough  seeks merely to bury the five resolutions of the General Assembly on the situation in Kampuchea and to recognize the Vietnamese fait accomplis in Kampuchea  and therefore the Vietnamese IndoChinese Federation  consisting of one master and two servants.192.	And yet our armed resistance is gaining ground. It has more than 60 000 combatants  better armed  equipped and trained and with a better experience of war and a higher degree of patriotic motivationâas is shown in the courageous raids  mostly successful  throughout the national territory.193.	On the other hand  the Vietnamese offensives  ill supported by Khmer adolescents who have been forcibly conscripted into Heng Samrin's paltry units  have doubtless done much harm to our civilian compatriots in the liberated zones  but they have not succeeded in imperilling our combatantsâstill less in winning back those zones.194.	No matter how loudly the Vietnamese proclaim that the situation in Kampuchea is irreversible  the fact is that  quite to the contrary  it is on the point of being reversed. Militarily  our position is gradually improving. We are striking back and are often taking the initiative  vigorously and with determination. Politically  as the best observers have confirmed  the people inside the country  despite their understandable desire to live in peace  are clearly siding  in their hatred of the Vietnamese occupiersâthe masters of so-called People's Kampucheaâwith our Coalition Government. The soil is getting hot under the feet of the enemy  which thought it could make short shrift of little Cambodia.195.	Diplomatically  finally  our legitimate Government is becoming better understood and supported by nations that are committed to independence and justice and that  in fact  make up the overwhelming majority of the United Nations. I have seen this myself on the scene  during my many trips in Asia  Africa and Europe  where I have received the most understanding and encouraging welcome everywhere.196.	The intensification of our struggle in Kampuchea  as well as the increasing support by the international community  will not failâin the not too distant future  I hopeâto bring Viet Nam to its senses and make it participate in an international conference on Kampuchea.197.	That is clearly in the interest of Viet Nam itself  which has been suffering more than would appear because of its condemnation by the highest international forums  and also by most of the Powers that were its friends and allies when it was courageously defending its right to self-determination and reunification. Need I recall that among those friendly nations  Cambodia  of which I was Head of State  was in the forefront.198.	I would stress also that our Coalition Government is not  as it is sometimes reproached with being  a Government in exile. Its Ministers work all the time in the liberated areas  to which I pay regular visits to assist the people there  to inspect our combatants and to receive the credentials of diplomatic envoys of friendly Powers.199.	We have every reason for hope  if we can safeguard our national union now and in the future. That is the basic factor in the survival of our nation and the preservation of our national identity.200.	Our overriding duty now is to devote all our forces to the patriotic union  without which our struggle would be futile. I note that all the component parts of our Coalition Government have become aware of this need and place the salvation of the homeland before any other consideration. It gives me the greatest pleasure to see the failure of our enemies to sow division within our coalition.201.	We Khmers know full well that the Vietnamese are our neighbours and will be so for all time. It is a warlike  expansionist  ambitious race  with which we have often had difficulties in living in peace. Its leaders are  however  on great occasions capable of realism. They have demonstrated that in recent decades in their dealings with the United States. They probably know when not to go too far. Their domestic situation  particularly the economic situation  is becoming increasingly difficult  and the people of South Viet Nam are not really committedâto put it mildlyâto the ideology and austerity of the North.202.	With regard to Kampuchea  the Hanoi leaders no longer have any illusions: they know that their Phnom Penh puppets obey them only reluctantly and have no authority over the populace which  humiliated daily  is alienated by their excesses. Thanks to the courageous action of our resistance forces  Kampuchea will never be the rice granary coveted by North Viet Nam to alleviate its food shortages. This war has taken a heavy toll: many lives have been lost  human resources that should have been devoted to the development of Viet Nam have been diverted to the military; it has sapped the economy of Viet Nam and its international prestige.203.	That anachronistic colonialist policy cannot go on foreverâunless Viet Nam has a suicide mission or wants to make sacrifices totally out of proportion with the benefits for which it hopes from this failed operation.204.	If the adversary can heed the voice of reason  we propose to end this age-old hostility. If it withdraws from our territory  we offer to develop with it and its allies of the moment  and with all countries of the world  relations of friendship and cooperation based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence  in equality  mutual respect and common interest. The Kampuchea that we build will be independent  neutral  nonaligned  no one's enemy  and friend of all who wish it well. How could it disturb Viet Namâa country of 52 million inhabitantsâwhich is so militarily powerful?205.	Thus far  the Vietnamese have left us no alternative but to fight them. We sincerely hope that they will soon realize the need to negotiate with the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea and understand that there would be no humiliation involved in establishing between our two peoples relations based on justice  wisdom and equity.206.	As a Member of the United Nations  Democratic Kampuchea  through the voice of its delegation  would like in conclusion to state the following.207.	First  we reiterate our cordial solidarity with our brothers and sisters of Laos  themselves victims of Vietnamese domination  in their just struggle for the independence and freedom of their homeland.208.	Secondly  we reiterate our abiding support for the ongoing efforts of the Korean people to reunify their homeland. We firmly support the just proposals of President Kim Il Sung for an independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.209.	Thirdly  our support and solidarity go also to the Afghan people struggling against the Soviet invasion. We wish the heroic Afghan combatants fresh victories until the Soviet forces withdraw  so the Afghan people can exercise its inalienable right freely to choose its Government and its economic and social system.210.	Fourthly  we continue our firm support of the Palestinian people in its efforts  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  to recover its legitimate national rights  including the right to found an independent State on its territoryâ the only way to bring about a lasting peace in the Middle East.211.	Fifthly  in the same hope  we welcome the establishment of a government of national union in Lebanon. It is essential that all foreign forces withdraw from that martyred country so that it can once again find its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.212.	Sixthly  we urge two fraternal neighbours  Iraq and Iran  to end the escalation of the war between them; we support any measures that could bring about a peaceful settlement of that conflict.213.	Seventhly  we reiterate our total support for the African liberation movements  in particular the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the sole  legitimate representative of the popular struggle of the Namibian patriots  for the withdrawal of the present illegal Administration and the transfer of power to the Namibian people  with United Nations assistance.214.	Eighthly  we support the efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the countries of the Horn of Africa to restore peace and stability in the region. We reiterate our solidarity with the Somali people in defending their independence and territorial integrity.215.	Ninthly  we support the efforts of the people and the Government of Chad to defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.216.	Finally  we support the initiatives of the countries of the Contadora Group to eliminate the tension prevailing in Central America and the Caribbean and to bring about the freedom and independence of all States of the region."
"78",3869,"KWT",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a pleasure for the delegation of the State of Kuwait to see you presiding over and conducting the affairs of this session  in view of your renowned vast experience in United Nations affairs  as well as your prudence and knowledge. You represent Zambia  a friendly country to which we are linked by the closest ties. You also represent the continent of Africa  to which the Arab world is linked with one destiny and common interests. We are confident that success will be yours in your great task.179.	I am pleased also to commend your predecessor  Mr. Illueca  the President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of that session and for the success he achieved.180.	The Secretary General has shown understanding and wisdom in dealing with the thorny international issues which have been and still are present on the international political scene. He deserves all the appreciation and support of my delegation.181.	Whenever Kuwait sees a new State join tin. United Nations  its conviction of the importance of the Organization and its Charter in influencing international relations is reaffirmed. The delegation of Kuwait therefore congratulates Brunei Darussalam on its admission to the United Nations and hopes that its membership will provide new impetus for the role and the effectiveness of the Organization.182.	As the world Organization prepares to commemorate its fortieth anniversary  we think that this occasion offers an opportunity for all of us to make an objective and realistic evaluation of the extent of the success and the failure of the United Nations and to restate the goals and ideals cherished by its founders and enshrined in its Charter  particularly the noble goal that the United Nations should become the centre of harmony among its Members in their pursuit of common goalsâthe stabilization of peace  security and prosperity in the world. 183.	In making this evaluation  we find ourselves face to face with the increasing awareness that the United Nations has not yet succeeded in becoming a centre of harmony and coexistence and that the gap has widened between the high principles of the Charter and the troubled status quo. When considering what is causing this  it is fair to say that the United Nations is but a stage on which we  the Member States  play our roles. Consequently  when the United Nations fails to implement the provisions of its Charter and execute its own resolutions  we have to look to ourselves for the answer. We  the Member States  have to harmonize our positions and our actions  and respect the provisions of the Charter without distortion or hesitation.184.	Against this discouraging picture of the realistic role of the United Nations  Kuwait sees that the time has come for us to take steps to avoid the deep abyss towards which we are headed and to realize sincerely that for us  the small nations in particular  the United Nations is the sole instrument capable of warding off the spectre of chaos and war in the world. We also think it is time for the Security Council members  especially the permanent members  to shoulder their responsibility for the establishment of peace and security in the world. This responsibility is primarily a collective one  since the Council members are answerable to the international community for the way in which they exercise their powers.185.	We also are of the opinion that emphasis and priority should be accorded to the Secretary Generalâs mission of preventive diplomacy so as to avert exacerbation of crises  contain conflicts and build bridges of understanding and trust among the parties concerned. Furthermore  we feel that the efforts of the secretary General to improve the efficiency of the work of the Organization itself through the introduction of carefully studied administrative reforms in the organizational structure and the optimum utilization of the available financial and human resources should be increased.186.	Our realistic evaluation of the role of the United Nations and our expectations thereof should not overshadow the constructive role played by the specialized agencies in the humanitarian  economic  cultural and technical programmes that they provide over a limitless geographical area  particularly in the developing countries.187.	The international situation is characterized by the gravity of dangers resulting from the threat or use of force under the cover of security  retaliation or preventive measures. Armament in all its forms is increasing at a time when hunger  disease  poverty and illiteracy are rampant all over the world. We also view with concern the quantitative and qualitative increase in terrorist operations  which destroy values and principles that have become established in international relations.188.	We realize that force  whatever its nature  cannot settle conflictsâin most cases it tends to inflame them or widen their scopeâand that armament  however inflated and diversified  will never be a source of security or stability.189.	When we speak of the devastating impact of the use of force and violence in international relations we usually do so because we have been suffering painfully for over four years in the course of which our region has been afflicted with a war of destruction which has exhausted its human and economic resources. That war has continued despite the intensive effortsâindividual  regional and internationalâwhich started with the war itself and which aimed at stopping or checking the war. None  however  has been successful. On the contrary  our region has unfortunately witnessed an intensification of this sinister war  which has brought to the Arabian Gulf  long noted for being a region of security and stability and an artery of wellbeing and prosperity for the world economy  threats to its safety and tranquillity and has increased its exposure to an international rivalry over spheres of influence  at the expense of the interests and future of the peoples of the region.190.	The Gulf Cooperation Council had to appeal to the Security Council following Iran's threat to the freedom of navigation in the Gulf and attacks on Kuwaiti and Saudi ships  as well as those of other countries  outside the war zone. In so doing we were prompted by our belief in three basic principles: that there is the need to bolster the role of the world Organization in solving problems which threaten international security; that force  of whatever proportion  can never be a substitute for peace and coexistence among the peoples of a region and that problems  no matter how acute  can be solved through dialogue and consensus in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.191.	The Security Council has adopted many resolutions calling for the cessation of war between the two countries and expressing its adherence to the basic principles that should govern international relations  including resolution 552 (1984)  which  inter alia reaffirms the right of free navigation in that important and vital waterway and calls upon Iran to refrain from any act that may impede freedom of navigation in the Gulf to and from the ports of countries not parties to the conflict.192.	But unfortunately and to our deep regret  Iran  scornful of the will of the international community made manifest during the Council's deliberations  has chosen to pursue its perilous course. It has continued to interfere with freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf. Once again we reiterate from this rostrum that the politico economic importance of the Gulf area  as well as its strategic and security situation  makes it imperative that its waters  ports and shores be a symbol of stability and tranquillity  because if its stability is subjected to turbulence and chaos  its tranquillity to attacks  and its freedom of navigation to and from States not parties to the conflict to interference  the interests of the nations of the world will be seriously affected and  in particular  the movement and growth of the world economy will be dealt a big setback.193.	In spite of these conditions  we are still hopeful that neighbouring Muslim Iran will appreciate the reality of these apprehensions and dispel them by adopting a courageous and prudent decision to put an end to this devastating war so that we  the peoples of that important region  will be able once again to live in harmony and concord  guided by the teachings of our divine Islamic religion  which advocates love  reconciliation  good neighbourliness and the avoidance of hostility  hatred and war.194.	We reiterate our gratification at the acceptance by our fraternal country Iraq of the international efforts to reach a just and honourable conclusion to this war. We wish that the leaders of Iran would spare the region further anguish and destruction  the extent of which is known only to Allahâglory be to Himâ by responding positively to these sincere and unbiased initiatives  in which I had the honour of personally participating on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council. All peace-loving countries call upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond favourably to these initiatives so that peace may be restored to the Gulf.193. The entire international community is also called upon to take serious and active action in this field. We do not ask anyone to take the side of one party against another. What is required is a clear stand against the continuation of war and on behalf of peace. We are convinced that there is no room today for indifference. If some Powers believe that the continuation of the war would be advantageous to them  we wish to advise them that those advantages would be short-lived and meagre  while the damage would be long-lasting and bitter. Kuwait feels that all mankind has a direct interest in seeing an end to this devastating war and the beginning of an era of reconstruction.196.	Kuwait unwaveringly believes that the basic function of all international and regional organizations and bodies should be to embody the identity of interests and the common destiny of their member countries  as well as to promote solidarity and coordination among them. We Arabs have realized that; hence the League of Arab States has been the first organization  in this politically historic era  to crystallize all the aims pursued by the international community. Since its establishment  the Gulf Cooperation Council  a subsidiary of the League of Arab States  has demonstrated to the world that it is a live and creative expression of that reality  since the Council now effectively participates in expediting the process of coherence and coordination among the peoples of the Arabian Gulf  to the extent that it has increased the significance of the role played by those countries in the fields of economic development  world security and political stability.197.	We adhere to the following basic principles: self-sufficiency  so as to maintain the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and vita! interests of the States of the region; maintenance of regional security and stability by the States of the region  not by any outside party; and commitment to the policy of nonalignment based on rejection of the policy of alliances and polarization and of the great Powers' race for spheres of influence.198.	In November  Kuwait will have the honour of being host to the fifth summit meeting of the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council. That meeting will solidify the structure of the Council and strengthen its commitment to the principles espoused by the States of the region and reflected in the Council's charter  thus increasing the possibilities for stability  cooperation and development among the peoples of those countries.199.	Several conflicts impose a heavy burden on the international community and have a negative effect on international relations. Some occupy the attention of the international community for only a short time. But there is one problem that has for more than 35 years directly and perilously threatened world peace and securityânamely  the tragedy of the people of Palestine  which is at the heart of the conflict m the Middle East.200.	This tragedy is a dangerous threat to the basic principles on which the United Nations :s founded  since it involves a denial of the rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's use of force and pursuit of a policy of repression  aggression  expansion and encroachment upon the sovereignty of the Arab nation and the integrity of its soil. We therefore feel that the elimination of this policy and the establishment of international legitimacy are basic duties of the United Nations.201.	Hence  Kuwait supported the holding of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  at Geneva in 1983  in pursuance of General Assembly resolution 36/120 C. We were pleased that many of the major parties to the conflict agreed to participate in me Conference  as an expression of their interest in having international legitimacy  represented by the United Nations  presiding over the solution of this thorny question. We were  on the other hand  disappointed by the continued refusal of Israel  the United States and some other Western countries to accept this international framework for action based on the spirit of justice and fairness. We cannot accept the reasons advanced by the Western countries to justify their refusal to participate in the Conference  because it has become the firm conviction of the international community that the PLO is the sole  authentic and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  that any solution reached without the participation of the PLO  on an equal footing with the other parties  would be a mirage  and that to seek such a solution would be to go in a vicious circle.202.	Kuwait also welcomes the initiative of the Soviet Union  which has submitted proposals on a Middle East settlement  including the convening of an international conference in which all the parties  including the PLO  would participate on an equal footing.203.	We are still convinced that the basis for a just and comprehensive solution of the question of Palestine is total Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab territory occupied since 1967  including Holy Jerusalem  and the safeguarding of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and the establishment of its own State on its national soil.204.	No one should be surprised that Israel rejects any initiative  whether regional or international  for solving the Palestinian problem. Israel is a State whose method is aggression and whose philosophy is expansion. Therefore  it depends on violence and the imposition of one new status quo after anotherâ from the annexation of Holy Jerusalem to the annexation of the Golan Heights  from the continuation of the process of Judaization of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the invasion of Lebanon and the occupation of part of its territory.205.	Israel's criminal record has extended to include inhuman practices in southern Lebanon. The Security Council recently considered those practices which are causing the Lebanese people suffering. All the Security Council members agreed in calling upon Israel to cease forthwith those practices and to apply elementary principles of human rightsâall but the United States  which surprised the international community by using its veto power to defeat that humanitarian draft resolution  It put forward pre texts that cannot stand scrutiny in the light of the justice of the cause and explanations that cannot justify prolonging the unjust situation experienced daily by southern Lebanon at the hands of the Israeli invaders and occupiers.206.	The Security Council had passed resolution 509 (1982)  in which it demanded that Israel withdraw all its military forces forthwith and unconditionally from Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries. But Israel  relying on the complete support of the United States for its policies and practices  has ignored that resolution  like all other resolutions  and has continued in its arrogance at the expense of the Palestinian and Lebanese people.207.	Kuwait is concerned about the stabilization of conditions in Lebanon and the restoration to that country of a normal  healthy life  so that it may continue its advance towards civilization and give the world a living example of coexistence between various sects and doctrines. We therefore support all the Lebanese efforts aimed at enhancing the spirit of national unity and reconciliation and at renouncing everything that may divide the people of that country. We appeal to the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel to desist immediately from rekindling the flames of discord and to withdraw to the internationally recognized boundaries.208.	The world today is experiencing a real tragedy because of the increase in hotbeds of tension  the disregard shown by the great Powers  which are influential internationally  of the desires of the peoples  and their persistence in using pretexts to interfere in the affairs of other countries in an effort to gain a foothold or to acquire an ally by force.209.	The people of Afghanistan has been suffering for four years under a puppet regime backed by Soviet forces. Tremendous international efforts have been made to alleviate the suffering of that peaceful Muslim people. While commending all those efforts  we think that all the parties concerned in the Afghan problem should refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of that independent country  aid the Afghan refugees to return to the country and allow the people to determine its own destiny as it sees fit after the foreign forces have withdrawn from its territory.210.	The effects of the situation in Afghanistan are not limited to that country and its people. It also threatens peace and stability in the border areas of Pakistan  where there are more than 1 million Afghan refugees.211.	The situation in Kampuchea  whose people is deprived of its right to choose the kind of regime it desires  has not changed. The time has come for all foreign interference in Kampuchea to cease and for this friendly people to resume the exercise of its natural right to a decent and free life.212.	The Cyprus problem is also at a crossroads after the recent developments. Kuwait feels that Turkish and Greek Cypriots should have recourse to the basic principles of resolving conflicts through serious and constructive negotiations. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary General. We believe that they constitute the right way to reach a just solution taking into account the legitimate rights of the two communities  while at the same time guaranteeing the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and nonaligned character of Cyprus.213.	The region of Central America and the Caribbean Sea is one of considerable tension because of intervention by the great Powers  which unfortunately are concerned only with gaining a foothold there to enable them to achieve their objectives of polarization and spheres of influence. Kuwait supports all regional efforts initiated by the Contadora Group to arrive at a political solution based on respect for the basic options of each country in the region.214.	The United Nations has been entrusted with the historic task of worldwide decolonization. However  a black spot remains on the map because of South Africa's refusal;  in spite of the international will  to respect the legitimate national rights of the Namibian people and because of its policies of racial discrimination and	âthat ugly blot on twentieth century civilization.215.	The United Nations adopted  in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  a plan characterized by prudence  moderation and non-bias for ensuring the independence of Namibia. However  the great Powers have elected to involve the fate of the Namibian people  despite its bitter struggle  in the international equation and the policy of confrontation between East and West. The Namibian people and SWAPO  its sole  legitimate representative  have been condemned to pay the price of rivalry and conflict that are not their concern. Kuwait reiterates its support for the United Nations plan  which comprises the ideal framework for a settlement that has comprehensive international approval.216.	Kuwait also strongly condemns the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid practised by the racist regime of South Africa against the black majority  the legitimate inhabitants of that land. The latest manifestation of that policy is the imposition of a contrived ""constitution"" which consolidates white minority rule and denies the legitimate rights of the overwhelming majority of South Africa's population.217.	The world economic situation is no better than the tense international political situation. It is our conviction that this is a result of the continuing connection between politics and economics. Both the rapidity and the scope of the deterioration of the world economic situation have assumed tragic dimensions. The most outstanding issue in this connection is that of the developing countries' indebtedness  which constitutes one of the most dangerous problems of the age. That indebtedness totals over $800 billion  and its annual servicing rate is $150 billion. It is easy to imagine the negative repercussions of that situation on development efforts in the developing countries.218.	Kuwait believes that economic cooperation among developing countries is the cornerstone of their efforts to achieve the economic growth and prosperity necessary for the attainment of the goals of self-sufficiency and freedom from dependence on the industrialized countries and subjugation to the conditions they impose on the developing countries in order to perpetuate the present in national economic order  with all the ills and deprivation this causes for the developing countries. We therefore support all well-thought-out  practical and reasonable measures to strengthen and consolidate cooperation among developing countries  for we believe that such cooperation is the first essential and the basic precondition that must be met if the developing countries are to strengthen their economic situation. There is no doubt that when we reduce our economic dependence on the industrialized countries we shall strengthen our negotiating position vis-a-vis them in the efforts to change the present international economic order.219.	Kuwait believes that to be useful and effective this economic cooperation among the developing countries should be based on principles and measures that will ensure mutual benefit and promote the common interests of the participating countries.220.	We continue to believe that the industrialized countries are the root cause of the economic problems of the third world. Therefore  the responsibility for providing or increasing the resources and assistance needed by the developing countries falls  in the first place  upon the shoulders of the industrialized countries. Nor can we relieve the industrialized countries of their financial responsibility towards the developing countries.221.	The developing countries should not take any measures or make any arrangements in the field of economic cooperation that could lead to lessening the responsibility of the industrialized countries. We believe that one way we can ensure that this does not happen is by emphasizing the need for the continuance of the North South dialogue so as to achieve the establishment of a new international economic order.222.	In spite of the large reduction in its revenues owing to fluctuations in the world oil market  the production recession and the increase in its requirements  Kuwait will continue to do its best to honour its obligations with regard to aid to the developing countries.223.	Mankind is more in need today for an approach that will open up shining horizons for the achievement of its dreams. On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations we are more hopeful of its ability to lead us to the shores of security so that together we can enjoy a state of wellbeing and peace  while adhering to the letter and the spirit of the Charter."
"79",3915,"LAO",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  I should like first to congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with the active participation of all delegations and under the wise guidance of the President  an experienced diplomat from Zambia  the work of this session will lead to concrete results in many areas.206.	I should also like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  on the excellent manner in which he fulfilled his mandate.207.	The Lao delegation would like in particular to praise the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to promote the equitable and effective achievement of the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security.208.	The Lao delegation welcomes the admission of Brunei Darussalam  a country from the same region as ours  as the 159th Member of the United Nations.209.	This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international situation is tense and when there is an acceleration of the arms race carried out by the major imperialist country  on land  in the oceans and in outer space.210.	In many parts of Asia  Africa and Latin America  the war of aggression  direct or indirect  undertaken by the imperialists  the war of destruction and of territorial annexation which is being waged by the expansionists  and the policy of brutal oppression of the racial discrimination regime  the instrument of the imperialists  have been gaining ground  thus infringing the independence and territorial integrity of several countries and threatening the right of those peoples to exist.211.	At the same time  in the economic field there is a further widening of the gap between the developed capitalist countries and the developing countries. The North-South negotiations are simply marking time now. The economic crisis  the exploitation and plundering of resources and the restrictive trade practices and protectionist measures applied by the capitalist countries have all placed the developing countries in an increasingly difficult situation. However  the overall picture is far from being a completely dark one  for the time when imperialism  expansionism and international reaction had absolute power is gone for ever.212.	Today  more than ever before  the movements in support of disarmament and against nuclear war are developing rapidly  as they were last year. They are involving millions of people from all social strata and in all continents in a great effort of solidarity to crush the warlike manoeuvres of the imperialists and to achieve a lasting peace on our planet.213.	The Lao delegation considers it essential to improve international relations  in particular the relations between the major countries which have a determining role in reducing the danger of confrontation.214.	Against this background  the Lao delegation firmly supports the consistent policy of peace  a policy of principle  of the Soviet Union  which has undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. We believe that the proposal of the Soviet Union to include in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly an item entitled ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"" demonstrates that country's sense of responsibility with respect to the future of mankind. Accordingly  we fully approve and support the reasonable and realistic proposals made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with a view to achieving disarmament and the limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons  as well as the various strong measures designed to prevent acts of war provoked by imperialism and international reaction and to ensure the peace and security of peoples.215.	The Lao delegation fully supports the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic to conclude a treaty of non-aggression and non-use of force in relations among the countries of Asia and the Pacific and its proposal relating to the right of peoples to peace  submitted at this session of the General Assembly. By its activities in support of international peace and co-operation  the Mongolian People's Republic is indeed a good candidate for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.216.	The Lao delegation supports the countries of the region of the Indian Ocean which call for the dismantling of the United States military bases on Diego Garcia and making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.217.	The Lao delegation supports the Joint Declaration of the Heads of State of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  addressed to the five nuclear-weapon States. We welcome the favourable response made to that proposal by the Soviet Union.218.	From its own historical experiences  the Lao people clearly recognizes that real peace can be achieved only in true independence and freedom. Thus  the bold struggle of the peoples of the world against the policy of interference  aggression and exploitation by imperialism and international reaction and in support of social progress is an integral part of their struggle for peace and security.219.	The Lao delegation fully supports the just struggle of the Palestinian Arab people  under the leadership of the PLO  its authentic representative  to regain their basic national right to self-determination  including the right to establish their own State in Palestine. We support the Lebanese people and other peoples of the Arab countries in their struggle against the aggression of the Israeli Zionists and interference by the United States. In this connection  we support the proposals made by the Soviet Union on 29 July 1984 with regard to an overall just and lasting solution to the question of the Middle East.220.	In Central America and the Caribbean  despite enormous difficulties and deprivations  the heroic peoples of Cuba and Nicaragua are able victoriously to defend their independence  sovereignty and illustrious social regimes. And the people of El Salvador  Guatemala  Puerto Rico  Grenada  Honduras  Costa Rica  Chile and other Latin American countries will without any doubt be able to defeat the policy of interference pursued by the United States imperialists  to overthrow military dictatorship and to defend their right to a free and independent existence.221.	We fully support the struggle of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia  under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa and SWAPO  respectively. We support the struggle of the peoples of Angola and Mozambique against the aggression and Machiavellian manoeuvres  the di- vide-and-rule tactics  of the racist administration of South Africa.222.	The Lao people fully supports the struggle of the Afghan people against the undeclared war unleashed by imperialism and international reaction and in defence of what they had achieved through their April revolution.223.	We also lend our support to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its struggle to achieve the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and to ensure the peaceful unification of Korea.224.	In the world today  the problems of international economic relations are the focus of the concern of many developing countries  particularly the Lao People's Democratic Republic  a small  land-locked country  one of the least developed.225.	We believe that it is imperative to bring about a radical reform of current international economic relations and to establish a new international economic order that is more just and more democratic. In this connection  the Lao People's Democratic Republic supports the just positions taken by the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77 relating to the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development.226.	At the present time  the situation in Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly tense. The escalation of the war undertaken by the Chinese expansionists along the Chinese-Vietnamese borders in April 1984 was an extremely dangerous occurrence  the most dangerous since the war of aggression waged by Chinese troops against Viet Nam in February 1979. The overt armed intervention by the extreme right- wing Thai reactionaries along the border between Thailand and Kampuchea to save the genocidal Pol Pot clique and the other Khmer reactionaries from their total defeat was also the most serious event to have occurred over the past five years; and the fact that they have sent in regular troops to commit acts of aggression and occupy three areas of Laos is the most serious occurrence since the creation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.227.	It is clear that all this benefits the Chinese expansionists and the extreme-right reactionaries in leading Thai circles in carrying out their policy  one that is directly hostile to the three peoples of IndoChina  in instigating confrontation between the countries members of ASEAN and the three countries of Indo-China  and in interfering with the movement towards dialogue between those two groups of countries  thereby creating tension and undermining peace and stability in the region. Their accusations against Viet Nam and the Soviet Union will in no way succeed in misleading world public opinion.228.	As is well known  the question of South-East Asia has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for nearly five years. It is indeed deplorable that the United Nations should have adopted so erroneous a decision as to have seated here the genocidal political corpse of the Pol Pot clique  alongside masked members of that clique  for that is in fact a denial of the Kampuchean people's right to rebirth and to existence and self-determination  as well as a denial of the aspirations of the peoples of the region to peace.229.	The Lao people  like the peoples of Viet Nam and Kampuchea  aspires only to live in peace in order to build up its country  to build a new life and to live in peace with its neighbours  including China. Over the past five years  the three countries of IndoChina have put forward various proposals with a view to normalizing relations with the People's Republic of China and have done everything possible to promote dialogue between the two groups of countries  those of Indo-China and those of ASEAN  in order to make South-East Asia a zone of peace  stability  friendship and co-operation. Those principles  which we regard as inviolable  have been confirmed on many occasions; they are as follows: to enter into dialogue on the basis of proposals made by the Foreign Ministers of the Indo-Chinese countries  meeting at Vientiane on 28 and 29 January 1984  and the proposals advanced by the ASEAN member countries on 21 September 1983. The Indo-Chinese countries mandated Viet Nam to be their representative  and the ASEAN countries asked Indonesia to act on their behalf. We trust that this session of the General Assembly will give additional impetus to the efforts to achieve dialogue between the two groups of countries.230.	In this connection  we welcome the initiative of Australia  which has offered its capital  Canberra  as the site for a meeting between the countries of Indo-China and the ASEAN countries.231.	At this session  the Lao delegation would like to draw attention to the most serious event that has occurred in Lao-Thai relations since the founding of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. I am referring to the attack by Thai troops on three areas of Laosâ namely  Bane May  Bane Kang and Bane Savang in the Paklay District  Sayaboury Province  in the northern part of Laosâand the occupation of those areas.232.	Our Government has already informed the Secretary-General and has issued several documents  namely  the statement of 13 June 1984  the memorandum of 17 August 1984 and the declaration of 26 August 1984  the statement of 6 September 1984  and the White Book issued on 18 September 1984. Those documents set forth all the facts relating to the three localities  the truth about Thai-Lao relations past and present  and our proposals for a settlement.233.	Here I should like to refer to some aspects of the problem. First of all  the occupation of these three areas of Laos is an act of premeditated aggression. Laos and Thailand are two neighbouring countries that share a common border 1 650 kilometres long. From time immemorial  these two peoples have been united by good-neighbourly relations and linked by ties of blood and by similarities in culture  language  customs and religion.234.	The boundary between the two countries was settled by the Franco-Siamese treaties of 2 February 1904 and 23 March 1907. There has never been any boundary dispute between the two countries in these past few decades. History  law and effective administration have proved  indisputably  that these three villages  occupied by the Thai Army since 6 June 1984  come under Lao sovereignty.235.	In 1979  the two countries signed two joint declarations containing principles intended to govern relations between the two countries. Those principles were as follows: mutually to respect the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country; to respect each country's right to choose its own way of life free from outside interference or threat; not to interfere in the internal affairs of the other country  and to refrain from carrying out  directly or indirectly  hostile acts against the other; to settle differences by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of equality; and not to use force or the threat of force against the other and not to allow others to use their territory as a base to intervene  threaten or commit aggression against other countries in any manner whatsoever. Such were the terms of the joint Lao-Thai declaration of 4 April 1979.236.	The declaration reiterated that:""The two Prime Ministers agreed to make the Lao- Thai border on the river and on the land a border of peace and friendship  based on respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and legitimate interests of each and the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes between the two countries.""237.	To justify their acts of aggression  the extreme- right Thai reactionaries presented a farce whereby they claimed that Laos had sent troops to occupy three Thai villages in May and then used other subterfuges  saying that this was a ""frontier incident""  a ""border dispute""  thus covering up the cynical nature of their aggression.238.	In the attacks against the three Lao villages  the extreme-right Thai reactionaries used several infantry units  together with tanks  artillery and reconnaissance aircraft  all of which were directly commanded by General Arthit Kamlang Ek  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the Army of Thailand. In order to perpetuate their occupation of the three villages and justify their claims  they removed the frontier markers in the region and used Thai administration to replace the Lao administrative authorities. They decreed obligatory education in the Thai language  forced the Lao population to use Thai currency  increased their troops to 3 000 menâthat is  double the number of people in the villagesâstrengthened the fortifications and unilaterally and tendentiously drew up their own map of the region.239.	At the same time  in order to prepare for a further escalation of the war  they sent their troops and Lao reactionaries in exile along the frontier across from the province of Sayaboury and other provinces in Laos.240.	This was not simply a border incident and it was certainly not simply a border dispute  which is something that can happen quite often between two neighbouring countries. Rather  it was an act of premeditated aggression  violating Lao sovereignty and territorial integrity; it was a serious violation of the two joint Lao-Thai declarations; it was a provocation to confrontation in the region; and it was a violation of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. One might therefore wonder if  with such conduct  this country  a Member of the United Nations  would be a suitable nominee for non-permanent membership of the Security Council.241.	Secondly  the underlying cause of the aggression by Thai troops against the three villages in Lao is the expansionist ambition of the extreme-right Thai reactionaries  an ambition which arose out of pan-Thaiism and which enjoys the support of the Chinese expansionists  who instigated the escalation of this destructive war against the three countries of Indo-China.242.	The White Book published on 18 September 1984 by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic exposed the reality of Lao-Thai relations and the hegemonist and expansionist policy of the reactionary military circles of Thailandâformerly known as Siamâvis-a-vis Laos from the sixteenth century until the present time.243.	History clearly shows that the expansionist and hegemonist policy of the reactionary Thai leading circles vis-a-vis Laos has remained unchanged. From the sixteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century  the reactionary Siamese leading circles committed acts of aggression against  occupied  administered and annexed a large part of Lao territory. For 115 yearsâfrom 1778 to 189Jâthey made Laos a vassal State. During the Second World War  from 1941 to 1946  Thailand used the Japanese Fascists to force the French  who were in a difficult situation  to yield the two Lao provinces west of the Mekong  the provinces of Sayaboury and Champasak. During the United States war of aggression in Indo-China  the reactionaries in power in Thailand transformed their territory into a United States base and made their troops participate directly in this war against Laos and the other countries of Indo-China. From 1975 to the present time  Thailand has been a decisive bastion  a docile instrument  used by Chinese expansionism in South-East Asia as a sanctuary for the genocidal Pol Pot clique and its consorts and for other reactionary exiles from Indo-Chinese countries who came to struggle against their own people.244.	The Thai reactionaries used military pressure against the Lao People's Democratic Republic to create tension and sow the seeds of trouble. They cooperated with the Chinese in feeding  training  organizing and commanding the Lao reactionaries in exile and then in invading the three Lao villages on 6 June 1984. This act of aggression is the product of pan-Thaiism  which is coming to life again among the extreme-right Thai ruling circles.245.	Thirdly  the aggression against the three Lao villages was part of the overall struggle of the extreme-right Thai reactionaries  in collusion with the Chinese expansionists and hegemonists against Laos and the other countries of Indo-China.246.	The incident involving the three villages occurred shortly after the visit to China of General Arthit Kamlang Ek  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the Army of Thailand. He even went to the Chinese-Vietnamese border to learn from the Chinese experience of its war of aggression against Vietnamese territory. During the visit  the Chinese side declared that it would support Thailand in its aggression against the three Lao villages  an aggression which was commanded by General Arthit Kamlang Ek in person and which took place at a time when the Thais  in collusion with the Chinese  were doing everything possible to help the Pol Potists and their consorts to oppose the Kampuchean people  and at a time when the Chinese themselves also were escalating the war of aggression against the Vietnamese border.247.	It is perfectly clear that the aggression against the three Lao villages enjoyed the support of the Chinese expansionists and that it resulted from their total collusion with the extreme-right Thai reactionaries against Laos.248.	Although these three villages are still occupied by the Thai forces of aggression  the Lao People's Democratic Republic has been very restrained and has been prepared to settle the problem of the three villages jointly with the Thai side through negotiations  so as not to let the fraternal relations between the peoples of these two countries deteriorate still further. That is why the Lao side took the initiative of twiceâin July and August 1984âsending a governmental negotiation to Bangkok to negotiate with the Thai side. But the results showed that the Thai side does not sincerely wish to resolve the problem with the Lao side. It submitted many proposals and demands which were unreasonable and unjustified; these all had the purpose of denying the sovereignty of the Lao People's Democratic Republic over the three villages. After vainly expending great effort in an attempt to force the Lao side to accept its unfounded demands  the Thai side decided unilaterally to break off the negotiations.249.	Moreover  the Thai side has been saying  for public opinion and in all its international contacts  that ""the three villages are a minor problem""; that ""the problem can be resolved through direct negotiations between the two sides"": and that ""owing to Viet Nam's manipulation from behind the scenes  Laos is not its own master"". In the end  they established a so- called technical committeeâwhich we rejectedâto carry out an investigation in the field. But  as I have already made clear  the border in this sectorâand  indeed  throughout its lengthâwas very clearly delimited by the Franco-Siamese treaties of 2 February 1904 and 23 March 1907 and requires no verification. This investigation is intended only to prolong and legalize the occupation and to mislead international public opinion.250.	At the same time  it has pleased the Thai side to inform the Secretary-General about this problem  in order to make it widely known. The head of the Thai delegation abandoned the first round of negotiations with the Lao side in order to pay a visit to China to consult the Chinese side.251.	As everyone knows  the three countries of Indo-China have been the principal South-East Asian victims of the policies of aggression and occupation of the Chinese  the colonialists  the militarists and the imperialists. Laos and Kampuchea in particular have also been victims of the expansionist  hegemonist policy of the reactionaries in power in Thailand. Bearing in mind these historical facts  the three peoples of Indo-China have been forced to join together at the cost of great sacrifices in the long common struggle to regain and defend their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity against the forces of foreign aggression.252.	Fourthly  after the grave effects of 30 years of war  the Lao people want only to live in peace  to bring its country out of backwardness and poverty and to build a new system and a new life of prosperity.253.	The consistent foreign policy of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is to establish relations with all countries  irrespective of their political and social systems  on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence.254.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic has spared no effort to develop fraternal relations between its people and that of Thailand  its neighbour. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic notes with satisfaction that  thanks to the united efforts of the two parties  the Lao Government and the Thai Government have been able to sign two joint declarations  in January and April 1979  which turned a new page in the history of relations between the peoples of the two countries. However  the extreme-right reactionaries in the Thai ruling circles took advantage of this to attain their expansionist and hegemonist designs on Laos; this runs counter to the interests of the peoples of the two countries. Accordingly  the Thai reactionaries alone must shoulder the responsibility for the present serious deterioration.255.	The just solution to the problem of the three villages is for Thailand to withdraw all its troops from those villages  to allow the inhabitants forced into Thailand to return to their homeland  to provide fair compensation to the local inhabitants for the loss of life and property caused by the troops and to return the situation in the three villages to normal  as it was before 6 June 1984.256.	The Lao people has a long tradition of heroic struggle against foreign aggression and is resolved to exercise its right of legitimate self-defence  as set out in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations  to repel the troops of aggression and to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its sacred homeland. At the same time  the Lao Government will always demonstrate goodwill and will continue to be ready to resume negotiations with the Royal Thai Government in order to resolve the problem on the basis of the principles set forth in the two joint declarations of 1979.257.	We should like to take this opportunity to express our since thanks to the Governments and peoples of the various countries  and to international public opinion which cherishes peace and justice in the world  for their sympathy and for the invaluable support they have lent to the just position of the people of Laos.258.	We appeal here to all delegations participating in this session of the General Assembly to urge theThai side to respect the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Laos by withdrawing its troops from the three villages  by returning the Lao inhabitants  removed by force  to their homeland  by providing compensation to the Lao victims of this aggression and by restoring the situation in the three villages to normal  as it was before 6 June 1984. That would contribute to normalizing relations between Laos and Thailand and to safeguarding peace and stability in South-East Asia.259.	My delegation sincerely hopes that this session of the General Assembly will be an extremely successful one."
"80",3960,"LBN",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of Lebanon and on my own behalf  allow me at the outset  Sir  to associate myself with those delegations that have preceded me in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your wisdom  wide experience and ability will enable you to conduct the work of this session with success.46.	I wish also to express appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session. My own appreciation and that of my country also go to the Secretary-General for his laudable efforts and for his report on the work of the Organization.47.	I welcome to the United Nations the newest Member  Brunei Darussalam; we wish its delegation all success in representing its country and defending its rights.48.	Lebanon witnessed the founding of the United Nations and contributed to the elaboration of many of its principles and methods. It attaches paramount importance to the future of the Organization and to the need to secure its objectives and develop its machinery and institutions so that it may become the haven envisaged by the authors of the Charter of the United Nations and the framework in which the world can look towards a better future and permanent peace.49.	The United Nations has acquired a universal character  but at present it finds itself threatened by less and less compliance with its resolutions; indeed  there is increasing defiance of those resolutions. My wounded country knows that  to the extent that the United Nations recovers its ability to solve world problems  so will Lebanon be able to recover its potential to solve its own problems. Hence  Lebanon attaches paramount importance to the process leading to the immediate implementation of the resolutions concerning Lebanon  particularly Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982). Through that process  our confidence and world confidence in the Organization will be restored.50.	Lebanon brings before the Assembly today its concerns and preoccupations because  to a large extent  they are an expression of so many of the concerns and preoccupations of today's world.51.	The tragedies that have befallen our people have not prevented it from looking optimistically towards a better future. For the Lebanese optimism has never meant wishful thinking but has always been an expression of genuine possibilities and an effective will. The people of Lebanon  which has experienced the most difficult challenges and faced the worst attacks and acts of aggression  has never given in to despair or despondency and never considered its situation inevitable. Instead  the will of our people has crystallized in the restoration of our cohesion and unity among the various factions of the Lebanese people. This will has resulted in the Government of National Unity  over which I have the honour to preside.52.	The Government of National Unity  which includes all the essential and effective forces in the Lebanese arena  came into existence after much suffering and labour  almost unparalleled in contemporary history. It has renewed hope in closing ranks to pursue the objectives it announced in its ministerial communique. These objectives are: security  liberation  political reform and reconstruction. Our Government is determined to deal with the root causes of past events and to reveal to the whole world the will for reform inherent in Lebanon  as were revealed the weaknesses of the past decade. Once our Government has restored confidence in the unity of our country as an essential path to ending conflicts and disputes  it will go on to tackle directly everyday problems with effectiveness and seriousness so that Lebanon's prolonged suffering may be brought to an end  thus leading the country to an oasis Of hope  safeguarding stability and gradually restoring normalcy.53.	I am referring to the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the Government of National Unity because that Government has been entrusted not only with the tasks that any Government is usually entrusted with but  in addition to striving to maintain the unity of the Lebanese and restoring security and stability in Lebanon  it must also endeavour to secure conditions of stability  security and peace in the whole region.54.	Hence  we are conscious of the historical responsibility that we have to bear at this particular juncture  in view of the fact that the tasks entrusted to our Government in the present circumstances affect the situation in the region and are affected by it as well. Therefore  while we are well aware of our energies and potentials  we are also well aware that those potentials have limitations. Consequently  we see that the realities of the Lebanese question are at one and the same time separate from and connected with the basic issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict.55.	The Lebanese crisis is passing through a very delicate and crucial stage in its arduous course. Lebanon has started to overcome various contradictions which emerged violently a few years ago and to take measures necessary to secure the withdrawal of occupation forces from its territory. It is on the threshold of solving its problems by peaceful means. I find it imperative to focus in my statement on those positive developments  in view of their importance and of the fact that they have a direct bearing upon our destiny and upon the whole region.56.	The immediate priority goals for our Government are: security  liberation  political reform and reconstruction. Obviously  these goals have to be attained as soon as possible  by the most peaceful means and with the assistance of the United Nations.57.	With regard to security  the Government has already drawn up and completed a comprehensive security plan that has led to the extension of the territory under the control of the State. It succeeded quickly in unifying the capital  Beirut  without bloodshed. It has also put heavy weapons under control and forbidden people who are carrying weapons to take to the streets. The Lebanese army and internal security forces have taken on the responsibility of maintaining security in Beirut. Both the harbour and the airport in Beirut have been reopened. The Government is striving to implement the next stage of its security plan  which is aimed at opening the international routes  consolidating security and stabilizing the economy.58.	There is no doubt that a new awareness has started to govern the political conduct of the Lebanese and to guide them in their practices. This awareness has been forged by successive disasters and pain. The Lebanese have come to realize that they have to face their accumulating problems by themselves and that the responsibility of saving their country and restoring peace and stability is  in the first place  that of the country's people and leaders. They have already embarked upon the course designed to overcome their country's plight and have succeeded in laying the solid and practical foundations that should enable them to establish a new social  political and legal infrastructure on the basis of which they can live and work in the future. However  their patient efforts are still obstructed by extraneous elements beyond their will and control. Undoubtedly  the continued Israeli occupation of Lebanese territories is the most prominent and dangerous of those elements.59.	I turn now to the question of liberation. The continued Israeli occupation of part of my country is of a unique and tragic nature that transcends the magnitude of any regional or border dispute experienced by the Middle East for decades.60.	The magnitude of the invasion to which a small country like Lebanon has been subjected  its disastrous effects on innocent civilians  the massive destruction that has struck the whole country have made of this invasion a very serious and violent phenomenon that has to be tackled separately and brought to an end as soon as possible.61.	The continued Israeli occupation of parts of my country threatens its existence and jeopardizes the possibility of restoring its unity and cohesion in the foreseeable future  because Israel is occupying one third of Lebanon and directly controlling one fourth of its population.62.	The question  then  is not one of borders that have to be drawn or posts that have to be controlled. If that were the case  it would be easier to reach an understanding  because the legal background is clear and the principles and texts that confirm the rights of Lebanon in all these fields are available. What is at stake now is the future and existence of an independent State that is a Member of the United Nations  indeed  one of its founders. A country threatened by division and the fragmentation of one of its parts remains under occupation. Therefore  and in order to find the means to eliminate the consequences of the occupation in my countryâan occupation that has claimed thousands of lives and caused enormous damage  displacement and agonyâI find it necessary to put before the Organization the basic principles of my Government's policy on this vital matter.63.	First  Lebanon is determined to regain control over all its occupied territories within a limited time. It considers that total Israeli withdrawal beyond internationally recognized boundaries is urgently necessary and has absolute priority.64.	Secondly  the people and the leadership of Lebanon fully realize that the continuance of the occupation of a large part of their country by Israel jeopardizes their very existence. They agree on the need for the State to use all the means available and make every possible effort to end that occupation. Those that focus on certain alleged differences and on the failure of some people to contribute to the task of liberation that must be carried out by them show a tragic ignorance of the realities of the present political situation in Lebanon and of the unswerving determination of the whole Lebanese nation  of all factions  to regain its rights and reunify its homeland.65.	Thirdly  the Israeli practices in southern Lebanon constitute a daily violation of most of the principles of the United Nations and the provisions of international conventions which Israel claims to respect. The population of the occupied territories is being subjected to every form of oppression and persecution. This has been verified by several impartial bodies and dealt with in detail in clear and precise reports of organizations whose credibility cannot be questioned. Those practices have also been the subject of numerous complaints submitted by Lebanon as official documents of the General Assembly. The latest of these complaints was that submitted to the Security Councilâa complaint whose fate is only too well known to all. The suffering is still continuing in physical  moral  economic and military forms that affect the daily lives of our citizens. Hundreds of innocent people are still in detention camps  held without charge  endlessly awaiting trial. Measures aimed at isolating the occupied territories from the rest of the homeland have become so severe and arbitrary that the members of a family must wait for long weeks before they receive a permit enabling them to pass through the narrow gates which the occupation forces condescend to open every now and then. The process of destroying the economy of the south is in full swing and includes the well-known projects for exploiting the waters and other resources of that part of the country. All these inhuman practices are a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949. Lebanon  while awaiting the total withdrawal  calls once again upon all States members of the Security Council to review its complaint in this context in a spirit of justice and right and to make it possible for the Council to take effective measures aimed at putting an end to all those practices.66.	It was natural that these excesses should lead to the formation of a national movement of armed resistance against the occupation. That resistance is irrefutable proof of the vitality and dignity of the Lebanese people. It is an expression of their determination to regain their rights  sovereignty and freedom. Lebanon is proud of this resistance; it sees in it a pure  shining reflection of the faith of the Lebanese people in their homeland  and the exercise of a legitimate right recognized and achieved by all States and peoples throughout history that have been subjected to occupation and invasion.67.	The attempt to depict Lebanon as a centre of terrorism is a distortion of the facts; it is a way of maintaining the occupation  domination  and interference. Such reasoning is rejected both in form and in content.68.	Lebanon is suffering from acts of atrocity as widespread as the atrocity of occupation  which leads to oppression and the denial of rights. Israel's occupation of the south  western Bekaa and Rachaya and the continuous inhuman practices accompanying that occupation carry with them the seeds of instability and violence. We undoubtedly have to differentiate between the legitimate  heroic resistance in the south and the individual actions of those who  as individuals  resort to violence as an expression of their despair. Surely  resistance is the noblest means of opposing occupation. As for the retaliatory measures  they are but private  suicidal actions taken for personal reasons; they happen in every society  including that of Israel itself.69.	The whole world should know that independent Lebanon is the master of its decisions. Those who challenge this fact are also those who attack its sovereignty and whose aim is to compromise its unity.70.	Sovereign Lebanon's relations with its Arab brothers have always been and will continue to be the central point on the wider spectrum of its relations with the world as a whole. These relations  besides being historical  cultural and traditional  are also connected with our destinyâto the extent that that word has any meaning.71.	If these relations are the distinctive mark of our relations with all the Arabs  what would one expect our relations to be like with a sister country and a neighbour  Syria with whom we have distinctive ties uniting us in all fields?72.	Such is the situation of sovereign Lebanon  which belongs to its Arab environment  and such is the nature of the reciprocal responsibilities between it and all the other Arab States.73.	Fourthly  Lebanon considers that the General Armistice Agreement concluded between Lebanon and Israel on 23 March 1949  and endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 73 (1949) of 11 August 1949  is the legal basis for Israeli-Lebanese relations. Israel's claim that this Agreement is no longer in force as a consequence of the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 is false. As the United Nations is well aware  in 1967 Lebanon did not take part in the hostilities against Israel  nor did it declare war against Israel. The Armistice Agreement has remained in force  and in compliance with it  there were meetings of military personnel long after 1967  which confirms the fact that it still remains in force. The Lebanese Government considers that the Armistice Agreement has a permanent character and that it will remain in force until it is officially and explicitly amended by the two signatories under the supervision of the United Nations.74.	Fifthly  Lebanon considers that Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) constitute the sound legal basis for the process of Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territories. It is noteworthy that those two resolutions provide for immediate and unconditional withdrawal. Israel  as a Member of the United Nations  must implement those two resolutions and must cease to ignore them. The international communityâespecially the Security Council and its membersâassumes a heavy responsibility towards the people of Lebanon and the inhabitants of the south  western Bekaa and Rachaya and must take the necessary practical steps to put an end to Israel's disregard of those resolutions.75.	Sixthly  the Lebanese Government is willing to take all the military and administrative measures necessary to ensure the safety of the population in southern Lebanon. It has prepared an integrated plan for the deployment of the army at the border areas in the wake of the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Lebanon welcomes any mediation effort or assistance  whatever the source  with a view to reaching an agreement on the security arrangements to be implemented in the south.76.	Seventhly  Lebanon regards the role of the international forces in the south as central and of paramount importance in supporting the Lebanese army upon the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. Their contribution in this respect is indispensable during the first phases of the Lebanese army's deployment. Therefore  Lebanon calls for measures to support those forces by increasing their number  widening the area of their deployment and reinforcing their effectivenessâin other words  to enable the Lebanese State to re-establish its legitimate authority over those territories extending to the internationally recognized borders.77.	I wish to refer here to the relevant proposals of the Secretary-General  as contained in his report of 9 April 1984  since they form a solid basis for formulating an integrated programme to support those forces  which have played an effective and positive role. Those units have performed their task in very difficult conditions and with limited capacity. Lebanon wishes to pay a tribute to UNIFIL  hoping that it will persevere in the performance of its noble task. It reaffirms its gratitude to the Governments that have contributed and are still contributing to those forces  despite the difficulties they face.78.	While we reaffirm our commitment to assign to those forces an appropriate role  we state our willingness to define the new tasks that will enable them to shoulder greater responsibilities  whether at the border or inside the camps  even in monitoring the withdrawal and helping the Lebanese army to extend its authority to all the occupied territories.79.	Eighthly  Lebanon is prepared to contribute to any political initiative designed to resolve the whole Arab-Israeli conflict. It subscribes to the proposal to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 38/58 C. However  Lebanon maintains that its cause requires immediate and separate consideration because of its urgency and the highly destructive impact it has on Lebanon's political and social fabric.80.	Ninthly  any security arrangements must respect Lebanon's sovereignty and its rights. They should confirm its solid constituent elements as a sovereign State with inviolable rights and frontiers. Proceeding from this premise  Lebanon will not accept the presence of any military force on the territory of south Lebanon except the forces of the Lebanese army under the legitimate Lebanese authority. Israel's pretext that it does not trust the legitimate Lebanese army and its reliance on illegitimate forces for the maintenance of security there are refutable. If those small groups have proved ineffectual even under the Israeli occupation  what would the situation be if they remained alone to confront the genuine national wrath that is on the increase?81.	Loyalty to Lebanon must take the form of loyalty to the State of Lebanon. The Lebanese leaders and people alike will not recognize any other allegiance. Lebanon considers that the only military force that is entitled to join it in the maintenance of security at the border areas is the international force whose role  activity and deployment are governed by clear and detailed international agreements and resolutions that have a time-limit  with the explicit agreement of Lebanon.82.	On the whole  Lebanon considers that any security agreement to be concluded must of necessity confirm the principle of respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and frontiers. If Israel cannot tolerate the violation of its borders and territorial integrity  Lebanon  which has suffered from the violation of its sovereignty  is equally concerned over the inviolability of its territory and its sovereignty.83.	I have attempted here to explain the position of the Lebanese Government vis-a-vis the issue of Israel's occupation of a part of the territory of Lebanon and its refusal to withdraw despite its repeated declarations in this respect. I am confident that stressing the principles to be respected will render the negotiating process easier and more effective. We are awaiting the results of the ongoing endeavours  whether on the part of the Secretary- General or of the United States or other friendly countries  and we call upon them to make all possible efforts so that Lebanon may find a way out of its present ordeal.84.	I have already referred to the new spirit inspiring the Lebanese people in their efforts to resolve their problems by themselves. In the meantime  we appreciate the assistance rendered by our numerous friends  who have extended help and counsel as well as moral support in the most difficult circumstances. However  the Lebanese people realize that the difficulties they face in certain areas make it incumbent upon them to appeal to those friends to continue their assistance and intensify their efforts  particularly as concerns economic assistance.85.	All these years of crisis have caused a great deal of destruction and weakened the economy in both the public and private sectors. These years were severely detrimental to the infrastructure  which was the fruit of hard work throughout the last decade. Preliminary estimates indicate that the damage exceeds $20 billion  a matter which makes reconstruction an enormous process far exceeding the modest resources of Lebanon at the present time.86.	The Lebanese Government and its competent organs have drawn up many projects  some of which have already been launched according to their priorities. The high priority given to reconstruction and rehabilitation on the part of the Government of National Unity is due to our conviction that such reconstruction is not to be achieved after security has been maintained; rather  it is a tool for maintaining security. If it is acknowledged that security has precedence over reconstruction  then the turning- point that now confronts Lebanon makes it imperative for Lebanon to regard reconstruction as a means for ensuring security. To invest in reconstruction will create confidence in the future success of the security scheme and will lend impetus and vitality to it.87.	The reconstruction policy that we pursue aims essentially at lifting Lebanon from its tragic situation and turning it into a dynamic workshop of building and reconstruction.88.	This is in fact a large-scale process that requires the assistance of all friendly countries  international organizations and specialized agencies that appreciate the difficulties facing Lebanon and are willing to help it overcome its ordeal so that reconstruction takes the place of destruction. While Lebanon expresses its thanks to those countries and organizations  it appeals to them to take part in the enormous efforts required for this process in the near future. Lebanon is quite confident that its Arab brethren will set an example for other countries.89.	We have so far attempted to give an outline of the policies we pursue  as well as our national and international commitments. We strive to ensure that these commitments will conform to the provisions of international legitimacy and to the resolutions and the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed  Lebanon's desire is to see that the United Nations remains the focus of serious attention and that its organs are reinforced. This would be conducive to greater objectivity and deeper understanding in relations among States as well as to a stronger resolve to face problems and overcome persistent or potential crises.90.	Lebanon has always been a meeting-point of intellectual and cultural interaction. Therefore  Lebanon has always been at the forefront  playing an effective role throughout contemporary history; this role should be resumed  especially in view of its sufferings throughout the last decade  which make it recognize that violence breeds violence and that man can ensure his rights through dialogue but wastes them through violence. The Lebanese people have endured untold sufferings. As a result  it has become more determined today than ever before to overcome the crisis which has placed such a drain on its energies. It has come to the conclusion that diversity enriches its national unity  provides a creative impetus and must never be allowed to lead to dismemberment.91.	It has never occurred to us to abandon our hope that Lebanon will recover its strength and resume its mission  even in the dimmest of conditions. We have never lost sight of the light at the end of the tunnel. Thus  the glimmer of hope has become a reality and our vision has become truth. This has always been and will always be the goal of Lebanon. We have inherited Lebanon as a haven of freedom for humanity. This is our cherished legacy to be handed over to succeeding generations.92.	At the close of my statement  I wish to appeal to you because of the heavy responsibilities you bear and because you are the source of hope for all the oppressed in this world: do not disappoint the hopes of those peoples. Lebanon is the testing-ground and will witness what you do. May God give you success."

We welcome the admission of Brunei Darussalam to membership of the United Nations. This act was a significant step in the affirmation of the role of the United Nations and the principle of universality. We are confident that Brunei Damssalam will make every effort to promote the goals of the Organization and join in the struggle for the total elimination of the remaining pockets of colonialism.227.	During the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  my Head of State  Samuel K. Doe  made a comprehensive report to this body on the progress towards a return to civilian government in Liberia. At that time he informed delegations that a national constitution commission had completed a draft constitution which had been turned over to a constituent Advisory Assembly comprising representatives from each of the political subdivisions of the country for review and recommendations to the People's Redemption Council. A revised draft constitution  which was presented to the People's Redemption Council by the constituent Advisory Assembly was subsequently accepted and thereafter presented to the people of Liberia in a referendum. The Liberian people voted overwhelmingly for acceptance of the draft constitution.228.	Today  with the Assembly's kind indulgence  I shall update that report. The People's Redemption Council has been dissolved and replaced by a National Interim Assembly  comprising representatives from all the political subdivisions of the country  to guide the transition process. The ban on politics has been lifted  making possible the formation of political parties. So far  11 political groupings have been announced. It is with such encouraging progress that the Government and the people of Liberia look forward to a peaceful transition to civilian rule.229.	As we continue on this path  we are mindful that the transition to civilian government is fraught with difficulties but filled with challenges. We firmly believe that the ultimate success of this process will rest primarily upon the intentions and the resolve of the Liberian people and the goodwill and understanding of the international community. We therefore use this opportunity to call upon friendly Governments and all who are gathered here today to identify with us and lend your fullest support to these endeavours.230.	The United Nations is increasingly experiencing many difficulties and a pervasive sense of frustration. The high hopes with which the Organization began its existence in 1945 continue to dwindle considerably. The search for peace has been marked by blurred achievements. Apart from the development of permanent institutions exclusively devoted to peace  and a general acceptance  even if one that is not fully applied  of principles such as the equality of States and human rightsâincluding the right of self- determination  the right to work  the right to education and to self-fulfilment and the right to an equal share in the world's limited resources  as well as the right to full participation in the decision-making processes of international relationsâpeace has neither been assured nor freely maintained.231.	If there is a constant danger of war in the midst of the universal desire for peace  it is perhaps because we are not all equally committed to peace. There are some of us who pay lip-service to its pursuit. If the United Nations is to be an effective instrument  Member States must be not only peace- preachers but also peace-seekers and peace-keepers and must redouble their efforts to carry out the noble ideals and principles for which the Organization stands. If international peace and security are to prevail  we must be totally committed to it and defend it at all times and not only at the hour of expediency or maximum danger.232.	We believe  moreover  that the Charter of the United Nations contains all the principles and precepts needed to assure peace and guarantee security. If  however  we have failed to secure peace it is not that the Charter is weak or inadequate or that some of its provisions are outmoded  as some would claim; it is only that we cannot summon the moral courage and political will to subordinate our own interest to the common interest of all  in accordance with the Charter.233.	No other issue or policy in world affairs in the last three decades has caused so much disgust  bitterness  hostility and strife as the South African Government's policy of apartheid. The entire world continues to voice condemnation and to heap scorn on this strange and diabolical policyâwithout a dent being made in the armour of its practitioner.234.	This year the international community has witnessed an upsurge in the policy of apartheid in one of its cruellest forms and in the guise of reform or superficial change in the bogus elections conducted last August by South Africa to vote on a new constitution which would further divide the population and entrench apartheid  making its implementation more efficient. Liberia was pleased that those elections were boycotted  as was only right  by an overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa and that  prior to the election  the Security Council  on 17 August 1984  declared both the new constitution and the elections null and void.235.	How can a nation which professes Christianity preside with seeming delight over the systematic separation of races through legislative enactments aimed at the physical uprooting and displacement of the African majority? South Africa is infested and misled by cruel and unkind men who belong to the past  who appear not to worry about potential enemies  who seem to have no desire for allies and who have no real friends.236.	How can we  as a collective entity  members of the world community  continue to permit the majority of the people of that land to be victims of tyranny and oppression  of exploitation and degradation  of poverty and hatred? What  I ask  does our moral conscience tell the United Nations we should do now on their behalf? What do we make of the proliferation of resolutions on the policies of apartheid of the South African Government and the decisions of the United Nations which the racist regime continues to defy and ignore? How much longer can we afford to listen sympathetically to complaints made to the Organization by neighbouring African countries and by the South African majority against South Africa while at the same time ignoring their plea for effective action?237.	Liberia  for its part  remains firm in its total rejection of apartheid and of the racist regime which practises it. We believe that comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations are the only effective weapon against apartheid. Individual and collective efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere must be encouraged and sustained for the imposition of sanctions against the Pretoria regime until that bastion of racism crumbles.238.	South Africa's apartheid system  its destabilization policies and economic blackmail are danger signals to the people of that region. Namibia has been virtually transformed into an apartheid inferno and a base for South Africa's aggressive attacks against neighbouring countries. South Africa's colonial and illegal occupation of Namibia is being increasingly consolidated  with utter disregard for the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. 239.	My delegation considers the question of Namibia a priority item. More than six years ago  Security Council resolution 43S (1978) was adopted  calling for free and fair elections in Namibia under United Nations supervision and control; yet the settlement plan for Namibia's independence has not been implemented. In the meantime  the South African racist regime continues to intensify its militarization of the Territory and to subject the Namibians to the crudest form of human humiliation and degradation  in defiance of United Nations resolutions and decisions.240.	The untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and the exemplary manner in which he has carried out his mandate on the question of Namibia deserve our commendation  We note in his report on the question of Namibia that  notwithstanding all the progress made in the negotiations this year  the United Nations has not yet been able to proceed  for reasons which are well known. Indeed  the reasons have to do with extraneous issues that were not introduced at the time of the adoption of resolution 435 (1978) but have subsequently received international attention and been rejected. Liberia  for its part  finds it difficult to accept the concept of parallelism  which links the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of troops from Angola.241.	It seems clear that the United Nations needs most urgently a new set of commitments and a collective resolve to end South Africa's intransigence and the sufferings of the Namibian people.242.	Liberia has pledged to encourage the efforts undertaken by the front-line and other well-meaning States to make Namibia's independence a reality and to bring about relaxation of tension and peace and Security in southern Africa. While we are grateful to Western contact groups for spearheading Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  we are of the view that the question of Namibia should be resolved within the framework of the United Nations. However  Member States that have leverage over South Africa should not be discouraged or prevented from using their good offices to bring about stability and the Organization's objective in that region. We urge the international community to continue the financial and moral support to Namibia  SWAPO and the front-line States as well as the Nationhood Programme for Namibia  the United Nations Fund for Namibia and the United Nations Institute for Namibia  at Lusaka.244.	As though colonialism  institutionalized racism  the misery of outright deprivation and scarce resources were not enough evils to reckon with  the refugee situation and food crisis have added new dimensions to Africa's intractable problems.245.	Four million refugees  the largest in any one area in the world  are scattered all over the continent and  worst of all  are dependent on countries whose economies can hardly sustain their own citizens.246.	The Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  must be supplemented by worldwide concerted efforts to alleviate the plight of Africa's refugees. This group of unfortunate people must be provided the means of developing their abilities and skills to be able to earn a livelihood and to contribute to the communities in which they live. We  on the continent  must do as much as lies in our power to eliminate some of the causes of this problem  for we know that this situation has not always been the result of natural phenomena. At the same time  we must intensify and redouble our efforts to assist our uprooted brothers and sisters in easing their endless miseries and sufferings and helping them to regain their confidence and normalize their lives.247.	Hunger  prolonged drought and desertification pose serious threats to the social and political fibre of our continent. According to FAO  100 million Africans will suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition due to food deficits this year  and FAO has appealed for emergency food assistance without delay  assistance which is necessary if massive starvation  malnutrition and the loss of thousands of human lives are to be avoided. We commend FAO for the efforts being made to bring this unfortunate situation under control and we hope the assistance needed will be forthcoming from the international community.248.	Liberia's resumption of diplomatic relations with the State of Israel has not altered its Middle East policy. We continue to believe in  and will give support to  a just and lasting peace which cannot be achieved in the Middle East without: first  the due recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a State of their own; secondly  the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from all Arab lands; and thirdly  the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live freely within secure and internationally recognised boundaries  with the fullest respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty.249.	The Government of Liberia also believes that peace in the Middle East cannot come through a policy of isolation of one of the major parties to the conflict. We believe also that it is through the language of exchange of views among all the peoples of the region that the path to peace and understanding lies. Peace will continue to elude us if we are not prepared to accept that all the States in the region lave the right to live freely within secured and internationally recognized boundaries.250.	The tragic story of Lebanon is one of continued sufferings  destruction and war. It is a situation that remains unstable  fragile and explosive. The international community should go on record again in urging the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon as well as stress the due recognition of and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that country.251.	The prolongation of the Iran-Iraq conflict  a conflict between two Muslim neighbours  can only add to the fragility of the area. Liberian ships and those of other countries have been arbitrarily attacked and damage done to life and property with impunity. We believe that the Security Council should again intervene in this long-standing conflict before it takes on unmanageable proportions.252.	The Central American region has witnessed unrest and violence for some time now and on an increasing scale.253.	The Government of Liberia has always adhered to  and will continue to adhere to  the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes. While there are still wide differences between the Government of Argentina and the Government of the United Kingdom on the question of the FalklandIslands  we urge the continuation of meaningful negotiations for the peaceful solution of that dispute.254.	Another perennial issue which continues to evade the collective resolve of the United Nations is the question of Korea. My Government has always stressed the need for the resumption of direct negotiations between the South and the North. Such talks  we believe  are likely to resolve enmity and distrust and promote reconciliation and reunification between the two sides. It is therefore our hope that both sides will bury the hatchet  as it were  and sincerely resume talks aimed at the achievement of those important objectives.255.	As is generally conceded  the arms race consumes a disproportionate share of the scarce resources of our planet and continues to do so at an ever-increasing rate. It utilizes much of our finest scientific talent in sterile and destructive pursuits.256.	Despite the danger and waste of the arms race  the States of the world have continued to stockpile armaments at an alarming rate  a clear indication that no State is prepared to disarm if it feels its security is not guaranteed. Each year  the two nuclear Powers seem to produce new weapons which are more efficient in deadliness and which  when adopted by their armed forces  immediately require a matching effort by the other side.257.	While we advocate a halt to the arms race  we equally stress the urgent need for an answer to the security question  thereby removing the need for the constant increase in military expenditures and rivalry between States.258.	We believe that security can be found only in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that it is only through the goodwill of all nations  coupled with mutual trust  confidence  understanding and co-operation  that we can achieve the international stability and security so urgently needed in our world.259.	It is therefore interesting to note President Chernenko's answers to questions posed to him during a recent interview and the reaction of the Government of the United States. We sensed from President Chernenkoâs answers a readiness to negotiate complete disarmament  despite the rhetoric. We are inclined to believe that the Soviet leader expressed his Government's preparedness for honest and serious talk with the Government of the United States  Let me quote a particular paragraph of President Chernenko's response:I wish to reaffirm with all certainty our readiness for dialogue  for honest and serious talks aimed at finding accord that takes into account the security interests of all countries and peoples.""260.	We have noted also the response of the United States: that it is seriously seeking agreement with the Russians  that it welcomes the statement of President Chernenko  and that it is ready to resume the Geneva negotiations. We noted with added interest President Reagan's address to the General Assembly on 24 September  with its reference to ""United States-Soviet Union relations  and the ""comprehensive and broad"" talks held between the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Shultz  and the Soviet Foreign Minister  Mr. Gromyko  on Wednesday  26 September.261.	In his statement to the General Assembly on 27 September  the Soviet Foreign Minister stressed that the Soviet Union would fully co-operate with all States prepared to help ease international tensions by practical deeds and to create an atmosphere of trust in the world in order to consolidate the foundations of peace.262.	We loudly proclaim the need for curbing weapons in outer space and for stopping the arms race and the continuous build-up of military armament; we want disarmament. We therefore endorse what appears to be a reasonable closeness of the positions of the two sides  though the approaches may appear divergent  and we urge them to get on with this important business and translate their pronouncements regarding genuine disarmament efforts into meaningful action. We are watching closely and with keen expectations the results of the assurances given by both sides 263.	The seriousness of our global economic crisis can be determined by the fact that it encompasses all nations of the world; rich or poor  developed or developing  large or small  we have all been affected in one way or the other. We have seen the economic havoc it has wrought in developed countries. In the developing societies  vulnerable as their economies are  it has created in its wake enormous balance-of- payments deficits  mounting debt burdens and worsening terms of trade  owing to a drastic fall in commodity prices and a sharp  rise in the prices of imported goods.264.	The crisis has introduced new dimensions into the debate on world development. There is a growing awareness that the fates of the developed and the developing countries are interlinked in the crisis. I hope that one good thing it has brought forth is the realization by the industrialized countries that the prosperity of the developing countries is vital to their own economic survival.265.	The threat of default by debtor developing countries and its implications for the international financial and banking system have brought into sharp and disturbing focus the inherent danger and inadequacy of the present world economic System. Although borrowers and lenders have endeavoured to avoid such default  the efforts hive amounted to no more than short-term rescue operations  providing temporary support only.266. While various remedies have been suggested to resolve the debt crisis  we believe that a concerted policy effort by debtors  creditors and international financial institutions to address the crisis now presents the best alternative. Long term measures include modification in the objectives and an increase in the resources of multinational institutions concerned with finance and development  as well as chances in the framework of the commercial banking system.267.	It is particularly important that a co-ordinated economic expansion in industrialized nations be accompanied by low interest rates and a relaxation of trade restrictions  in order to contribute to an economic upturn and provide relief to debtor nations.268.	In order to reverse the tremendous transfer of resources from developing countries to the industrialized world and thereby improve the economic outlook of the developing countries  and in particular African countries  financial institutions and industrialized countries should write off long-standing loans and turn some of the loans that have been rescheduled more than once into grants-in-aid. Such a moral gesture on the part of the creditors would reduce the debt burden of some developing countries and enhance their economic recovery.269.	The magnitude of the crisis of the world economy dictates the need to summon our political will and make the concerted efforts necessary to launch the negotiations on reforming and restructuring the existing economic order without delay. This process  we continue to believe  would serve as a major step in achieving a more orderly and equitable world economy and at the same time foster greater co-operation among nations.270.	The economic situation in Africa is critical and precarious  and it poses a serious threat to the social and political well-being of our people. It is true that the global economic situation affects all developing countries  but its impact on sub-Saharan Africa is tremendous. These countries continue to experience negative growth  and their export earnings are still on the decline.271.	While we recognize that the development of Africa is our primary responsibility  as enshrined in the Lagos Plan of Action  concerted efforts by the international community and donor countries  which have the enormous capacity to correct the critical economic situation  would complement the national efforts of African Governments in reversing the negative trend of their economies.272.	The people of Liberia fully endorse the Secretary-General's initiative with regard to the critical social and economic situation in Africa. We wish to thank him for his efforts and urge him to continue to regard the economic situation in Africa as a priority issue that requires the moral and political support of the international community and donor countries for its amelioration.273.	We welcome the World Bank plan to aid sub- Saharan African countries  in spite of the lack of substantial pledges for the $2 billion that the Bank would need to implement the programme. The effort of the Bank to highlight the economic malaise of African countries deserves the full support of all true mends of Africa. We call upon the industrialized countries and those developing countries which have the capacity to do so to pledge funds to the Bank programme for improving the economic situation in274. At this point  the Government of Liberia wishes to thank all those friendly States and international organizations that participated in the Liberia round-table conference  which was held at Berne in October 1983. It is our hope that we can continue to rely on their understanding and assistance as we go through a critical economic period in our national life. We wish also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General and all those in the United Nations system who worked so tirelessly for the convening of that conference.275.	Earlier I reflected on various achievements in the search for international concord  especially the evolution of permanent institutions for peace and the development of principles and rules of conduct of States. I should like to close by focusing on the serious nature of our present assignment.276.	Every time the General Assembly has met in the past 38 years  hopes have arisen that the world body would be able successfully to address some of the major problems haunting man's struggle for progress and development. Speeches of hope and promise are made  couched in triumphant phrases; resolutions are adopted and then ignored; thereafter  representatives go back home to their Governments and begin all over again doing what they best know- acting in the supreme interest of each individual's country  whether it be planning for war  raising the interest rates  causing a flood of refugees to spill over into someone else's territory or something else.277.	This year the General Assembly meets for the thirty-ninth time in regular session. It is meeting at a time when the two super-Powers have hardly been on speaking terms. It meets under the threat of a nuclear cloud  with both East and West looking at each other through a palisade of nuclear missiles. It is meeting at a time in our world history when the poor nationsâ and there are many of themâare poorer and the threat of human sufferings through famine  drought and oppression is becoming not only widespread but uncontrollable.278.	In short  the United Nations has serious business to discuss this year. But this is not all: the United Nations must resolve to be resolute and tackle the problems facing mankind. It must decide to take some positive steps in the direction of curbing the arms race  in bridging the gap of poverty  in stemming the lucrative arms trade which aims at defeating the very purpose for which the Organization was founded: to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The United Nations must restore the people's faith in its ideals  its objectives and its functional ability.279. The new generation today is crying out for that United Nations which once had the will to help resolve the problem in the Korean peninsula; obstructed the partition of the Congo during the 1960s; voted for the establishment of new States; aided in the liberation of many African States. The United Nations should arm itself with that tenacity of purpose to address the burning issues of mankind and pull the world away from crises. 280. In the early days of the formation of the world body  the United Nations adopted the decision made at Bretton Woods that gave birth to the current world economic order. If it now appears that Bretton Woods no longer serves the best needs of mankind's economic order  we think the United Nations as a moral force should put pressure on the economic Powers so that a reconstruction of the economic order suitable to the demands of the time may be accomplished.281. In June this year  the allied forces of Europe and the United States commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the invasion of Europe  which history tells us was the turning-point in the Second World War. Next year  the United Nations will celebrate its fortieth anniversary as the corner-stone of peace and progress. But before it can do that  it needs to restore hope to mankind by lessening tensions and making the two super-Powers play a more positive role in maintaining a world order based on peace and harmony  not by competitive polemics and harsh rhetoric  not by confrontation and stockpiling weapons  but by devising constructive proposals calling for joint efforts in addressing the issues of the day.282. If this session of the General Assembly can take some positive steps in a direction that would lead the super-Powers to appreciate their role and thereby work jointly for the progressive attainment of world peace  it will accomplish more than many of its resolutions ever have since Day One.283.	I know that the nations of the third world which make up a large part of this world body arc committed to this serious assignment this year. I hope all the nations of this family are also so committed."
"82",4051,"LBY",39,1984,"ï»¿At the outset allow me to convey to you  Sir  congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It gives me personal pleasure to see you assume that high office  for you are a friend who represents a fraternal country that is part of the great African continent that has made such a great contribution to mankind and that is still engaged in a bitter struggle against apartheid and neo-colonialism in order to lay the foundations for justice and peace. I am confident that your vast experience and well- known wisdom will guide the proceedings of this Assembly to the best results possible. I should also like to pay a tribute to the role of your country and its President in our struggle on the African continent.162.	I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  who so brilliantly guided the deliberations of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session.163.	I also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for his efforts and dedication in seeking to reinforce peace and stability in the world and in promoting the United Nations  strengthening its role in the service of peace and freedom.164.	My delegation takes pleasure in congratulating Brunei Darussalam upon its accession to independence. We welcome its admission to membership in the United Nations.165.	Nearly four decades have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations and the promulgation of its Charter. There can be no doubt that enormous efforts have been made since then to realize the purposes enshrined in the Charterâfor the ending of colonialism  for the maintenance of peace and for economic development. However  as the Secretary-General states in his report on the work of the Organization:""... for all of the accomplishments of the past decades  and they have been major  the fact of the matter is that the three main elements of a stable international orderâan accepted system of maintaining international peace and security; disarmament and arms limitation; and the progressive development of a just and effective system of international economic relationsâhave yet to take hold as they should.""166.	Now  on the threshold of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  we must consider the obstacles that hinder its work and *he reasons why it is impeded in the effective discharge of its duties in keeping with the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter.167.	The international community is passing through a critical and difficult period characterized by the escalation of tension and the exacerbation of international crises as a result of the policy of confrontation being pursued by the colonial countries  which are seeking by all means and methods to return to their old spheres of influence or to acquire new ones.168.	We have witnessed the frenzied show of strength that has recently dominated the conduct of the United States. That country has deployed its forces throughout the world; it has sped up the production and deployment of new weapons in many parts of the world; and it has ""Hexed its muscles"" and stepped up its aggressive military provocations against States members of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries. All of this has created distrust regarding its intentions and has renewed the nuclear and strategic arms race among the great Powers  which has in turn led to a quest by the small  non- aligned countries to acquire weapons in order to defend their own sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  to the detriment of their economic and social development.169.	When speaking of the deteriorating state of international security  I must refer to one of the foreign military activities that is being carried out in one of the most sensitive of the world's areas  namely  the Mediterranean  a region we believe should be free from any factor that might lead to a worsening of tension  which could in tum lead to a catastrophe in the area. Proceeding from a belief in the importance of security in the Mediterranean to international peace  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya intends to consult with other non-aligned States and with other States concerned with a view to reaching an international agreement that would ban the holding of military manoeuvres in the international waters of the Mediterranean. The presence of foreign fleets and colonial military bases in the Mediterranean constitutes one of the major factors for instability in the region and a threat to the security and safety of the States in the area. We want the Mediterranean to be a sea of peace and co-operation. We call for the evacuation of foreign bases  the departure of foreign fleets and the dismantling of all lethal weapons  especially nuclear weapons  in the area.170.	The fact that the problem of Cyprus has not yet been settled directly influences security in the Mediterranean. We hope that the two communities  Turkish and Greek  may reach a just solution through direct negotiations so as to ensure the rights of both communities and reinforce the independence of Cyprus  as well as its territorial integrity and non- aligned status. We support the efforts of the Secretary-Genera! and his Special Representative in this regard. My country has contributed its good offices to the two communities and stands ready to make further efforts in order to achieve a peaceful solution as speedily as possible.171.	We have recently witnessed an increase in the campaigns of destabilization waged by the United States throughout the world  campaigns aimed at compromising the security and sovereignty of peoples who attempt to follow an independent and non- aligned policy and refuse to yield to the pressures and threats of the United States Government  which aims to dominate those States  usurp their riches and use them as a tool for achieving its political and strategic goals.172.	As a result of its boldness and steadfastness in resisting imperialism and supporting freedom and world liberation movements  the Libyan people and its leaders have been subjected to a long and virulent series of military provocations  acts of aggression and clandestine operations  as we!! as economic conspiracies and pressures on the part of the United States.173. This campaign is illustrated by the acts of provocation of the United States Sixth Fleet dose to Libyan waters in the Gulf of Sidrah and the repeated violations of Libyan airspace by AW ACS spy planes; the dirty operations of the Central Intelligence Agency aimed at the assassination of the leader of our revolution; and the training of saboteurs who are sent from other countries to strike at important goals in our country and thus destabilize it. AH possible means have been usedâincluding an almost total boycottâto hamper the Libyan economy. AH of this was described on 30 August 1984 by John Hughes  a spokesman for the United States State Department  as being more stringent than that imposed on any other country  including the Soviet Union.174. Needless to say  the United States refuses to carry out the boycott imposed on the regime of South Africa  despite all international resolutions. It stands by that regime and supplies a!! its needs  including highly destructive military equipment.175.	The Foreign Ministers of the Mediterranean member countries of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  meeting at Valletta on 10 and 11 September 1984  studied the United States acts of provocation against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and  in their Final Declarations  stated the following:""The Ministers expressed profound concern at the many provocations by the United States of America that violate the sovereignty of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and its territorial integrity and that constitute a threat to international security and peace and a factor hampering the efforts of the non-aligned countries to strengthen peace and cooperation in the Mediterranean region. They expressed their support for the Jamahiriya's efforts to resist the various pressures arising from these provocations.	176.	United States acts of aggression against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have not stopped there. It has gone as far as slander and media campaigns aimed at tarnishing the image of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and preparing world public opinion for the possibility of military aggression against it in collaboration with the reactionary regimes in the area.177.	The United States  which threatens peace and security in the Mediterranean region  has not confined itself to installing bases in and sending a fleet to the area and using them against the Arab nation and in the interest of its Zionist allies. It has gone further and deployed its fleet in the Red Sea after fabricating what it called the ""mine operation"". These mines were planted there by the United States and its Zionist ally as an excuse for their collusion against the Arab nation and for the presence of their fleet in the region.178.	The United States  within the framework of its virulent attack against the Libyan Arab people  has resorted to vile tactics that are contrary to international laws and norms. The harassment of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's Mission to the United Nations and of the members of the Mission is a violation of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations and other relevant international agreements. Its aim is to hamper the activities of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's Mission to the United Nations.179.	The serious situation in the Arab region resulting from the usurpation of Palestine  the displacement of the Palestinians and the implanting of an alien racist entity in the area is still a source of concern to the entire international community. Despite the fact that more than 36 years have elapsed since the usurpation of Palestine and the displacement of its people  the international community has so far not been able to take any concrete measures that would re-establish the rights of the Palestinian people and enable them to return to their homeland. This is because the imperialists that created the Zionist racist entity in Palestine pledged themselves to support it both in the United Nations and with weapons and money  so that it could not only strengthen its bastion in Palestine but also continue its aggression against the Arab countries and its expansion at their expense  with a view to establishing a greater Zionist State reaching from the Euphrates to the Nile. 180.	No further evidence is necessary of the complete support of the United States for the racist Zionist entity  especially following the strategic agreement between them. The United States has given the Zionist entity more than $2.5 billion up to now  and it is possible that next year it will give more than $3 billion and as much as $5 billion in the following year.181.	The aid given by the United States Government to the Zionist entity has become one of the main campaign issues in the race for the United States presidency. Everybody takes pride in this  with each party pledging to supportâmore than the other partyâthe Zionist entity against the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The United States is responsible for the plight of the Palestinian people. It bears full responsibility for the intransigence of the racists in Palestine and their rejection of all the relevant United Nations resolutions.182.	The United States  which is helping the Zionist entity to create settlements by providing it with weapons with which to strike at the Palestinian people and at other Arab countries  cannot be an impartial party or play any role in the peace process  unless that peace is meant to be a device to enable Israel or the Israeli entity to occupy more territories. It has become clear that tension in the area has escalated since the signing of the Camp David accords. The Zionist entity has occupied southern Lebanon and annexed Jerusalem and the Golan Heights despite all the resolutions adopted in this regard.183.	The General Assembly must reconsider its position concerning the Zionist entity in the light of the continuing racist  Zionist practices  the acts of aggression which are witnessed daily  the usurpation of property  the acts of genocide and the flouting of United Nations resolutions.184.	We reaffirm that it is necessary to take the following actions: first  the Zionist entity must be expelled from the General Assembly as an entity that does not cherish peace  in accordance with the resolutions of the ninth emergency special session of the General Assembly; and secondly  there must be a complete boycott of that entity.185.	No peace initiative will be successful unless it takes into account the right of the Palestinian people to return to Palestine and to establish its independent State on the entire territory of Palestine.186.	The tragic fate inflicted on the Jewish people cannot be redressed through the suffering of the Palestinian people. The Zionist neo-Nazis cannot use against the Palestinian people the same practices that were once used by the Nazis against the Jews. Responsibility for the persecution of the Jews is borne by the persecutors and the persecutors alone. The world cannot accept a State based on religious discrimination and on the Nazi doctrine of Zionism.187.	The Zionist aggression  supported by imperial-ism  has not confined itself to the occupation of Palestine and the displacement of its people; it has spread to Palestine's neighbouring countries. The continued occupation and the annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights should be condemned and rejected by the international community. The continued occupation by the Zionist entity of a considerable portion of Lebanon  in defiance of all the resolutions of the international community  confirms the nature and objectives of the racist Zionist entity.188.	The Lebanese people  which has succeeded in forcing the imperialist invaders to withdraw and has been able finally to abrogate the shameful 17 May 1983 agreementâwhich Lebanon was forced to sign under pressure from the United Statesâwill be able  through its valiant resistance  to achieve victory over the Zionist invader. The Lebanese people has proven the futility of imposing capitulatory solutions on Arab nations. The fate of the Camp David accords  imposed by the armed force of the United States and by United States-Zionist aggression  will be the same as that of the 17 May 1983 agreement.189.	The Arab nation  which has known dismemberment and division  must now unite and play its role as one of the major forces in the world. Colonialism divided and dismembered that nation and it is trying to perpetuate that division and dismemberment by all means.190.	Proceeding from its belief in the unity of the Arab nation  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought and continues to seek to bring that unity about  despite all obstacles. Historical and emotional factors make Arab unity an imperative necessity for the Arab nation so that it may face its enemies and strengthen itself. Arab unity will help to promote peace and security not only in the Arab region  but in the whole world. If unified and given the opportunity to do so  the creative Arab nation  which has contributed so much to mankind  will be able to contribute even more.191.	Proceeding from that same belief the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Morocco  exercising free will and integrity  have signed an agreement to establish an Arab-African union. This union is not aimed against any country; it is not an ""axis""  but is a step towards the achievement of the unity of the Arab Maghreb and a foundation for the complete unity of the Arab nation. The fear of this agreement felt by imperialist and reactionary forces is testimony to its importance and its integrity. The agreement is open to all countries of the region  whether Arab or African  and it embodies the principles of the League of Arab States and of the United Nations.192.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya welcomes any act conducive to unity and any step in that direction  whether in the West or the East of the Arab world  or in the African continent. We warmly welcomed the agreement signed by Algeria and Tunisia  to which Mauritania subsequently acceded  and we welcomed the opportunity offered by Tunisia for us to sign it also. We shall participate in any step towards achieving Arab unity in any part of the Arab homeland or the African continent. Any attempt to impede Arab unity or to exploit its noble principles in an attempt to cover up hegemony and the desire for domination is doomed to failure.193.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  which firmly supported the people of Western Sahara in its struggle against the Spanish colonizer  supports the solution of the problem of Western Sahara in accordance with the resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations and in keeping with the concept of Greater Maghreb unity.194.	The United States  which has adopted a position inimical to such unification  must stop its intervention in the Arab world; it must let the Arab nations achieve unity in accordance with their own free will. This United States position makes us even more determined to persist in our desire for unification of the Arab Maghreb and  more broadly  of the Arab world  and for unification of the African continent. In the meantime  we call on our brothers in the Arab Maghreb to join and support this union.195.	The African continent continues to be a focus of the world's attention and a hotbed of tension. That continent is the site of some of the most complex problems of today.196.	In Namibia  the South African racist regime continues its illegitimate occupation of the Territory and persists in its oppression of the black citizens of Namibia and in its usurpation of the country's wealth  in collusion with the Western transnational corporations  in defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations and other international organizations. With the help of the Western countries  that racist regime has continued its manoeuvres aimed at preventing the independence of Namibia and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).197.	Linkage of the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is but one more proof of imperialist collusion with the regime in an attempt to prevent the United Nations from achieving genuine independence for Namibia. This constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Angola and cannot be accepted as a pre-condition for independence. My country declares its complete solidarity with the People's Republic of Angola until the liberation of its territory and of the whole of Namibia.198.	We cannot forget that colonialism created the racist Pretoria regime and helped to sustain it by providing it with various types of aid  including weapons. Consequently  we are certain that the Western countries cannot act as mediators in the resolution of the Namibian problem. Imperialism cannot be a mediator in that process because it is a party to the aggression against the Namibian people  by virtue of its material and political help to the regime and its usurpation  through its transnational corporations  of the wealth of Namibia.199.	The problem of Namibia can be resolved only through the strict and speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  with the full participation in any effort to resolve this problem of SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya proclaims its full support for SWAPO in its efforts to achieve independence and self-determination for the Namibian people. We call on the Security Council to take the necessary measures to implement its resolutions concerning Namibia and to put an end to the racist occupation of that Territory.200.	In Azania  the fraternal African people of that country is still struggling against the apartheid policy of the Pretoria regime  which is daily reinforced by the Government with executions and arrests of national leaders. The people of Azania recently proved to the whole world that it will continue its struggle against the policy of racial discrimination  when thousands took to the streets in demonstrations  facing the bullets of the racists  who tried to deceive the world with what they called constitutional reformsâsham parliaments established for those of Asian origin and the Coloureds. Those were not constitutional changes  but final  desperate attempts to perpetuate and reinforce the policy of apartheid. They will enable the apartheid regime to conscript Asians and Coloureds into the racist army  to be used for the suppression of their black brothers  who represent the majority.201.	We in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believe that apartheid cannot be reformed but must be eliminated. We shall continue to help the people of Azania in its efforts to achieve majority rule and to eliminate the odious phenomenon of apartheid	which has been condemned by the United Nations as a crime against humanity.202.	As I speak of the situation in Africa  I cannot fail to refer to one of the problems that has been a cause of concern to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for a long timeâthe problem of Chad  a war-tom country which lacks stability owing to the negative policies left by imperialism  the effects of which have been felt at the political and social levels and which led to a civil war. That war is still raging  despite the attempts made by all the countries of the region  foremost among them the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  and recently by the OAU  to achieve national reconciliation in Chad and lay the foundation for a stable regime that would devote its energies to the country's reconstruction and development.203.	Chad being at the southern border of my country  the unstable situation there is naturally a source of grave concern to us  especially as it was at different times the pretext for foreign intervention and the presence of foreign troops from outside the continent at our border  which gives us grave security problems. We were gratified by the recent agreement concluded with France  which we hope will be an important step towards solving the Chad problem in accordance with the Lagos Accord on National Reconciliation in Chad  of 18 August 1979 "" and with the participation of all the Chadian parties that signed it. The Government of National Unity  headed by Goukouni Oueddei  has always been willing to achieve national reconciliation  but the rebellious elements in N'Djamena  supported by the forces of imperialism and reaction  have rejected all the serious efforts made by the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity for national reconciliation.204.	Basing itself on its belief in international peace and security  and the conviction that they are indivisible  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya supports all the efforts of the countries of the Indian Ocean to turn that ocean into a zone of peace  free of all foreign fleets and bases. We therefore call for the evacuation of United States troops from the island of Diego Garcia and the dismantling of all the military installations on that island so that its indigenous people can live there in peace.205.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya supports the aspiration of the Korean people for the reunification of its country  and calls for the establishment of the necessary conditions to bring that aboutânon-interference m its internal affairs and the withdrawal of United States troops from Korean territory.206.	My country reiterates its solidarity with all countries subjected to imperialist provocation and acts of aggression  countries such as Afghanistan and Iran.207.	Certain territories in the world are still under the yoke of colonial domination despite the achievements on the path towards decolonization. They include the territory of Puerto Rico  whose people is still struggling for decolonization and the establishment of its own independent State. The United Nations must help it and support its efforts.208.	The continued tension in Central America is also a cause of concern to the international community. It results from intervention by the United States and that country's failure to respect the right of the peoples of the region to choose their political and economic system without any foreign intervention or pressure. My country supports all the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a comprehensive and lasting solution to the problems of the region and to restore peace there. We maintain that it is possible to have peace and security in the region only if the United States stops interfering in the affairs of the States of the region and ceases to support dictatorial regimes against their peoples. Other requirements for peace and security in the area are the withdrawal of United States forces  the dismantling of its bases in Cuba and an end to its aggression.209.	The world economic order is still suffering from the crisis that has dominated it since the end of the 1960s. The measures taken to reform it have so far failed  because they are like tranquillizers; they are attempts to ease the crisis  but not to reform the system. The system can be reformed only by restructuring it so that it is in keeping with the international economic and political indicators of our time. It should take into account the interests of the developing countries  which were for the most part dominated by foreign forces when the present system was set up. Unfortunately  we note that the developed countries still impede the efforts of the international community to change the international economic order  despite all the concessions made by the developing countries as a whole.210.	The international monetary system also is unable to respond to the needs of the developing countries and to the aspirations of the present age. It should be changed so that it may be in keeping with today's economic and political realities. The system  which collapsed in August 1971 when the United States ceased to exchange the dollar tor gold  has played a negative role instead of being effective in international economic co-operation and  more particularly  in the development programmes in the developing countries. Depending on a single currency  the system is an anachronism in an age of equality and mutual respect. It is not only politically but also economically unacceptable. All attempts at reform have failed for the simple reason that reform has taken place through an institution still dominated by certain developed countries. We do not expect any serious attempts to be made within the framework of such an institution. Reforms are still being considered without the developing countries  which are still passive onlookers  unable to play any role. Reforming the international economic order should be considered within the framework of global negotiations  in a forum where representation is universal  where all voices may be heard and all points of view taken into account.211.	I should like now to refer to a matter directly related to economic development in my country: the mines and other explosives planted in Libyan territory during the Second World War. We still suffer from their detrimental effects in the economic  social and environmental fields. Hundreds of innocent people have lost their lives as a result of this problem and thousands have been incapacitated. It has also obstructed the implementation of development projects and increased their costs. It is the responsibility of the imperialist countries that planted those mines to solve this problem; they must offer adequate compensation to the countries that have suffered damage and provide them with topographic charts and all assistance needed to remove them. We hope that the United Nations will take the necessary practical steps for an inventory to be taken of the total damage that has been inflicted on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and to have compensation paid in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.212.	Like many other countries  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was subjected to occupation and colonialism during long years and it has the right to ask for reparation for the damage caused as a result of colonialism. Japan apologized to Korea for its occupation of that country and announced its willingness to offer compensation. We welcome that action and we hope that the other colonial Powers will follow suit.213.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya fully supports strengthening the role of the United Nations and promoting its effectiveness. Therefore  as we have done in previous years  we shall submit certain proposals concerning the abrogation of the right of veto  or amending that right  and granting more authority to the General Assembly. We shall continue to press for such action this year because we are convinced that the right of veto is in contravention of democratic rules. The will of the Members of the United Nations should not be at the mercy of each of the five permanent members of the Security Council  particularly in view of the fact that some of them have abused the right of veto. The Security Council has thus been deprived of its effectiveness and left unable to perform the role entrusted to it.214.	The prevailing international situationâthe tension and the economic anarchy in the worldâ may lead to catastrophe. All this confirms the role the United Nations should play and the need to strengthen that role so that the Organization can discharge its responsibilities. But the United Nations  which must face these international problems as a result of acts of imperialist intervention  is confronting a direct threat as a result of the policy of the United States  which continuously and categorically defies this international Organization.215.	A serious manifestation of that policy is the pressure it has brought to bear against UNESCO and other international humanitarian organizations of the United Nations system. Last year we witnessed insults directed against that organization by the United States Government. We see constant harassment of this Organization and certain of its Member States that are not satellites of the United States  including my own country. It is time for the United Nations to put a stop to blackmail and threats directed against peace-loving countries. After having suffered so much from wars  destruction and colonialism  the countries of the world must not now compromise the United Nations and allow any country to destroy it. It is time to take the necessary practical steps to move the United Nations Headquarters to a peace-loving country. If the United Nations cannot do so  it faces ruin. Then the countries that suffer from intervention and terrorism will have to form a wide front against imperialist intervention. Such steps would strengthen the role of this international Organization and enhance its effectiveness. 216.	Having said that  we do not harbour any aggressive intentions with respect to the American people or the United States. We extend a hand of friendship within the framework of mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of others.217.	As a non-aligned country pursuing an impartial policy  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya strongly supports the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. It reaffirms its unshakeable belief in the role of that Movement in achieving international peace and security. As a non-aligned State  we freely determine our own policy and we extend a hand to all peace- loving Statesâlarge or small  strong or weakâin order to forge relations of friendship and co-operation devoid of any form of hegemony or intervention. We do not harbour any enmity towards any people or nation. We seek only friendship and co-operation with those who agree to co-operate with us in the context of mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of others and within the framework of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations."
"83",4085,"LCA",39,1984,"ï»¿12.	Mr. President  many a distinguished statesman has occupied the presidency of this parliament of the worldâthe General Assemblyâand I have no doubt that  with your fine record of public service  you will follow the precedents of fairness and impartiality which have been the hallmark of your distinguished predecessors and that  as you pass the mantle of the presidency of this body to your successor  you  too  will be remembered as having served with honour.13.	During your presidency  Sir  you have seen a new Member  the State of Brunei Darussalam  admitted to the Organization. That this new nation has added the name ""Darussalam"" to its pre-independence designation is a happy indication of the policy it intends to pursue. As we welcome this proclamation  we also welcome this new Member to our Organization.14.	The fact that countries such as Saint Lucia and Brunei Darussalam can gain independence  and retain it against the blandishments of international predators  is a tribute to the work of the United Nations  the fortieth year of existence of which we commemorate next year.15.	The Charter of the United Nations is not only based on mutual respect for sovereignty and the peaceful settlement of disputes between States; even more important are the moral underpinnings of the principles of human rights and human dignityâ principles which are often buried in the torrents of words and the snowstorms of conflicting resolutions that daily pour forth from this body or its various agencies. It is therefore necessary sometimes to remind ourselves of the Biblical injunction concerning the Sabbath  and remember that as ""The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath""16.	The lot of ensuring that this injunction is not lost sight of has fallen upon the shoulders of the Secretary-General. On behalf of the Government of Saint Lucia  I thank him for his untiring efforts  not only in the cause of world peace but also in other  less dramatic but equally important  areas of human concern. His efforts in mobilizing resources to relieve famine in the sub-Saharan areas of Africa  whose millions live constantly in the shadow of death  will always be remembered as one of the high points of his tenure of office.17.	But there are times when  despite the efforts of the Secretary-General and his staff  the conduct of some Member States  even in the precincts of this very Hal!  drive us  in small countries  to despair and to cry out with Mark Anthony  of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:""O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts  And men have lost their reason.""18.	Time and again  resolutions passed and ratified by the United Nations have been defied or ignored by Member States. There have been attempts to condemn  without the observance of one of the most basic principles of natural justiceâhearing the other party. The ""gag rule"" has been invoked  as in the notorious case of the Grenada resolution  and the veto has been used on occasions which can only lend aid and comfort to the racist regime of South Africa. All this can lead us to conclude that the United Nations has lost its moral underpinnings and is in danger of losing that reverence and awe in which it was once held  particularly by small nations such as our own.19.	But  in the encircling gloom of the clash of angry speeches and angry denunciations by Member States of each other  even within these revered halls  of the seemingly endless arms race  and the threat of nuclear holocaust  we yet see that tiny light of hope held aloft by such agencies as UNESCO  UNDP  the Pan American Health Organization  UNICEF and a host of others  whose untiring efforts  away from the glare of news headlines  bring hope and relief to untold millions in the developing world. It is for these reasons  if for no others  that we are strong and steadfast supporters of the United Nations.20.	It is therefore in sadness  rather than in anger  that we speak when we discern attempts to dislodge the Organization from its moral foundations and weaken the voice of the collective conscience of mankind. It is in sorrow that we see the furnace of the arms race being fed with such a large proportion of the world's resources  the product of the finest brains and the labours of millions  while nightly into our very living rooms is brought the sorry image of starving children. It is in sorrow that we call attention to the fact that while some developing countries can hardly provide the basic necessities for their people  their Governments parade the latest military hardware supplied by some of the developed countries  some of which contribute not a single rouble to United Nations famine relief funds.21.	But it is in anger that we protest at the conduct of certain States which should provide moral leadership to the Organization but which encourage  wit-tingly or unwittingly  that repulsive regime of South Africa in its errant ways and its defiance  which reduces this world body to impotence. South Africa is the pariah of all nations and should be made an outcast of the world  and any conduct which in any way lends aid and comfort to that repulsive regime in the perpetuation of its racist policies must be deplored and unequivocally condemned.22.	The issue of Namibian independence continues to defy solution  as South Africa  in contemptuous defiance of world opinion  continues its illegal occupation of that Territory  enforcing its doctrine of racism upon that unhappy land. The work of the contact group of Western nations  upon which so much reliance was placed  has ended in frustration  and United Nations efforts to find a peaceful and speedy solution have been repeatedly thwarted. South Africa must be continuously pressured to comply with the edict of the United Nations  and a Namibia whose independence and neutrality is guaranteed by the United Nations must be brought into the community of nations without further delay.23.	How can some countries condemn the genocide of Hitler and Pol Pot and yet openly encourage South Africa with trade and investment? How can we live with our consciences when we stand impotent in the face of the blatant genocide of large sections of the black population  who are moved from their traditional homelands into barren lands to die of hunger and our only response is the passage of pious resolutions? How can the veto of a resolution exposing the sham of the so-called power-sharing in South Africa be justified when that sham has already been exposed by the very people it is supposed to benefit?24.	How can certain countries reconcile their superficial subscription to the Charter of the United Nations with their conduct outside the Organization? How can countries  some of our own friends  line up in mute obedience to condemn the initiative in Grenada which liberated the people of that country from the iron boot of military tyranny and removed the threat to the very existence of the small  democratic and defenceless nations of the eastern Caribbeanâan initiative that was supported by the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the Eastern Caribbean and by almost the entire population of Grenada? Yet many of those nations remain silent on the continued bleeding of the people of Afghanistan.25.	Those are questions which small countries  defenceless but for the umbrella of the moral authority of the United Nations  continue to ask. The answers  when they come  bring us but cold comfort.26.	The technological revolution  which could have been employed to solve many of the social and economic problems that beset the world  instead has brought people in every part of the globe under the mushroom cloud of fear. We now have the spectacle of two super-Powers  with contending ideologies and sharply differing political systems  both armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons capable of reaching the furthest end of the earth  standing off like characters in the cinematographic film High Noon and glaring at each other across a gulf of hostility which even sportsmen and sportswomen are not permitted to cross. But it must be realized that there can be no winners in the arms race. As we raise the stakes so  too  do we raise the danger of mutually assured destruction. This madness must stop and the resources of the earth must be put to the service of mankind to fight the only wars that should be foughtâwars against hunger  ignorance and disease.27.	Other wars are being fought  however  wars by proxy  and the chosen battlefields are countries of the developing world. Lebanon continues to bleed in agony  and we welcome the initiatives at present being undertaken to end that fratricidal strife. Nor can we fail to raise our voices in support of those who seek to end the seemingly interminable war between Iran and Iraq  a war in which so much blood and treasure is being senselessly expended.28.	It is now 40 years that there has been no peace in the Middle East. It has been said and frequently repeated that the Palestine question lies at the heart of the problem. Saint Lucia subscribes to that statement  but Saint Lucia also recognizes the fact that Israel exists and that  short of a nuclear holocaust  Israel will continue to exist. That certain countries in the area refuse to accept this fact is also at the heart of the problem. Therefore  while we support the Palestinians' right to a homeland  we also support Israel's right to exist within secure and defensible boundaries. Israel  too  if it is to retain international support  cannot fly in the face of world opinion and pursue an expansionist policy of settlements on land which  if it is to live in peace  it must eventually vacate.29.	The costs of these interminable wars in the Middle East are horrendous and  if the expenditures in military enterprises since 1948 had been used to develop a Palestinian homeland rather than to provide instruments of destruction  the Palestinians would have the highest per capita income of any nation on earth. But logic and sanity are at a high premium in that part of the world.30.	It does not appear that the poverty of a country and the destitution of its population preclude its being dragged into the arena of international conflict. Had that been the case  the people of the Republic of Chad would have enjoyed a life of peace and serenity. That is  unhappily  not the case. While the bulk of the population of that unhappy country languishes in poverty  hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to frustrate the ambitions of one international adventurer. The initiative taken by France to protect the independence of Chad is to be commended  and it is hoped that foreign troops will soon be withdrawn and that unfortunate country left to pursue its destiny without further interference from outside.31.	Wars  in the sense of armed conflict between States  are not the only cause of concern. In recent years  a new and dangerous phenomenon has emergedâthe phenomenon of State-supported terrorism. The tragedies of Rangoon and Beirut shocked the conscience of the civilized world and bear sad testimony to that fact. The perpetrators of those dastardly acts and those States which give them aid  comfort and sanctuary must be unequivocally condemned  and concerted international action must be taken to remove this scourge from our midst.32.	It would appear that the sponsors of that form of international mischief spare no country  however small or however far removed from their borders. Only one year ago  certain Governments of the eastern Caribbean  including Saint Lucia's  became aware of a conspiracy to train certain of their nationals in terrorism and sabotageâa conspiracy which was frustrated only by timely intelligence received from certain friendly countries. Such brazen acts of aggression by proxy cannot be condoned by the international community.33.	Permit me to deal briefly with matters of current concern in the Caribbean and Central America. In this area  within the last decade  there have been stirrings of a people anxious to remove the weight of centuries from its back. These stirrings  in the main  have not evoked sympathetic response from the international community but  rather  have provided opportunities for international adventurers and attracted the attention of the sensation-seeking media. The problems of the region are social and economic in origin  with roots deep in the colonial past of which they are legacies. Such problems as the unequal distribution of land and wealth  the wide disparity between rich and poor  the denial of such basic human needs as education and health facilities  deep-seated though they may be  are not amenable to military solutions. If neglect in addressing them has driven some sections of the population  in despair  to take up arms against their sea of troubles  hoping that by opposing they will end them  that should not be seen as an opportunity for international adventurers to fish in the troubled waters of social discontent  in an area hitherto free of international entanglements  and to pour in military equipment and advisers in quantities and numbers which must cause alarm as to the ultimate intentions of the suppliers of such assistance.34.	For more than a century  the Caribbean and the Americas have endeavoured to sort out their problems without international entanglement. This approach should continue  and those problems that exist must be left to the wisdom of the statesmen of the region  who  with regard to the current problems in Central America  have already taken the initiative under the umbrella of the Contadora Group. All peace-loving nations should therefore support their endeavours. This support can be convincingly demonstrated by the cessation of supplies of military equipment and the withdrawal of all military advisers from the region. What the region needs is ploughshares  not the sword; tractors  not tanks; bread  not bazookas; teachers  technicians and doctors  not military advisers  and  most important  an environment of peace in which economic development and social transformation can take place.35.	Therefore  we welcome the recommendations of the Kissinger Commission on Central America  with its emphasis on economic and social assistance. We welcome  too  the opportunities available for expanded trade and development under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the initiatives taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States members of the European Economic Community in support of the Contadora Group.36.	After centuries of colonialism throughout this hemisphere  coupled with slavery in some parts  western hemisphere leaders are wary of becoming involved in ideological struggles for fear that by so doing they might exchange one colonial master for another. Recent events in the Caribbean have forcefully demonstrated to us the need for vigilance if we are to preserve our fragile independenceâvigilance particularly in the removal of any areas of social conflict. If the Caribbean is to be made a ""zone of Peace"" as some have proposed  this should mean not only ""peace""  as opposed to military conflict  but Peace"" in terms of the removal of social conflict between various groups in our society  by removing the root causes of such conflict.37.	In this regard  we urge the appointment  specifically for the Caribbean region  of a Commission  akin to the Kissinger Commission on Central America  to address the needs of the Caribbean and to recommend a programme of economic assistance which would help in removing areas of social discontent and to provide the environment of social peace which is so crucial to economic and social development and the preservation of our democratic way of life.38.	In our part of the worldâand I speak specifically of the Commonwealth Caribbeanâwe know of one way and one way only of choosing and of changing our Governments: that is  by the ballot box  in free and fair elections  held at regularly specified times. We do not subscribe to the doctrine that power comes from the barrel of a gun but  rather  we hold steadfastly to the imperative that power comes from the will of the people  who giveth and who taketh away. It is for this reason that we became so alarmed when in 1979 one member of our closely knit family of nations departed from this traditional path. This departure provided an opportunity for international adventurers to invade our region  introducing alien ways and strange concepts intended to keep the people of Grenada in subjection far worse than colonialism and  by subversion  to extend their influence throughout the region  with domination their ultimate goal.39.	What other explanation is there for the introduction of over 10 million rounds of ammunition in a small country with a population of fewer than 100 000? What other explanation can there be for the supply to a country  surrounded by unarmed and friendly neighbours  of arms far in excess of its needs for self-defence  or for the construction of the most powerful radio station in the region and of a satellite earth station  or for the vast array of instruments of propaganda and subversion? What other explanation is there when young people from neighbouring islands are recruited and trained in subversion and terrorism and sent back home to practise their newly acquired skills?40.	Our needs in the Caribbean are great  but guns and instruments of war are not among them. In most countries of the eastern Caribbean  our only defence is a police force seldom numbering as many as 300 men  including the band  armed only with batons or ceremonial rifles. Military assistance is  therefore  not welcome.41.	However  between 1979 and 1983  the militarization of the island of Grenada progressed at a rate that caused alarm. One distant country with which we have no traditional association provided in excess of $ 15 million in military hardware  but not a single dollar for water supplies in a country where over 50 per cent of the population is without potable water. Others provided hundreds of military advisers  but not a single teacher in technical education. Armoured personnel carriers came  but not a single agricultural tractor. There were elaborate provisions for military training  but no provision for job training. Elaborate military installations were built  but not a single mile of farm road. And so the litany goes on. These were not the needs of the Grenadian people and were not the solutions to their needs.42.	We  in the eastern Caribbean  drew our own conclusion  and this gave us no comfort. In fact  we became alarmed and when the opportunity presented itself we took action under the Treaty establishing the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States for our own self-defence and self-preservation and removed this cancer of militarization from our midstâaction which is permitted under the Charter of the United Nations. Today  Grenada is a free county  and the eastern Caribbean can breathe easily again; we can sing the popular song that has now become an anthem: ""We hope the day will never come when we will awake to the sound of guns.""43.	We are peace-loving countries struggling to provide basic essentials for our people  whose history of colonization has been so long and is so recent. Those with military and imperialistic ambitions must therefore look elsewhere. The Caribbean will provide them no haven. Bayonets planted in Caribbean soil will not grow. In a few weeks' time  Grenada will have a Government elected by the democratic process  the fairness of which is open to observation by the international community. That is our way  the only way we will have it. How many countries can boast of such a record?44.	On another encouraging note  Saint Lucia applauds the recent proposals for a peaceful solution of the Beagle Channel dispute and the acceptance of these proposals by Argentina and Chile  and we congratulate these countries on so doing. I note  too  that Guatemala is prepared to negotiate a peaceful settlement of its dispute with Belize  and it is our hope that the dispute between Guyana and Venezuela  which has been submitted to the Secretary-General so that means of mediation may be found  will be speedily and satisfactorily disposed of so that these two countriesâone a brother and the other a close friendâcan then devote all their energies to the solution of their social and economic problems.45.	We  in this hemisphere  have in this manner demonstrated to the international community our approach to the solution of disputes between ourselves. It is my hope that such an approach will be used as an example in providing a solution for the Falkland-Malvinas disputeâa continuing irritant between traditional friends. One approach which I commend to the parties is that Argentina should forswear the use of force as a solution to the dispute  while the United Kingdom  for its part  should suspend the fortification of the islands pending mediation under United Nations auspices.46.	While the high drama of political issues held the spotlight  equally important  though less dramatic  were the battles of reviving the world economy from the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s  and the organs of the United Nations have played a leading role in this field. Though there are positive signs of recovery in the more developed countries  even in those the recovery is patchy and uneven  and most developing countries are still firmly held in the grip of the recession.47.	Protectionist policies adopted to shield domestic industries from competition are still obstructing the free flow of trade; prices of the primary commodities on which most developing countries depend for their very survival are still depressed and in many cases below 1975 levels; and interest rates are so high that to borrow at all is to court financial disaster.48.	The low level of earnings from exports from the third world  the decreased capital inflows and the high level of resources deflected to finance the arms race of the developed countries or to provide arms in some developing countries have resulted in a decreased demand for manufactured goods from the industrialized world. These have been analysed as the principal causes of the world recession. High interest rates have resulted not only in reduced capital inflows from the developed to the developing world but  in many cases  in a reverse flow. At current rates  the aggregate of less than five years' repaid interest equals the capital sum borrowed. This is nothing short of usury and exploitation.49.	Economic growth in the developing world j holds the key to sustained recovery in the industrialized world and  while there is a large reservoir of unsatisfied demand  with low commodity prices and high interest rates even the tenuous recovery which we now experience will not long endure.50.	As long ago as 1969  the Pearson Commission recommended in its report that the industrialized nations pledge a mere 1 per cent of their gross national product as economic assistance to the developing world. That plea was repeated in the Willy Brandt report. Many were the pledges  but few were honoured. In fact  the World Bank has reported a substantial decrease of concessionary aid flows in both real and actual terms since 1975  and there has been a disappointing response to the call for the seventh IDA replenishment. The Nordic countries are therefore to be commended for having continued  the world recession notwithstanding  to honour their commitments and  in some respects  to exceed the required target.51.	The economies of island developing States have been identified as areas for special attention. But it would appear that the concept of their special position within the international system is being eroded  as the report by UNCTAD that was to have been prepared for this session of the General Assembly is not yet available and no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming. It would appear  therefore  that in these cases the international community responds only to crises  and then too hastily and in too ill-considered a way  and consequently at too great a cost and therefore ineffectively.52.	As small countries  we are here because of the insistence of the United Nations that all countries have a right to independence  and that size and economic circumstances should not be criteria. But independence should mean more than a flag  however colourful  or an anthem  however stirring; or even a place in this body. It should mean  among other things  the ability to provide one's people with the basic amenities of civilized life. Small countries cannot  like the Israelites of old  emerge from the bondage of colonialism to die in the desert of neglect. Small countries cannot be left like orphans stranded on the international shores by the receding tide of ' colonialism  only to be gobbled up by international predators or to become client States of powerful neighbours. Small countries such as our own need the umbrella of the social and economic programmes of the United Nations. They need help to help themselves without being dragged into the slip-stream c ideological struggles. Their entry into the international community must mean more than the right to address the Assembly.53.	We sit here as equals whatever our size or importance  military or economic. It is because of the interdependence of the world community that each nation  like each man  should be his brother's keeper. The plight of the dirt farmer in the Sahel should evoke a sympathetic response in the vaulted halls of Moscow. The thirst for knowledge of a Saint Lucian child should tug at the heart-strings in Tokyo. Those who by accident of geography or history now possess most of the world's resources or the world's storehouse of knowledge must share with those who wish to cast off the bondage of underdevelopment. The goal in world politics today should therefore be not the exercise of power over the less fortunate but  rather  the dispensing of social justice to those in greatest need. This is what I referred to as the moral underpinnings of the United Nations and this is what membership of this family of nations should be all about."
"84",4156,"LKA",39,1984,"ï»¿275. It is with great pleasure that I extend to you  Sir  the warm congratulations and good wishes of Sri Lanka on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Zambia and Sri Lanka  founder members of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and fellow members of the Commonwealth  have enjoyed the most cordial of relations. We have admired your negotiating skill and witnessed your gentle but firm use of the gavel at many United Nations and non-aligned forums. Sri Lanka is therefore pleased that you  a distinguished son of Zambia  will guide us through this session.276.	My delegation wishes to place on record its appreciation of the admirable manner in which the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Jorge Illueca  conducted the business of the thirty- eighth session.277.	Sri Lanka welcomes the entry of a fellow Asian Stateâthe State of Brunei Darussalamâto the United Nations and wishes it well. Brunei Darussalam  with its long history and traditions  its resources and its location  could play a considerable role in the life of the international community.278.	In a survey of the international landscape  both political and economic  an overall impression of bleakness is unavoidable  making the imperative of international co-operation all the more compelling.279.	In the economic sphere  the prospects of a global  co-operative approach to restructuring inter-national economic relations are dim  and economic disparities between nations have heightened. A climate of economic recovery among the developed countries will  of course  provide grounds for some optimism as regards restructuring. But there is every reason to believe that the recovery of the last year may not prove to be durable.280.	As a recent study of a Commonwealth expert group on the international debt problem has indicated  the recovery owes virtually everything to the build-up in the last two years of unsustainable budget deficits through expansionary policies in a single powerful economy. It is therefore inherently fragile in not being sufficiently broad-based. At the same time  the thrust of economic policy elsewhere has been profoundly recessionary. In a word  over-expansion on one side and over-restriction on the other is the combination of macro-economic policies that needs to be corrected if the current recovery is not to turn down once again into a deep depression.281.	It is our responsibility to prepare our countries for ways of coping with the eventuality of another depression. Everyone in this forum is aware of the fact of global economic interdependence; and any recession originating with the developed countries cannot fail to have damaging consequences for developing countries as well.282.	The long-term strategy surely is to strengthen economic linkage within the third world so that we become less vulnerable to disturbances emanating from economic policy failures in the developed world. A third-world bank  or bank of the South  is one solution that has been advanced  and this is currently under* negotiation within the Group of 77.283.	It would be idle  however  to pretend that such initiatives would yield fruit in time to insulate the developing countries against the impact of any collapse of the current bout of recovery. What is required to moderate the resulting chain reaction of collapse within the third world is adequate and flexible methods of balance-of-payments financing. This can come about today only from long overdue reforms in the Bretton Woods institutionsânamely  the IMF and the World Bank. There must  at a minimum  be put in place a facility that would provide unconditional and substantial-enough finance when countries experience an external shock such as a collapse of commodity prices. The facilities available today are notoriously inadequate.284.	Otherwise  the budgets of developing countries would in turn collapseâfor example  from the failure of export revenues. Countries would then be faced with an impossible choice between curtailing their development programmes  on the one hand  and  on the other  risking inflation by printing the money needed to finance their budget deficits. A second emergency requirement would be an IMF facility to meet the international debt problem. Finally  there is the need for IMF to create special drawing rights in the required measure. An irrefutable case has been made for this by numerous organizations and authorities. This gains special weight during a period when recovery in the developed countries is as delicate as it is and when inflation has declined. A genuine and enduring recovery of the international economy requires  in brief  a global effort.285.	Only a truly international effort within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea can ensure that the full bounty of the oceans is developed for the benefit of all mankind. The developing countries need to acquire capabilities in marine affairs  particularly in science and technology  which can be best advanced through the establishment of a well-planned and co-ordinated programme under the United Nations to operate at the global and regional levels. The Indian Ocean  which is bounded by Africa and Asia  requires special emphasis in this context. A co-operative United Nations inter-agency effort would be timely and invaluable for realizing the benefits of the new ocean regime.286.	The Antarctic continent must remain free of militarization and international confrontation. The resources of that vast continent should be developed equitably  rationally and safely. Sri Lanka supports a comprehensive study of the entire Antarctic system and the establishment of an ad hoc committee for that purpose.287.	In political terms  international tension has risen and in some areas has led to situations of confrontation and conflict. Relations between the two major defence alliances have been deteriorating  and a dizzy acceleration of the arms race has been one alarming fall-out. The nuclear dimension of the armaments race bodes ill for all mankind. The nuclear deterrent theory  which is advanced as a means of securing peace  is being perilously maintained at constantly rising levels of armaments  increasing  rather than reducing  the threat of a global confrontation. Sri Lanka will always welcome  there-fore  any initiative to promote dialogue and negotiation on the priority questions of disarmament in order to break down dangerous barriers of doubt and suspicion  particularly between the super-Powers.288.	The oceans and the land mass of this planet have long been fouled by the contaminants of militarization. Now even man's last frontier  outer space itself  faces the ultimate pollution of the arms race. Sri Lanka hopes to continue at this thirty-ninth session an initiative pursued at the last two sessions for the prevention of an arms race in outer space.289.	An initiative in disarmament of special significance for Sri Lanka is the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. The States of the Indian Ocean  the great Powers and the major maritime users of the ocean are engaged in an exercise of co-operative endeavour to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean at Colombo next year. The Conference itself will not establish a zone of peace overnight but will chalk out the essential principles and the appropriate modalities  mechanisms and machinery for the establishment of the zone of peace.290.	One of the natural extensions of the Indian Ocean is the Gulf  where two non-aligned Islamic States with which Sri Lanka has the closest of relations  Iran and Iraq  are in conflict. We hope that this tragic dispute will come to a speedy end  bringing peace once more to the peoples of Iraq and Iran and security to the region.291.	The Middle East as a whole continues to be an area of tension. Numerous international gatherings held under the sponsorship of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have identified the key elements of a Middle East settlement  and international consensus has been established on these elements. It is clear that the question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East question and that no just or viable settlement is possible without the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territory and the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. These rights include the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland  the right of self-determination and the right to establish an independent State in Palestine. In the settlement of this question  the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must participate in full measure and on an equal footing with other parties. Sri Lanka has been happy to host at Colombo a resident mission of the PLO with the full diplomatic status of an embassy.292.	Sri Lanka is greatly concerned about developments in Lebanon and calls for full respect for the sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally recognised boundaries.293.	It is our firm view that  like the PLO in Palestine  SWAPO in Namibia constitutes the van-guard of the struggle by a majority people against the tyranny of a racist minority. For Namibia  a comprehensive peace plan already exists in the form of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) but  because of the intransigence of	South Africa  this remains unfulfilled. Sri Lanka rejects the linkage of extraneous issues  such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola  with Namibian independence.294.	In South Africa itself  the apartheid regime has sought to foster so-called constitutional reforms to tighten its grip on the majority people of South Africa. Sri Lanka expresses its solidarity with the majority people of South Africa in their legitimate struggle for a non-racial democratic society in a united  non-fragmented South Africa.295.	Although the respective situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have each a separate and distinct complex of circumstances at root  Sri Lanka believes that a just and lasting peace is not possible in either country unless it is founded on a comprehensive political solution in which the indispensable elements would be the withdrawal of foreign forces and guarantees to ensure the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of the respective States. TP Secretary-General's efforts to find solutions to these questions require the full support of the international community  particularly the parties directly concerned.296.	The instability and insecurity sensed by the States of Central America cause us concern. It is hoped that the Contadora process will help ensure the preservation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of those States and bring stability and security to that region.297.	Sri Lanka supports the desire of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully through direct dialogue  without foreign interference and in conformity with the principles of the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972.298.	In regard to Cyprus  we support the endeavours of the Secretary-General to encourage meaningful intercommunal talks in order to effect a viable settlement which will bring peace to the Republic of Cyprus. No settlement is possible without the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from the northern section of Cyprus. Sri Lanka has consistently supported the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. I should like to emphasize that no State should use its armed forces to interfere or intervene in the internal affairs of another State on any grounds. Interference and intervention on the grounds of ethnic interests and affinities with people in other States should be severely checked  in the interest of international stability. Aggression remains aggression even when wreathed in expressions of concern for the welfare of kindred racial or religious groups elsewhere.299.	In the aftermath of the Second World War  individual States  depending on differing perceptions of their defence needs  followed different strategies. Some joined mutually exclusive military alliances; some opted for neutrality; and many committed themselves to a policy of non-alignment. In post-war times  many States have had to endure threats to their independence and freedom. It is important to note that those affected have been mainly small States: Cyprus  Kampuchea  Afghanistan.300.	It is therefore relevant in this connection to recall the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations 	and to reiterate that the territory of no State should be permitted to be used for the preparation or commission of hostile acts against the territory of another State. There can be no contextual application of these principles  no limiting qualifications  no extenuating arguments to justify threat  pressure or subversion. These principles apply universally  be it in Sri Lanka's own area of South Asia or in the distant region of Central America.301.	Sri Lanka is a democratic  multiracial  multi-lingual  multi-religious country. We are committed to the rule of law. We respect the rights of the individual. The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race  religion or language. Historically  we have been a model of communal harmony for centuries. The communal disturbances of July of last year were therefore a tragic development in the life of our nation. Attempts have been made by certain ill-motivated parties outside Sri Lanka to pillory us and to place us permanently in the dock. It is a sad commentary on international relations that the aberrations of small States are sensationalized and blown up to massive proportions.302.	The President and the Government of Sri Lanka have been working  despite set-backs  to find a political solution to the problems we face. An all- party conference  in which the majority groups as well as the minority groups are represented  is meeting under the leadership of the President and is striving to find solutions that will meet with the acceptance of all concerned.303.	Meanwhile  motley groups of terrorists who seek to impose  through violence and terror  a separate State based on racist grounds have made the application of the democratic process much more difficult. These terrorists  who constitute only a small minority within the Tamil community  direct their violent campaign not only against the majority community and security forces but also against innocent civilian members of the Tamil community who are committed to a united multiracial Sri Lanka.304.	The terrorist group finds refuge  training  sympathy and even encouragement on foreign territory  posing a rising threat of destabilization of the country.305.	Terrorism has its sordid international ramifications. International co-operation is therefore vital in dealing with and eliminating international terror-ism. Last year the General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution which called on all States to fulfil their obligations under international law to refrain from organizing  instigating  assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State [resolution 38/130].306.	The President of Sri Lanka has proposed concerted action by the international community through the United Nations to eradicate international terrorism. The United Nations  in keeping with agreed international instruments  should once more urge and  indeed  ensure that all States co-operate more closely with one another  especially through the exchange of relevant information concerning the prevention and combating of international terrorism and the conclusion of special treaties  in particular to ensure the extradition or prosecution of terrorists. We believe that the United Nations should take effective steps to establish machinery to implement agreed measures against international terrorism.307.	It has been my privilege to represent Sri Lanka at several General Assembly sessions. The perspective that presents itself at this session  on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  is neither worse nor better than that of the last few years. We must therefore guard against a sense of resignation  which would lead either to despair and apathy  on the one hand  or to an aggressive and callous pursuit of narrow interests  on the other. Both extremes are dangerous.308.	Recently  the Secretary-General described the option before us as between unilateralism and multilateralism. The United Nations is composed of 159 independent nations  each with definite commitments to its people. In exploiting the full potential of this great Assembly for building greater global harmony and understanding  we should ensure that all States  irrespective of differences in size  economic strength and military muscle  command equal acceptance  respect and dignity in the demonstration of the Organization's will."
"85",4199,"LSO",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  at the very outset permits me to extend to you and to the members of the Assembly fraternal greetings and a message of peace from King Moshoeshoe II  the Government and the people of Lesotho. We are pleased to congratulate you on your well-deserved unanimous election to the presidency of this session.This augurs well for all of us because your great country  Zambia  under the leadership of President Kenneth Kaunda  has been in the forefront of the freedom struggle that has swept from the north to the southern part of our continent. While congratulating you as an illustrious son of Africa  we take special pride in recalling that you received the first part of your advanced education in the Kingdom of Lesotho  at what was then the Pius XII College. We pledge our full support to you and to the other officers.5.	Allow me to seize this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  who served concurrently as the President of his great country  Panama.6.	As a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  Lesotho warmly congratulates and welcomes the State of Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations. The admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations is a reminder to all of us that this is a universal Organization charged with responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security. Indeed  the Secretary General  whom we congratulate on his lucid and succinct report  has stated that ""the United Nations is a unique and ideal forum for discussing and solving international problems and conflicts even between the superpowers.7.	Let us therefore take this auspicious occasion of the admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations to rededicate ourselves to the ideals and objectives of the United Nations as enshrined in its Charter.8.	As we meet again  the international economic crisis continues to threaten the survival of small developing nations. Their efforts to restructure their economies are frustrated by the polarized manipulation and refusal of the developed countries to accept the new international economic order.9.	The stalemate in the global negotiations has further organized the North South relationship into a curious rectangular arrangement of first  second  third and fourth worlds. In this scenario  development strategies conceived in the last decade have degenerated into a thirst for regional domination characterized by coercion and blackmail. Failure to arrest this trend and revert to a normal dialogue between nations can only take the world back to the colonial era.10.	My country  as one of the landlocked and least developed among the developing countries and one of the hardest hit by economics and spiralling inflation  is gravely concerned at the stalemate in the North South dialogue  which so far happens to be the only possible means of restructuring the present unjust economic order.11.	Of course  resolutions have been adopted by various United Nations institutions and efforts have been made in an attempt to improve the economic conditions of the least developed countries. These endeavours may not have generated substantive gains  but this fact need not diminish our will and determination to achieve our set goals of development. The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983  served as a reminder to the developing countries of the importance of mutual cooperation. The developing countries should utilize their experience further to promote their unity and move towards self-reliance.12.	Although multilateral cooperation has made substantial contributions to economic and social development since the last world war  there is a growing awareness of the need among developing countries for reform of the existing international monetary and financial systems. It is almost 40 years since the Bretton Woods blueprint was agreed upon as the basic framework for global economic relationships. Today  near chaos and disorder have made it urgently necessary to re-examine the system and the whole machinery.13.	Even though there are diverse views on reform  we believe that close dialogue would culminate in some practical reforms. In Toronto  the Commonwealth Finance Ministers made commendable recommendations  which have my delegation's full support. That the Development Committee of the World Bank is considering those recommendations is encouraging. The international community should work towards the day when the world's financial and trading systems will be free of major banking crises  disequilibrium in external payments  stagnant growth  increasing trade barriers  volatile exchange rates and reduced investments due to high inflation and interest rates. No blame is being placed on any single country or group of countries for the prevailing uncertainties  but there is no doubt that the major industrialized countries have a special responsibility to initiate reforms.14.	The Secretary General has called the attention of the international community to the deteriorating economic and social crisis in Africa  particularly in the drought stricken countries. This call could not have come at a more opportune moment  because we  in Lesotho  have experienced unprecedented drought for the past three to four years  resulting in famine  malnutrition and death. While we express our appreciation to those countries which have responded positively to the call  we must state that the situation is not getting better. Meagre resources have been redirected towards emergency programmes  leaving very little for normal development activities. We therefore take this opportunity to welcome the initiative of the FAO and the World Bank group in bringing to the fore the crisis situation in sub-Saharan Africa  of which Lesotho is an integral part. It is to be hoped that the international community will respond positively and generously to requests for assistance in order to alleviate the plight of the peoples of the region.15.	Today  the global political climate is more volatile than ever before. The deepening confrontation in East West relations and the growing tendency to resort to force is of the greatest concern to Lesotho and its peace-loving people. In the past year there has been no progress in arms control negotiations. It is our earnest hope that the recent contacts signal a new era whose atmosphere will replace the current atmosphere of heightened fear of nuclear confrontation and violence.16.	There has been violence in many parts of the world. The situation in Cyprus remains unresolved although the issue has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for many years. Indeed  recent developments have exacerbated the problems in that friendly Commonwealth country. The Government of Lesotho continues to support territorial integrity and independence for Cyprus. We are encouraged by and commend the Secretary General's efforts to that end.17.	The situation in Central and Latin America continues to be characterized by interference in the internal affairs of smaller States. Hence our firm support for the Contadora initiatives and the opening of dialogue between the United States and Nicaragua. We hope that the peoples of Central and Latin America will soon be left alone to live in peace  free of external pressures and intimidation.18.	A serious threat to world peace persists in the Middle East. The Palestine issue is at the heart of that problem. We are convinced that Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which endorses the right of all countries of the region to exist  constitutes a just and comprehensive solution. We contend further that all conquered territories must be returned and that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  especially their right to self-determination  must be respected.19.	The Iraqi Iranian war is another outstanding international conflict in which many lives have already been lost. What is even more painful about that war is that it involves two fraternal nonaligned States. Lesotho calls for a negotiated settlement to end that fratricidal war and commends the Secretary General and others for their efforts in trying to bring about peace in the area.20.	On the Korean question  the Lesotho Government has always supported the Korean people's desire to reunify their country peacefully  without foreign interference. Talks have been held between the parties concerned with the aim of achieving genuine reunification. My delegation urges that those talks continue.21.	There are many other areas of world tension  but representatives will bear with me if I single out southern Africa  since it is the most vexing problem and could engulf us in an inferno of immeasurable proportions. The Government of Lesotho has consistently expressed its position on the Namibian question.22.	The United Nations plan for Namibia's independence remains unimplemented. The diplomatic efforts launched by the five Western Powers to persuade South Africa to end its illegal occupation of Namibia have not shown any progress. Many issues that had already been resolved are being reopened and irrelevant matters are being drawn in. There is insistence that Namibia cannot be independent unless Cuban troops are withdrawn from Angola.23.	We have maintained that Cuban troops are in Angola at the invitation of the Angolan Governmentâa bilateral arrangement between sovereign States. The illegal occupation of Namibia is a separate  colonial issue which should be treated as such and not confused with other extraneous matters. South Africa ought to set a date for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and a date for Namibia's independence.24.	The General Assembly  in its resolutions 38/11 and 39/2  unequivocally rejected the so-called constitutional reforms. Since independence  Lesotho has upheld a policy of the resolution of problems between nations through dialogue. Even today the Government of Lesotho is still committed to that policy. We are  however  apprehensive that as long as apartheid exists our relations with our neighbour will always present problems  much as both sides would like them to be as reasonable as possible. The Government of Lesotho therefore feels strongly that the question of apartheid must be addressed as seriously as possible if there is to be genuine peace in that part of the world. The world should not be deceived into thinking that the push for political change in South Africa is mainly externally motivated. Recent events in that country are compelling examples of the impatience of the majority of the black masses. What we all have to bear in mind is that a people determined to liberate itself will not be halted by anything or anybody.25.	The consequent reprisals by the South African authorities have  as usual  resulted in an influx of South African refugees into my country. In spite of serious pressures from our powerful neighbour  we find ourselves unable to deny sanctuary to those who are denied civil and political rights. This is  first  because  as King Moshoeshoe II stated in the Security Council on 14 December 1982  we are ourselves a nation of refugees. That is why we do not place refugees in camps; instead  we integrate them into our society. Secondly  it is because we are obliged to honour international conventions on refugees to which we are parties.26.	Lesotho will continue to receive those who run to it for sanctuary. But we shall also insist  as in the past  that our country should not be used as a springboard for attacks against other countries. The Government of Lesotho has made a declaration to that effect  which has been reproduced in Security Council document S/16746. It is because we are committed to a policy of good neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence that we have continued to impress upon our neighbour that it would greatly facilitate matters for us if the South African Government were to engage in a serious and meaningful dialogue with the black people of that country  the legitimacy of whose struggle for a place in the sun is accepted by the Assembly.27.	The struggle of the people of South Africa affects us in Lesotho directly  for  as my Prime Minister has stated  when these people flee to our country we are used as scapegoats and are falsely accused of giving military bases to the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC].28.	Sometimes those accusations against us become so acrimonious that our very independence and sovereignty are threatened  as was the case recently when South Africa interfered with goods destined for Lesotho from other countries and at the same time restricted the movement of people across our common borders. Another very disturbing dimension in this respect concerns the armed bandits who cross our borders from South Africa into our country to commit acts of murder and sabotage. To contain this situation we have had to divert funds which could otherwise have been used for development to strengthen our internal security.29.	In this volatile situation  in which the positions of the white rulers of South Africa and the black majority of that country seem to be drifting further apart  as a result of which we  in Lesotho  are not able to concentrate on development  my Prime Minister  Mr. Jonathan  has offered himself as a catalyst between the two sides  with Lesotho as a venue for discussions towards resolving the conflict between them. We have no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of another country  but we are affected because of our geographical position.30.	We  in Lesotho  do not subscribe to the view that peaceful coexistence among neighbouring countries in southern Africa can be attained through the signing of so-called nonaggression pacts. It is our firm and sincere belief that the problem of southern Africa  at the centre of which is the apartheid system  can be resolved by the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa. As a matter of fact  we have stated that we have no problem coexisting peacefully with South Africa and  indeed  the current dialogue  if carried out in good faith  holds good prospects for normalization of relations. But we also think that the continuing influx of refugees into our country  which we cannot stop  will continue to threaten these relations which are showing signs of improvement.31.	We should like to express a very special word of gratitude and appreciation to the friendly countries and international organizations which gave us economic support and political solidarity in our socioeconomic development efforts.32.	Our ability to withstand the enormous political pressures which undermine our sovereignty and territorial integrity is firmly based on our historical background. We are happy that the international community is behind us."
"86",4268,"LUX",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like first to congratulate Mr. Paul Lusakamost warmly on his election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His profound knowledge of the workings of this world Organization will  I am sure  exercise a favourable influence on our debates and improve their effectiveness. The presence at the head of this Assembly of an eminent African personality will serve to focus our attention on the critical economic situation facing many countries of Africa following the droughts and other natural disasters which have afflicted the continent over the last few years  and will also underline the urgent need for the international community to provide assistance based on strength and solidarity.326.	It is a pleasure for me to reaffirm once again our confidence in the Secretary General  whose discreet and persevering efforts to bring about reconciliation at the international level deserve admiration  recognition and gratitude. At a time when the satisfactory settlement of conflicts and critical situations is encountering growing difficulties in the international forums created especially to resolve them  the initiatives of the Secretary General when it is a question of bringing parties closer together and creating a climate of understanding between them assume major importance. This action inevitably and necessarily rules out the publicity which accompanies public debate. Thus I feel it is essential to encourage the Secretary General to continue unswervingly along the path he has followed since he has been at the head of this Organization. I should like to congratulate him on the commitment he has obtained from Iraq and Iran to cease attacks on purely civilian targets  a commitment which is apparently being respected. I hope that the new efforts which the Secretary General has undertaken this summer to solve the problem of Cyprus will soon bear fruit  and I make an urgent appeal to the two communities of the island to cooperate faithfully with him.327.	I should like to address a warm welcome to the delegation of Brunei Darussalam  which has just joined the United Nations.328.	The balance sheet of the international situation  which we review here each year at the beginning of the General Assembly session  once again hardly gives grounds for euphoria or optimism.329.	Military confrontations  open or covert conflicts and the critical tensions that have affected various regions of our planet for years  and in some cases for many years  persist  frequently with increased savagery. The use of force and the threat of the use of force are increasing. 330.	In many countries the most elementary human rights  which have long been dearly defined in universally recognized international instruments  continue to be ignored or even flouted with impunity.331.	Despite some encouraging signs  the economic recovery remains uncertain. Monetary disorder  the financial crisis and  in particular  international indebtedness are worsening. As usual  the most impoverished countries are the worst affected.332.	The bodies whose mandate it is to ensure that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations are respected and that its purposes are achieved seem incapable of halting this trend and shouldering their responsibilities. Confronted with a worsening situation  hope is giving way to disenchantment and public opinion is beginning to ask questions about the meaning and reality of our efforts.333.	The time has therefore come for Governments to react by improving our working methods as appropriate  concentrating attention as much as possible on the essentials and carefully studying practical measures to put an end to our difficulties  particularly by showing foresight and political will.334.	Two days ago my Irish colleague  Mr. Barry  informed the Assembly [6th meeting] of the joint position adopted by the members of the European Community with regard to the range of difficulties in international relations. I should like to devote my own comments to those difficulties which I believe deserve particular attention.335.	First  I cannot conceal my concern at the worsening climate of East West relations  which has been seen particularly in the recent controversy between the two superpowers. If on the one hand there have been some regrettable remarks or the use of language that is sometimes a little too strong for our taste  on the other we have encountered a stream of offensive historic comparisons  unfounded accusations  false insinuations and even appeals to hatred.336.	We hope that the statement to the General Assembly by the President of the United States [4th assembly] and the contacts in the past few days between the delegations of the two superpowers will mark a tum for the better in this regard.337.	Indeed  it is high time we returned to more moderate language and respected the basic principles contained in the Nixon-Brezhnev declaration of 29 May 1972. That important document does not provide simply for the ""recognition of the security interests of the parties based on the principle of equality"" but attaches equal importance to the ""renunciation of the use or threat of force"" and of ""efforts to obtain unilateral advantage at the expense of the other  directly or indirectly""; it includes the commitment of the parties ""to do everything in their power so that conflicts or situations will not arise which would serve to increase international tensions""  as well as the promise to ""always exercise restraint"".338.	Only respect for those principles can lead to the reestablishment of a better climate and to the success of the current negotiations or those to come.339.	However  there must be rapid progress on disarmament  which has for so long occupied an important place in the General Assembly's work. This problem is rightly still the subject of the anxious concern of all mankind  for the arms race has accelerated in a worrying way with the accumulation of unprecedented stockpiles of weapons and their continued sophistication through scientific and technological progress. Our planet is being transformed into a more and more dangerous powder keg. The extension of the arms race to outer space gives it a new dimension with unforeseeable consequences.340.	This development is increasing the threat of a general conflagration  since it multiplies the possibility of miscalculation in the assessment of each other's intentions. It makes it more and more unlikely that possible monitoring measures will succeed. It takes away from civilian use the vast human  economic and financial resources invested in the military effort  resources whose absence is doubly felt in this period of economic recession.341.	For these diverse reasons my country has always encouraged  and it continues to support  efforts to re-establish confidence in international relations and to reduce the level of armaments to more reasonable proportionsâthat is  compatible with the real defence needs of everyone.342.	That is why we placed great hopes on the opening of negotiations on strategic weapons as well as those concerning intermediate range missiles. The halt of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on missiles in Europe is a reverse all the more troublesome because the difficulties facing those two Powers in beginning negotiations on the use of outer space for military purposes shows how essential it is to loosen the deadlock and to resume at this level a dialogue which has been interrupted. Such a resumption is indispensable  as what is at stake is of vital interest to the whole world.343.	In this respect we share the opinion of the Secretary General when he declares that any effortâ whether bilateral or multilateralâwhose final goal is to prevent an arms race in space should be encouraged. The dialogue should be resumed without preconditions  as any default or even delay might result in a new escalation.344.	Apart from its harmful effects on international security and the safeguarding of peace  the arms race involves a huge waste of material resources whose release would benefit economic development generally and that of the developing  countries in particular.345.	The maintenance of peace also depends on success in the struggle against underdevelopment and can be soundly based only on a more just and better balanced economic and social order.346.	The North South dialogue on international economic cooperation for development  which once aroused so much hope  has been marking time for some years. Despite serious appeals repeated on all sides and despite continued informal consultations  the political will is lacking when it is a question of beginning effective global negotiations on the basis laid down at the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development  held at Cancun in 1981. There is no clear prospect of their beginning as yet. However  immediate steps are urgently required  as the economic recession has already produced particularly harmful effects in the developing countries  whose per capita income has been falling for a number of years.347.	Moreover  the prospects for the immediate future are not rosy. There is little likelihood of a strengthening of commodity prices and a return to growth in international trade in general. Sources of finance are drying up because of the unprecedented size of the international debt  extreme austerity measures are blocking recovery and protectionism is reappearing. All these factors together will  by the force of events  slow down the return of economic growth on the world scale  if we do not succeed in reversing this trend.348.	It is only by becoming aware of the interdependence between industrialized countries and developing countries that we have a chance together  in solidarity with one another  to start a constructive dialogue by agreeing on concrete measures  formulated in realistic terms  aimed at promoting a return to growth.349.	In this respect  I share the view of my eminent French colleague  Mr. Claude Cheysson  who some time ago proposed a ""planetary New Deal"". He said:""It is a planetary New Deal that should be talked about today  the granting of the right to development  to consumption  for hundreds of millions of people. Have we forgotten that our prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s was possible only because earlier the less advanced sectors of industrialized societies had gained access to consumer and leisure markets as a consequence of bold social measures adopted before and immediately after the war: in the United States  thanks to the New Deal; in England  following the policy set out by Beveridge; and in France  by the reforms of 1936 and those following the liberation? A voluntarist policy must permit this same progress at the world level in the years to come.""350.	If we are faced with a crisis today  it is due in large measure to the fact that the economic machine is blocked owing to inequality in the distribution of revenues at the world level: on the one hand  there are countries which have a powerful industrial base but lack outlets; on the other hand  there are very many nations lacking in purchasing power.351.	External aid  however  can reactivate the economy in the third world only if it is synchronized judiciously with appropriate internal policies. The consequences of international monetary and economic disorder are too grave not to impose urgently on the international community the obligation to work in common with foresight to restore order under the auspices of the United Nations.352.	But the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations will not be realized and the mission of the Organization will not be accomplished unless the safeguarding of peace and economic development are matched everywhere with effective respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the expressed provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later conventions connected with it.353.	Unfortunately  there is ever more frequent confirmation that in various parts of the world flagrant violations of those international covenants are being committed almost daily: racial discrimination  arbitrary arrests  improper detentions  particularly in psychiatric hospitals  torture  inhuman and degrading treatment  and limitations on the free movement of people are current practices in many countries and are offences to human dignity.354.	The new Government of Luxembourg formed after the legislative elections of 17 June 1984 will adopt a particularly firm and steadfast position in this area. It will never hesitate to stigmatize such acts and condemn them unreservedly  whatever the country in which they occur and under whatever pretext they are resorted to  for there is no doubt that all violations of human rights go beyond the framework of exclusive national competence.355.	We will not accept either the argument that the respect of economic rights makes it possible to side step ""with an ironic smile"" any criticism on the subject of respect for political rights.356.	For our part  we adhere firmly to General Assembly resolution 37/200  which states  in paragraph 1:""that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from the promotion and protection of the others"".357.	The impartial and persistent efforts of Amnesty International over the years to make international public opinion aware of the violations of human rights deserve praise and encouragement. The Human Rights Committee  for its part  whose mission is to follow the obligations assumed by Member States  would benefit from bringing its investigation to bear on specific consideration of the individual cases before it rather than on a general analysis of the constitutional rules and laws in force  whose scope frequently remains theoretical.358.	The preparation by the Commission on Human Rights of a draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment will make it possible  we hope  to expand usefully the framework of the conventional provisions applicable in this area. But it is essential that articles 19 and 20 of the draft  relating to the submission and consideration of reports by States and to the establishment of an arrangement for investigations  are an integral part of the system for the mandatory implementation of the convention  to be applied to all States which adhere to it.359.	We condemn and reject once again most categorically the policy of apartheid pursued by South Africa  which should put an end to it once and for all by establishing a democratic society in which the fundamental freedoms and political rights of all citizens are respected. In addition  South Africa should stop blocking Namibia's accession to independence by complying with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).360.	When mentioning the problem of human rights  I cannot pass over in silence the concerns mingled with hope and sympathy which we feel given the development of the situation in Poland  where we welcome the measures of amnesty in favour of political prisoners. We hope that the authorities will enter into a sincere and genuine dialogue with the organizations representing the labour movement  which would be a first step towards genuine national reconciliation.361.	An undeniable assault on human rights and on the right of peoples to self-determination is  unfortunately  lingering stubbornly in Afghanistan. The Soviet military intervention which has continued over the past four and a half years is growing in savagery following an increase m methods used to put an end to popular resistance  particularly by high altitude bombing. The outside world cannot stifle its condemnation in the light of such a merciless escalation. A peaceful settlement in keeping with the various resolutions adopted over the last few years by the General Assembly is the sole admissible and honourable way out of the present deadlock.362.	The same applies to Cambodia.363.	There are also manifold reasons for disquiet with regard to the ongoing war between Iraq and Iran  which has reached a new level with attacks against shipping in the Gulf. This escalation is likely to drag into that conflict States which have so far remained on the sidelines. Although the attempts at mediation have not yet met with success  efforts should be redoubled to calm passions  unblock the situation  put an end to this bloody struggle and halt the sufferings of the two peoples by respecting their legitimate reciprocal interests.364.	During the past year violence has continued to claim many innocent victims in Lebanon. The example of that country shows once again that the use of force creates more difficulties than it solves.365.	Even if complete calm does not yet reign in Lebanon  we can be pleased with the progress which has been made towards national reconciliation and which deserves our total encouragement.366.	It is important that the international community now redouble its efforts so that Lebanon's sovereignty  territorial integrity  independence and unity be restored and respected and that there be a withdrawal of Israeli and all other foreign forces whose presence is not desired by the Government of Lebanon.367.	To achieve a comprehensive settlement in the Near East  we must necessarily take into account the various basic facts that have long been known. They have not changed. Such a settlement can be envisaged only provided that it includes recognition of the right of each State  including Lebanon and Israel  to live in security within safe  recognized and guaranteed borders  together with the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination with all that that implies. The multiplication in the area  particularly in the occupied territories  of contrary to international law will only delay and further complicate the development of a viable solution. All those directly concerned should  willy-nilly  consent to meeting around the negotiating table.368.	Latin America offers both cause for great concern and grounds for hope.369.	We can only energetically condemn the bloody repression of peaceful demonstrations that has just taken place once again in Chile.370.	We have noted with satisfaction  in other countries  a gradual return towards democracy and  at least in Colombia  a movement towards the settlement of domestic disputes by peaceful means. We very much hope that those examples will be studied elsewhere and that in Central America in particular the efforts of the Contadora Group will meet with success.371.	The comment that I made earlier in connection with the need simultaneously to respect all categories of human rights applies particularly with reference to Latin America.372.	Next year the United Nations will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of its establishment. During this period the international community has undergone profound changes: it has been enlarged considerably following the accession to independence of a large number of States which were formerly colonial Territories.373.	We are pleased at this  but we realize at the same time that while the debate has gained in depth and intensity it has also become more complex  because the immediate concerns and the objectives of the various participants are not always the same  while the political regimes and the economic and social conditions in those countries have become markedly different.374.	Furthermore  the results achieved have not matched the immense hopes which the peoples represented at San Francisco placed in the Charter of the United Nations  which  of course  presupposed the active cooperation of each Member State in the attainment of common objectives. The proper application of the Charter entails if not perfect understanding at least a sincere desire on the part of the permanent members of the Security Council to seek cooperation through the world Organization. This is not  however  the case at present. The relations between the two superpowers are going through a difficult period and have practically reached deadlock. We can only regret this and hope that the dialogue between them will be resumed as speedily as possible and that mutual distrust can be dissipated. Only thus can the safeguarding of peace and the expansion of cooperationâin other words  the success of our common enterpriseâbe achieved."
"87",4341,"MAR",39,1984,"ï»¿Before beginning my statement  Sir  I wish to convey to you  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You have been chosen for this post because of your competence and your experience. This fortunate choice also expresses the esteem in which your country  the brother country of Zambia  and the continent of Africa are held. I am happy to assure you that my delegation is ready to give you its whole-hearted support in the fulfilment of your functions.2.	I wish to thank most warmly Mr. Jorge Illueca  your predecessor  and to pay a tribute to him for the outstanding way in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session.3.	It is with great pleasure that I pay a tribute also to the work of the Secretary-General in the service of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.4.	It is also a pleasure to welcome to our midst the Sultanate of Brunei Darussalam  which has just been admitted to the United Nations and which  through its efforts and its action  will certainly make its contribution to the work of the Organization.5.	This new session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international scene is particularly strewn with risks. Tension is constantly increasing  disputes are becoming aggravated and increasingly acute  the economic crisis is striking without pity at States  the gap between the rich and the poor countries is growing and the arms race  whose threat to international peace and security cannot be overemphasized  is being accelerated despite the good will of those who have sought in vain to slow it down.6.	This session's agenda includes for consideration various questions that are both important and complex  prominent among them being the Middle East crisis and the question of Palestine  a question which is of major concern to world public opinion and constitutes a severe threat to world peace  stability and security.7.	In the Middle East  the Palestinian people continues to endure deprivations and a rootless existence and to be the victim of tyranny  injustice and oppression.8.	For 36 years the indigenous Arab people has been fighting for its freedom and inalienable rights  which have been recognized by the international community. That people expects the United Nations to help them to recover its rights and to resolve this problem  which poses a grave threat to stability and peace in the Middle East and in the world.9.	The constant attitude adopted by Israel vis-a-vis the resolutions adopted by the Organization on this question is a blatant example of violation of the Charter and contempt for the role and credibility of the United Nations. In the region  Israel has followed a course of action without precedent in the history of colonization. It has pursued systematically the same policy of uprooting the Palestinian people  seizing its lands and property and doing its utmost to erase all traces of its civilization and to cast a slur upon the sacredness of its holy places. Israel was not content with trying to suppress the Palestinians as a people by Judaizing their land: it has followed the same policy with regard to neighbouring Arab States  occupying and annexing certain of their territories.10.	On this question  the United Nations has adopted a large number of resolutions  all of which have recognized that the Palestinian people has the right to return  the right to self-determination and the right to establish on its territory an independent State  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. These resolutions condemn the Israeli policy of aggression represented by its occupation of territories. They call upon Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories  but Israel has totally disregarded the United Nations resolutions and indeed  has stubbornly continued to implement its policy of expansion and usurpation.11.	The occupied Palestinian territory has recently experienced a new phase of the repressive policy  practised in order to empty the villages and towns of their Arab populations in order to Judaize them and establish new settlements. The town of Al-Quds al- Sharif is daily the scene of grave events designed to Judaize the Holy City and change its physical character; the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque has been directly threatened by excavations in the subsoil and around that building by the occupation authorities. The Israeli authorities have been pursuing the implementation of their plan in disregard for the feelings of Muslims and Christians and thus continue to disregard Security Council resolutions calling upon it to respect the status of Al-Quds.12.	The Kingdom of Morocco  which had the honour of serving as th3 host country of the Fourth Islamic Summit Conference  held at Casablanca from 16 to 19 January 1984  and whose King  Hassan II  acted in his capacity as President of that Conference and of the Al-Quds Committee  expresses its condemnation of those practices and appeals to the international community to guarantee respect for the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning Al-Quds al-Sharif  the question of Palestine and the occupied Arab territories.13.	The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez in November 1981 and September 1982  reaffirmed the dedication of the Arab nation to peace based on justice. The Arab Heads of State adopted on 9 September 1982 the Arab peace plan  which guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the peace and security of the States of the region. Through this clear and feasible plan  the Arab sovereigns and heads of State have demonstrated their open-mindedness and sincere desire for peace. They have made their positive contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the Middle East.14.	We believe that the Middle East problem  which has proved so difficult to solve and which continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security  can be resolved by an amalgam of the Arab peace plan and the plan proposed by President Reagan of the United States on 1 September 1982. We feel also that a solution to the Middle East problem requires that the Soviet Union be involved in its elaboration  in view of the international responsibilities of that great Power. This is the consistent position of my Sovereign  King Hassan II.15.	The fraternal people of Lebanon is still enduring the drastic consequences of Israel's occupation of its territories. The situation in that country has deteriorated gravely; the peace and security of the whole region are thereby threatened. Morocco  which is united with Lebanon by links of brotherhood  reaffirms its total support for the efforts of the Lebanese Government to bring about national reconciliation and safeguard Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. We give our unreserved support to the Lebanese demand for the withdrawal from its territories of the Israeli occupation forces.16.	For more than four years  an atrocious war has been waged between two neighbouring Islamic countries  Iraq and Iran. The Kingdom of Morocco deeply deplores the continuation of that war  which  with each passing day  further destroys the potential of the two brotherly peoples. We hope that wisdom and common sense will prevail and that after the conclusion of a cease-fire the two countries will arrive at a solution capable of restoring peace and security to the region  in keeping with Security Council resolutions.17.	We wish to express our satisfaction with the positive attitude of Iraq  reflected in its decision to abide by the resolutions of the Security Council and respond favourably to the mediation initiatives undertaken to put an end to the bloodshed. At the same time  the Kingdom of Morocco ardently hopes that Iran will eventually adopt the same stance so as to guarantee the restoration of peace and stability and the safeguarding of Islamic energies and potential.18.	We hope that the Islamic Peace Committee  under the presidency of Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  President of the Republic of the Gambia  together with the other bodies acting to promote peace  will attain successful results and that the region will thus recover its tranquillity and security  enabling the two neighbours to get on with their work of national construction  in keeping with the aspirations of their peoples for progress and well-being. We hope that mutual goodwill will be shown and that the international community will act vigorously to put an end to this terrible war.19.	Morocco  a country located on the African continent  takes a great interest to African events and problems. For that reason  guided by the awareness of its responsibilities  it has always striven and still strives for the liberation  independence and territorial integrity of the African States and the consolidation of their stability and security.20.	In southern Africa  the Namibian people is struggling for its freedom and independence. Morocco reaffirms its support for the brother people of Namibia  which  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its national organization  must obtain complete independence and the exercise of its rights  in conformity with the resolutions of the Security Council  particularly resolution 435 (1978).21.	The people of South Africa continues to endure the consequences of the policy of racial discrimination. My country  which has always condemned racism in all its forms  once again demands that everything possible is done to put an end to the policy of apartheid  a policy inimical to human values and incompatible with moral principles.22.	The African continent is suffering the effects of two natural disasters: drought and desertification. The countries of the Sahel are almost permanently affected by drought; desertification also affects those countries and threatens to spread to vast areas of Africa. Large numbers of people have been obliged to leave their areas  as a result of which the economic and social situation of the countries concerned has seriously deteriorated. We believe that these disasters can be tackled effectively only by means of far- reaching international action. Immediate arrangements must be made to help the stricken countries and make it possible to alleviate the consequences of these disasters.23.	These situations undoubtedly constitute real problems for Africa. The countries of the continent are called on to do their utmost  together  to resolve them  instead of being preoccupied with artificial and imaginary problems sustained by selfish considerations.24.	The north-west region of Africa is a setting for one such artificial problemâthat of the Sahara  After my country had secured the decolonization of the Saharan provincesâdecolonization which Morocco  as in the cases of other provinces formally under French and Spanish rule and under international administration  had carried out in strict conformity with the rules of international lawâthe problem was artificially revived for the express purpose of impeding my country's progress and exhausting its energy and potential. Although Moroccan rights are clear and beyond dispute  my country has shown great wisdom  good sense and patience and looks forward to the future with optimism and a willingness to continue to overcome difficulties.25.	It is in this context that we must see the historic initiative of King Hassan II  who  at the eighteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  held at Nairobi in June 1981  announced the decision to agree to prove what had already been proved in fact  history and lawâas His Majesty himself said.26.	His Majesty proposed the organization of a referendum in the Sahara and  as he made clear in his statement to the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session  did so""for the reconciliation of Africa and to teach those who were unaware of things  to demystify the facts for those who were trying to disregard them all and to instil some wisdom into those who still did not want to understand anything"" .27.	After the Nairobi summit had unanimously adopted the resolution calling for the referendum  the Kingdom of Morocco remained faithful to that resolution and co-operated positively with the Implementation Committee charged by the Nairobi summit with the duty of applying the referendum resolution.28.	The Implementation Committee succeeded in drawing up the arrangements for the organization of the referendum and in defining the conditions pertaining to persons invited to state their views. It decided to instruct the observers of the OAU to monitor the progress of the voting operations side by side with observers appointed by the United Nations. Thus  everything was arranged  set up and spelled out so that the referendum could take place and meet all the conditions necessary for a fair  equitable and sincere consultation.29.	My country granted the Implementation Committee the facilities necessary to enable it to fulfil its mission and declared itself ready to organize the referendum whenever the Committee decided that it would be convenient. To avoid any misunderstanding and in the most authoritative tone possible  through King Hassan II  my country confirmed here its solemn commitment to consider itself bound by the results of the referendum.30.	However  obstacles were set in the path of the implementation of the resolution on the referendum because of fear of the inevitable outcome of the consultation. Indeed  more than once the people of the provinces of Al-Aaiun  Smara  Bojador and Oued Ed Dahab have proclaimed their unswerving attachment to their Moroccan character  and the whole world was able to verify that fact through numerous reports by journalists and politicians  who  having visited the region several times  saw for themselves the real state of affairs in our southern provinces  the achievements and the constructive work that had been done there  and the calm and security in which the people live  a people firmly committed to their Moroccan identity.31.	The question is quite clear: Morocco  which took the initiative concerning the organization of the referendum  again declares its willingness to co-operate  in facilitating the holding of the referendum. We believe that the referendum provides the effective basis for the solution of this problem. Morocco is always ready to co-operate towards that end with the OAU.32.	The Kingdom of Morocco  which believes in the idea of a united Arab Maghreb and in Arab unity  which has worked towards that end ever since the days in which it was struggling to regain its own independence and which  furthermore  has greatly contributed to the attainment of African unity  has worked tirelessly and resolutely to consolidate the fraternal bonds between Arab States and African States  and it regards the establishment of the Arab- African Union as the concrete expression of the idea of such a union and its full attainment.33.	On 13 August 1984  at Oujda  a treaty was signed establishing the Arab-African Union between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Moroccan and Libyan peoples unanimously approved that Union  through a popular referendum in Morocco and by the vote of the peoples' congresses in Libya. The two peoples are convinced that the Union thus proclaimed embodies their desire for unity and that it is the first stone to be laid in constructing the Arab Maghreb  along the pathway towards greater Arab-African union.34.	The treaty concluded between the two fraternal countries can be taken as a model. It is a treaty based on logic and drawn up from the teachings of experience. It is marked by objectivity and is based on realism  a spirit of open-mindedness and tolerance. This treaty  built under the aegis of international law  is aimed at the establishment of a just and equitable peace. The Moroccan-Libyan treaty of union is also characterized by its honesty and sincerity. It is a ""guileless treaty""  one that is not directed against anyone.35.	There can be no doubt that the Arab-African Union  which is now a concrete reality  will assist in ensuring progress and stability in the Arab world and in the African continent and will serve as a model of its kind for complementarity and co-operation among States.36.	The Kingdom of Morocco has been closely following recent developments in the question of Chad. My country regards the agreement concluded in that connection as the harbinger of a forthcoming resolution of the Chadian crisis that has long been a source of grave concern to the countries of the African continent. In our desire to see stability and security prevail throughout the entire region  the Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the agreement concluded between France and Libya and considers that that agreement opens up broad horizons for all sectors of opinion among the people of Chad to bring about the restoration of peace in that country.37.	My country is also keenly aware of the other political problems that exist in other parts of the world and has been following their evolution with close attention. Morocco has  on diverse occasions  made known its opinions on those problems. Those positions have been unswerving and are based on Morocco's commitment to the basic principles of the United Nations and on its commitment to the resolutions adopted with regard to those problems by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab States and regional organizations.38.	The arms race continues to be one of the most crucial concerns of the General Assembly. The frenzied arms race poses a severe threat to international peace and security; it drains vast financial and material resources and considerable human and technological energy. It has deplorable repercussions on international relations and on international cooperation in particular. Accordingly  the Kingdom of Morocco deplores the slowness with which the Programme of Action adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  the first special session devoted to disarmament  in 1978  has been carried out. It deeply regrets that the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second special session devoted to disarmament  held in July 1982  was unable to reach agreement on a comprehensive disarmament plan capable of setting forth concrete measures for moving towards complete and general disarmament under international control.39.	Certain aspects of the current world economic crisis do  of course  have an impact on the countries of the North  but the crisis is of particular gravity for those of the South and is a source of deep concern for the developing countries.40.	There are many reasons for the crisis. The principal reason  however  lies in the fact that economic relations among States are still governed by a certain tendency towards monopolization. We firmly believe that the crisis will worsen if such relations are not viewed in a spirit of North-South cooperation in keeping with the needs of our era and capable of promoting constructive co-operation among the countries concerned.41.	Our increasingly interdependent world makes it essential that we think in terms of establishing an international economy based on complementarity and co-operation between the countries of the South and of the North  the producers of raw materials and the industrialized countries.42.	The obstinate refusal of the developed countries to meet the legitimate demands of the third-world countries could well bring about an economic situation that would be harmful to all the States of the world.43.	Ten years after the adoption of the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation  the developing countries are still waiting for the industrialized countries to live up to the commitments they assumed within the framework of that Plan for the improvement of investment conditions in the developing countries and the guarantee of the stability of raw materials prices in order to protect the legitimate interests of those countries.44.	There can be no doubt that the debt burden weighing upon the third-world countries is quite capable of creating serious upheavals in the world economic system and its monetary and financial institutions. That system must enable developing countries to enjoy their true share of international trade by doing away with protectionist barriers.45.	The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna this year  are only two of the many attempts made to find a common ground between the positions of the countries of the North and those of the South.46.	The Kingdom of Morocco urges the developed countries to make their positions more flexible in order to bring about a new international economic order that would take into account the vital interests of the developing countries.47.	The world is passing through grave crises and is being forced to cope with delicate problems. However  we have all placed our hope in the United Nations in order to promote the best solutions that can make possible the attainment of an international community based on tranquillity  security and the true solidarity of all States. Such an achievement would surely strengthen the confidence the States and peoples of the world have placed in the United Nations and would certainly give concrete expression to the noble objectives of the Charter in relations among nations."
"88",4436,"MDG",39,1984,"ï»¿The General Assembly's choice of Mr. Paul Lusaka to preside over the work of its thirty-ninth session gives us cause for real pride  because the recognition of his distinguished qualities is a tribute paid not only to his country  Zambia  but to Africa as a whole. We assure him that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar will exert every effort to support the actions he will take under his mandate and on behalf of our common ideals.173.	We express again to Mr. Jorge Illueca our thanks for the responsible  clear-sighted and committed way in which he presided over the thirty-eighth session  despite the strains involved in his lofty duties.174.	Finally  my Government is particularly aware of the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General for the benefit of Madagascar and Africa as a whole  and we once again express to him our support and our confidence in his mission of peace and in his determination to return multilateralism to its place of honour.175.	The exchanges of view that have been taking place during the general debate confirm our belief that  despite certain signs that in other circumstances might have been encouraging  uncertainty persists and disquiet and pessimism are the order of the day. Indeed  in analysing  as we must  the causes for the divisions in our world  we must note that the North and the South are not getting down to a dialogue on the establishment of a new order; the organization of the developing countries is still in an embryonic stage or is split up; there has been a chronic blockage of East-West relations for five years now; and outmoded and inadequate solutions to regional conflicts  the by-products of that tension  are envisaged.176.	There are some who have settled down into this state of generalized deadlock  and peoples might have adapted to this if it could have been proved to them that the world in which they were living was the best reflection of their rights and aspirations. But during the past few months we have witnessed an onslaught of phenomena  the mere listing of which gives an idea of the insecurity all around us: the repetition of rigid positions; the quest for unilateral advantage; the strengthening of the policy of blocs; the refusal of concessions or compromise; displays of force alternating with appeasement; the diplomacy of brinkmanship and preparation for confrontation. Everything that is happening makes it appear that the three pillars of international co-operationâpeace  security and justiceâhave been reshaped to justify actions motivated by the utmost egotism and a kind of Messianism.177.	As a non-aligned but committed country  we believe that in East-West relations the natural differences of interests cannot be disregarded and  hence  that nothing can replace peaceful coexistence and detente  which can re-establish peaceful conditions without confusing myth with reality. Much has been said this year about confidence- and security-building measures. Some advocate a global approach based on principles; others prefer a selective  and therefore limited  method. But the peoples  whose consciousness has been raised by the peace movement  need above all the confidence that can replace entrenched positions  deterrence and balance.178.	Is it not true that if the security interests of everyone  and not merely the great Powers  were taken into account  nuclear deterrence would lose its raison d'etre? Is it not true  too  that confidence would make it possible to emerge from a process which  in the name of balance  has accelerated the race in nuclear and conventional weapons? Finally  is it not true that a commitment to collective  rather than polarized  security could induce peoples to subscribe more frequently to negotiations and to hope for their success  denouncing all provocations that could derail them?179.	On many occasions we have said that we cannot blindly follow the experts and technicians on their ground. In the United Nations we are obliged to reason in terms of policies that are responsible and designed to ensure the survival of civilization. That is why we wish to lend our support and solidarity to any undertaking that would bring us closer to the fundamental aspiration of the peoplesâthat is  the restoration of peace. That holds true for the proposals on the prohibition of the militarization of space  the halting of the course of naval armament  the banning of chemical weapons  and a nuclear freeze.180.	Argument about the complexity of the problems does not justify avoidance of their consideration. Declarations of intention must necessarily be followed by action. Negotiations will be difficult  and the obstacles along the way cannot be minimized. Negotiations will have the merit of making international public opinion better aware and will facilitate application of our collective intelligence to the solution of conflicts in the South.181.	But let us not be misunderstood. The relaxation of tensions in the North can be brought about only through the reduction of conflicts  and such reduction will be meaningful only if it takes place within the framework of a global approach. We cannot merely say that the solution of regional conflicts depends on the will of the great Powers alone. We all intend to shoulder our responsibilities.182.	If one thinks about it  the situation in southern Africa would not be what it is if  apart from spheres of influence  some of us were not tempted to be led by the notion of traditional strategic responsibility. Despite our protests  our denunciations and our condemnations  extenuating circumstances are always found for the apartheid regime  which it would seem it would be best to control in order to stabilize the region  putting aside  if need be  black consciousness. Is this not tantamount to ensuring the survival of the minority racist Power in order better to defend values some label democratic in an environment that is viewed as hostile?183.	But this is only one of many contradictions. We want to put an end to the cycle of violence  yet some discreetly or openly applaud when the cycle of injustice is coupled with the adoption of so-called constitutional reform. Very little importance is attached to the military and economic pressures on the apartheid regime  but these are included in a strategy that should presumably lead to mediation and negotiation. Some advocate pragmatism and patience  but in the name of the struggle against international terrorism they want to do away with SWAPO and the ANC  whose authenticity  representational character and historic role in the liberation of Africa need no longer be demonstrated. The front-line States are being subjected to intolerable blackmail  and none can be fooled as to its purpose. Who could for a single moment believe that the Pretoria regime has suddenly seen the light and the virtues of dialogue  non-aggression and good-neighbourliness? In truth  the only possible answer is an immediate increase in support and international assistance for the front-line States in order to give them the means to face up to aggression that is all the more pernicious since some might support it.184.	For us  as for the great majority of the Members of the United Nations  the course to be followed is clear. Whatever stratagems may be used  Namibia will become independent. The democratization of political  economic and social relations in South Africa will bring about the day when the black  the white  the Coloured and the Asian populations are free of the apartheid regime and its collaborators. Our dignity as Africans is incompatible with the continuing detention of Nelson Mandela  and we demand his immediate release. We affirm that southern Africa can be an area of true harmony  peace and co-operation only when an end has been put to the political and economic hegemony of the racist regime and to foreign interference.185.	We also continue to believe that the interplay of strategic and political interests has made decolonization go astray in Western Sahara. After years of bitter discussions  confrontations followed by accommodation  at its last summit conference  Africa succeeded in achieving unanimous agreement on ways and means of restoring peace in the region. Is the scheme proposed by the OAU perhaps not fully in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the inalienable rights of the Saharan people? Has the United Nations perhaps been wrong in supporting it  with the few reservations we are all familiar with?186.	Such a thesis cannot be sustained  nor can it explain the intransigence of Morocco  the ostracism of certain circles vis-a-vis the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic or the rumours designed to give credit to the argument that the OAU should drop this case in favour of other bodies. The application of the African solution to the Saharan problem should not be unduly delayed by considerations that would mean our shirking our responsibility vis-a-vis the Saharan people. Because we intend to meet this responsibility  we maintain the common African position  which is that there should be a cease-fire and withdrawal of the Moroccan troops from Western Sahara so that there may be a peaceful and fair referendum.187.	In this connection I should like  on behalf the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  to hail the withdrawal of foreign troops from Chad  which will make it possible for the various factions and groups to meet and try to find a solution that will be in the interests of the people of Chad and in keeping with the resolutions of the OAU  without replacing African and even international solidarity with paternalism.188.	Finally  as a representative of my President  Mr. Didier Ratsiraka  and of my Government and as a son of that great continent that is the object of so much greed and struggles for influence  I cannot fail to invite my brothers and sisters to settle our political problems first and foremost among ourselves.189.	The Democratic Republic of Madagascar would be failing in its duty if it did not appeal for awareness of the solidarity and affirmation of the identity of African men and women and their ability to contribute to the solution of the problems afflicting our continent.190.	The similarities between the situations in southern Africa and western Asia have been mentioned on several occasions  and in such precise and objective terms that it seems unnecessary to revert to them in great detail. I shall therefore confine myself to certain considerations that might help bring about understanding of our position and lay the foundations for analysis.191.	In 40 years  the fundamental facts of the question of Palestine  at least as regards the United Nations  have remained unchanged. Arbitrariness  domination and exploitation persist in that region  while adjustments introduced following various tensions but with disregard for law and equity have hardly contributed to an acceptable solution. At the same time  the PLO  like every liberation movement  is going through a difficult period which the play of powers in the region have not helped. Thus  there is osculation between solicitude and ostracism  between sympathy and indifference  between ambiguity and support. Finally  the programme drawn up by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People is relegated to dead-letter status  as is the international conference proposed by the non-aligned countries. Prospects for negotiations at the Security Council level are hampered by the exclusion of the PLO.192.	The result is a diplomatic void on the international level  one that cannot be filled by reaffirming Security Council resolution 242 (1967)âat this point largely outdatedânor by the increasing number of unilateral or bilateral initiatives. Such negative factors reflect the internal and external tensions in the region and are being used either to force us to accept faits accomplis or to make us better accustomed to the state of latent war  or even to accept the worst of paradoxes in which a people who have been promised a homeland now have a State  while another people  whose right to a State has been expressly recognized by the United Nations  find themselves being offered a homeland as a kind of consolation prize. In the face of this impermissible disparity  the only solution is the restoration of the rights of the Palestinians and an international guarantee of those rights in order that an end may be put to the suffering and devastation to which the Lebanese and the Palestinians have been subjected for so long.193.	For the same reasons  in the Iran-Iraq conflict we are following very closely the response to the Secretary-General's three-part appeal for the protection of the civilian populations victimized by a frenzied fratricidal struggle that is casting an unnecessary shadow over the image of non-aligned unity.194.	In other parts of Asia  we find peoples being caught up between present and past interests that pursue their course without regard to those peoples. From Afghanistan to Korea  the peoples' aspirations to normal relations  to peace  to co-operation and to stability are constantly being frustrated by ideological or strategic considerations.195.	No one can accept a situation such as that in Cyprus  where a succession of faits accomplis and unilateral steps have taken us ever further from a solution that should have been freely accepted by both communities  equal in rights and obligations. No one can be against the idea that the situation around Afghanistan should return to normal and that the Secretary-General's mediation in that matter should be allowed to continue and lead to direct negotiations. No one thinks of thwarting the joint efforts being made by the States of Indo-China and the States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations to narrow their differences and to organize co-operation and coexistence among them in accordance with respect for each party's freedom of choice. However  we can demand that in all such actions account be taken of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of non-alignment  and  in particular  the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference.196.	Those are also the principles to which we appeal when we assert the need to normalize the situation in the Korean peninsula and to bring about peaceful  independent reunification there  free from outside interference. In that connection  the proposals recently put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for tripartite talks constitute a positive contribution towards the resumption of dialogue between North and South Korea.197.	In Central America and the Caribbean  events in recent months have sounded a note of alarm for the development of international relations. We believed that the proposals of the Contadora Group had been accepted by the parties concerned  and we were already gratified at the fact that Nicaragua had risked the alternative of peace by subscribing to the terms of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. Unfortunately  other pre-conditions have been raised  and we very much fear that the opportunity to find a peaceful political solution to all the problems in Central America and the Caribbean may have been frittered away.198.	Before ending my remarks on this subject  I should like to refer to the question of the Indian Ocean and the Malagasy Islands. My Government reaffirms its determination to continue  within the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  to work for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  containing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Any demonstration or escalation of great-Power presence in that area  such as foreign military bases and installations  logistical support services and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction  contrary to the oft-expressed will of the States of the region  would constitute a flagrant violation of that Declaration. Such activities are liable to jeopardize the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and peaceful development of the States of the region.We are convinced that the immediate convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  scheduled to be held at Colombo in the first half of 1985  is the only way of reducing tension in the area. In this connection  the Government of Madagascar regrets that some States  through their negative attitude  have tried in an unwarranted manner to delay the convening of that Conference and  thereby  the summit meeting of interested and concerned States proposed by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar.199.	As to the Malagasy Islands in the Mozambique Channel and the Indian Ocean  their status as belonging to Madagascar has been confirmed by relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU  as well as by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. My Government hopes that the exploratory talks recently held in Paris will be pursued and will contribute to drawing up a solution in keeping with respect for the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity and mutual advantage.200.	Lastly  as an island State that contributed to the negotiation and conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Madagascar wishes to reaffirm its support for that legal instrument and to state  further  that the resources of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are and remain forever the common heritage of mankind. It is for that reason that we deplore any arrangement or mini-treaty  past  present or future that may be prejudicial to the provisions of that Convention.201.	Like the continued existence of so-called regional conflicts  the economic problems afflicting developing countries remain a subject of great concern for the future of international peace and security. The tentative recovery to be observed in certain industrialized countries has not restored order to monetary and financial markets  nor has it halted the wild fluctuations of exchange rates or brought interest rates down to tolerable levels. The prices of raw- material commodities have continued to fall and the terms of trade have continued to decline  while the spectre of protectionism has arisen.202.	When the crisis got under way  the third-world countries were urged to carry out economic adjustments  and most of them did so with courage and logic. Their sacrifices  however  have not been recompensed. How  indeed  can the conditions for a sound and lasting economic recovery be re-established when the international environment is not propitious  when the minute growth in exports is swallowed up by the burdensome weight of indebtedness  when the real flow of capital to the developing countries has never been as low as it is today  when so-called austerity measures have increased domestic social tensions and when structural problems inherited from a lengthy colonial period remain? If we add to that the effects of disasters of all kinds  we find we have very little ground for hope and perseverance.203.	Of course  at times we do see signs of encouragement. The international community seems to have awakened to the daily tragedy of our countries. Africa  which is at the very bottom of the scale of development  is now the focus of attention of assistance organizations. There are many programmes of action  and so-called emergency assistance measures are proliferating.204.	Without underestimating the need for these measures  we cannot overemphasize  as was done in the Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  the importance of producing in the United Nations a general  consistent and concerted framework for action to rehabilitate and revitalize African economies. At the same time  we must pursue a global approach to the problem of indebtedness  which cannot be dissociated from that of interest rates.205.	Indeed  if the industrialized countries refuse to take the necessary measures  or claim that they are powerless to bring down these rates to more tolerable levels  they should at least agree that their effects should be mitigated for the developing countries. Moreover  all of us on both sides must be realistic. Through realism  we can conceive of machinery which would preserve the interests of both the creditors and the debtors  by establishing  for example  a link between debt-servicing and the level of export earnings. This would have the effect of revising certain rules applied by the Club of Paris. Through realism  we should also recognize that the developed countries have something to gain by increasing the flow of assistance for development to the least privileged countries. Through realism once again  we should concede that the conditions attaching to the assistance rendered by Bretton Woods organisms often leads to results contrary to those sought. Through realism  finally  we should not seek to camouflage the asymmetrical and inequitable nature of the processes of adjustment and multilateral control.206.	These thoughts should not be allowed to obscure the importance of South-South co-operation. Within this context  we recall the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the creation of funds for the development and stabilization of commodity prices. Five years after it was put forward  this proposal remains as relevant and as urgent as ever  because far from wishing to replace arbitrarily international monetary and financial organizations  the machinery proposed would be complementary to them and would represent the contribution of the South to the necessary reform of the current system. A summit conference of third-world countries on economic questions would undoubtedly enable us to go into further detail on our commitment to South-South co-operation.207.	The solution to our economic problems remains  first and foremost  the responsibility of each country and each Government. For our part  in spite of the political  economic and social costs of adjustment programmes  we have taken important measures for adjustment which have made it possible to obtain encouraging results: reduction of the budgetary deficit  increase of the gross national product  and improvement of current accounts and the trade balance.208.	An analysis of the conduct of States Members of the United Nations demonstrates that some see the Organization merely as an idea  an abstraction  and would deny it a role in the promotion of harmonious international relations. But this is a paradox which verges on contradiction. Those very States that would deny an institutional role to the United Nations attach disproportionate importance to the votes cast here  instead of considering them  if those States wish to be consistent  as having a purely indicative value with regard to a given situation. Others  however  rise above the essentially evanescent nature of ideas and are struggling to confer on the Organization a positive role of vigilance and monitoring which would reflect the international conscience and make of it a true assembly of peoples  a privileged forum for the exchange and clash of ideas and views among nations.209.	Our position on all the questions debated at the United Nations is in keeping with the principles of sovereignty  mutual respect and non-interference. We respect the diversity of opinions and divergence of interests which are manifested in this body. We understand that a country can  without necessarily being hostile to us  adopt a mode of conduct different from our own  because outside the bilateral context it acts in accordance with its own principles  its particular commitments and specific priorities.210.	A member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  we remain true to ourselves by our refusal to become a pawn in the East-West confrontation. Our determined devotion to multilateralism and internationalism reflects our allegiance to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations  and we share the views and concerns expressed on the subject by the Secretary-General. In the final analysis  the goal of the United Nations  as set forth in the provisions of the Charter  is not to provide a convenient forum for the venting of differences between Member States  or crystallizing their differences; rather  its purpose is to guide us towards the necessary common will to respond to the fundamental aspirations of all our peoples for a world of peace  security and justice. For our part  we assure anyone sharing these views of our readiness and  indeed  our commitment to meet this challenge.211.	Next year we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. We should mark this event by making of the Organization the symbol of hope for a desperate mankind threatened with sudden annihilation by unbridled technology; the symbol of a better world where man  having finally restored his dignity  will be able to devote himself increasingly to the service of the common good  that is  the good of the peonies; in short  the symbol of responsibility genuinely shared among nations working together for the most noble causes."
"89",4474,"MDV",39,1984,"ï»¿It is indeed a great honour for me and my delegation to felicitate you  Sir  on your election to the esteemed office of President of the General Assembly. We endorse the confidence placed in you by this body. Your election represents a well-deserved tribute not only to your reputation as a distinguished diplomat with a long association with the United Nations but also lo your country  Zambia  which contributes through its vital role in the promotion of the true aspirations of Africa in particular and the third world in general. We are confident that your formidable knowledge and diplomatic skills will enable you to steer the work of the current session to a fruitful conclusion.132.	My delegation associates itself with previous speakers who have more eloquently expressed their sincere appreciation for the excellent manner in which your predecessor carried out his enormous task  despite his new responsibilities as Head of his Government. We salute Mr. Illueca  the President of Panama  on the wise and able manner in which he conducted the work of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session.133.	Maldives is proud and happy to welcome the newest Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam  which has many things in common with us in history and culture. Its admission is a strengthening link in the chain of universality of nations  furthering the noble objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.134.	We are meeting at a time when the Organization is reaching the mature age of 40 years. My country is fortunate to have shared with it the last 20 years of its varied but rewarding experience. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  has most aptly and wisely cautioned us about the enormous importance of the continued existence of the Organization. We are of the opinion that the United Nations cannot and must not be replaced  in view of the important institutional responsibilities that it was founded to fulfil. We believe that the great problems that we confront as a world community  such as those of the obstacles to economic development and the nuclear-arms race and the need for disarmament  cannot be solved through bilateral or regional efforts alone. My country is happy to record its appreciation of and admiration for the clear and thorough manner in which the Secretary-General has informed us through his report on the work of the Organization. He has spared no effort in carrying out his diverse and complex responsibilities as the executive head of the United Nations.135.	We endorse his submission that our prime objective at this crucial moment should be to reconstruct the concept of collective action for peace and security to make the United Nations more capable of carrying out its primary mission of maintaining international peace and security.136.	We are gathered here at a time of increasing tension and anxiety. The problems and challenges which face us today are so pressing that we need more than ever before a sharing of responsibility and a high level of political will. All available means must be utilized to stem the growth of forces which undermine the United Nations and peaceful international relations. The imbalances in the state of affairs we are currently experiencing are leading the world to an intolerable situation  and  unless we all sincerely join together to eliminate its causes  the future generations of mankind will have no choice but to suffer the consequences of our failure  for which they will rightly condemn us.137.	We should assert the principles of peace  justice and equality. These and other noble principles which humanity has evolved from its sufferings and experiences are clearly inscribed in the Charter of this great Organization. It is our solemn duty to uphold these principles and to fulfil our commitments to our peoples.138.	As a true non-aligned developing country  Maldives believes that amongst the major issues confronting our universal body special emphasis should be given to the problem of disarmament and the escalating nuclear-arms race. We cannot help expressing our anxiety over the lack of a viable solution to that problem  for countries such as my own must admit that the contribution they can make to bringing the situation closer to solution is rather limited. However  we humbly share our concern and pledge our support to any endeavour to eliminate the shadow of the threat and the perils of a nuclear confrontation.139.	We urge all States Members of the United Nations  particularly the nuclear-weapon States  to co-operate and enter into relevant international agreements and arrangements that will be instrumental in limiting the production and stockpiling of nuclear and other destructive weapons in order to insure the world against global suicide.140.	We live today in the presence of a chilling and unprecedented phenomenon. It is very unfortunate that  at the pinnacle of world power  there exist enough nuclear weapons to destroy all life on our planet. At the intermediate level of world power  there exist vast quantities of sophisticated  so-called conventional weapons. These weapons are  by comparison with those of former times  immensely destructive  as their use has so horrifically demonstrated. They are also the object of a highly profitable international trade.141.	Yet  at another level  we have the poverty of the vast proportion of the world's population. We must not be deterred from continuing to emphasize the immorality of mankind's precious resources being used in the production of weapons of destruction at a time when so much of humanity has a dire need for those same resources to be used in the war against poverty and disease. It is not only a political but also a moral objective  which we must never relinquish.142.	We strongly support nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia  in the Pacific and in other regions. Our support of the resolutions calling for the establishment of such zones  and of all actions at fulfilling that objective  is based on a strong conviction that they will contribute towards the reduction of arms and armed conflicts. We strongly oppose the continued testing of nuclear weapons  not only because of the direct dangers they pose but also because of the destruction such testing could finally cause to man and his environment.143.	Maldives firmly supports the initiatives and efforts of the United Nations in the search for general and complete disarmament  including the banning of nuclear testing and the prevention of an arms race in outer space.144.	The question of Palestine continues to remain one of the outstanding major international concerns. The situation in the Middle East in all its aspects  including the tragedy of Lebanon  continues to give rise to frustration. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the continued Israeli presence in Lebanese territory have aggravated further the already explosive situation created by Israel's refusal to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories  including Jerusalem.145.	The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and freedom remain at the heart of the issue. The key to any lasting solution and for peace in that crucial area is  as evidently seen through the sequence of events  the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to have their own independent homeland.146.	The world witnessed with anger and dismay the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  while it continued its illegal occupation of Palestine  including the Gaza Strip  the West Bank  the city of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Israel continues to perpetuate its policies of expansionism through the establishment of illegal settlements  ignoring and rejecting numerous United Nations resolutions and violating all norms of international behaviour. Maldives joins the international community in its repeated condemnation of the Israeli aggression against Arab territories and Israeli atrocities in the occupied land.147.	The invasion of Lebanon under the cruel pretext of liquidating the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which symbolizes the legitimate will of the Palestinians  has clearly revealed the true nature of Israeli policies in that area.148.	Every State Member of the United Nations has pledged its commitment to the provisions of the Charter. Therefore  action should not be delayed any further regarding the delicate situation in the Middle East. The Security Council should invoke the relevant provisions of the Charter with regard to the arrogance and defiance with which Israel is trampling underfoot the inalienable rights of the Palestinians.149.	The PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has the full right to participate in any step that may be taken to achieve a lasting solution. In the opinion of my delegation  the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  represents a sound framework for the international community and the parties concerned to work for a durable solution.150.	My country associates itself with other nations in expressing its deep regret at the continued bitter armed conflict between Iran and Iraq. We urge the parties concerned to bring about a cease-fire and to find a solution to their dispute by peaceful means. Maldives pledges its support to the United Nations mediation efforts and to the Secretary-General's recent personal appeals to spare civilians. Both Iran and Iraq must heed the appeals of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and halt this seemingly purposeless conflict. These bodies are trying to bring about an honourable settlement of the dispute  and we wish them every success.151.	The question of Namibia and the tragic plight of the people of South Africa have remained a matter of grave concern to the world community. The task of the United Nations to seek a negotiated settlement of the question of Namibia remains a special responsibility. The continuation by the racist regime of South Africa of its illegal occupation of Namibia  despite the vigorous efforts to grant independence to the deprived people of that Territory  constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and endangers the security of the southern African region. Here again  like Israel  the racist minority regime in Pretoria has scorned the numerous resolutions adopted by this august body in full accord with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.152.	It is our bounden duty to maintain and enforce political and economic pressure on South Africa  with a view to forcing it to concede to the logic of humane behaviour. We must continue our support for the people of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO.153.	The hope for a peaceful future in southern Africa lies in political change and the creation of greater trust through regional co-operation and international support. We believe that it can be achieved peacefully. My delegation joins in the unanimous insistence on an early implementation of the plan endorsed by Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This would enable the people of Namibia to decide their destiny in a free  fair and democratic manner. The delay in the realization of the plan is greatly disappointing. It would be most unfortunate if at this late stage the process leading to the independence of Namibia were to be impeded by issues extraneous to the question itself. My delegation fully recognizes the continued efforts of the Secretary-General for an early solution to this vital issue.154.	Apartheid is a crime against humanity itself. Maldives is firmly convinced that peace and stability in southern Africa require the total eradication of apartheid and the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of South Africa  irrespective of their race  colour or creed.155. My delegation wishes to express its concern over the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  two countries which  in the view of my Government  have been victims of foreign military intervention and invasion. We express our deepest concern and fully endorse the United Nations resolutions which condemn foreign intervention and call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from those countries. That will enable the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea freely to decide their own destiny. The peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be given the opportunity to exercise their rights without outside interference  including the right of the refugees to return to their homes with security and honour. My delegation notes with deep appreciation and commendation the unceasing efforts of the Secretary- General and his special representatives to find political solutions to those two major issues.156.	It is with alarm  dismay and frustration that we witness the increasing instances of foreign intervention in Africa and Latin America. We recall here the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States. There is no difference  in my opinion  between intervention and interference. The final result in either case is tragically the same: tension  unrest  internal strife  conflict and even bloodshed.157.	We view such developments with the utmost concern because they destroy the very fabric not only of international peace and security but also of the concept of peaceful coexistence. Never for a moment should we forget that we are a family of interrelated and interdependent nations  with diverse political ideologies  economies and social systems  which must live together in an atmosphere devoid of suspicion  envy and animosity.158.	In Cyprus  the United Nations has been tirelessly trying to promote a settlement and the Secretary-General continues to maintain his personal involvement. My Government welcomes those unceasing efforts. Despite some limited progress in intercommunal talks held under United Nations auspices  a peaceful and lasting settlement regrettably still appears to be distant. My delegation would like to reiterate its support for the people of Cyprus in their efforts to consolidate their independence within the framework of national unity and equal rights for all Cypriots.159.	While making reference to the solution of conflicts by peaceful means  may I mention also the yet unsolved question of Korea. Peaceful reunification has been  and continues to be  a matter of great concern to us. My Government feels that all efforts must be made  collectively and individually  to facilitate a dialogue between the divided North and South. The international community should extend every possible support  opportunity and encouragement to the people of Korea to achieve their objective of peaceful reunification.160.	With regard to our part of the worldâthe Indian OceanâMaldives is committed to the policy of non-alignment and is determined to keep its territory free from nuclear weapons or the establishment of any foreign military base on it. Furthermore  Maldives will continue to work with the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean towards making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. We are concerned over the escalating tension created by the great-Power rivalry for military superiority in the Indian Ocean and the introduction of nuclear weapons there. We reaffirm our full support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and support the efforts of the United Nations to implement that Declaration.161.	It is our earnest hope that  through co-operation among the countries of the Indian Ocean and other concerned parties  we will be able to find practical ways to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of our region. The proposed Conference on the Indian Ocean  to be held at Colombo in early 1985  will  we believe  form a corner-stone in the path to realizing our cherished objective. We appeal to the world community to support us in achieving that objective.162.	The world economy has experienced increasing difficulties during the last decade. The period has been characterized by a generally unsatisfactory and erratic growth of output and trade  high rates of inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. While the crisis has affected all countries  it has inevitably had the most serious impact on the developing countries  whose economies are particularly vulnerable. The developed countries have experienced unprecedented rates of unemployment and idle industrial capacity  accompanied by high interest rates. The developing countries have faced increasing balance-of-payments deficits  mounting debt burden and deteriorating terms of trade.163.	The economic gap between the developed and developing countries is widening and the latter are being denied effective and equitable participation in the benefits of international development.164.	At a recent meeting held at Male  in my country  the Foreign Ministers of Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Nepal  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and Maldives  member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  expressed their concern over the conditions in the developing countries. In the final communique  the Ministers reviewed the current world economic situation and expressed their concern over the deteriorating economic and social conditions in the developing countries. In the past three years  sharply falling commodity prices  deterioration in the terms of trade  intensification of protectionist measures  excessive debt burden and a decline in the flow of financial resources had caused unprecedented balance-of-payment problems and serious loss of development momentum in the developing countries. It was agreed that without redoubling of efforts by the international community  including immediate measures  the goals and targets of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries could not be attained. They expressed their deep disappointment at the lack of progress in putting international support measures into place and at the continued stalemate in the negotiations on international co-operation. In this connection  they noted with deep regret that no appreciable progress had been made in meeting the concerns of the developing countries at the London Economic Summit of the industrialized countries  held from 7 to 9 June 1984  despite urgent actions suggested by various leaders from the non-aligned and developing countries.165.	That important meeting at Male endorsed the desire to communicate with leaders of industrialized countries the immediate concern of the States of South Asia  namely  that the financing of the seventh replenishment of IDA had not been augmented to a degree whereby an increase in real terms was achieved over the level of the sixth replenishment of IDA. This timely request has already been conveyed by my Government as the Foreign Ministers desired.166.	That co-operative endeavour in our part of the region aims at harnessing support and co-operation in economic development  and cultural and social exchange. The Foreign Ministers at the Male meeting recorded their satisfaction with the progress that had been made in a relatively short period of time in the areas of co-operation identified.167.	I am happy to inform the Assembly  on behalf of my country as the current Chairman  of the important leverage that the recent meeting provided to the eventual holding of a summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation countries by late 1985.168.	Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom  President of Maldives  in his opening address at the ministerial meeting  said of the member countries: ""Our societies are quite diverse but their hopes and expectations do not vary. Together our peoples are sure of themselves  confident of their identities and confident too of their ability to control their own destinies."" He said  further  that the moving spirit and the objective of the very principles which gave birth to our association is one of working together  which has as its basic foundation the promotion of the interests of our region  an essential aspect of which is the maintenance and  indeed  the strengthening of our people's political  social and economic independence. These words of wisdom give us confidence that the outcome of the forthcoming summit will further strengthen the global aspirations and efforts made by the United Nations.169.	The Government of Maldives whole-heartedly supports the call of the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77 for the removal of the structural imbalances and inequalities of the present pluralist economic system and the restructuring of the world economy through the establishment of a new international economic order. This should be done through North-South dialogue and global negotiations among developed and developing countries. Maldives also considers co-operation among developing countries themselves  both for economic and social development and to minimize their dependence on developed countries  to be vital. Maldives welcomes the establishment of the South Bank as a practical step in the right direction and hopes that it will prove very useful to developing countries.170.	The delegation of Maldives noted with satisfaction the adoption  in 1982  of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a historic achievement in the progressive development of the law of the sea. The Convention was adopted by an overwhelming majority of States and has already been signed by 136 States  including my own  and ratified by a number of them. My Government is now in the process of ratifying it. The Convention establishes a new legal order for the rational use of the seas as an instrument of justice  peace  development and international co-operation. It represents a rare example of global interests and ideologies striking innumerable practical bargains. It is a most comprehensive international Convention  consisting of 320 articles and nine annexes  with four related resolutions.171.	The delegation of Maldives appeals to all States which have signed the Convention to expedite the process of ratification so as to enable the Convention to become effective and operative.172.	The continent of Antarctica has considerable environmental  climatic  scientific and potential economic significance for the world. The delegation of Maldives firmly believes that  in the interest of all mankind  Antarctica should continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes  should not become the scene or object of international disputes and should be accessible to all nations. The exploration of the area and the exploitation of its resources should be carried out for the benefit of all mankind and in a manner consistent with the protection of the environment of Antarctica.173.	Maldives supported the proposal for a comprehensive study on Antarctica by the United Nations  taking into account all relevant factors  with a view to widening international co-operation in the area.174.	Like Antarctica  outer space should be used for peaceful purposes only. Recent proposals for intensified militarization of outer space are a cause of grave concern  and measures should be undertaken with urgency for the rejection of such proposals.175.	My delegation also notes that the distribution of the benefits of outer space among the countries of the world has to date been uneven. To remove that imbalance  the principle of guaranteed and equitable access should be the essence of any new regulatory mechanism  which should take into account the particular needs of the developing countries  especially those of an equatorial nature. We firmly believe and sincerely hope that the benefits resulting from the peaceful use of outer space will be shared equitably for the benefit of mankind as a whole.176.	My delegation is fully convinced that the United Nations is indispensable in a world fraught with tensions and peril. Institutions such as this are not built in a day; they require constant constructive work and fidelity to the principles on which they are based. We must seriously consider the practical ways in which the Organization should develop its capacity and be used as an essential institution in a stormy and explosive world.177.	Primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security has been entrusted to the Security Council. We believe it is still the best device for defusing tensions  solving problems and maintaining peace and security. While it tends not to have much of a pre-emptive capacity  it is our duty as Members of the United Nations to strengthen its role by resisting the attempts of individual countries to assume the primary responsibility of the Security Council. If the Security Council fails to act or react in a given situation  it is not the institution that is at fault but the countries that constitute it. It is for us to convince ourselves and the generation we are responsible for that the world is interdependent  and to act accordingly and be guided by that reality.178.	The United Nations system should play the role of a catalyst in creating mutual understanding and co-operation. We should not allow it to become the arena in which to battle out our differences. Rather  it should and must be a place where hatred and animosity towards others are avoided. The agencies of the United Nations came into existence not only because the prominent men who created them were wise but because those agencies are directly related to the aspirations of mankind  irrespective of race or region.179.	We are concerned by the trend that has emerged recently as a result of the fact that certain Member countries repeatedly express their pessimism about the viable functioning of important specialized bodies of the United Nations system. We hold the view that their development justifies the wisdom by which they were created and that they need to be strengthened now more than ever before. My Government does not believe in any endeavour to politicize specialized bodies whose executive functions are purely technical in nature. It is therefore essential to maintain a high degree of professionalism and to orient programmes carried out by those bodies towards the achievement of more tangible results.180.	We in Maldives are happy to be associated in the noble tasks prescribed under the WHO Global Strategy for Health for all by the Year 2000  which should ensure humanity a better world in which to live. We are confident that the work of UNICEF  whose primary responsibility lies in the care and welfare of the children of the world  will strengthen the future of humanity through its dynamic programme launched in 1983 as the child survival revolution.181.	My delegation still believes that amid the various perils that now threaten the orderly progress of humanity  we can rally once again to the standards of the Charter of the United Nations  beginning with the peaceful settlement of disputes and steadily progressing towards the other objectives of that prophetic document.182.	In all sincerity  Maldives pledges its fullest co-operation and support to the United Nations system."
"90",4520,"MEX",39,1984,"ï»¿87. On behalf of the Government of Mexico and on my own behalf  Sir  I wish to extend our congratulations to you on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that your wide experience of the United Nations and your diplomatic gifts will enable you to guide our deliberations along the path of mutual understanding.88.	The election of the representative of Zambia bears witness to our recognition of the committed role in international affairs that is played by your country  with which Mexico maintains excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. In our view  your election also reflects the growing importance of the African continent in contemporary international relations. The peoples of Africa  freed from the yoke of colonialism  are a living symbol of the universal aspiration to build a more stable  pluralistic and democratic world.89.	I consider it my duty also to express our satisfaction with the prudent and persevering action of your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca. Latin America has welcomed the dynamic and direct efforts of the President of Panama to promote dialogue and conciliation.90.	I should also like to express again to the Secretary-General the pleasure of the Government and people of Mexico at his official visit to our country last April and his visit to our capital on the occasion of the International Conference on Population last August. I offer him too our sincere congratulations on the effective work he has done in heading the Organization. His efforts to consolidate the United Nations system  to expand cooperation and  especially  to promote the cause of peace and security bring our nations new hope. His report to this session of the General Assembly on the work of the Organization	is clear proof of his clear-mindedness and political creativity.91.	My Government wishes to extend to Brunei Darussalam  the new Member of the United Nations  a warm welcome and best wishes for a peaceful and prosperous future in full exercise of its sovereign rights.92.	We are witnessing today a resurgence of old doctrines of power and new forms of intolerance that cast doubt on the usefulness of international organizations. In view of this  I should like to reaffirm the unwavering commitment of the people and Government of Mexico to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We are certain that the world Organization is an irreplaceable instrument for the promotion of freedom  justice and peace. We accept also that it is a body susceptible of improvement.93.	In 1945  determined to live together in peace and to promote the progress of all peoples  we postulated as standards of conduct for all States full respect for the principles of law and a genuine will to co-operate with others. The United Nations was to be a forum for understanding and the pivot of a collective effort towards further development and security.94.	Over the past years the Organization has played a decisive role in the promotion of the highest political ideals of the twentieth century. The liquidation of the most flagrant forms of colonialism has allowed almost 100 countries to attain political independence. The growing democratization of international society has contributed to the progressive development of a juridical order more in accordance with the demands of the peoples of the world. The international regime of human rights fosters respect for the basic freedoms of individuals and for the prerogatives of social groups  especially those of the least privileged.95.	The United Nations has been a determining factor in avoiding global confrontation and in encouraging the peaceful solution of a great many regional conflicts. Furthermore  as a result of its efforts  we have today a clearer view and understanding of the problems of the developing world. We in the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America have increased our ties of identity and solidarity  coordinating our stands and establishing platforms of common principles and strategies. We have encouraged the creation of numerous mechanisms which would enhance effective international co-operation if all States acted responsibly and with a view to the future.96.	Some isolated voices attempt to ignore the magnitude of the task performed and the potential of the United Nations system. The difficulties of an effective dialogue between the great Powers certainly have contributed to the antagonism between those with hegemonistic aspirations. In a climate of tension between East and West  it is only natural that the crises multiply  that regional conflicts are exacerbated and that confrontations between the power blocs are transferred to third-world settings  thereby affecting the security  sovereignty and political and economic development of many nations. At the same time  the grave world economic crisis is negating important and just expectations of the developing countries.97.	Such voices would seem to be unaware of the fact that  save for the presence of the United Nations  even more devastating conflagrations might have broken out. They tend to forget that we would have lacked institutional barriers to offset the arrogant use of force  that the juridical and moral principles of peaceful coexistence among States would have been weakened even furtherâin short  that we would all suffer by the absence of an enormous effort at cooperation that seeks to lighten the burdens and sacrifices of the weakest. Those voices seem to have forgotten the highly innovative and transforming task of the United Nations in today's world.98.	The cause of the crisis of world society  does not lie in the shortcomings of the organic structure of the United Nations or in the modalities of multilateral diplomacy. There are many who would like to make such limitations a pretext or a cover-up for more deep-rooted political realities. Indeed  when dogmatic views prevail there is no room for contrary or differing opinions. Manichaeism  by definition  excludes a world of varying criteria and attitudes. For those who think that way  multilateralism should be replaced by a set of asymmetric  predominantly bilateral relations  which would necessarily benefit the most powerful.99.	This morning [4th meeting]  the President of the United States  at the very outset of this General Assembly session  renewed hopes and expectations. By stating the willingness of his country to reinitiate constructive negotiations with the Soviet Union  mainly in the field of disarmament  in order to reduce the world arsenals  to institutionalize periodic consultations at a high political level and to establish better working relations between the United States and the Soviet Union in which understanding and cooperation prevail  President Reagan infused optimism into the community of nations on its difficult path towards peace and detente. Mexico expresses its recognition of and appreciation for this felicitous initiative and hopes that it may soon produce optimum results for all  without exception.100.	The international community must always act in accordance with the principles it has established  respecting the rights of all and giving each nation the unrestricted right to seek the economic and political system that is most in keeping with its interests. The United Nations  the supreme expression of the plural community of States  is thus the necessary setting for international democracy and an irreplaceable vehicle of co-operation. The values it represents are neither ephemeral nor circumstantial. They are  beyond any doubt  the only values that allow for civilized and orderly coexistence  beneficial to all.101.	Today  no country can live in isolation  separate from the rest. Any claim to autarky is illusory. Interdependence is an unavoidable fact of the life of States  even though that interrelationship has not been useful in distributing benefits justly and equitably to non-industrialized countries. The United Nations constitutes an organized framework that is capable of giving that interdependence a positive outlook and of transforming current international relations into respectful and peaceful coexistence  founded on equitable co-operation and mutual respect.102.	The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations seems a propitious moment not only for evaluating the functioning of the system and correcting deficiencies  but also for renewing our commitment to the principles and values that gave the Organization its lifeâprinciples & u values whose validity must be reaffirmed not only with words but also with deeds. Let us recall' that universality is part and parcel of the Organization's very essence. That is why the effectiveness of its decisions and the usefulness of its mechanisms of consultation must be based on the will of all States  and this must not entail a consolidation of privileges or the abusive use of different forms of the veto. The deficiencies of the Organization should be corrected democratically.103.	No one can seek to turn the United Nations into an arena of sterile confrontation  or an arena for unworthy attempts at subjugation or tyrannies of the minority. That would go against the democratic imperative of the Organization. Let us make our international institutions the setting for genuine dialogue  co-operation and constructive negotiation that are so greatly needed by our world today.104.	The strengthening of the international order also involves the renovation of regional forums  which must provide an increasingly faithful reflection of common interests and of the aspirations of developing countries. Latin America is currently seeking to consolidate its stands more effectively and to take joint steps to promote stability  development and full independence for the countries in the area as a real contribution to self-determination and world peace.105.	In the political sphere  the efforts of the Contadora Group express our unwavering determination to join together and find appropriate means of arriving at a peaceful solution of conflicts  avoiding any form of interference in the internal affairs of States. The nations of the area are  at the same time  combining their endeavours to achieve a rational and equitable economic order. The Latin American Economic Conference  held at Quito in January of this year  and the meetings at Cartagena and Mar del Plata of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of Finance of 11 Latin American countries in June and in September  respectively  all have that aim.106.	A year ago the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 38/10  on the situation in Central America. The resolution reaffirmed the right of all the countries in the area to decide their own future freely  and it condemned the acts of aggression against the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Central American States. Unanimously  the General Assembly gave its firm support to the efforts of the Contadora Group  urging it to persevere in its role as a mediator.107.	In 1984 the Contadora process has been aimed at reaching specific agreements dealing with the problems of peace  the strengthening of political institutions  and the process of development  which are of concern to the countries of the area. For months we have been engaged in an intensive process of consultation and negotiation which is now reflected in the instrument entitled ""Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America"" [seewhose purpose is to reconcile the legitimate interests of the Governments of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua. This is a draft global agreement stipulating both general and specific obligatory commitments for the purposes of fostering understanding and co-operation among the countries of Central America.108.	We are convinced that the Contadora Act is faithfully designed to fulfil the requirements for stability in the area. The principles set forth in the Act encourage the establishment of a framework of reciprocal security and respect  mutual confidence and regional detente  which are essential for normalising the political relations and all other relations among the countries of the isthmus.109.	For that reason  it is from here  the highest rostrum of the international community  that we call upon the Central American Governments to proceed with all due urgency to assume the legal commitments contained in the Act  and we express our appreciation to those States which have announced their intention to subscribe to the Act. The Contadora process and its arduous and difficult task of negotiation  which have now been in progress for 20 months  have been aimed at safeguarding the independence of States  preventing the further destruction of human and material resources that are essential to the well-being of their peoples  and opening instead channels for far-reaching and sustained economic  political and social development.110.	We reiterate today that negotiating implies harmonizing legitimate interests in order to reach common goalsâa partial surrender of one's goals  in order to attain a final objective that is considered fundamental to all. Regional security  a basic prerequisite for peace and development  can be attained only through honourable  just and responsible agreements based on conciliation and not on imposition. This is the immediate option of the five Central American Governments: to express their firm decision to protect the sovereign rights and long-term plans of each nation for the benefit of present and future generations  or to sacrifice a stable future for the sake of circumstantial illusions. It is the responsibility of the Central American Governments to choose between peace and war  between development and destruction. The Contadora Group  for its part  will continue to do everything within its power to facilitate the process of mediation.111.	The Contadora Act decidedly contributes to the establishment of a regional order founded on respect for pluralism and the rights of peoples. It offers  without a doubt  a viable opportunity for normalizing relations among the Central American countries. Unfortunately  the political and diplomatic effort has been severely hampered by a plethora of actions that aggravate tensions and undermine confidence in the area. Biased information has also been circulated with a view to harming the Contadora process and initiatives  and obstacles have been placed in the way of a more open and fluent dialogue among the Central American countries. The in-creased foreign military presence and the overt or covert support supplied to exogenous forces and groups  whose purpose is the overthrow of the established Governments of the area  have been two of the major obstacles to detente and understanding.112.	The historical experience of the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean has shown  over the centuries  that interference and intervention ultimately revert against their instigators. In the final analysis  the use of force is no solution but only leads to more force  hatred and lack of confidence. Let us try  with the invaluable assistance and support of the international community  to save Central America from even more serious harm and crueller devastation.113.	We call once again on those Governments with ties and interests in that region to give their unequivocal and clear support to efforts to halt the arms race and traffic in arms and the naval  land and air manoeuvres and to end the presence of foreign military advisers and bases. When Central America accepts and abides by the agreements reached  other States must inevitably assume their corresponding responsibilities.114.	Regional peace demands not only collective commitments but also the determination to solve bilateral differences. We also have here a long road ahead of us. In May of this year we applauded the establishment of a special commission of the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua to resolve border conflicts  reduce tensions and foster a climate of mutual confidence. We should also note that the initial steps in a dialogue between the Governments of the United States and Nicaragua have proved encouraging. Mexico has promoted these conversations  and five meetings have been held to date. My Government will continue to lend whatever support the interested parties request. We believe that the dialogue of Manzanillo is a key element in the process of bringing peace to Central America.115.	For the past year  Mexico has had the honour of presiding over the Group of 77. During this time  we have sought  through an informal exploratory process  to dispel misunderstanding  clarify intentions and establish bases for a better understanding of the problems we face. With the participation of the industrialized nations and the developing countries  we are making efforts to establish frank  pragmatic and flexible communication.116.	Although considerable conceptual progress has been achieved and areas of common interest identified  the launching of global negotiations has again been postponed because of a lack of political will on the part of some industrialized countries and their reluctance to grant the United Nations in practice the competence that the Charter establishes.117.	During this period  we developing countries have made innumerable efforts to seek immediate measures to ease the crisis and to allow the gradual fulfilment of the commitments that we all undertook when the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Unfortunately  we have seen a virtual paralysis of the North-South dialogue and a systematic rejection of the use of the mechanisms of international cooperation for development.118.	The Group of 77 will decide  this very week at its ministerial meeting commemorating its twentieth anniversary  on the strategies that we should follow during the coming year in order to achieve our aims. We hope to receive a responsible reaction from the developed countries. The survival of the greater part of mankind and the supreme objective of peace and collective security are at stake.119.	For our part  we are determined to expand economic and technical co-operation among developing countries. Collective self-reliance is not only an ideological principle that brings us together but a practical method to facilitate economic recovery in our countries  strengthen their unity and independence  and promote reform of the prevailing international order. South-South co-operation is a fundamental step in the process of decolonization  and we are therefore determined to encourage it with imagination  efficiency and perseverance.120.	The problems of the world economy must be dealt with coherently and comprehensively. From a structural viewpoint  we must find viable long-term answers. Faced with the needs of the developing countries and the severity of the crisis  urgent and effective measures are required by the international community  together with the commitment of all States to promote the establishment of new and more equitable international economic relations. This will require responsible interlocutors endowed with a sense of solidarity and far-reaching vision.121.	The current crisis has sharply emphasized the negative aspects of economic interdependence. Measures adopted by some of the more influential members of the community of nations are having an adverse effect on the economic security of weaker countries. The gravity of the situation is even being reflected in political and social disorders that threaten the stability of the system as a whole. The deterioration of the quality of life heightens tensions and fosters instability. Practically all countries acknowledge the magnitude of the problems we are confronting. The need now is to translate declarations and speeches into concrete actions of co-operation  free of any subordination or conditions.122.	Every State has the responsibility of promoting its own development  but the international community must assume the correlative obligation of establishing the conditions that permit the attainment of national goals. At considerable sacrifice  we have made adjustments in our own internal economy in order to overcome our difficulties. At the same time  we demand the elimination of unilateral actions that worsen existing imbalances.123.	Foreign debt is now the most burdensome economic problem for developing countries  particularly those of Latin America. The solution to this problem  as postulated by the Cartegena Consensus  signed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of Finance of 11 Latin American countries on 22 June 1984  demands a joint commitment by creditor and debtor nations. The aim is to distribute the costs and benefits of capita! flow according to a principle of justice. It is impossible to demand austerity from those who have less  when more favoured countries have shown no readiness to make similar economic adjustments.124.	The Latin American countries have in recent months begun a process of negotiations to reschedule payments on their foreign debt  lessen capital amortization and reduce the costs of financing. New progress in establishing more equitable conditions must follow the achievements attained thus far. These negotiations  however  require the political framework essential for a fruitful dialogue among debtor Governments  creditor countries  the international banking network and multilateral financing institutions.125.	The problem of debt must be attacked at its roots and in all its complexity. To begin with  the trend that has turned our countries into exporters of capital must be reversed. To this end  we call for the opening up of markets and the elimination of protectionist measures in the industrialized economies. It is also necessary to stabilize prices of raw materials and to reduce interest rates. Beyond reasonable percentages  income derived from exports cannot be committed to the servicing of debts.126.	It must be recognized that the debt crisis is linked to drastic changes in the conditions in which credit contracts were originally drawn up  particularly where liquidity and interest rates  the structure of the debt  and economic growth perspectives are concerned. These changes  which took place in the industrialized countries  demonstrate the joint responsibility of creditors and debtors.127.	At the beginning of President Miguel de la Madrid's administration  Mexico decided to adjust its economy in order to undertake a fundamental reordering. This choice has not been easy for the Mexican people. After periods of apparent prosperity  they have had to enter a time of discipline  restraint and sacrifice. Nevertheless  the country's production structure has been safely maintained and the work force  including its best-qualified elements  has remained intact. Employment opportunities will no doubt increase in the future.128.	The reordering of the economy has been undertaken with a view to reducing inflation and the instability of currency exchange  recovering growth capacity  preserving productive plant and employment  and protecting basic consumption. At the same time  a policy of structural changes has been established in order to tackle the mam problems in the field of production  distribution and social participation in the development process. The ultimate aim is to establish a solid  permanent basis for rapid and egalitarian social development.129.	These efforts at economic readjustment have begun to yield fruit. The difficult transition to a more solid economy would not in any case have been possible without the civic conscience and solidarity of the majority of Mexicans and without a political regime that has invariably shown its maturity and prudence in critical moments.130.	The exceptional resources of our people notwithstanding  consolidation of our effort at recuperation will not be possible without a favourable international atmosphere. Mexico  together with other developing countries  therefore firmly demands the urgent restructuring of world economic relations. The maintenance of unbalanced economic relations such as those that provoked the present crisis  causing a severe deterioration of developing societies  is contrary to all ideas of equity. The international community must make a determined effort to correct asymmetries. Without such an effort  we shall enter an era of growing confrontation and instability.131.	The difficulties in the dialogue between the great Powers and the paralysis of the multilateral disarmament forums oblige us to take political decisions to stave off the danger of a nuclear conflagration.132.	The so-called strategic balance inevitably feeds an arms race that appears to be unending. The experience of the last 40 years proves that an increase in the arsenals of one Power is followed by a similar or greater development of those of its counterpart. The magnitude of their destructive power today is sufficient for mutual annihilation and the destruction of the entire planet.133.	Each new stage of this escalation would seem to move mankind further away from agreements to eliminate for ever the threat of nuclear war. The technical and military struggle between the superpowers is placing us on the threshold of a new phase that could irreversibly block verifiable disarmament commitments.134.	Nevertheless  Mexico is convinced that it is possible to halt this absurd armaments spiral. We have insisted in numerous forums on a freeze of nuclear arsenals as a prerequisite for initiating a gradual reduction in arms  until they are eventually eliminated. Against the logic of strength and armaments we must pit the reason of disarmament and peace.135.	Stability cannot be based on a balance of terror that requires a capacity for reciprocal extermination as a means of guaranteeing peace. It is essential to banish this erroneous doctrine of deterrence.136.	We propose  on the contrary  that security should come about as a result of a gradual reduction of nuclear arsenals. In this way  the spiral would be reversed without altering the balance of power  and progress would be made towards the goal of general and complete disarmament.137.	Furthermore  that could also be a means of severing the causal relationship between armaments and underdevelopment. Resources now allocated to the constant improvement of weapons should be used to improve the lives and economic condition of large sectors of the world's population.138.	Similarly  we reiterate our call for an end to the harmful trade in conventional weapons. In search of a security that is often illusory  many developing countries divert scarce capital to the acquisition of military equipment. Possession of new armaments further erodes trust  increases the risk of war and aggravates the economic weakness of those countries.139.	On 22 May of this year Mexico  together with Argentina  Greece  India  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  called upon the nuclear Powers to assume their responsibilities in the task of disarmament. In their Joint Declaration  the signatory Heads of State or Government announced their determination to ""take constructive action towards halting and reversing the nuclear arms raceâ echoing the pressing demand of an ever- increasing number of men and women of the five continents.140.	I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm  on behalf of the President of Mexico  Miguel de la Madrid  our determination to continue fighting for disarmament. We urge the community of nations to make every possible effort to further that noble peace initiative.141.	There is an urgent need for the great Powers to subordinate considerations of expediency and internal policy to the supreme value of preserving mankindâs existence. Their political will to maintain world peace must be in keeping with the responsibilities deriving from their power.142.	The principles of the juridical equality of States  the self-determination of peoples  non-intervention and the prohibition of the use of force allow of no exceptions. Their strict observance far outweighs casuistic interpretations or supposed threats to national or regional security.143.	A year has passed  and we repeat our appeal that Grenada return to the path of self-determination without limitations of any kind.144.	We note with concern the continued presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. In spite of the intense mediation efforts of the Secretary-General  no significant progress has been made. Once again  we urge the parties involved to seek a prompt solution in accordance with those initiatives.145.	We reaffirm our support for Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and again urge the parties involved to settle their differences through negotiation.146.	In the Middle East  unilateral efforts and expansionist policies for the solution of the regional conflict have been seen to fail. Lasting peace m the area can be attained only through the combined efforts of the parties involved and respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. AH the States of the area have the right to live in peace within recognized borders.147.	The efforts at national reconciliation currently under way in Lebanon with a view to ending the civil war deserve the broadest international support. Lasting stability and peace  however  depend on absolute respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.148.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq is taking on added dimensions that are reflected  according to reliable information  in the indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations  the use of chemical warfare and the violation of international humanitarian law. We hope that new initiatives will emerge from this session of the General Assembly that will help to put an end to a tragic war which is destroying two developing countries.149.	Another year has passed and the people of Namibia still cannot exercise their sovereignty  while the infamous policy of	continues. Once again  we express our repudiation of a system that violates the most elementary norms of human dignity  and we demand an end to the increasingly open support being given by certain countries to the South African regime. Mexico demands the implementation of the decisions of the international community to enable Namibia to attain its independence.150.	Every year here in the General Assembly we review the situations that endanger peace and security. In the Assembly  the international community recommends formulas and means of arriving at peaceful solutions to controversies between States.151.	The close relationship between maintaining peace and attaining development is emphasized here each year. The dramatic needs of our peoples are described  and proposals are made to banish hunger  ignorance and disease from the planet.152.	In spite of the desire for peace of the majority of States  the practical results have been tenuous. The aggravation of conflicts  the growing gap between the developing world and the industrialized nations  the severity of the economic crisis  the breakdown in talks between the great Powers and the stagnation of co-operation and economic negotiations are  unfortunately  the dominant features in the international situation. Such problems must be a source of grave concern to all States.153.	Mexico maintains its unwavering confidence in the strength of law. The imperatives of its history lead it always to defend the principles on which the civilized coexistence of nations is founded. We are certain that diplomacy is today the only feasible means of overcoming the differences that separate States. In these times  the reconciliation of interests and a genuine willingness to understand the views of others should prevail over every form of imposition or domination.154.	Mexico supports the institutions of the community of States. Places in which to meet and communicate with others in a world that is undergoing rapid transformation are a necessary condition of an orderly process of change. I reaffirm the full support of the people and Government of Mexico for the United Nations  the highest expression of international democracy.155.	In its internal affairs  Mexico upholds the rule of law  based on respect for the freedoms of individuals and groups  on encouraging the democratic participation of citizens and on social solidarity. We seek forms of coexistence that will provide an equitable distribution of the benefits derived from the work of all Mexicans. For that same reason  we wish to contribute to the endeavour of ensuring that the society of nations will be governed by the same principles. That conviction is the coherent and solid basis of Mexico's commitment to the cause of peace and international co-operation"
"91",4615,"MLI",39,1984,"ï»¿Next year we shall commemorate with enthusiasm a double anniversaryâthe fortieth anniversary of the Organization and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.34.	At a time when we are drawing up balance sheets  we must note that the world is in crisisâ political crisis and socio-economic crisisâwhich seems to arise from self-interest  the power complex and mutual fear. Never have men been dying in such numbers for freedom  or from hunger and malnutrition in this world of surplus food.35.	Yes  the freedom fighters are still falling under the bullets of anachronistic colonial wars  and the apartheid system is persisting with ever more insidious  virulent and arrogant practices and the flagrant violation of the elementary human rights of peoples. At the same time  for most of the world population  the present and future are immersed in a situation of absolute poverty because of the absence of appropriate solutions to development problems. We are very far from achieving one of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations  namely  the promotion of social progress.36.	The peoples of the world continue to live in a nightmare of uncertainty and in growing insecurity  because there is no significant progress in negotiations on general  complete and controlled disarmament. Worse still  the nuclear danger raises the ever more threatening spectre of a new holocaust. The world is dumbfounded by crises and is virtually on the threshold of war. Diplomatic language has become more and more abrasive. The international situation is explosive.37.	It is therefore comforting that  at a time when there is a growing tendency to turn away from this remarkable institution  the United Nations  a happy combination of circumstances has led to you  Mr. President  guiding the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It is a pertinent symbol. The eminent President of the United Nations Council for Namibia is a worthy son of the southern part of Africa  which is in the vanguard of the African peoples' struggle against the bastion of apartheid. Your outstanding election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session is not only an honour to your country  Zambia  a friend of my country  but also a tribute to the entire African continent. There is no doubt that  thanks to your outstanding qualities as a man of dialogue  prudence  tolerance and compromise  the work of the session will be successful. It goes without saying  of course  that you can be sure of the full co-operation of the delegation of Mali in carrying out your delicate mission.38.	It is also a pleasure for me to convey to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  now Head of State of his country  Panama  my respectful congratulations on the competence  dedication and calmness with which he guided the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.39.	It is also encouraging that  on the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the Organization has welcomed to its midst the 159th Memberâthe State of Brunei Darussalam. My delegation offers this new Member of the Organization its sincere congratulations on the freedom it has gained and assures it of our readiness to seek frank  full and brotherly co-operation with itâco-operation which has already commenced within the Organization of the Islamic Conference.40.	The United Nations has thus moved one step further towards the achievements of one of the fundamental goals set forth in the Charter signed at San Francisco  namely  universality. There is reason to hope that very soon Namibia will be able to join this great family of the United Nations  in accordance with the principles contained in the historic General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).41.	That would  in any case  be fair recompense for the untiring efforts made with great openness by the Secretary-General  to whom we pay a special tribute for his devotion to the cause of the Organization. I am very happy to express to him the gratitude of the people of Mali and its leaders  who will always remember his friendly visit to our country. The Secretary-General also visited other countries in the Sahel and saw the extent of the disaster there. Then  in New York and at Geneva and wherever he had an opportunity to do so  he found the simple  decisive words needed to awaken the international conscience further and  in agreement with the countries concerned  was able to define a new approach to the problems of drought and desertification and to formulate a global strategy for combating those disasters which  I can never repeat enough  constitute a universal calamity.42.	The agony created among the people of the Sahel through the constant deterioration of the ecosystemâthe causes of which do not yet seem to have been studied in depth and the scope of which is not fully understoodâis due to a more disturbing phenomenon than that attributed to cyclic variations in the balance of the world ecology. Desertification has become a fact  one which presents a challenge to our knowledge and which is shaking our belief in our mastery over nature. The scope of desertification can be found in the frightful spread of the phenomenon  year after year  to the point where drought now afflicts every continent  without exception. It has been established that  in 1983  the vegetation line in Africa shrank by 230 kilometres in comparison with 1982. During that period  the food situation in Africa reached a critical threshold. Twenty-five years after independence  Africa is  alas  the only continent where per capita food production has shrunk. Thus Africa has replaced Asia as the main beneficiary of food aid. Indeed  per capita food production south of the Sahara is less than it was 10 years ago  and even 20 years ago.43.	Mali  like other Sahel countries  has been experiencing this disaster for more than 12 years. My country has devoted the greater part of its resources to fighting the phenomenon through an appropriate restructuring of its development programmes  by mobilizing all its means of production and by an acute awareness of the phenomenon of desertification to the point where the Head of State  President Moussa Traore  called upon all Malians to live with the phenomenon and to integrate it into our economy. That appeal is universal in scope  for in the gigantic battle against drought that has become universal  the devotion of a single people  however courageous or determined  is not enough. Therefore  in dealing with this global vision of the preservation of nature  we talked from this very rostrum about the establishment of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  about its goals and the hope that animated its partners and its development programmes and about that Committee's hope of reviving affected regions of their countries. None the less  as is so correctly recognized in the World Economic Survey 1984:""... in addition to the reforms which these countries can undertake on their own  others require investments which are beyond their capacity at the present time. Adequate external support is therefore essential to help sub-Saharan countries accelerate progress in what has become a painful adjustment process.""44.	Twenty-one African countries decided at Dakar  last July  to combine their resources to fight desertification  and once again they have appealed for international  action to counter predictions to the effect that African countries were running the risk of being wiped off the face of the earth because of the implacable desert creep.45.	To be sure  in spite of its relative slowness  international support in the struggle against desertification has not always been lacking. Subsidies or assistance granted to the Sahel countries by friendly countries  international organizations such as the World Bank  the European Economic Community  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations system will never achieve the desired goals unless the volume and quantity of assistance are adapted more and more both to the rationalization of existing economic machinery and to the extent of the damage.46.	The strategy for combating drought is essentially composed of two parts: emergency assistance and medium-term programming. Among the measures to be taken within the framework of emergency assistance is that of giving priority to restoring food supplies in order to meet the acute and pressing needs of the population. The appeal made in Rome  at FAO  last January by the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel is part of that strategy  although it also deals with the concerns for the future. In this context  the food strategy tends to transform food assistance into development assistance  and that depends on the political will of our people. Refusing to settle into a mentality of dependence  and convincedâas President Moussa Traore has constantly repeatedâthat the noblest and most useful assistance is that coming from themselves  the people have entered the fray  which involves a wholesale revision of our assumptions concerning desertification.47.	The harmonious evolution of our society depends upon the attainment of progress by all. It is dependent also upon our capacity to assure a collective security  without which there is no development. The United Nations  which has been created precisely to weave strands of harmony and peace among peoples  is undergoing a crisis because of the fact that some negative attitudes are paralysing its essential organs and preventing them from realizing their ideals. At this time  when the Organization has reached the age of maturity  we call upon all nations present here to show a little more wisdom and determination so as to restore to our peoples all the hope they have in this remarkable instrument of close co-operation. I refer here to rehabilitating the world Organization in terms of scrupulous respect for the sacred principles of non-resort to force  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and abandonment of all forms of political or economic domination.48.	One of the cardinal principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations is  in fact  the refusal to resort to war  in order to save succeeding generations from ""untold sorrow.""49.	Refusal to wage war implies resorting to peaceful means in order to resolve conflicts. Last year  it was our task in this very Hall to insist upon the creative dynamics of dialogue in the search for solutions to disputes arising from the errors and vicissitudes of history. That is the keystone of Mali's foreign policy. Mali constantly cultivates and strengthens its good-neighbourly relations with all the surrounding countries on the basis of fraternal and fruitful dialogue.50.	In Africa  a land of dialogue  this step is more than ever necessary to resolve the painful crisis of the Western Sahara  especially since the ways and means of resolving that question were carefully defined by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983. That dialogue  I say  is more than ever necessary at a time when the Organization of African Unity [OAU] needs to mobilize all its resources to preserve its indispensable unity and meet the difficult problems of development that beset the continent on all sides.51.	It has already been our task to recall the deep historic wellsprings from which Western Sahara and Morocco have drawn their common civilization. That civilization  which is shared by our entire sub region  elevates man to his full grandeur  in all his dignity  with strict respect for his idealsâideals which imply in particular respect for political and economic choices  and therefore the principle of self- determination for all peoples. It is only natural  therefore  for both parties to the conflict in the Western Sahara to have accepted the principle of the organization of a general  free and orderly referendum on self-determination.52.	The African Heads of State  in adopting at Addis Ababa the resolution on Western Sahara  pointed out the path to the restoration of peace in the sub region to which Western Sahara belongs by urgently inviting the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO4 to engage immediately in direct negotiations to define practical modalities  internationally recognized by the Organization  for a referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara so that there will at last be a further clasping of hands in restored friendship and will for co-operation  hands which  in spite of the vicissitudes of history  have woven the fabric of brotherhood down through the ages. This urgent appeal which we reiterate to Morocco comes from our assessment of the outstanding role that country has had to play in its own liberation and in the liberation of other countries under foreign domination and of its capacity as a founding member of the African organization.53.	In these times of grave uncertainties  the OAU  the pride and hope of all sons of Africa  needs to use all its resources in order to work towards the fulfilment of the aspirations for freedom and progress of its peoplesâpeoples who  in spite of the enormous wealth of our continent  remain the most disadvantaged peoples on earth.54.	The principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes must also prevail in order to end the four- year fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  two brother countries  Members of the United Nations  of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It is time  high time  for those two countries to heed the voice of reason and wisdom and achieve a speedy settlement of that tragic conflict  which is constantly growing  in a region where the situation is already very worrisome.55.	Similarly  unless care is taken  the Korean peninsula is again in danger of losing its peace. The artificially created barriers to reunification of that country are unacceptable. They oppose the will of the Korean people  they are contrary to all international commitments made at the end of one of the most painful wars ever fought  and they herald even bloodier conflicts.56.	Fidelity to the Charter of the United Nations and commitment to its ideals therefore demand not only refusal to wage war but also  and perhaps above all  refusal to prepare for war. Unfortunately  the proverb that says ""Let him that desires peace prepare for war"" has not been disproved.57.	Thus persists the dangerous illusion of maintaining security through accumulation of weapons  through possession of the ultimate weapon. In reality  the safeguarding of international security resides in confidence among nations. It is strengthened by the desire to bring peoples ever closer and not make them live in the nightmare of uncertain days. It is strengthened by a firm political will in negotiations on disarmament and not by research and the abusive stockpiling of weapons  the perfecting of which is constantly postponed by ever newer findings on the part of science and technology.58.	Thus we see the perpetuation of the arms race with the development of anti-satellite and anti-missile systems. Dialogue has virtually ended in the Conference on Disarmament. Reciprocal accusations made by the major military Powers with regard to disturbing the balance of forces do not deal with the real object of disarmament  because this imbalance can exist only in people's imaginations. The appeals made by world leaders  and in particular by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries tends precisely to treat the question of disarmament on the basis of the real facts in a climate of confidence and collective responsibility  without which Star Wars will soon cease to be a game shown on the movie screen. It would be enough really for a slight error of calculation to take place or for some equipment suddenly to fail  and our planet would be transformed into the last volcano.59.	Impediments to the launching of decisive negotiations on general and complete disarmament will remain so long as measures to ensure collective security are perceived as the special preserve of those who  thanks to the strength and quality of their weaponry  only threaten that security.60.	Disarmament is dependent on trust and acceptance of responsibility for saving and enriching our common civilization. The incredible waste of resources in the service of war thus becomes more than disturbing. I need make no comment on the ever- rising spiral of expenditure on weapons  but we must highlight the fact that  in this world which longs for social justice  30 childrenâI repeat  30 childrenâ die from hunger each minute while during that same minute $1.3 million is spent on weapons. The cost of a single nuclear submarine is the equivalent of the operations and equipment budget of the world's 23 least developed countries. All the studies on the world economic and social situation have shown that senseless expenditure on arms is one of the direct causes of the present world crisis  which is itself the cause of so many nightmares both in the developed countries and  in particular  in the developing countries.61.	It seems to my delegation that  in the light of the disturbing developments in the international situation  rejection of preparations for war should be as much a duty as non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.62.	Regarding this principle  the conflict in Chadâ which for us is a cause for great concern and distressâcan only  we repeat  be settled nationally. Therefore  we urge the people of Chad to resume the path of negotiations to reconcile their differencesâ differences which can arise in any society but should not be allowed to destroy itâand not to stray from the path of wisdom and honour. We support them in this noble initiative  for the sovereignty of Chad can be maintained and remain inviolable only by the will of the people of Chad  free from all outside interference. The withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad  which is now under way  should make a positive contribution to national reconciliation. Then the sons of Chad will be reconciled and the external aspect of the crisis will be more easily dealt with  because with unity peoples have always known how to respond to threats to their sovereignty  integrity and independence.63.	Outside Africa  after long years of wastage of energy and resources in terms of human lives  peace has yet to be restored in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. The intercommunity talks have been suspended in Cyprus. Central America is more deeply engulfed in armed conflict. We must accept the fact that these unfortunate situations cannot be resolved by military means.64.	We had hoped that after the glorious sacrifices made in South-East Asia a new era of fruitful and fraternal co-operation would begin for the peoples and the age-old culture of that sub region  through respect for the principle of good-neighbourliness and through joint efforts. Unfortunately  however  that has not been the case. Mali calls on the countries concerned to embark on and broaden the path of dialogue in order to settle the conflicts which only expose them to interference of all kinds.65.	We call upon the sons of Kampuchea to undertake such negotiations  without outside interference. They would gain much by joining together to face the priority tasks of development. For its part  the Government of Mali will support any action towards a politicalâand therefore negotiatedâsettlement of this tragic question.66.	It is impossible to overemphasize the fact that the solution to the tragedy of the Afghan people must be a completely political one. Only peaceful negotiations carried out with a true political will to achieve a genuine solution can enable Afghanistan to regain its unity and its status as a non-aligned country. Mali pursues the same objectives regarding the disturbing situation of the Cypriot people. My country is a member of the contact group of non-aligned countries on the Cyprus question  and  while welcoming the Secretary-General's tireless efforts  we invite the two communities to negotiate and engage in fruitful dialogue so that this conflict  the source of international tension  may be resolved in a way that is just and will protect the unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus.67.	In Latin America and the Caribbean  just as in South-East Asia  interventionist activities are also taking place. In the Final Communique adopted by the Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Countries held at Managua from 10 to 14 January 19835 on the situation in Central America and the Caribbean  among other things  and  more recently  in the Quito Declaration  adopted by the Latin American Economic Conference held at Quito from 9 to 13 January 1984  the attention of the international community was drawn to the fundamental problems facing South America and the Caribbean. To the problems of development  unfortunately  another must be added. I refer to interference of all kinds. Here  as elsewhere  this is a matter for the peoples alone. They demand only to live in peace  with respect for their chosen political  economic and social systems  the differences in which sometimes show originality and are a source of further progress.68.	Reason always triumphs in relations among men of good will. It is on the basis of reason and understanding of the true interests of Latin America and the Caribbean that the Contadora Group is attempting  with remarkable patience  to put an end to futile conflicts over boundaries and sovereignty between countries which are the heirs of Simon Bolivar  who considered them all to be one and the same homeland.69.	Year after year  in the face of the many problems that we have just outlined  we end up believing that the United Nations is incapable of resolving the crises that break out in various places and spheres.70.	In Africa  racism is becoming increasingly insidious and virulent. Colonial wary continue.71.	Only one year after its establishment  the United Nations came into conflict with South Africa over the political future of Namibia. For 18 years  the people of Namibia  under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its sole authentic representative  has faced with increasing success  despite extremely difficult conditions  the army of South African invaders. SWAPO would have been easily crushed had it not genuinely embodied  expressed and defended the deepest aspirations of its people. SWAPO has consistently fulfilled its national responsibilities. Its political maturity and its devotion to the ideals of peace need no further proof. It is a model for authentic national liberation movements: it shows firmness and persistence in struggle and openness to dialogue and concessions without capitulation. We  in Mali  would like to believe that Africa is incapable of betraying an African cause  and that the great diplomatic activity seen recently between South Africa and some of its immediate neighbours is explained only by irresistible economic necessity brought about by the timid support of African States for the front-line countries  division in the OAU  a lack of effective and active support from friends of Africa  and the requirements of the long and complex struggle of the peoples of southern Africa.72.	Thus  the war for the independence of Namibia is more than a national liberation struggle. Its nature and scope can be compared to those of the determined  universal struggle against racism  Nazism and fascism  the triumph of which led to the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations and the founding of the Organization. That fact is clear  and it explains why  despite much resistance and much culpable accommodation with the apartheid regime  the United Nations has associated itself with the liberation struggle of the Namibian people while constantly pointing out the peaceful paths that could lead to its success. The most recent initiative is reflected in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the implementation of which  six years after its adoption  is still being blocked by the simple fact of South Africa's ingrained hostility to the principles that are the glory of the United Nations: democracy  freedom and respect among peoples.73.	The stumbling-blocks placed in the way of the rapid and proper implementation of resolution 435 (1978) are therefore serious and of great concern because they are highly prejudicial to international peace and security. While such acts of procrastination can delay Namibia's accession to independence  they can never prevent it. Such dilatory manoeuvres exacerbate tensions in southern Africa rather than reducing them in the interest of peace. Respect for the ideals enunciated in the Charter calls for the full implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  which was adopted with the favourable vote of four of the Powers that have the right of veto. The United Nations cannot be indifferent to the agony suffered by the Namibian people.74.	You  Sir  who have presided tactfully and effectively over the United Nations Council for Namibia  know that the history of decolonization teaches us that negotiations entered into in good faith have often been long and arduous. They have  none the less  made it possible to resolve many colonial conflicts.75.	In the past  prior to the holocaust  people believed that Nazism was merely an epiphenomenon. They were wrong and  alas  mankind paid dearly for it. Today  in southern Africa  the strategy of the Nazi leaders is resurfacing: we see the deliberate violation of the borders of neighbouring countries and racist confiscation of fundamental freedoms. Today  here and there  we can still see shields being raised up in defence of human rights  sometimes on behalf of peoples that have not even asked for that much  but  on the other hand  powerful information media  the most modern weapons and facilities of every kind are  with inadmissible complicity  being placed at the service of apartheid.76.	Last June  the fortieth anniversary of the Normandy landing was celebrated in Europe. We reverently recalled the glorious sacrifice of millions and millions of men deprived of their lives in order that liberty might prevail  in order that racial hatred should not be handed down to future generations. The apartheid leader took part in those commemorative ceremonies. He most certainly must have taken advantage of the occasion to spit upon the graves of the non-whites who lie in the far-distant soil they helped save from tyranny.77.	The electoral farce that was quite rightly and widely boycotted by the Indian and coloured communities is part of the same strategy of revamping apartheid in order to make it look presentable.78.	The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations calls for redressing assaults on its purposes and principles through peaceful means  and states that armed force shall not be usedâsave  as it makes clear  ""in the common interest"". The presence of South Africa in Namibia is an insult to history  to logic and to the lofty purposes set forth in the Charter. It is in the common interest to isolate and destroy the hateful system of apartheid by all available diplomatic  cultural  economic and  above all  military means  in keeping with the relevant provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. Thus  history will one day reproach us for having tolerated this abject system for so long and in so shameful a way  and mankind will not have to suffer another mistake with incalculable consequences.79.	In view of the ethic that has served to support the Pretoria-Tel Aviv axis  the Palestinian people  too  continue to carry their heavy cross. Having failed to find an equitable solution to the question of Palestine  the Middle East ceased decades ago to be one of the privileged meeting grounds for different races and cultures. The Government of Israel has waged war there on the pretext of protecting the Jewish homeland  but to the detriment  none the less  of the Palestinian people's right to preserve their own identity and draw strength from the teachings of their age-old history  to build their own future on the basis of their own values and aspirations. However  like all wars of liberation  the war forced upon the Palestinian people will also end with the triumph of right over injustice  with the triumph of faith in fundamental human rights and with the advent of an era of reconciliation among all the children of Palestine. This is inevitable and will come to pass notwithstanding the occupation of Arab territories by force or the proliferation of settlements and the systematic and savage bombardments of Palestinian refugee camps.80.	We shall never tire of repeating that the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the Middle East crisis. Its solution is not to be found in an augmented arsenal of armaments but in recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  especially its right to independence and national sovereignty.81.	Despite the difficulties inherent in the protracted state of tension  Lebanon has entered a new phase of national reconciliation  the success of which depends primarily on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from that territory.82.	Peace derives strength from movements towards peace. The glimmer of hope that has appeared in Lebanon could extend to the whole of the Middle East if the reality of Palestine prevails. In recognizing  in its various resolutions  the right of the Palestinian people to a national existence  the United Nations has faithfully reflected international public opinion.83.	The Organization has called for a new dialogue to re-establish confidence in this troubled and highly sensitive region of the Middle East by advocating  in General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. The reactions of Governments to that sound recommendation have demonstrated the need for such an initiative  one that has also been advocated by many international organizations. The people of Mali  a people of peace  will spare no effort to ensure that that conference takes placeâa conference that will be responsible before history  one representing hope to all the peoples of the Middle East who are victims of endless and bloody wars that lay waste their legitimate aspirations to security and economic progress.84.	Obviously  the holding of such a conference would be pointless without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people. Its agenda will be limited if it does not include the root causes of the graving deterioration in the situation in the Middle East  namely  and in particular  the recognition of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people  withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and non-interference in the internal affairs of States of the region. A decisive step towards peace will be made if the largest possible number of countries can participate in that conference and  obviously  all those Powers to whom the Charter has given special responsibilities in the area of safeguarding and maintaining international peace and security.85.	In addition to these serious political crises that are tearing the world apart  one of the major threats to international peace and security is posed by the overall world economic situation  which continues to be alarming. In its deterioration  the economic social crisis has passed through several critical stages. It represents a kind of structural violence that is becoming endemic.86.	The economic situation in the developing countries is disastrous. For some of them  even that word is a euphemism  since negative factors affecting world economic growth are compounded in those countries by additional climatic and ecological factors that are depriving them of the meagre resources from which they already derive paltry benefits. For most of the poorer countries  we are unfortunately witnessing so-called bad development  since their development is being blocked by the weakening in the flow of official development assistance  the crushing burden of debt servicing  which forestalls any improvement in the standard of living  the rise in interest rates  the relentless collapse in raw commodity prices with the concomitant deterioration in terms of trade and  lastly  the alarming reduction of the share of developing countries in world trade.87.	For the developed countries  the announced economic recovery becomes a mere assumption with the collapse of the world economic structures. The development and intensity of the present economic crisis rest on many factors which have been amply described in many manuals and publications  and we therefore do not need to dwell on these. If we cited too many figures  we might mask the tragedy which lies behind this situation.88.	The scientific studies on the chronic balance-of- payments deficits  the uncontrolled rise in the cost of borrowing and the foreign debt burden hide a simple reality  namely  that our economies are at a standstill. While the burden of indebtednessâ$800 billionâ prevents any economic progress or improvement in the standard of living of the developing countries  the repayment of this debt is gradually becoming impossible. This explains the awesome words of one exasperated leader  who asked: ""How can that debt be repaid except through the hunger of our people?â Already  $500 billion has been deemed lostâthat is  more than the total capital of the Western banks. Chain reactions are taking place which endanger the economic and social system in the so-called developed world  and it is impossible to forecast what can emerge from this chaos except greater poverty and violence. The world economy will remain at a standstill because of the absence of the co-operation needed to take the necessary action. This situation will persist until a responsible dialogue taking into account mutual interests is begun on the establishment of a new international economic order which will safeguard the sovereignty of States over their resources.89.	Renewed co-operation between the North and the South is an absolute necessity if we wish to maintain a climate of peace and understanding in the world.90.	The African States  in adopting the Lagos Plan of Action demonstrated their desire to contribute to the building of a world in which the progress and happiness of all would be promoted. The Lagos Plan  based on the strategy of collective autonomy and designed to encourage and strengthen South-South co-operation at the sub regional and regional levels  is one of the main components of the new international economic order which must be built in a spirit of harmony and solidarity in order to respond to the deeply felt aspirations of man. That is also the strategy of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Indeed  the non-aligned countries  noting that the exacerbation of East-West confrontation not only threatens world peace but also dangerously jeopardizes co-operation between nations  decided  surmounting the problem of blocs  to build a new international economic order which would ensure peace and justice for all. The global negotiations  which have not yet gone beyond the stage of exploratory contacts  must be continued. The present world economy  because interdependence is a fact  cannot be adapted to the natural order of things simply by willingness to do this. As we have stated  the harmonious development of international society hinges on the achievement of progress for all. It can be maintained only by our ability to deal with international problems in their entirety and to find global solutions for them.91.	The third world  the Group of 77  must continue to demonstrate open-mindedness in order to achieve steady progress.92.	The world horizon is dangerously uncertain. The international situation is one of growing insecurity  injustice and human tragedy. Monetary and financial chaos  the slowing-down of trade  poverty  social deprivationâparticularly hungerâdesertification and poor employment prospects for coming generations are the ills which threaten to destroy our international society. In the face of these real dangers  I wish  on behalf of the people of Mali and President Moussa Traore  to make an appeal to reason and unity of action. Indeed  while we fear that the developing countries are headed for disaster  we doubt very much that they will be alone."
"92",4656,"MLT",39,1984,"ï»¿I would like first of all to congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to welcome to our midst a new Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam.181.	The essential task of the international community is to identify collective action leading to the peace and prosperity in which the citizens of each Member State can pursue their individual destinies. Each year in the General Assembly we take stock of our endeavours in this direction. For the region of the Mediterranean  this year has witnessed significant developments in the process aimed at transforming our region into a zone of peace  security and co-operation.182.	At the beginning of the year  when the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe opened at Stockholm  all the non-aligned Mediterranean States were given an opportunity to address the participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe on confidence- and security-building measures in the Mediterranean as part and parcel of the process of confidence- and security-building measures in the whole of Europe. As I had the opportunity to state in my address to the opening meeting of the Stockholm Conference  ""tension and confrontation in the Mediterranean are both a result  and in tum a cause  of tension and confrontation in other parts of Europe"". For that reason  Mediterranean countries would examine all confidence- and security-building proposals at Stockholm in the light of their applicability to Mediterranean security issues  especially the seriously deteriorating naval military confrontational situation in our region.183.	A second important development in our region concerned the first-ever ministerial meeting of the Mediterranean members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which took place at Valletta on 10 and 11 September 1984. The Foreign Ministers of Egypt  Libya  Malta  Morocco  Syria  Tunisia and Yugoslavia and Ministers from Algeria and Cyprus  together with the Head of the Political Department of the PLO  participated in that important meeting and agreed on a declaration which lays down the basis for transforming the Mediterranean into a zone of peace  security and co-operation.184.	The non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean are conscious of the continuing need to intensify their efforts for peace in a world which  unfortunately  is progressively becoming a more dangerous and a much less kind place for our citizens to live in. The Secretary-General has once again focused attention on the two related elements of the dilemmaâthe headlong rush towards nuclear catastrophe and the callousness with which pressing development needs are denied the necessary resources.185.	The reckless reliance upon increasing armaments  especially nuclear armaments  exacerbates tension  rather than increasing security. The accumulating and expanding grievances owing to poverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy are fast reaching explosive points at both national and international levels. The most outrageous fact of all is that so many resources continue to be poured into the armaments race instead of being devoted to redressing the needs and pressures of development.186.	Underlying this dangerous reality is the phenomenon of two contending military alliances  each led by a massive super-Power which places its interests and objectives as inevitably superior to those of other nations. The majority of mankind today faces the supreme arrogance of a handful of industrially and technologically advanced nations which take it for granted that  nearly as a divine right  their citizens should increase their already well- established well-being and enhance their already well-protected security even at the cost of denying the most basic needs of livelihood and existence to the rest of their fellow beings.187.	Those nations consider that the pursuit of their security is primordial  even to the extent of intruding upon the stability of other regions and countries. They assume automatically that because they possess might of armaments they also possess wisdom of action and that  consequently  whatever they decide as being good and useful for themselves must and should be good and useful for others.188.	We have witnessed over recent months even more disconcerting manifestations of this phenomenon. In the Middle East  in Central Asia and in Central America  the two super-Powers have felt no inhibition in using force or manifestations of force to thwart local developments which they have unilaterally defined as inimical to their interests. They have felt no inhibitions in continuing to pour new and more lethal armaments into already tense areas like the Mediterranean  the Indian Ocean  particularly near the Gulf region  and the Pacific  because their interests so dictated. In spite of their protestations in favour of freedom and democracy  they have failed to act effectively to redress the injustices of apartheid in South Africa and the oppression in Namibia. In spite of their claims to humanity  they have found it more useful to send costly satellites into orbit  to deploy new missiles and to develop  ever more expensive and lethal weaponry than to encourage and implement measures to relieve the hunger and the poverty of so many peoples or to soften the massive debt burden of so many nations.189.	As has often been noted  the objective of the United Nations is to replace the arbitrary action of individual nations by collectively agreed action. The United Nations is a substitute for  not an extension of  the Yalta arrangements. Individual nations do not lose their identity or sovereignty but  rather  enhance their dignity and freedom of action by participating in the decision-making possible through the United Nations.190.	It is perhaps logical that it has been the emergent nations of the world which have most appreciated the essential value of collective action. All of us pursued our individual struggle for liberation within the framework of the global revolt against colonialism. Today  as free and sovereign States we pursue the security and prosperity of our peoples in the full knowledge that unless our actions are mutually supportive we will fail to escape from the poverty and oppression which still engulf most of us.191.	The movements and initiatives which the emergent nations have originated have therefore been intimately linked with the work of the United Nations. Malta's work in the Security Council comes to an end this year. It is perhaps appropriate to recall that on this very day  the members of the Council have unanimously agreed on a second report on the strengthening of the Council's work which Malta was entrusted to prepare. Our initiatives at the international level have found their fullest expression in the creation of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77  which this year is celebrating its twentieth anniversary. Both of those groups define their objectives and pursue their actions in strict conformity with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.192.	Our more specific initiatives at the regional level have been conceived just as strictly in the context of our pursuit of collective action at the global level. The need for collective action at the regional level arises both from the disparate needs of different regions and the different manifestations of super-Power rivalry in various parts of the globe. In contrast with the initiatives of the industrialized nations  however  the regional initiatives of the developing and non-aligned nations  in both the economic and the security fields  remain integrally linked with their initiatives at the global level.193.	Over recent years such initiatives have assumed concrete form and achieved a clear substance. In South-East Asia the countries of ASEAN have pioneered the new road towards regional initiatives. Moving away from the series of regional military arrangements imposed earlier within the framework of the armed alliances  the ASEAN initiative rests upon the foundation of enhancing security and cooperation throughout their region  without at any point jeopardizing security and co-operation at the wider level.194.	Malta has followed with interest and encouragement the calm and constructive manner in which the ASEAN nations have been pursuing the objective of securing the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea; the forms of economic co-operation among themselves which they are forging not in isolation but as a formative link in their economic relations with other countries; and the openness of their actions to the involvement of other nations in their region and beyond so that they may join in the collective endeavours towards regional and global security and co-operation.195.	The initiative of the Gulf Co-operation Council  while dealing with different security issues and relating to different economic conditions  is  however  conceived in the same mould. The tragedy of the fratricidal struggle between Iran and Iraq is a matter of the gravest concern to all non-aligned and developing nations. Malta's objective is not to favour one side over the other or to foment differences but  rather  to impress upon both sides the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities leading to a peaceful  just and lasting resolution of the differences which divide them. Malta is encouraged to see that all the initiatives taken by the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council are intended in that direction. We support their aims to avoid an enlargement of the conflict  to discourage super-Power meddling or involvement and to maintain sea and air lanes free for commercial traffic  while at the same time seeking to protect their security interests and to encourage the contending nations to resolve their conflict.196.	In Central America the Contadora Group initiative provides yet another successful example of how developing and non-aligned countries can serve as a motivating force for a resolution of conflicts and tensions in their region. The struggle of the peoples of Central America to rid themselves of the oppression of foreign economic and military interference has been long and arduous. Those who through bitter and heroic struggle have achieved their objectives still face the hidden intrigues and open aggression of outside interference. The proposals which the Contadora Group has formulated for resolving the suspicions and hatreds  the pressures and intrigues and the outside military interference which harass the region are constructive and far-reaching. They deserve the full co-operation of all countries directly concerned and the support of peace-loving States worldwide.197.	These and other regional initiatives by developing and non-aligned countries share common foundations in spite of the different circumstances in which they are unfolding. They all stress the need for regional States themselves to take the leading role in resolving problems of their region. They prove that approaches based on dialogue and co-operation are much more fruitful than reliance upon armed might in resolving problems. They emphasize the need for outside Powers  and in particular the super-Powers  to stop meddling in the destinies of different regions  either directly through military presence or indirectly through the use of proxies.198.	It is a great satisfaction to report further on the meeting whichâacting upon a mandate given to them by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983âthe Mediterranean members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries held at Valletta earlier this month to concert their views and devise initiatives for co-operation and for strengthening security in the Mediterranean.199.	Since time immemorial  the Mediterranean has been considered by predominant military Powers as a special preserve for their global empire-building. Much of the fighting of the Second World War was undertaken in or around our region. A string of military bases then dotted our shores. The flow of commercial traffic has traditionally been punctuated by the flow of military hardware.200.	The end of the Second World War spelt the demise of the colonial era. In the Mediterranean  however  the withdrawal of the colonial Powers was immediately replaced by the intrusion of super-Power presence. First  the United States Sixth Fleet and  soon after  the growing Soviet naval capability invaded and took over our waters. For Mediterranean peoples the struggle against colonialism therefore merged into the struggle to rid the region of the military presence of outside Powers. Even after the achievement of our independence  the pressures upon us to maintain and even increase the military facilities available in our region for use by the military alliances  very often even against our own interest  remained in force.201.	Dedication to the policy of non-alignment has therefore meant an uphill struggle for those Mediterranean countries which chose to pursue it. Malta's experience exemplifies the difficulties we have had to surmount and the determination that was required to secure our objectives. We have had to struggle consistently to escape from the shackles of post- colonial tutelage and to eliminate all foreign military presence from our soil  in order finally to be able to adopt the status of neutrality  based on non-alignment  which we defined as the most appropriate manner in which we could pursue our national development and at the same time contribute towards security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region.202.	The policy measures we applied to pursue our objectives have been the object of slander and attack  open and covert opposition  even outright aggression from reactionary forces both inside and outside our country. Our internal social and economic policies were deliberately misconstrued and our expanding relations with other countries maliciously misinterpreted in an attempt to distort our objectives and obstruct our endeavours. Even such measures as the introduction of free hospitals and medical services and free education for all our citizens have been and in some cases are still being accompanied by the rabid opposition of vested interests. That we have prevailed is due to our tenacity and to the strength we derived from cur friends in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and elsewhere.203.	Together with the other Mediterranean countries which have accomplished their national struggle for freedom and dignity  we realize that the elimination of all foreign military presence from our territories is only the first step in ridding our region of the tension and confrontation that characterize it. As long as the Mediterranean remains a focal point of super-Power confrontation we cannot feel free and secure to pursue our national destinies and resolve our regional problems in the manner we consider most appropriate. We cannot feel free and secure as long as our sea remains the playground for the United States Sixth Fleet to flex its muscles whenever it desires  as long as the Soviet Navy uses our sea as its backyard  as long as two major navies and a number of smaller ones use our sea as the domain of their ever-enlarging war games  as long as our region is riddled with staging posts for rapid troop deployment  and as long as nuclear weapons beneath and above our waters  and even on the adjoining mainland  remain the frightening daily reality.204.	The concern and dismay voiced by non- aligned Mediterranean countries at these developments do not spring from any sense of antagonism to either one or the other of the super-Powers. Neither is it our wish to stand in the way of the pursuit by any country  regional or not  of its legitimate commercial and security interests. Our sea has always been a point of contact and a means of transit for different cultures and peoples. Our aim is to enhance this traditional function by transforming it into a zone of peace  co-operation and security based on the principles of non-alignment.205.	The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the non- aligned Mediterranean countries  meeting at Valletta  were deeply conscious of the far-reaching significance of the action they were taking and the widespread support that accompanied their initiative. Their deliberations were followed directly by representatives of the Chairman of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  India  and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States  who attended as observers. Messages of support from sympathetic foreign ministers came from many countries  including China  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Greece personally attended the formal opening session of the meeting. These expressions of support in themselves constitute an acknowledgement that the initiative of the non-aligned Mediterranean countries is not a self-enclosed one but rather opens itself up to the involvement of the aligned States of the region. In this context  it is to be hoped that future meetings of this nature will be followed even more closely and attentively by the southern European States of the Mediterranean.206.	The Final Declaration adopted at the Valletta meeting has been distributed as a document of the General Assembly. I should like to underline some of the most significant elements that emerged from this first ministerial meeting of the non-aligned Mediterranean countries ever held.207.	In the first instance  particular importance is to be attached to the fact that the Ministers of the non-aligned countries devoted their special attention to ""the presence of foreign fleets  military bases and facilities to be used for aggression against non- aligned members""  which they considered as having serious consequences for their security interests. In the light of this assessment  the non-aligned Mediterranean countries agreed upon what turns out to be the central point of their declaration  namely  their solemn reaffirmation of the three fundamental and interrelated aspects of their whole approach to questions of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region: first  their commitment not to use force or the threat of force among themselves; secondly  their undertaking never to permit military bases or facilities for great Power presence in their region; and  thirdly  their invitation to other Mediterranean European States to adhere strictly to the principle of the non-use or threat of force  and in particular not to use their own armaments and forces  nor allow the use of bases and military facilities against non-aligned Mediterranean members. We have here the essential foundation upon which a peaceful and secure Mediterranean can be achieved.208.	At the same time  the Valletta meeting conclusively demonstrated that whatever problems exist in our region they do not preclude the possibility of collective action for security and co-operation. Individual differences between any of the participants did not prevent them from asserting together that the Valletta meeting constituted a step of major political significance aimed at strengthening the efforts of the Mediterranean non- aligned countries to transform the Mediterranean into a region of peace  security and co-operation  in conformity with the decisions of the Non-Aligned Movement and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly  in particular resolution 38/189 ...209.	The non-aligned Mediterranean countries have now clearly identified the measures which need to be pursued both for the resolution of the specific problems of their region and to reduce the overall level of tension and confrontation in the Mediterranean.210.	On the Middle East they reiterated the fundamental position that""a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and the solution of the Palestinian question cannot be achieved without the total and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 6 June 1967  and the full exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  their sole legitimate representative  including the right of return  self-determination without external interference and the right to national independence and sovereignty  including the right to establish an independent Palestinian State in its homeland  Palestine"". To this end the Ministers of the non-aligned Mediterranean countries expressed their support for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East in conformity with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C.211.	On the question of Lebanon  the Ministers ""decided to intensify efforts to bring about the withdrawal of Israeli forces  as the continued Israeli occupation is the main factor obstructing national reconciliation in Lebanon""	212.	On the question of Cyprus  the Ministers ""called for the withdrawal of all foreign military forces"" and ""pledged their full support to the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in the solution of the problem and urged him to continue and intensify his current efforts""213.	Finally  the Mediterranean non-aligned countries made it clear that they envisage the process of Mediterranean security and co-operation as involving a dialogue of full equality between them and the aligned States of the Mediterranean. They identified two major areas in which this dialogue has to be conducted with the utmost urgency. One concerns the process of confidence and security-building. It was stressed that  ""for the process begun at the Stockholm Conference on Confidence-and Security- building Measures and Disarmament in Europe to unfold effectively  adequate measures for the Mediterranean region must be agreed to  through a dialogue on the basis of equality"" para. The other concerns the economic relations between non-aligned Mediterranean countries and the European Economic Community. It was stressed that co-operation must ""take due account of the legitimate concern of the non-aligned Mediterranean members  especially in the sectors of human resources  trade and economic development"".214.	The results of the Valletta meeting therefore provide a sober and firm basis for action aimed at reversing the tension and confrontation which exist in the Mediterranean and which pose a threat to the peace and security not only of the region itself but also of the international community in general. We expect other countries in our region and the superpowers themselves to take up the challenge which has been set. They should recognize that the Valletta Declaration  far from being an isolated and soon forgotten expression of solidarity  reflects with precision and clarity the political realities of our region. Mediterranean countries  not only the non-aligned among them  are seriously concerned at the security situation in the region; they are worried and dismayed at the growing manifestations of super-Power confrontation around them; they are keen to see a peaceful  just and lasting resolution of the problems of the region  notably the question of Palestine and that of Cyprus.215.	it has to be recognized that in the background of the Valletta Declaration lies the political will and action of the various protagonists in our region aimed at resolving the problems which exist It would be a great mistake on the part of either super-Power to ignore the positive implications of recent developments regarding problems in North Africa  to misjudge the common desire for national reconciliation and the return to full sovereignty over their territory of the people of Lebanon  or to bypass the process of healing of wounds taking place in Cyprus.216.	The members of the EEC should accept the hand of co-operation which is being extended to them by the developing countries of the Mediterranean. They should respond to this call by transforming their present tight-fisted and protectionist attitude into policies which open their markets for the products of other Mediterranean countries on equitable terms and conditions and which utilize resources available in the region on the basis of mutual benefit. The forthcoming Venice seminar on economic  cultural and scientific co-operation in the Mediterranean of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which in its turn is a follow-up to the Valletta meeting of February 1979  offers an ideal opportunity for the EEC member countries to demonstrate a new and more positive attitude towards co-operation in the Mediterranean. We shall go to Venice expecting that the EEC will not miss this opportunity  albeit already belated  to reverse a trend which  if maintained  could not but contribute towards a further polarization of attitudes in the region.217.	The nations participating in the Conference on Confidence-and Security-building Measures and Dis-armament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm  should now respond to the call for a full dialogue on Mediterranean security  in the light of their acknowledgement that there can be no security in Europe without security in the Mediterranean. The attempt to hide behind such technicalities as the assertion that the whole of Europe does not include the European waters of the Mediterranean  or that the massive naval deployment in the Mediterranean can somehow be considered a phenomenon independent of what happens on the European mainland  is certainly not the proper spirit in which to consider the question of Mediterranean and European security in a serious manner 218.	Non-aligned Mediterranean countries want to ensure that their territorial waters are fully respected  that their enclosed high sea is used scrupulously and exclusively for the purpose of peace and that the question of whether or not nuclear weapons should be deployed barely 100 or so miles from their populations should be a matter on which they are fully consulted. Unless these questions are considered in detail both within the Conference on Confidence-and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe and in separate and equal dialogue between Conference participants and the non-aligned Mediterranean countries  security and confluence-building cannot be achieved either in the Mediterranean or in Europe itself.219.	The non-aligned Mediterranean countries are determined steadfastly to pursue and reinforce the regional process which they launched at Valletta. For this purpose  they have agreed to meet again in the future and to utilize all available forums  especially the General Assembly and the Security Council and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries itself. Those of us who are participants in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will also follow-up at Stockholm all the relevant questions raised at Valletta.220.	What non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean are doing in their region forms an integral link with what other non-aligned countries are doing elsewhere. Reference has already been made to other regional initiatives. I should also like to mention here the initiatives concerning transforming the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  as well as the efforts by the front-line States of southern Africa to bring justice and stability to their region.221.	The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  it must be remembered  are also still struggling to reunite their divided country. In this context  Malta wishes to reiterate its support for the proposals for tripartite discussion  and the eventual solution of setting up a confederal republic in Korea. We urge all the parties concerned to approach these constructive proposals in an open and co-operative spirit. Like many other countries  Malta fails to understand the justification for a continuing presence of foreign troops in South Korea after a number of recent developments have taken place which significantly alter the factors which contributed to the placing of those troops there in the first place.222.	A few peoples  notably the Palestinian and Namibian peoples  are still engaged in the struggle to achieve freedom and sovereignty. To them we extend our fullest support  sympathy and encouragement.223.	For the large number of other emergent peoples  the national liberation struggle is today almost a whole generation away. However  we can look back and recognize that our struggle for liberation did not end when our people became free to hoist their own flag and play their national anthem on their own territory. Liberation means much more than that. It means most significantly  the freedom to adopt those social and economic policies at the national level which we consider most just and applicable for our particular developmental and cultural conditions.224.	It is becoming increasingly apparent that the economic and social policies we adopt at the national level inevitably interface with the realities beyond our own frontiers. The structures supporting international economic relations  the methods governing the flow of information and the strategic conditions encompassing our regions both affect and in turn are affected by the social and economic policies we adopt at the national level. 223. Given the inequitable structures of existing international economic relations and information flows and the predominant position of a few industrially advanced nations  the realities beyond our frontiers have hitherto been more of a constraint than a help to our development process  it is for this reason that the developing countries have raised the call for new international orders both in the economic and in the information fields. It is equally for this reason that they are increasingly seeking an active role in matters relating to the security as much as to the economic situation in their regions.226.	It is in this spirit that Malta has been pursuing its national and regional policies under a socialist Government. Thanks to the far-reaching and comprehensive social and economic reforms we have introduced over the past 13 years  Maltese society today presents a much more humane and just picture than was the case while we were still under post- colonial tutelage. Our health and education policies  our pension systems  unemployment and sickness benefits  and a vast range of allowances for children  orphans and widows today ensure that no member of our society is downtrodden or forgotten. It has been our consistent endeavour to ensure that  while each individual in our society is given the fullest opportunity to enlarge and fulfil his or her own personality and pursue his personal aspirations  that person will not be permitted to do so at the expense of the legitimate rights and aspirations of other members of society.227.	In our economic and other relations with other countries we expect our partners in our region and elsewhere to co-operate with us in applying complementary and mutually beneficial measures to improve the well-being of our respective populations. Time and time again  the developing countries have emphasized that the existing structures of international trade and technology flows do not facilitate mutually beneficial relationships  but on the contrary favour the strong against the weak. Time and time again  we have complained how the terms and conditions of international payments are continually manipulated to work against our interests.228.	As long as these calls remain unheeded we have to take our own independent remedial action to safeguard our interests and hard-won gains. Over the past 13 years under its socialist Government  Malta  lacking all forms of indigenous natural resources  has built up  through careful planning  the collective efforts of its people and the assistance of its friends  an external reserve which permits it today to possess at least one sure means of defence against adversity. An indication of the extent of our collective effort emerges from the fact that for the last two years the Maltese people have succeeded in freezing both prices and earnings.229.	Obviously we are not prepared to see our years of effort and sacrifice undermined through the unjust and biased trading systems the industrialized market economy countries are seeking to perpetuate. To those countries that enjoy a continuous and substantial trading surplus with us we have made it clear that means of redress must be found on a mutually agreed basis. We are not prepared to keep on purchasing goods and services from those who are not ready to give us something in returnâbe it in terms of increasing their purchases from us  or in terms of a transfer of technology in our favour which would help us operate more effectively on their markets  or in terms of some other form of industrial and commercial co-operation which is acceptable to us.230.	We are certainly far from proposing some form of passive co-operation in which a one-way flow of assistance or aid does more to undermine our sovereignty and harm our productive capacity than anything else. On the contrary  what we seek is a partnership on the basis of equality where the efforts and benefits are shared both ways. We can offer to our partners the skills and expertise of our workers which have grown and developed over the years  as our economy has itself grown and diversified. We offer them the benefits of our many political initiatives through which  on the basis of reciprocal trading and banking arrangements with countries ranging from the Mediterranean region to the Far East  we have obtained for our products and services access to new and expanding markets.231.	The opportunities these achievements offer to the small number of industrialized countries that still need to reduce the huge trading surplus they enjoy with us are not limited simply to the possibility of increasing their purchases from us. There also exists the vast potential of joint investment with us  as our successful experience with some of our partners already demonstrates. For those countries who have yet to take up these opportunities  we continue to extend the offer of mutually beneficial co-operation. But we must make it equally clear that we will not tolerate any longer a biased and lopsided relationship where the benefits are only in their favour.232.	The battle cry of the developing world has always been ""trade not aid"". The Maltese people expect their legitimate rights  not any form of charity. With distant Japan  negotiations on this basis can now start.233.	AH the more did the Maltese people expect Italy to translate good-neighbourly relations into positive acts. Our commercial disequilibrium with Italy has reached alarming proportions. This is no longer tolerable. From now on  no Maltese will buy anything from a country which does not buy Maltese products in return. Malta's legitimate rights cannot be assured by Italy's empty promises but by concrete actionsâactions alone speak louder than words.234.	Together with other countries in our region  in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  here in the United Nations and elsewhere  we are determined to continue to work in pursuit of just and equitable relationships. The difficulties facing us are indeed daunting  but not unavoidably overwhelming. What many like us in Malta have achieved at the national level  what so many non-aligned and other developing countries are achieving at the regional level  are elements of hope and encouragement for ourselves and for others.235.	We realize that without the full co-operation of the more fortunate and advanced members of the international community our difficult s will be unduly compounded. We trust that they will finally appreciate the desire for peace and justice which inspires all our endeavours and will join us in seeking to transform this planet from one of crisis which it currently is to a home of serenity and prosperity which it has such an immense potential of becoming."
"93",4702,"MMR",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr  President  allow me at the outset to extend to you the very warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on your unanimous election to the high office which you hold. Your vast experience in the activities of the United Nations and your diplomatic skill and perception are certainly well known to all of us  and it is most fitting that you should preside over the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your able guidance the deliberations of this session will help further to develop and consolidate moves towards a more peaceful world.2.	The delegation of Burma also takes this opportunity to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge Illueca  whose distinguished services have contributed in no small measure to the successful conclusion of the session of the Assembly that has recently ended.3.	We should also like to say how glad we are to welcome Brunei Darussalam to the family of the United Nations. We offer our warm felicitations and friendly greetings to its delegation  whose presence in our midst will surely give added strength and be a positive contribution to the Organization.4.	We meet in the Assembly once again to examine collectively the problems of our time and  it is to be hoped  exercise our influence for the betterment of world conditions. We are gathered here together in the belief that all Member States  be they big or small  powerful or weak  rich or poor  have a shared responsibility to make their contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. The fact that 159 Member States  irrespective of differences in their political  economic and social systems  gather here each year is proof enough of the interest of Governments in seeing the continuance of the United Nations system as a pervasive force in maintaining world peace. Hope is therefore kindled anew that with the development of mutual understanding and co-operation and the fostering of a spirit of compromise  which are essential for the success of the Charter  the welter of conflicting interests of many nations and peoples may find a degree of order and harmony.5.	Many are aware of these requirements  but the irony is that we have so far failed to translate this awareness into practice. The effectiveness of the United Nations in fulfilling its role is also largely determined by the political and power realities of the world environment in which we live. Unhappily  factors in the international climate have not helped the Organization to measure up to the magnitude and nobility of its tasks.6.	The delegation of Burma would therefore venture to think aloud and suggest that  when the Assembly considers many of the items on its agenda  it is of vital importance to take note of the global perspective and search deeply for the root causes  instead of the mere surface symptoms. Nor is it enough to reiterate the lofty principles and ideals of the Charter  which embody the hopes and dreams of mankind and especially of the small nations  for which they represent a safe haven in the stormy seas of fast and far-reaching changes. The Charter  often quoted  is all too readily ignored  misinterpreted or even brushed aside when it seems to stand in the way of some nations all too obsessed with self-interest or emboldened by their strength and power.7.	If we are to see the United Nations develop into a really effective instrument for the performance of the functions outlined in the Chatter  it is our duty as Member States to endeavour to be more worthy of the principles and more loyal to the purposes of the Charter. No organization with aims so sublime can hope to fulfil its promise without the whole-hearted support and commitment of its membership.8.	The General Assembly embarks on its thirty- ninth session at grips with a whole range of problems and issues that transcend geographical and ideological borders and call for a new dimension in international co-operation.9.	The increasing crisis in international  political and economic relations reflects the slow and painful progress of nations and mankind. Of particular concern is the political tension and growing incidence of aggression in many areas of the world. Equally upsetting are the un-remedied economic disparities between the rich and the poor nations and the growing inequality of international economic relations.10.	As at past sessions  once again the General Assembly is exposed to the same unresolved issues which have been on the agenda for several years. The pattern of difficulties faced by the United Nations in resolving them stems largely from the seriously deteriorating state of relations between the superpowers  which are the leading Members of the world Organization. The essential co-operation between them has given way to confrontation  which has retarded the work of the General Assembly. The inter-bloc politics which they personify have also hampered the normal functioning of international relations. The prospects of an early solution to the many questions on the Assembly's agenda will not be bright so long as this climate prevails. Surely  it is in the genuine interest not only of the super-Powers but of the entire world community that they should re-establish a working relationship.11.	It is in this spirit that the delegation of Burma welcomes the recent resumption of the high-level talks in Washington between the Soviet Union and the United States. These talks may or may not have any immediate palpable or dramatic impact on the scope and direction of the deliberations which the Assembly is about to embark upon. It must also be recognized that the assessments of such possible impact could well be quite varied and naturally far from identical. Notwithstanding these facts  the fact that these regular talks should once again have become feasible after a lapse of a considerable number of years should in itself be a source of gratification for us all. It is to be hoped that they will prove to be a harbinger of a new era marked by more intensified co-operation  better understanding and a spirit of mutual accommodation not only between the two super-Powers but between all nations of the world. The delegation of Burma therefore considers the holding of the high-level talks as a step in the right direction which will surely help to place the present state of affairs in the world on a more even keel.12.	It is not enough to content ourselves with merely passing resolutions. The time has come  we believe  for a more conceptually clear and operatively more effective response to the numerous challenges and dilemmas of contemporary world problems. The time has also come for the two super-Powers to ponder the possibility of placing their relations upon a new basis so that they might be put on a more stable and constructive footing.13.	Seen in this perspective  the Secretary-General's call for holding a meeting of the Security Council at the highest level is both timely and important for the development of an effective common approach to contemporary world problems. I; would be a tremendous boost to the United Nations processes if the permanent members of the Security Council were forthcoming in support of the Secretary-General.14.	Need we recall that the United Nations was founded on the assumption that the permanent members would remain united  beyond their wartime coalition and  with the United Nations as the instrument  strive in mutual efforts to ensure world peace and contribute to a system of universal collective security. So far  this assumption has proved illusory.15.	We live in a dangerous era. The most important and pressing problem of our timesâthe achievement of nuclear disarmamentâdoes not appear to be receiving the attention it deserves. Tue world com-munity is unhappy about this situation. The negotiating processes between the two super-Powers have been at a standstill ever since the breakdown of their nuclear disarmament talks in November last year. Not only is the essential element of mutual trust completely absent; it has been replaced by complete mistrust. It is a distressing paradox of the world today that all these years  in spite of the endless flow of talks  of conferences and well-meaning sentiment in the pursuit of nuclear disarmament  we are no further removed from the threat of nuclear war and no nearer towards promise of its solution. We are now well through the fourth nuclear decade and the world community has yet to arrange its affairs in such a way as to shackle the nuclear threat forever.16.	From day to day  we witness the growing intensity of the arms race  which increasingly reduces world stability and endangers the survival of mankind. The world bristles with a whole range of armaments as each side seeks to match the other in keeping up the military balance of power. The awful danger of the present approach to military balance is that it goes on prodding each side to arm themselves. Each party is bent on outdoing the other in the invention of ever newer types of virulent weapons and systems. As we see it  this posture cannot lead us anywhere except into a hopeless maze of arming and counter-arming out of which it will be very difficult to emerge. It may well condemn both sides to an arms race in perpetuity.17.	The lesson of balance  as commonly perceived  carries with it a demand for co-ordination  for interrelationships and intercommunication between various domains  if meaningful equilibrium and stabilization are to be achieved. We see no alternative to negotiations between the super-Powers  and their alliances  so as to arrive at just such a mutual achievement if world peace and security are to be assured.18.	An increasingly acute problem is the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The delegation of Burma joins others in expressing deep concern over the dangers connected with the militarization of outer space. Space-borne systems have a two-sided function  for either benign or offensive operations. It is extremely difficult to make a clear distinction between their military and civilian uses. As such  the extent to which the world community stands to benefit or be endangered by rapidly developing space technology depends very much on whether the foremost space Powers are co-operative or antagonistic in their use of space. Concern for the welfare of mankind dictates that they co-operate.19.	Let me now turn very briefly to some of the problems which preoccupy the Assembly at successive sessions. These include the Middle East and Palestinian problems  the conflict between Iran and Iraq  the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  and the unresolved question of independence for Namibia.20.	It is difficult to foresee just how these many specific problems can be resolved effectively without the co-ordination of joint political action on the part of the principal opponents. Each situation tends to become entrenched in their positions with the passage of time and compounded by ever-new developments adding to their complexity. The more they become protracted the more they become vulnerable to the diplomatic gambits and stratagems in the interplay of world politics. While the contestants involved contend  and we  here in the Assembly  hopefully debate and draft our texts carefully  the victims of the situations continue to suffer. To them  the desperate need is to survive and live in peace.21.	The present difficulties between various States are to a large extent due to the failure to uphold the principles of mutual respect for each other's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Both are cardinal norms of international conduct. We must recognize that if States fail to tolerate and respect the rights of other States to ways of life they cannot and do not share  then we shall be no nearer to realizing the high hopes and ideals of mutual cooperation and mutual endeavour envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.22.	The search for a Middle East peace settlement remains a vital concern of the world community. However  the Assembly must face up to the fact that there is as yet no solution in sight. The prospects for a settlement continue to be elusive  owing to the complexities of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the uncertain path of developments in Lebanon.23.	The most important aspects of any settlement in the Arab-Israeli conflict are the right of every State in the Middle East  including Israel  to exist in peace within secure and recognized borders and the right of the Palestinians to self-determination. No progress can be made without an agreement which guarantees to both the Israelis and the Palestinians the right to security and the right to exist in their own State.24.	A related question is the control of territories. While Israel's central concern is for the attainment of security  the primary concern of the Arabs is the return of the lost territories. As it stands  essential steps for progress require that Israel withdraw its forces from territories occupied in 1967  change its policies of incorporating Palestinian lands into its State and halt the establishment of new settlements in these territories. Equally  it would be up to the Palestinians to state explicitly and clearly their willingness to recognize the right of Israel to a secure existence. The reality of the situation calls for the possibility of such an accommodation. Unhappily  the present attitude of both sides does not hold any promise of development along these lines.25.	As regards the situation in Lebanon  the over-riding concern is to restore to the country its full sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence. The factor of internal sectarian strife must somehow be overcome by a process of national reconciliation so as to help to extend the authority of the legitimate Government and ensure the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country.26.	At present we face stagnation in the entire Middle East situation. The recent visits of the Secretary-General to the region in pursuit of a framework for a renewed Middle East peace conference are a welcome initiative in the right direction. The problems of the Middle East have been with the Assembly for the past 36 years. To our mind  the question of convening an international conference for peace in the Middle East cannot be excluded for all time if we are to work for the goal of a comprehensive and lasting settlement.27.	The delegation of Burma shares the concern of the world community over the escalation of the Iran- Iraq conflict  which has dragged on for the past four years. The recent attacks by both sides on neutral ships in an international waterway show how potentially dangerous the situation has become. It threatens to bring an international dimension to the conflict and clearly points to the urgency of halting the hostilities by peaceful means before the pressure of events leads to a wider confrontation.28.	For six years the General Assembly has been concerned with the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Both situations continue to cause tensions and threaten regional peace and stability. Like the rest of the members of the Assembly  we are anxious to see improvements in the prospects for peace and a negotiated political solution of the two problems. Despite diplomatic initiatives from time to time to secure movement by all parties concerned  no formula has emerged to bring about a process of negotiation.29.	The position of the delegation of Burma is simple. Our wish is to see a political settlement in Afghanistan and Kampuchea on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign forces and full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of both States. Our wish is to see a process of reconciliation and the restoration of unity to the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the return of conditions in which they can work out their own destiny free from all external interference and pressures. It is a sad state of affairs when the people of both States are being uprooted and continue to suffer from deprivation and hardship. We are therefore very much distressed at the  protracted conflict and unresolved nature of the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.30.	Again this year  there is no immediate prospect of Namibia achieving independent statehood. Over the past several years  the Assembly has repeatedly given expression to the Namibian people's inalienable right to freedom  independence and territorial integrity  including Walvis Bay  and under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which provides a United Nations framework for Namibia's independence  has been accepted in principle by all the relevant parties as a basis for settlement. However  South Africa has not shown the least inclination to change course  but insists on broadening the question by injecting extraneous issues as a prerequisite for Namibia's independence. This linkage is incompatible with the letter and spirit of resolution 435 (1978) and constitutes an impediment to the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. Furthermore  no breakthrough has been achieved in the direct talks which took place this year between South Africa and the parties seeking independence for Namibia. We see no progress likely until South Africa reverses its position and forgoes its repeated assertion that Cuban troops must be removed from Angola before it withdraws from Namibia.31.	In South Africa today  the Government's apartheid policy continues to exclude the majority buck population from constitutional reform with a view to creating the so-called independent homelands. As such  there is as yet no sign of South Africa turning away from its basic policy of apartheid  which is institutionalized racial discrimination and universally condemned. South Africa's contemptuous defiance of the world's moral indignation is a matter of increasing concern to all nations of good will which believe in the essential worth and dignity of the human person. The world would be happy if South Africa conformed with reality  abandoned its policy of apartheid and worked for a more constructive relationship with its neighbours.32.	Permit me to make a few brief remarks on the world economic situation. There is no doubt that  to the greater majority of the world's people  the main issue that interests them is the economic situation  and not so much the political. The ends for which people strive are food  work  security and housing  which taken together mean freedom from want and the right to survive. To a certain extent  the present processes in the economic sphere are somewhat a paradox. After 30 years of development-related international conferences  of summits  strategies and economic expansion  the results so far achieved have been minimal for the majority of the world's people  principally those living in the developing countries. There is today no unity  but disorder  in the world economic situation. Nations compete against nations and man competes against man  in a desperate effort to establish economic stability and security.33.	Since the start of the 1970s  the world economy has struggled from crisis to crisis and has spared no nation or region from the consequences of economic turbulence. The energy crisis  the collapse of the world monetary-financial system  and the serious structural disturbances arising therefrom  have led to the emergence of recessions  which have culminated in the present world economic crisis.34.	Having experienced two major recessions in the past 10 years  the world economy is now considered to have registered a measure of recovery. This may be visible m the economies of the major developed countries but does not sufficiently hold true for the rest of the world  the developing world. We understand that even in the economically more advanced countries there is widespread doubt about the stability of the current trend. The prospects for a sustained recovery remain precarious because of the high interest rates pursued in the domestic policies of the world's strongest economic power. This has reduced the scope for and increased the cost of investments in the economies of both developed and developing countries. Without an increase in productive investments it would be difficult to overcome the present economic crisis.35.	The world-wide recessions have had a damaging impact on almost all developing countries. The issue before the Assembly is how to reduce the developing world's predicament. To our mind  the current image of the world economy is not encouraging at all for them. Their economies are still marked by low growth  adverse external factors and problems in attaining a satisfactory balance-of-payments situation. Falling prices of primary commodities  together with declining export volumes and adverse terms of trade  have all compounded their external imbalance. Having to curb their essential imports for the familiar reason of balance of payments  their development efforts have undergone serious set-backs. They face difficulties in obtaining investment for development and in providing employment for their growing labour force.36.	The central problem in the world economy today is the international debt situation of the developing countries. Many countries are just unable to repay their debts in the face of high interest rates and reduced export earnings  the only source from which debts can be serviced internationally. Massive debt rescheduling is also increasing accumulated debts. International lending  once perceived as a principal instrument for the stimulation of economic growth  has become today the factor causing a reverse flow of capital and retarding the growth prospects of developing countries.37.	As we see it  there can be no lasting world economic recovery without a solution to the international debt problem. And the problem of debt cannot be resolved without structural adjustments for a more balanced financial and monetary system and the revival of world trade.38.	We believe that the world economy is at an acute phase of a changing process in international economic relations. The economic upheavals faced by the world community in the last several years have enabled us to understand the interdependence which inextricably links all nations  both developed and developing. The dimension of mutual dependence has been discovered and come to be accepted as a reality. We live in an interdependent world of problems which require mutual accommodation. We would hope that this mutual interdependence can be transformed into active solidarity and collective response to a world which is badly in need of restructuring of the pattern of international economic co-operation.39.	In concluding  the delegation of Burma wishes to place on record its appreciation  surely shared by others  of the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at the achievement of a constructive course in world affairs. His recent visit  on a personal mission  to the Middle East  his talks with the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States  his successful initiative concerning the halting of attacks on civilian targets in the Iran-Iraq war  and his ongoing efforts to solve the Cyprus problem are praiseworthy moves which have not gone unnoticed. He has brought new confidence to the office he occupies. We venture to express the hope that the Secretary-General's earnest endeavours will be rewarded with concrete results."
"94",4759,"MNG",39,1984,"ï»¿Sir  allow me to congratulate you sincerely on your unanimous election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. It is our confident hope that your vast experience in the diplomatic service and in United Nations activities will surely contribute to the success of the work of the present session to the benefit of peace  security and the progress of nations.110.	The Mongolian delegation warmly congratulates Brunei Darussalam on its admission to the membership of this world body.111.	The United Nations  which came into being in the aftermath of the most devastating war in history  has declared as its main objective ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Today  this vital task of ensuring the peaceful advancement of mankind has assumed particular urgency. Effective measures are needed to safeguard the right of peoples to peace and the right of States to security.112.	The extremely grave situation prevailing in the world is characterized by the mounting threat of a nuclear war. The most aggressive imperialist circles  and primarily the United States Administration  have taken a course of confrontation vis-Ã -vis real socialism and are bent on mounting an open offensive against the forces of national and social liberation.113.	Washington seeks to achieve military superiority over the socialist world. The deployment of United States first strike nuclear weapons in some countries of Western Europe constitutes a dangerous step towards material preparation for a war against the socialist countries. Similar measures are being taken in Asia  especially in the northeast  in the immediate vicinity of the frontiers of the socialist community. In the Pentagon  the ""Star Wars"" scenarios are translated into practical policy  and measures to implement the notorious concept of ""protracted nuclear war"" are being developed.114.	All this is followed by actions aimed at undermining the foundations of the post war settlement and disrupting the agreements on limiting the arms race and on disarmament.115.	In its attack on peace  national independence and the social progress of peoples  the United States nurtures and exploits the forces of militarism  revanchism  zionism and racism everywhere. State terrorism and brute force go hand in hand with direct armed aggression. The independence of Grenada has been crushed only because the people of that small country wish to have a social order that is not to Washington's liking. For the same reason  the United States Administration thinks nothing of resorting to gross interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua  or of committing open aggression against it. It was with strong condemnation that the world community learned about the latest preparations for an armed attack against that country  made in total disregard of the constructive attitude of the Sandinist Government and the peace efforts of the Contadora Group.116.	Threats  blackmail and subversion against the Republic of Cuba persist  and attempts are being made to destabilize its socialist order. Imperialist forces  in collusion with the racist regime of Pretoria  step up their intrigues against the independence and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola  the People's Republic of Mozambique and other frontline States in Africa. All this clearly testifies to the timeliness of the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union for the inclusion in the agenda of the present session of an item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system in other sovereign States"" . The General Assembly is duty-bound to pronounce itself resolutely in favour of the cessation of the policy of State terrorism as a method of dealing with other countries and peoples.â117.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the premise that  however complex the international situation may be  it is possible to prevent war through concerted action on the part of the peace-loving forces.118.	Mr. Jambyn Batmunkh  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic  has stated that:""The constructive initiatives and the concerted foreign policy activities of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries inspire in the peoples the confidence that peace can be safeguarded. The guarantee of this is the further strengthening of the economic and defence potential of the socialist community and the consolidation in every way of efforts of all the peace-loving forces.""119.	The ranks of the forces fighting for peace are becoming ever wider. The overwhelming majority of States throughout the world  among them the nonaligned countries  are actively in favour of relaxing international tension and against the use of coercion in interstate relations. The mass anti-war and anti-nuclear movement continues to grow in scope and to intensify in different parts of the world. It is important that realistic statesmen and political leaders in the Western countries are increasingly speaking out against preparations for war.120.	Constructive measures for overcoming the dangerous situation in the world have been proposed in the Political Declaration adopted by the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty at Prague on 5 January 1983  and in the Declaration adopted at the high level Economic Conference of the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  held in Moscow from 12 to 14 June 1984.121.	These documents contain a whole set of measures for the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe and for the reduction and ultimate liquidation of nuclear weapons. Proposals have also been made with a view to creating favourable conditions for the adoption of such measures and for the promotion of confidence among States. Of special importance is the proposal for the renunciation of first use of nuclear weapons by all the nuclear Powers that have not yet done so. As urgent as ever is the proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations between the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the States Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. The Moscow Declaration of the States Members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance places special emphasis on the importance of maintaining military and political parity at a progressively lower level and of pursuing constructive negotiations on the limitation of the arms race and on disarmament  on the basis of strict observance of the principle of equality and equal security.122.	Implementation of the proposal for a quantitative and qualitative freeze on the nuclear weapon arsenals of all nuclear States would constitute an important step in that direction. In this connection  the Mongolian People's Republic has expressed its support for the Joint Declaration of Heads of State and Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  in which they appealed to the nuclear Powers to begin limiting and reducing nuclear weapons.123.	The Soviet United States talks on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons are of extreme importance for lessening the danger of a nuclear war. The United States should withdraw the first strike nuclear missiles deployed in some Western European countries so that the negotiations on this vitally important issue may be resumed.124.	The relations between the nuclear Powers play a particularly important role in improving the international climate. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic supports the Soviet proposal that an agreement be reached on joint recognition of concrete norms in the relations between the nuclear States and on measures to make them binding. We consider it necessary for this timely proposal to be embodied in the resolutions of the present session of the General Assembly.125.	The proposal on the ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"" made by Mr. Andrei A. Gromyko  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  for discussion at the current session of the General Assembly  is designed to prohibit  once and for all  the use of force in outer space and to safeguard mankind against the use of means of mass destruction from outer space. Early agreement on the prevention of the militarization of this vitally important area would open the way for joint efforts by States to use outer space for peaceful purposes. My delegation expresses its hope that the General Assembly will call upon all States with a large potential of space technology  primarily the United States and the Soviet Union  to open negotiations on this question without delay.126.	The situation in Asia has become increasingly complex and tense. The United States has taken to turning many parts of the continent into launching grounds for nuclear missile forces. Particular danger lies in the fact that  with the participation of its Asian accomplices  Washington has begun to establish a new base for a nuclear missile first strike directed against the socialist countries and other peace-loving States of the continent.127.	Intensified efforts have been made to create new military and political groupings and alliances. The Washington Tokyo Seoul triangle is conceived of as the crux of these projected formations.128.	Overt military and revanchist tendencies are making themselves felt once again in that part of the world  especially in Japan  which is being integrated more and more into the NATO bloc. Today  some tend to forget the lessons of history. Those lessons are most instructive. This is evidenced  for example  by the events that took place 45 years ago on the very eve of the Second World War. In 1939 Japanese militarism met with a powerful rebuff when it violated the independence and territorial integrity of our country with a view to carrying out its plan to create a pan Asian empire of Japan. Frustration of the adventurist designs of the Japanese militarists by the combined operation of the Soviet and Mongolian armed forces in the region of the Khalkhyn Gol river dealt a hard blow to the aggressive strategic schemes of the forces of fascism and reaction.129.	The existing hotbeds of tension and conflict are being further exacerbated while new ones are being created on the continent. The so-called parallel actions of the imperialist and hegemonist forces often contribute to such developments 130.	A tense situation continues to exist in Southeast Asia as a result of the intrigues of those circles  which are not willing to accept the new realities in that region. The situation is further aggravated by armed inroads by China on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  by the hostile actions of Thailand against the popular order in Kampuchea and by its recent open armed aggression against the Lao People's Democratic Republic  which resulted in the occupation of a part of its territory.131.	The Mongolian People's Republic fully supports the stand of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  set forth in the statement of its Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued on 13 June 1984  as well as in the White Book of the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic published last month. The crux of the matter and its root causes were exposed with great lucidity in the statement of Mr. Phoun Sipra-seuth  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  here in the General Assembly last week .132.	We continue to hold the view that the problems of Southeast Asia can and must be resolved by the States of the region through constructive dialogue without any outside interference. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the proposals of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea for turning Southeast Asia into a zone of peace  stability and good neighbourliness. It resolutely opposes any attempt to use the United Nations as a cover-up for interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and stands for the speedy granting to that country of its legitimate seat in this world Organization.133.	We believe that  in the light of the present tense situation in the Far East  the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the immediate withdrawal of United States troops and of nuclear weapons from the south of Korea and on easing tensions in the Korean peninsula and around it assume greater relevance. My Government continues to support the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their country  without outside interference.134.	The interests of the Afghan people and those of peace in Asia call for resolute action to defeat efforts to escalate the undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan pave the way for a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan created by the hostile acts of imperialist forces and their accomplices. Once again we express our hope that the dialogue between the representatives of Afghanistan and Pakistan through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary General will yield positive results.135.	The Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the expansionist acts of Israel and the increasing interference by the United States in the Middle East. It continues to believe that the settlement of the Middle East problem should be achieved on the basis of respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to create its own independent State and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967. My Government is in favour of convening an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  on an equal footing. It stresses the importance of the proposals put forward by the Soviet Government on 30 July of this year for the achievement of a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement in the Middle East.136.	We advocate an early cessation of the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq. This conflict  marked by a further dangerous escalation  only plays into the hands of the imperialist forces that are seeking to advance their selfish interests in that region  and in the Persian Gulf in particular.137.	The Mongolian People's Republic favours a peaceful and just settlement of the Cyprus problem in accordance with the United Nations resolutions on the subject  Such a settlement calls  first and foremost  for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and the elimination of foreign military bases on its territory. We express our support for the good offices of the Secretary General in this regard.138.	My Government consistently supports the efforts of the littoral States for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and is in favour of speedy implementation of the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. It is  in our view  important that at its current session the General Assembly should clearly express itself in favour of convening an international conference on that subject in the first half of 1985. The Mongolian delegation welcomes the initiative of the Heads of Government of South Pacific States concerning the creation of a nuclear free zone m that region.139.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic shares the view of the overwhelming majority of the world community that in the nuclear age there is no reasonable alternative to constructive negotiations and the peaceful coexistence of States.140.	It was precisely this stand that prompted the proposal put forward by the Mongolian People's Republic in May 1981 that a convention be concluded on mutual nonaggression and non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific. Its purpose is to establish the principle of the non-use of force in interstate relations in the region  thus laying down constructive dialogue and peaceful negotiationsâthat is  the principles of friendly cooperationâas a basis for these relations.141.	in this context  I should like to emphasize the importance of implementing the Soviet proposal on the elaboration of confidence-building measures in the Far East and on the development of good neighbourly relations between the States of the region. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic supports the efforts made by the Soviet Union to normalize interstate relations with China as well as with Japan.142.	The strengthening of peace and international security is intrinsically linked with the complete elimination of the vestiges of colonialism and with the eradication of racism and apartheid.143.	My delegation  as always  strongly condemns the inhuman policy of apartheid. The Mongolian people lends its support to the struggle for national and social liberation which the people of South Africa is waging under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa against the racist regime.144.	The Mongolian People's Republic continues to support the people of Namibia  which  under the leadership of SWAPO  is fighting for its freedom and independence. It condemns the manoeuvres of imperialist and racist forces designed to perpetuate the colonial regime in Namibia and joins the world community in demanding the immediate granting of independence to Namibia on the basis of the well-known United Nations resolutions.145.	We support the granting of independence to the so-called small Territories  in particular Micronesia  and oppose the use of those Territories as springboards for military preparations.146.	The colonial policy of the leading capitalist countries is now implemented to a great extent in the sphere of economic relations with the developing countries. The terms ""economic colonialism"" and ""financial colonialism"" are frequently used now  and not without reason.147.	The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the just struggle of the developing countries for the democratization of international economic relations on the basis of equality and equity. My delegation shares the view that the principles laid down in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and in the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have assumed ever greater importance today. We continue to lend our support to the initiatives of the developing countries for the launching of global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development.148.	Next year  the world community will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great victory over the forces of fascism and militarism. In that victory  a decisive role was played by the Soviet Union  which had borne the brunt of the Second World War. An important outcome of that victory on a world scale was the creation of the United Nations. The Organization has become a symbol of the aspirations of the peoples of the world and of their resolve never to allow war again. We presume that the world community will use the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization in 1985 as an occasion for enhancing its efforts for the realization of its central taskâthe elimination of the threat of a new world war.149.	In the questions of war and peace  no sober minded person can or should be an unbiased observer. Ensuring world peace has indeed become the concern of all mankind. To achieve that goal  the peoples of the world are destined to play an active role and fulfil a very noble mission. In this connection  I should like to refer to a pertinent remark by the Secretary General to the effect that without the understanding and support of the peoples of the world  Governments would not succeed in realizing the noble aims of peace  justice and prosperity for all.150.	The peoples have a sacred right to peace  that is  the right to the protection of international peace. Ensuring universal recognition of this sacred right by formulating and proclaiming it in a special document of the Organization would  in our view  serve the interests of the common cause of upholding peace. Guided by those considerations  the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic has proposed for consideration by the General Assembly at its present session an item entitled ""Right of peoples to peace"" and has submitted a draft declaration on the subject.151.	We propose that all States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaffirm that the right of peoples to peace is inalienable and legitimate. Safeguarding that right and cooperating in its implementation should be declared to be a fundamental obligation of each and every State. We consider it important for the General Assembly to call upon all States to provide a legal and material guarantee of this right. That would include  for instance  the adoption by States which have not yet done so of legislative acts on the safeguarding of peace  on protection of the right of citizens to advocate peace and oppose the danger of war.152.	As material guarantee  practical steps should be taken to facilitate the proscription of the use of force in international relations  the solution of international disputes by peaceful means and the strengthening of confidence among States. To ensure the right of peoples to peace is tantamount to defending the right of States to security. This calls for active participation on the part of every State in efforts to undertake practical measures for the cessation of the arms race and the achievement of disarmament goals. Nuclear weapon States must be required to pursue policies directed towards the elimination of the threat of a nuclear catastrophe and to be guided in their mutual relations by standards conducive to the attainment of this goal.153.	We deem it important for the General Assembly to appeal to all States and international organizations to facilitate  in every possible way  the exercise of this fundamental right of peoples through the adoption of other appropriate measures  at both the national and the international levels.154.	The adoption by the General Assembly of a declaration on the basis of the proposed draft would  in our view  represent an important political action on the part of the United Nations  aimed at mobilizing and intensifying the efforts of the world community to eliminate the threat of a nuclear war. The adoption of such a document would also represent a significant step in combining United Nations efforts for maintaining international peace with the struggle of the world community against the threat of nuclear war and in favour of global security.155.	In conclusion  I should like to say a few words about my country. This year is of special importance to our people. The sixtieth anniversary of the proclamation of Mongolia as a People's Republic will be solemnly commemorated this coming November.156.	This act marked the beginning of an historic stage of carrying out far-reaching social and economic transformations in the country. During the short period that has elapsed since then  Mongolia has been turned into a dynamically developing socialist State with a thriving economy and with a steady improvement in the wellbeing of its people. Our country is now successfully implementing the great tasks of completing the construction of a socialist society and is facing the future with optimism.157.	The Mongolian People's Republic has become a component part of the community of socialist States. It consistently pursues a policy of peace and friendship among nations. My Government devotes considerable effort to enhancing the effectiveness of the activities of the United Nations aimed at realizing the main purposes of its Charter. My delegation will be guided by this aspiration of its Government at this session of the General Assembly as well."
"95",4801,"MOZ",39,1984,"ï»¿We are extremely pleased  Sir  to see you  an experienced and well-known African diplomat  a representative of a front-line State  presiding over the affairs of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We have known you for more than 10 years and we have shared a working relationship with you while you have exercised your high governmental functions and the presidency of the United Nations Council for Namibia. Mozambique and Zambia maintain strong ties of fraternity and friendship which are deeply rooted in our people's common past of struggle for freedom  justice  independence and human dignity. We are confident that under your leadership our work will bring successful results at the end of this session. Let me assure you  Mr. President  of the full co-operation of my delegation in the fulfilment of your duties.2.	We salute the President of the thirty-eighth session  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for his endeavours and for having successfully carried out his task.3.	Once again  we extend to the Secretary-General the appreciation of the Mozambican people for his commitment and devotion to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in its search for peaceful solutions of the critical problems confronting the international community today.4.	It is always a matter of great joy to see the membership of the Organization grow. The admission of Brunei Darussalam to this great family of nations bears testimony to the commitment of the international community to the lofty principles of the United Nations and the attainment of its objectives. We join previous speakers in warmly welcoming Brunei Darussalam.3. Twenty years ago  on 25 September 1964  faced with the violent intransigence of the colonial Power and its refusal of dialogue  our people embarked on a general armed insurrection against colonialism and for national independence  peace  justice  freedom and progress. The justness of our aspirations won us the respect  support and solidarity of all freedom- and peace-loving peoples. The resort to the armed struggle was in no way a warmongering option. We were forced to wage war as the only means of achieving peace on the basis of the recognition of our rights.6.	However  we always remained open to a negotiated settlement of the conflict  which was characterized by the opposition of the Mozambican people to the foreign occupants of our country. The armed struggle for national liberation ended as soon as  in September 1974 at Lusaka  the colonial State recognized the right of the Mozambican people to self- determination and national independence and agreed to transfer power to FRELIMO ' the sole and legitimate representative of the Mozambican people.7.	At the negotiating table  FRELIMO managed to secure an agreement which gave substance to the completely legitimate aspirations of the Mozambican peopleâthe aspirations to freedom and independence. With independence  the Mozambican people regained their own personality. Independence placed the history of our people back on its correct path.8.	Our independence created a great impact in the region and served as a strong impetus to the struggle for liberation of other peoples in southern Africa.9.	Mozambique  like Angola  became a direct target of aggression and destabilization carried out by the racist minority regimes of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. This action was aimed at destroying our independent sovereign State and preventing the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa from attaining their own freedom.10.	The People's Republic of Mozambique was and still is a target of aggression because our struggle was able to translate into reality the profound aspirations of people all over the world to peace  democracy  progress and equality  without discrimination based on the colour of one's skin or on religion or ethnic origin.11.	The Mozambican people were once again compelled to take up arms to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity.12.	We contributed to the Zimbabwean people's struggle for freedom. We made the cause of the Zimbabwean people's struggle our own  while at the same time we encouraged and participated in all the peace initiatives in the search for a negotiated settlement of the question of Zimbabwe's independence  taking fully into account the legitimate rights of its people.13.	We went to Geneva and Malta. We took part in the discussions on the Anglo-American proposals. In compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations  we applied fully the total and comprehensive sanctions against the rebel colony of Southern Rhodesia.14.	Guided by our adherence to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  we  together with the legitimate representatives of the people of Zimbabwe  attended the Lancaster House negotiations aimed at putting an end to the illegal  minority and aggressive regime of Southern Rhodesia. For all of us  the Lancaster House agreements meant the triumph of the ideals of justice  freedom and peace.15.	Following the proclamation of Zimbabwe's in-dependence  the Pretoria regime assumed direct command of the destabilization actsâuntil then under Ian Smith's regimeâagainst the independent countries of southern Africa  particularly Mozambique and Angola. With these actions the South African regime violated the most elementary rules of international law governing relations among States.16.	The aims of South Africa were to prevent the consolidation of our national independence and to destroy the example which we represent in the region of a democratic  anti-racist and socialist society.17.	Unable to solve its internal contradictions and confronted with the intensity of the popular struggle  Pretoria opted for the generalization of conflict in our region. Pretoria resorted to economic sabotage  to direct aggression and to the use of armed bandits recruited  trained  equipped  financed and dispatched by it from sanctuaries in its territory into neighbouring States. Pretoria tried to present those armed bandits as members of national resistance movements.18.	Armed banditry  a new type of mercenarism in our region  is imposed from outside upon Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe and Lesotho. In Mozambique  armed banditry does not represent an internal political opposition. It does not represent any national political or social force. Its leadership is essentially composed of well-known foreign citizens  agents of colonialism  who early in 1974 tried in vain to block the signing of the Lusaka agreement and to prevent the accession of the Mozambican people to independence.19.	Armed banditry  a covert imperialist means of aggression against our country  encompasses within its ranks outlaws  drug addicts  thieves  murderers and mercenaries. These bandits plunder  kidnap  rape  destroy  massacre and assassinate. They are responsible for the paralysis and destruction of important sectors of our economy. The dimension of the tragedy caused by the war of destabilization imposed by the South African regime is difficult to describe in words and to quantify in figures. The devastating consequences of their acts and the irreparable losses in human lives caused by the ferocious rage of the armed bandits are incalculable.20.	Many Mozambican victims of these criminals will for ever bear on their bodies and in their souls the scars of mutilation. Others will carry in their memory scenes of the massacre and incineration of their families. There are still others whose malnutrition worsened  who saw their little ones prevented from going to school and their loved ones deprived of medical care. This generation will for ever be marked by the brutalities of this banditry.21.	In order to face this war situation  our people  from the Rovuma to the Maputo and united to a man  organized themselves against the armed banditry  as they did in the past against colonialism and against the acts of aggression by the rebel regime of Ian Smith. As a result of this organization and the determination of the Mozambican people  heavy military blows were inflicted on the enemy.22.	At the same time  we set into motion a diplomatic campaign directed at certain countries with the intention of demonstrating that the only destabilizing agent  the only focus of tension  the only source of conflicts in the region is the South African regime.23.	We have neutralized South Africa's attempts to relegate to second place the struggle of the international community against apartheid? In this campaign we have shown that the cause of the tension and war prevailing in our region does not spring from the East-West conflict but exclusively from the antagonistic contradiction between	âdeclared a crime against humanityâand the forces struggling for freedom  democracy  equality  peace and progress.24.	Our victories over armed banditry and our diplomatic offensive frustrated the South African strategy of isolating and destroying our socialist State. In other words  they frustrated the South African strategy aimed at creating an alternative political force to rule Mozambique. We have shown that the Mozambican State is a solid and indestructible socialist State  because it is deeply rooted in its people and it embodies their most legitimate aspirations.25.	The Pretoria regime then came to understand that neither direct aggression nor armed banditry would enable it to attain its objectives. At last  the South African regime realized that any destabilizing acts unleashed from without would be met with a prompt and effective response. It was against this background that South Africa was led to the negotiating table with the People's Republic of Mozambique in order to search for an alternative to the path of violence it had pursued until then.26.	Mozambique has always stood for peace and peaceful coexistence among States of various social and economic systems and for good relations among neighbours. Hence it is always open to the possibility of negotiations to resolve conflicts among States. Mozambique has always refrained from undertaking any act that would jeopardize peace and security  not only in our region but also in the world as a whole. Mozambique has never carried out any acts of aggression against South Africa.27.	In the light of these principles  we initiated negotiations with the South African Government which led to the conclusion of the Agreement on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness  signed at Nkomati on 16 March 1984. The Nkomati Agreement consolidates the victories of our independence. It is an instrument for the defence of our sovereignty. It creates conditions for economic development and the construction of socialism in Mozambique. It reaffirms the fundamental principles of international law governing relations between sovereign States.28.	In the Agreement  South Africa recognizes these principles and pledges to abide by them in its relations with our State. This is a new attitude on the part of South Africa if we consider its long history of hostility and aggression against our country.29.	We consider this a victory for wisdom and realism  a victory for peace  one decisive stage in the prevention of a major conflict in southern Africa. The Nkomati Agreement constitutes an important legal instrument for promoting detente in southern Africa. We are confident that the international community will be able to create favourable conditions conducive to the full implementation of the Agreement.10. The peace efforts we are pursuing allow us to create the necessary conditions for devoting our energies and resources towards the economic and social development of our country. For less than 10 years  we have been masters of our own economic and social development and of our own well-being and progress. The illiteracy rate has been reduced and the health care network has been expanded.31.	Many projects of vital importance to our economy are under way  with the aim of transforming our natural resources. Several times these projects have been the targets of armed bandits. They try to prevent the building of communication networks  which are necessary for the transport of goods  and the construction of dams  which ensure the irrigation of vast agricultural lands in order to produce more food and avoid the harmful effects of droughts. They want our country to remain in a permanent state of underdevelopment  by preventing us from carrying out any activities that would satisfy the basic needs of our people.32.	Despite these acts  however  we have attained remarkable successes in expanding our infrastructures. Our programme for economic recovery comprises measures whose implementation will reduce the deficit in the balance of payments and contribute to the relief of the causes and effects of hunger  lack of clothing  disease and poverty. The main aspects of the programme for the coming years are essentially the rehabilitation of infrastructures and of existing industrial and agro-industrial equipment.33.	Priority is given to the realization of rural development projects in order to increase food production and export crops  as well as the improvement of ports and railway services and an increase in migrant labour and tourism. We are also giving top priority to educational and training programmes. In the implementation of this programme  our efforts will have to be complemented by external resources  both bilateral and multilateral.34.	In the context of expanding our international economic relations  we have enacted the Law of Foreign Investments. We have joined the IMF and the World Bank and we were participants in the negotiations of the Lome Convention.35.	Despite the efforts deployed  the economic and financial situation confronting Mozambique today is rather difficult and complex owing to the following factors: first  the difficult economic situation we inherited at the time of independence; secondly  the economic losses  estimated at $500 million  resulting from the application of United Nations-mandated sanctions against Southern Rhodesia; thirdly  the direct aggressions  the economic boycott by South Africa against Mozambique and the acts of armed bandits  which altogether caused a loss of about $3.5 billion to our economy; fourthly  natural disasters  especially droughts  which for several years have been affecting large areas of our territory and have brought about a total loss of $154 million in 1982 and 1983 alone; and  fifthly  the deepening of the international economic crisis  namely  the debt problem  deteriorating terms of trade  protectionism and high interest rates.36.	Despite these difficulties  we are confident that the economic programmes we are undertaking will bring about favourable conditions for overcoming some of these problems in order to promote the economic and social development of our country. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the international community for the invaluable support it has rendered to the People's Republic of Mozambique. That assistance encourages us to pursue our endeavours in national reconstruction and the struggle against underdevelopment.37.	The continuing existence of colonialism in Namibia and of apartheid and racism in South Africa remains the main cause of tension and war in southern Africa.38.	The situation in Angola remains critical. The occupation of parts of the territory of that sister country  as well as the massacre of its people and the destruction of its economic and social infrastructures by South Africa  still persist. As respectable Members of the United Nations  we should not remain indifferent to this situation. We must vigorously condemn these criminal acts  for they constitute a violation of international law and a manifest disregard of the Charter of the United Nations. The People's Republic of Mozambique vehemently appeals to the international community to render all material  political and diplomatic support to the People's Republic of Angola to enable it to repel the South African aggression and defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We must demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angola  as well as the cessation of South African support to the armed bandits acting under its command against the legitimate Government of Angola.39.	The condition of the majority of South African people is worsening. Every day more and more people are being thrown into gaol or receiving banning orders. There is a reluctance to recognize black trade unions. All legitimate strikes and peaceful political demonstrations by workers  students and other democratic forces are immediately repressed. The fundamental rights of the majority of South African people continue to be denied  as evidenced by the so-called new dispensation  which was roundly and soundly rejected by them. As a result  we have witnessed the escalation of brutalities and detentions just before and after the so-called new constitution came into force. This is the nature of apartheid. A regime that institutionalizes racial discrimination  represses and massacres its own people  continues to colonize Namibia and carries out acts of aggression against Angola and occupies parts of its territory cannot claim to be pacifist.40.	In light of the foregoing facts  it is the duty of the international community to denounce and condemn the bellicose policy of South Africa; condemn and denounce the policy of bantustanization  as well as the blatant violation of human rights by the Pretoria regime; condemn  pursuant to Security Council resolution 554 (1984)  the so-called constitutional reforms inasmuch as they are aimed at perpetuating apartheid demand that South Africa put an end to its support for this new type of mercenarism  armed banditry; and prevent the strengthening of South Africa's military capability  particularly its capacity to produce nuclear weapons.41.	In this context  we firmly believe that relations between Mozambique or other countries of the region  on the one hand  and South Africa  on the other  should not be used as a pretext by some members of the international community to shy away from their duty to isolate the apartheid regime. Our relationship with South Africa stems from the geo-graphical contiguity of our countries and from the historical past colonialism imposed on us. What prompted the isolation of Pretoria was not only its policy of destabilization; it was not just its aggressive acts against neighbouring countries; it was mainly its inhuman and cruel policy of	which is still in force in South Africa.42.	The Western countries must clearly dissociate themselves from the apartheid system and join the forces fighting for freedom  justice and peace in South Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa. It is the sacred duty of all peoples and Governments the world over to recognize as legitimate and to render wide-ranging support to the struggle of the South African people led by the ANC.43.	The ANC is fighting so that each South African  regardless of the colour of his or her skin  may benefit from the wealth of the country and attain the social development to which he or she is entitled. It is fighting for democracy so that all South Africans  regardless of the colour of their skins  may take part in all decision-making processes affecting their lives and destinies. It is fighting so that power in South Africa may be exercised by representatives of all South Africans without discrimination. It is fighting for an undivided South Africa and against bantustanization.44.	The People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its condemnation of the apartheid system and the policy of bantustanization. It reaffirms its political  diplomatic and moral support for the ANC. The international community should see to it that the Government of South Africa adopts a policy of dialogue and negotiations with the ANC in order to bring about the establishment of a democratic society in the country.45.	The continued state of hostilities in Namibia is the result of South Africa's intransigent refusal to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The demands that the South West Africa People's Organization	unilaterally cease hostilities without any assurance that resolution 435 (1978) will be applied are attempts to link extraneous and alien issues to the question of Namibia's independent. It is our duty to see to it that the South African Government engages in constructive negotiations with SWAPO to bring Namibia immediately to independence. Linking Namibia's independence to alien issues is intolerable.46.	We reaffirm the unconditional support of the People's Republic of Mozambique for SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. We encourage the Secretary-General to carry on with his efforts to bring about the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).47.	The international community of nations must vigorously condemn the repression being practised against the majority of the citizens of South Africa  as well as those of Namibia. The South African regime must immediately put an end to the practice of executing freedom fighters and take all the necessary steps for the speedy release of political prisoners in South Africa and in Namibia.48.	In the overall struggle of the peoples of southern Africa  the economic front is of special importance. It is within this context that the Southern AfricanDevelopment Co-ordination Conference plays a valuable role in supporting the right of the peoples to development  progress and peace. The SADCC is our main instrument in the struggle for the lessening of economic dependence on South Africa and for economic and social development in the region of southern Africa. We therefore welcome the growing participation of some States in this undertaking for the promotion of the welfare of our peoples.49.	The global international situation is complex and tense. It is characterized by the ever-increasing aggressiveness of imperialism  which causes an increase in the number of hotbeds of tension and war and accelerates the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race. The era of dialogue  understanding and peaceful coexistence which at one time prevailed in relations among nations is becoming more and more remote.50.	In the 1970s  when we were paving the way for understanding and detente  there was hope for the rapid eradication of colonialism and confidence in the commitment of nations to the struggle for the elimination of apartheid and racial discrimination and for social progress and development.51.	Today  the questions of peace  peaceful coexistence  independence  disarmament and development remain the main concerns of peoples the world over. The time of the cold war  when the interests of the peoples were ignored and the so-called vital interests of some Powers were advanced  has returned. Imperialism is forcefully renewing its old view that all international and regional political problems remain solely within the scope of the East-West conflict.52.	As a consequence  Africa  a continent tom apart by centuries of colonial domination  is still witnessing conflict situations and war  which bring untold suffering to children  women and men.53.	The situation in Chad and Western Sahara is of the utmost concern to us. We are hopeful that recent developments in Chad will bring peace at long last to that war-torn country  so that its people may be able to devote their resources and energies to economic and social development.54.	The Saharan people have the right to self-determination and independence. We strongly urge the conflicting partiesâthe Frente POLISARIO and the Kingdom of Morocco  to enter into negotiations in accordance with the relevant OAU resolutions  in order to bring about an immediate end to the conflict.55.	In the Middle East  the People's Republic of Mozambique supports the just struggle of the Palestinian peoples  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  for their inalienable rights  including the right to create their own State in Palestine  and the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories.56.	We are encouraged by the efforts being made by the Lebanese people with a view to farming a national Government representing their legitimate interests. We call upon Israel to withdraw its troops immediately and unconditionally from Lebanon and fully to respect the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.57.	The war between Iran and Iraq is also of major concern to us. We strongly appeal to both countries  members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to put an immediate end to the fratricidal war  which is adversely affecting the world community.58.	The question of Cyprus is another challenge facing the United Nations. In spite of all the efforts of the Secretary-General  the country remains divided and confronted with the presence of foreign troops. We urge the parties concerned to give their utmost co-operation to the Secretary-General so that a just and lasting solution can be found to the Cyprus question.59.	The dramatic situation afflicting the Maubere people in East Timor shows no sign of abating. The territory of East Timor is under occupation and its people are under domination. To the yearning of the Maubere people for justice  freedom and human dignity  Jakarta responds with systematic detentions  torture and massacres.60.	We hail the stand by many personalities of the United States  including many Senators and Congressional representatives  in denouncing the acts of oppression being committed against the people of East Timor. The recent declarations by the United States Administration regarding the situation of the East Timor people is encouraging. However  we consider that this issue should not in any way be viewed from a humanitarian perspective alone. All countries  large or small  have the right to self- determination and independence and the freedom to decide their own fate. Therefore  colonized peoples will always fight tenaciously to attain these ideals and goals regardless of the sacrifices they may have to make. The struggle of the people of East Timor is ours as much as theirs  for they are fighting for freedom  justice and equality.61.	The people of East Timor  under the leadership of FRETILIN  deserve the total support of the international community. We demand that Indonesia cease its acts of genocide against the Maubere people and that its troops be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn from the territory of East Timor. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue to undertake with the parties concerned  including Portugal  the administering Power  all efforts likely to lead to recognition of the legitimate right of the people of that territory to self-determination and independence.62.	The people of Korea continue to see their country artificially divided. The solution to this problem lies in dialogue and negotiations. We therefore support the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for peaceful reunification of the Korean nation through tripartite dialogue.63.	We are deeply concerned about the situation in Kampuchea. Efforts should be pursued by us all so that a just and lasting solution may be found.64.	In Latin America  there is a constant escalation of confrontation and acts of destabilization and aggression  particularly against the peoples of Central America. The People's Republic of Mozambique is in favour of a peaceful settlement of the problems in the region. Direct talks between Nicaragua and the United States are encouraging. While vehemently condemning the aggression perpetrated against the Nicaraguan people  we reiterate our support for the efforts being undertaken by the Contadora Group. Nicaragua's acceptance of the revised text of that Group's proposals is a positive step.65.	The political problems in the world contribute to the exacerbation of the grave international economic problems  especially in developing countries. Hunger  disease and poverty are the everyday reality of the lives of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. Determined efforts by the international community to overcome the present international economic crisis should be made urgently in a spirit of solidarity  understanding and co-operation  for the benefit of mankind.66.	The present international economic crisis requires global solutions. We stress as a matter of priority the undertaking of joint  co-ordinated action to restructure international monetary and financial systems to ensure the equitable and democratic participation of the developing countries. Global negotiations continue to be an issue of paramount importance and we should pursue this process.67.	In the meantime  measures must be undertaken immediately in favour of the developing countries  particularly those in the African continent  where the ongoing world economic crisis  the persistent drought and other external adverse factors have contributed to the worsening food situation  thus aggravating hunger and malnutrition among the population.68.	We take this opportunity to salute the Secretary-General for his timely undertaking in favour of the most seriously affected countries in Africa. The operational activities for development undertaken by the United Nations system are deemed by the People's Republic of Mozambique to be of the utmost importance.69.	We regret to note that the interest of some developed countries in multilateral assistance for development is slackening  to say the least. As a result  many programmes in favour of developing countries are threatened  while at the same time we are witnessing growing emphasis on bilateral cooperation  as well as the galloping pace of armaments  particularly nuclear armaments.70.	The situation created by the deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe is a manifestation of a new escalation in the arms race and poses a threat of the outbreak of war  menacing the very existence of mankind.71.	The ever-growing tension in the Indian Ocean  with the consolidation  expansion and nuclearization of military naval bases  endangers the security  peace and tranquillity of the countries of the region and of mankind as a whole. The transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  free from nuclear weapons  in keeping with the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace must come about. The People's Republic of Mozambique expresses its regret that some countries  in complete disregard of that Declaration  have not lent their support to the holding of a United Nations conference on the Indian Ocean.72.	Peace  international security and co-operation among peoples and countries were the main motivations which inspired the nations that met at San Francisco  in 1945  when they adopted the Charter of the United Nations  enshrining the purposes and principles governing the Organization. The United Nations was set up as the principalâand an adequateâforum for the solution of international conflicts through dialogue and negotiation.73.	In 1985 we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. This will be an occasion on which we shall take stock of the role played by the Organization and shall chart the course for future action. We make a pressing appeal from this rostrum to all members of the international community to commit themselves strongly to strengthening the role of the United Nations  making it more dynamic and active in discharging the duty we have entrusted to it in the maintenance of international peace.74.	The People's Republic of Mozambique  an African  non-aligned and socialist country  strongly believes in the role the United Nations can play in harmonizing the actions of States in the promotion of a propitious political atmosphere of understanding  concord and co-operation among peoples and nations."
"96",4846,"MRT",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Lusaka  on behalf of the Mauritanian delegation  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. We are indeed proud that this lofty post is occupied by one of the sons of our struggling African continent. We are fully confident that  with his outstanding personal qualities  he will guide the work of the General Assembly with great experience and wisdom.184.	To his predecessor  Mr. Illueca  the President of Panama  we also extend our congratulations for the excellent manner in which he guided the work of the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session.185.	We should like to thank the Secretary-General  who discharges his enormous responsibilities with complete devotion to the Organization. It gives me pleasure  on behalf of the Mauritanian delegation  again to assure him of our renewed support for the great efforts he is exerting in order to realize the goals of the Organization and to surmount the difficulties of the current international situation.186.	On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I should like to congratulate the fraternal Muslim State of Brunei Darussalam on its admission to the United Nations. We are indeed confident that it will lend its support to the cause of right  justice and peace in the world.187.	A glance at the international scene gives little cause for optimism concerning the future of mankind. The continuing deterioration of the world economy and especially the collapse of the economies of most of the developing countries  the escalating arms race and the continuing hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world  all portend the perils that jeopardize mankind's future and threaten the destruction of the very bases of human civilization.188.	The international economic situation is deteriorating day by day  and therefore a true dialogue aimed at arriving at acceptable solutions is now more necessary than eve- before. The economic recovery that has begun in some industrialized countries has not had a positive effect on the economies of the developing countries. With great regret  we note the absence of any constructive dialogue between the developed and the developing countries with a view to arriving at solutions to international economic problems. We had hoped that global negotiations would begin and that there would be a positive response from the industrialized countries to the desire for dialogue expressed by the Group of 77. Regardless of our dismay at the obstacles some have placed in the way of global negotiations and the injustice of present international economic relations  we are happy at the increase in voluntary contributions to UNDP. It is our hope that the improvement that has occurred in the situation of UNDP will constitute the beginning of a new era of international co-operation and an incentive that will encourage the rich countries to increase their contributions to UNDP with a view to consolidating its funding activities in the developing countries.189.	Mauritania believes that comprehensive and radical reform of the world economic system would lead to the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equality and that that is the only path that will lead to progress  stability and security for all.190.	The Sahelian countries  in addition to suffering from the international crisis and the continuing deterioration of international economic relations  are experiencing a relentless and unprecedented drought  which has destroyed all vegetation. The situation is aggravated by a continuing decline in the prices of raw materials  a reduction in international development aid and highest interest rates on foreign loans  all of which has imposed an enormous burden on the economies of those countries  placing them in an intolerable situation.191.	With regard to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  the advancing deserts  the decline in groundwater levels and the sparse and irregular precipitation have to a great extent reduced arable lands and destroyed vast pasturelands  wiping out more than 70 per cent of the livestock. All of this has adversely affected conditions of life in a country that used to be essentially pastoral and agricultural.192.	We have mobilized all our limited resources to confront this natural disaster. The numerous appeals launched by the President of Mauritania  Mohamed Khouna Ould Haydalla  calling for self-reliance and support for the rural population have had a positive result in alleviating the sufferings of the victims of the devastating drought. All levels of our society  within the framework of mass guidance structures  have responded to these appeals  extending different forms of assistance and carrying out many social projects such as the drilling of wells and the building of earthen dams. Assistance in various forms from fraternal and friendly countries and international organizations  though still insufficient  has played an important and positive role in supporting our efforts in the face of this problem.193.	Here I should like to thank all who have stood alongside us as we have confronted the lean years  years unprecedented in the history of our region. The past year has been no more fortunate than previous years. Rainfall was restricted to certain areas and came too late and was too scattered. The peasants have not been able to profit from the rainfall  and there have been serious human and material losses in the northern region of Adrar.194.	In addition to the efforts deployed at the national level  Mauritania has in recent years  in cooperation with fraternal Sahelian countries  consolidated and developed the efforts of regional organizations working for the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan aimed at reducing the impact of drought and desertification on the population of the region.195.	In this context  we have the activities of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  which is attempting to mobilize the financial resources needed to implement national and regional projects to combat drought in the region. I would like to pay a tribute to the important role played by the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office in support of such efforts.196.	We would also like to avail ourselves of this opportunity to commend the positive results achieved by the conference held recently at Dakar  organized by the fraternal Government of Senegal  which took the form of a comprehensive diagnosis of the phenomenon of desertification and the identification of ways and means of combating it in the short  medium and long term. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  which participated in that conference  expresses its satisfaction at the inclusion of this question on the agenda of the General Assembly. We hope that  in view of its importance  especially with regard to the future of the Sahelian region now afflicted by drought and desertification  the international community will make special efforts to implement the recommendations of that conference.197.	There can be no doubt that efforts to confront the economic crisis now facing the African continent  and especially the fight against drought and desertification  require enormous resources that far exceed the region's potential. We should therefore like to praise the role played by the Secretary-General in mobilizing world public opinion to cope with the tragic situation now confronting most of the countries of Africa. We support the efforts of the ad hoc consultative working group established to monitor the situation in the countries afflicted and the appointment of a personal representative of the Secretary-General to co-ordinate financial and technical assistance.198.	At a time when the world economic crisis is becoming ever more acute and hunger  disease and ignorance still prevail in most developing countries  vast sums are being squandered to develop and stockpile the means to destroy mankind. Is it not amazing that lethal weapons consume $1 trillion a yearâthat is  more than $2 billion a day? The arms race constitutes one of the major obstacles hindering the implementation of development programmes to serve human progress. That is why we call upon all countries  and especially the super-Powers  to enter into serious negotiations to reduce nuclear armaments with a view to achieving genuine disarmament.199.	The international situation continues to be characterized by uncertainty and instability. Many countries and peoples continue to suffer from colonialism  expansionism and hegemony  while international peace and security continue to be hostage to super-Power rivalry and confrontation. In many parts of the world  countries and entities are engaging in aggressive activities against neighbouring States in violation of all international laws  rules and customs. Tension continues to mount and hotbeds of war continue to rage in more than one region  consuming enormous human and material resources in countries that are striving towards development and that see their efforts to build their countries hampered and thwarted.200.	In the Middle East  international peace and security are constantly being threatened because of the intransigence of Israel and its defiance of world public opinion and of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations and its organs  including the Security Council. Everyone is aware that for the past 37 years Israel has persisted in its aggression and expansion  occupying ever more Palestinian and other Arab territories and attempting to distort their demographic and historic structures with a view to final annexation  to such an extent that even the sacred Muslim and Christian sites in Al-Quds al- Sharif have not escaped desecration and destruction.201.	The policy of intransigence and fait accompli jeopardizes respect for the United Nations and its credibility and thus represents a serious threat to international peace and stability. Any just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question and the problem of the Middle East must be based on recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination  national sovereignty and the establishment of their independent State on their land under the leadership of the PLO  their sole  legitimate representative  as well as the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories  including Al-Quds al-Shar- if.202.	In Lebanon  we are pleased at the efforts being made by the fraternal Lebanese people and its Government to achieve reconciliation and to preserve the country's territorial integrity despite the yoke of the Israeli occupation  which affects not only Lebanese territory but extends to the repression of Lebanese national resistance. Israel has this year intentionally carried out a scheme to take possession of the waters of southern Lebanon by diverting the courses of certain rivers in the area under Israeli control to serve that country's aggressive designs in occupied Palestine. The international community must resist such pressure and remain faithful to its noble position in the face of Israeli practices in southern Lebanon.203.	In southern Africa  the racist Pretoria regime is continuing its odious policy and intransigence with a view to consolidating racial discrimination  on the one hand  and hindering Namibia's movement towards independence  on the other. The farce of the so-called constitutional reforms does not delude the people in southern Africa  who have heroically resisted them despite campaigns of intimidation and massacres in various parts of their homeland. The malevolent intent behind such manoeuvres has been clear to the international community  which has condemned them from the very beginning. We are convinced that the policy of racial discrimination  as an unjust philosophy of Government  is not capable of partial amelioration. Any measure purporting to achieve that will represent a new challenge to the dignity of man and the freedom of peoples. Mauritania is convinced that any just and lasting solution to the South African problem will depend on the complete elimination of the policy of racial discrimination and the establishment of a democratic system based on justice and equality.204.	With regard to the question of Namibia  the international community and  first  the countries that bear special responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations  should seriously strive to implement the resolutions of the international organizations and put an end to the violation of international law and legitimacy.205.	We reaffirm our full support for the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative  for independence  freedom and territorial integrity  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).206.	With regard to Chad  my country continues to make earnest efforts in the interest of the restoration of peace in that brother country. We hope that the withdrawal of foreign forces will mark the dawning of a new era of national harmony  stability and security in all parts of that African land.207.	As for the conflict in the Gulf  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  while deploring the continuing bloodshed and wastage of the human and material resources of the two brother peoples of Iraq and Iran  wishes to record its satisfaction at the agreement by one of the parties to the conflict to enter into peaceful negotiations. We repeat our appeal to our brothers to put an end to that destructive war  which only serves the interests of the enemies of our Islamic nation. We stress the need to prevent the conflict from spreading throughout the region and to respect the sovereignty and independence of neighbouring States.208.	On the Afghanistan question  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania continues to urge respect for the sovereignty of that brother Islamic country and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghan territory.209.	With regard to Kampuchea  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania reiterates its support for the relevant General Assembly resolutions and for the Declaration on Kampuchea  adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York in 1981. We reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Democratic Kampuchea  respect for its territorial integrity and the cessation of foreign intervention in its internal affairs.210.	My country is concerned about the situation in Central America and hopes that the efforts being made there will lead to peace and security in that region.211.	Directly across our borders  the Saharan war continues between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. That fratricidal war drains enormous human resources  overburdens the Moroccan and Saharan peoples and jeopardizes security in the whole region. This year in particular has seen an alarming rise in tension  thus dampening the hopes that we all shared after the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983. The historic resolution of that session not only determined the two parties to the conflict but also clearly defined the framework and measures for a just settlement of that dispute by peaceful means. As is well known  that resolution was endorsed by the Assembly at its last session.212.	It is indeed regrettable that the efforts to give effect to that resolution have not yet borne fruit because they have come up against the refusal of one side to implement it. Those who put obstacles in the way of implementation of that resolution must bear the consequences historically of such acts  which harm the interests of the people of the region and the future peace and security of the African continent.213.	Having contributed to the adoption of the Addis Ababa resolution  Mauritania remains convinced that direct  frank and constructive negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic are the only way to bring about a cease-fire and practical arrangements for a comprehensive referendum to enable the people to exercise the right of self-determination free from any administrative or military pressure.214.	Our country  which pursues a policy of open co-operation  good-neighbourliness and understanding with all the countries of the region  is determined to continue its efforts to bring about the lasting  peaceful solution of this painful conflict  thus allowing our peoples to devote their efforts to building the great Arab Maghreb. Mauritania works for such a Maghreb by participating in the laying of sound  strong foundations  for which purpose we have joined our brothers in Algeria and Tunisia in a treaty of brotherhood and understanding. The conclusion of that treaty was not dictated by transient interests at the expense of the independence of peoples and the stability of States  as is the case with certain agreements in the region. On the contrary  it fully recognizes the objective facts and truly fulfils the hopes and aspirations of the peoples.215.	The clouds that loom large over international economic and political horizons make it essential for us to fulfil our responsibilities so as to enhance the authority of the Organization and ensure compliance with all with its decisions.216.	Salvation lies in establishing a system of economic relations that is more just  replacing selfishness with fruitful co-operation  sterile differences with constructive dialogue  hatred and fanaticism with concord and brotherhood  in accordance with the principles on which the United Nations is based and with its high ideals and human values  so that the human community may enjoy peace  security and justice.217.	In our view  this is the only way to fulfil our duty to future generations. Let us never forget that the annals of history will record our acts and that sooner or later history will pronounce its verdict."
"97",4892,"MUS",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  I thank you for the opportunity given to me to address the Assembly. I bring to you and to the eminent personalities gathered here the warm greetings of the Government and people of Mauritius. We welcome Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations.38.	Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you very warmly on your election to this high office. The Assembly could not have made a better choiceâa choice which bespeaks your proved personal abilities  your diplomatic skills and your commitment to the high ideals of the Organization. Indeed  Sir  it is a tribute to your great country and an acknowledgement of Africa's role and importance in world affairs.39.	I should like also to express the whole-hearted appreciation of my Government and myself to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  for the highly distinguished manner in which he presided over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. He marked our last deliberations with the stamp of wisdom  justice and fair play. I salute this noble son of the third world.40.	I pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General for his untiring and unflinching efforts in the cause of international peace and  in particular  for his patient and ceaseless endeavours to complete the process of decolonization in Africa. In the exercise of his duties  onerous certainly  but so vital for mankind  Mauritius stands firm behind the Secretary-General and is ready to co-operate in the search for lasting peace. To this end  we are fully committed and we shall strive within our capabilities to ensure that the United Nations is in a position to perform the tasks entrusted to it under the Charter.41.	It is a matter of deep regret that this thirty-ninth session still faces many of the problems which bedevilled previous sessions. The world  which our forebears sought to create in order to protect succeeding generations from the scourge of war  is altogether different now. Man holds in his hands the power to annihilate all forms of life on this planet. And the existence of weapons of mass destruction has sown the seeds of discord and distrust amongst us and has struck terror into the hearts of mankind. War machines have far outpaced the instruments of peace.42.	The world situation today is more than ever fraught with danger. The spectre of a thermonuclear holocaust becomes more and more haunting  while the renewed escalation in the nuclear-arms race continues unabated. Resources of an unprecedented scale are being expended by certain countries while elsewhere drought  famine and diseases have claimed a heavy toll in lives from the undernourished  the old  the weak and the newly born.43.	We have no moral or other right to stand by and witness the slow death of mankind. We can all live only if we are courageous enough to combine our efforts and resources in the struggle for peace. We have already made a step in the right direction by tacitly recognizing our capacity for self-destruction. We are also all too aware of how massive military expenditure delays and inhibits the elimination of poverty  hunger and economic inequity. Let us therefore be bold enough to engage in meaningful talks for general and complete disarmament. Let us start now  for we all desire peace and security. Let there be a renaissance in values that characterize international relations. If we are truly men of dedication  then let love  mutual understanding  co-operation and trust be our guiding principles. Let us build anew a world where the strong are just and the weak secure and where peace is sacred.44.	In the name of humanity  I call upon the nuclear Powers fully to assume their responsibilities towards mankind so that tomorrow's world may be free from threat  conflict and greed and free from the terrors of mass destruction. Only general and complete disarmament can provide such credible guarantees. We therefore propose that disarmament negotiations resume promptly and continue without interruption until meaningful agreement is achieved.45.	I speak today in an hour of international peril  at a time when the world is being held ransom by the protagonists of war  neo-colonialism  imperialism and hegemonism. Peace  which should have been a vital part of mankind's heritage and a dominant element in our interdependent world  remains as elusive as ever. We have  instead  a situation of greater international rivalry and tension and conflicts. Nations tend to belong to specific spheres of influence  established and nurtured by the superpowers. And more and more often  regional conflicts  armed intervention  foreign interference and occupation are the direct results thereof. These in our view constitute the most dangerous threats to world peace and international security.46.	We firmly believe that peace and freedom are inseparable. One cannot exist in the absence of the other. Any denial of this basic concept cannot but lead to confrontation  tension  instability and a total lack of faith in man. We have no doubt in our minds that the threats that loom large on our horizon and the catastrophe that threatens us can be averted. We have only to show courage by fully assuming our responsibilities and by standing firmly by our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. It is because of our deep-rooted belief in such principles that we favour a world of free and equal States.47.	It is disappointing and  indeed  alarming to see how our efforts to achieve lasting peace are being frustrated by power politics. The continuous flouting of international norms of behaviour by the superpowers  their lack of respect for their obligations under the Charter and their constant endeavour to strengthen their spheres of influence have brought about regional conflicts  tension  aggression and war. Not far from our shores  southern Africa offers a spectacle which is repulsive and abhorrent. No one can  in his heart of hearts  remain insensitive to the ordeals of the downtrodden and oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia  whose legitimate aspirations for freedom  equality and dignity are being stifled and trampled upon.48.	We view with grave concern the events taking place in that part of the worldâevents which will weigh heavily against us when we stand trial in the high court of history. For years now  we have condemned the inhuman policies of apartheid practised by the immoral regime of South Africa. We have repeatedly affirmed the right of the South African people to accede to full independence and sovereignty. It is now most disheartening to note that those were mere words  hollow and devoid of significance  uttered with characteristic cynicism and hypocrisy by those who hold the key to this thorny issue.49.	Let us resolve now to do away with the shameful situation prevailing there. Let us heed the cry of the oppressed. Let us combine our efforts to bring home to those concerned that the continued denial of fundamental rights and freedoms to the people of South Africa cannot but push us further towards disaster.50.	The illegal occupation of Namibia  the unlawful exploitation of its natural resources and the repressive policies of the racist regime against its people constitute further grave threats to regional as well as international peace and security. We want the Namibian people to know that we fully support their heroic struggle for freedom  equality and justice. We stand committed to their noble cause and to the war of liberation that is being waged by the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. Our aim is to see a stable and prosperous southern Africa and this cannot be achieved as long as the occupying administration violates the Charter of the United Nations and flouts the basic principles of international law. The prevailing situation is one of grave anxiety and calls for united and determined action.51.	Mauritius stands firmly by Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. We deeply regret the inability of the Western Powers to ensure the early implementation of the independence plan. And we consider the linkage between Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a lame argument  trumped up by the racist regime and supported by vested interests. We appeal to the world body to join us in our struggle to secure the early independence of Namibia.52.	It seems that the lot of mankind is one of misery  threat  tension and anxiety. From Africa to the Middle East  the ugly head of confrontation  aggression  occupation and war is reared. The explosive situation in the Middle East threatens our existence and is central to the political  economic and military stability of the world. As long as uncertainty  discord  distrust  frustration and violence prevail in that region  the world will continue to live with a profoundly destabilizing element in its affairs. A just and lasting peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the question  including  and in particular  the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.53.	All States in the region should live within secure and recognized international frontiers. Aggression and occupation of the land of others will not guarantee the security of any State or nation. The crying need of the hour is therefore negotiation  accommodation and recognition.54.	The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has our full support in its valiant struggle to secure the inalienable and fundamental rights of the Palestinian people. We call upon all parties concerned to review their positions and seriously engage in meaningful negotiations for a lasting settlement of this problem.55.	As I said before  the world is so closely knit and interdependent that conflicts or tensions anywhere affect us all because we are citizens of one world.56.	The situation in Cyprus continues to threaten peace and international security and is a cause of deep concern to us. We strongly urge the peace-loving countries of the region and others to desist from any action that may further aggravate the explosive situation that prevails in Cyprus.57.	We fully support the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus and we condemn any effort aimed at changing its demographic situation. We strongly favour the immediate withdrawal of all occupation forces and the resumption of intercommunal talks. We are convinced that settlement of this issue must be based on Security Council resolution 365 (1974).58.	Yet another problem  which is assuming alarming proportions and to which we must address ourselves  is the unresolved conflict between Iran and Iraq  a conflict that has weakened both countries economically and has claimed a heavy toll of human lives on both sides. This fratricidal war should be stopped forthwith. We therefore call upon both parties to show restraint and to cease all hostilities. Any further escalation of this conflict cannot but disturb regional stability and peace. We urge both Iran and Iraq to engage in serious and meaningful negotiations with a view to ending this dispute peacefully.59.	The world is still plagued by localized wars. The complex situation in Afghanistan is yet another example of the flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a sister country. We want the Assembly to know that we strongly oppose external interference of any kind and from any source in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  or of any country for that matter. We fully support the Secretary-General in his efforts to secure a peaceful solution acceptable to all parties concerned  and we eagerly await the day when Afghanistan will resume its non-aligned status.60.	The smouldering crisis in Central America continues to threaten peace in that region and is an impediment to the efforts of countries of the area aimed at strengthening their unity  solidarity and cooperation. The traditional repressive power structure has further aggravated the situation. We firmly believe that every effort should be made to facilitate the necessary dialogue between the parties concerned for the achievement of a political and negotiated solution of the problems of the region. Such dialogue and negotiations should take place within the Contadora framework.61.	The continuing state of affairs in South-East Asia is precarious and explosive. While much effort and time has been lost in superficial matters  the tragic plight of the peoples of the region has been lost sight of. The untold sufferings of the people of the area  bearing witness to the further escalation of tensions in the region  are all the more aggravated by external interference and the use of force against sovereign States. We condemn such action  and we strongly urge the international community  in particular the countries concerned  seriously to work for a comprehensive political solution which would provide for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the area  thus ensuring full respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all States  including Kampuchea. We applaud the efforts being made in this direction within the framework of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  an association we fully support.62.	The international community has for some time been discussing the question of Korea. We once again reiterate our firm belief in the urgent need for direct negotiations  without any outside interference of any kind  between the two parties concerned for a realistic and lasting solution to their problems. We call upon both North Korea and South Korea immediately to resume inter-Korean negotiations for the peaceful settlement of issues impeding the reunification of the two Koreas.63.	We have always upheld the principle of universality of membership of the Organization. We feel strongly that  for the sake of peace and international security and also because of the larger interest of the peoples of both Koreas  we should seriously consider the admission of North Korea and South Korea to the Organization.64.	I do not want to appear to be a prophet of doom  but threats  tensions and conflicts cannot but hamper political and socio-economic development  peace and international security. My own country  Mauritius  is in the midst of it all. The activities of the big Powers and the arsenals of death and destruction they have deployed in the Indian Ocean constitute one of the major threats to the countries of the regionâcountries which are still vulnerable to external influences. This continued refusal to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace is highly indicative of their avowed policy of establishing spheres of influence in the Indian Ocean and of continued domination. We strongly condemn such policies and attitudes  and we call upon those concerned not to vitiate efforts aimed at the complete demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. We urge them to give their full support to the United Nations so that the Conference on the Indian Ocean may be convened as early as possible.65.	Finally  I should like to address myself to yet another problem which is fast assuming alarming proportions  a problem which transcends political barriers and which is at this very moment threatening more than two thirds of mankind. I am referring to the economic plight of the developing countries  taking into consideration the world economic situation in the period 1980 to 1984.66.	The world economic scene in the 1980s has been characterized by persistent recession in the developed countries  high rates of interest and the appreciating dollar. Growth in the industrial market economies  as a group  slowed down sharply in 1980 and remained sluggish during the years 1980 to 1983. There are evident signs that  in spite of the fact that the international economic scene is picking up  the monetary market continues to be severely perturbed. Major industrial countries are pursuing restrictive monetary policies to restrain inflation. This has resulted in declines or low rates of growth in gross domestic product among almost all developing countries of the world. Unemployment rates have also reached alarmingly high levels.67.	This continuing recession in the industrial world has severely constrained growth in the developing countries through a series of direct and indirect interactions. The drop in demand in industrial countries resulted in declines in both the prices and the volumes of primary exports of both oil-exporting and non-oil-exporting countries. Growth in these countries was therefore affected by monetary  trade and fiscal policies adopted by the industrial countries to combat the recession.68.	The restrictive monetary policies pursued in a number of industrial countries  to control inflation  for example  maintained interest rates at high levels  thereby greatly increasing non-oil-producing developing countries' debt-service payments on their floating rate. The current account deficits of the oil-importing developing countries have continued to increase  from 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1978 to 4.4 per cent in 1980 and this trend has kept increasing in the early 1980s.69.	The balance-of-payments position of oil-importing countries was severely affected by increases in the price of oil  coupled with increases in interest payments. A number of countries were therefore unable to meet their loan repayment obligations and  indeed  many had to pursue drastic deflationary policies to contain their growing current account deficits  with all the accompanying evils of reduced demand  lowered standard of living and higher unemployment levels. Therefore  although the long- term solution for these countries lies in the recovery in the world demand and a determined restructuring of their own economies  their immediate requirement is for continued inflows of capital to ease their liquidity shortage.70.	This need has been recognized and various formulas have been proposed  but these have not  unfortunately  proved adequate to meet the requirements of the developing world. During this period  several countries have had recourse to debt rescheduling  although this is not the solution for countries with deep-set economic and financial problems. There is  therefore  an urgent call for better and closer collaboration among creditor Governments  and for a better understanding of our commercial banking system and among international financing institutions. It is this and only this which can facilitate our long-term adjustment and pave the way for a quicker world recovery. While steps are being taken to ease the debt difficulties of the main middle- income borrowers  too little has been done to assist the low-income countries seriously affected by the recent recession  the effects of which have not yet left our doorsteps.71.	The continuing appreciation of the United States dollar and the resulting weakness of our currencies has further fuelled inflationary tendencies in most countries  and in particular developing countries  which would normally have benefited from the gain in competitiveness of their exports. This comparative advantage has been mitigated by the extremely low levels of economic activities in most developed countries and in the pressures for restrictions on imports. The benefits of the recovery in the world economy have not been felt in any significant manner by the underprivileged of this world. Industrial countries continue to resort to protectionist measures and to invoke safeguard clauses in the various agreementsâsome of which were held out to be models of co-operation only a few years earlierâthereby threatening the very survival of the developing countries. The developed countries are not playing by the rules of the game and often use flimsy arguments to resort to protectionist measures. Such an approach was reflected in the outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983.72.	The debt problem of developing countries needs to be emphasized. Of all constraints facing us today  none is as damning in its consequences as the burden of debt. We continue to reel under the burden of successive increases in oil prices  recession  high interest rates and decreases in the price of our raw materials. Our exports to world markets have suffered drastically because of the growing surge of protectionism. And  to crown it all  debt servicing has brought development in all spheres of economic life to a grinding halt. As far back as 1981  Luis Echeverria Alvarez  former President of Mexico  gave a pertinent diagnosis of the reasons for the tensions and conflicts in the third world  emphasizing the formidable dangers of inequality.73.	In fact  at no other time in historyâliving as we do in the nuclear ageâhave the problems of humanity been so severe in their causes and in their consequences. Inequality has become for us the most outstanding institutional form of conflict among nations and peoples.74.	Above and beyond possible and foreseeable changes that might take place in the East and the West  it seems impossible to speculate regarding peace and development in the absence of an adequate solution to the traumas of the South. In short  although the East-West confrontation could lead to a nuclear war and the general destruction of civilization  on the other hand  a fruitful dialogue between the North and the South could mean a stage of reconstruction  as well as bringing about the most important change that mankind has witnessed in recent centuriesâthat is  the creation of a new international economic order  the only logical outcome of the North-South dialogue. The only alternative is a yearly get-together for rhetorical discourse  a dialogue of the deaf.75.	The contemporary world's greatest challenge indeed lies ultimately in the discovery of a formula to integrate science and technology into the struggle against misery  poverty and the misuse of economic and military power. This can take place. It is not a third world Utopian dream  for the world possesses outstanding and significant human resources and a great reserve of human wisdom. We have more educated people living today than during the whole of human history. Are we really to dedicate such an immense potential for creativity and change to the agony of a perpetual and implacable arms race? This undoubtedly would be a senseless tragedy.76.	Today's economic disorder  in which inequality has become the dominant institutional form of development  has changed the problems inherited from colonial times into dilemmas that are more far reaching than those involving East and West  North and South  and calls for the return to one of the most outstanding periods in international life in recent years  1974âthe year in which the United Nations condemned the old international economic order and proclaimed as imperative the establishment of a new international economic order.77.	The current world situation should make us comprehend the impossibility of maintaining an economic  monetary and institutional structure founded upon the equilibrium of terror or the explosive disarticulation of zones of influence. Such a disarticulation would affect all geopolitical fields and means of control stemming from the international division of labour.78.	The problems of the third world have assumed calamitous proportions which affect all cultures  ideologies and economic systems equally. The resulting turmoil has adversely affected the development strategies of the developing world. All nations must now take an interest in seeking a rational answer to a crisis which can no longer be resolved in the old way  one that is now impossible and unworkable  the way of areas of influence and the balance of terror. It is essential to find practical  concrete and humane solutions that will bring about a new order in the face of world economic disorder. This challenge will determine the future path of our civilization.79.	May I also state that we are anxiously awaiting the Secretariat's comprehensive study on Antarctica. I am sure the study will help the international community to fathom Antarctica. I hope that the Assembly will take the necessary and appropriate measures for the review of the existing regime. Antarctica must become part of the common heritage of mankind.80.	Before concluding  I should like to make two points which are of particular significance to Mauritius. I would like first of all to commend the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations family and  in particular  to say a few words about the IMO. For developing countries  and especially for island countries  maritime transport is of crucial importance. Recently Mauritius has had the benefit of valuable practical help from the United Nations system by way of advice and assistance from the IMO in respect of the efforts of Mauritius to update and revitalize its shipping and related maritime programme.81.	The work of the IMO in relation to shipping  and in particular to the technical co-operation programme of that organization  is of great importance and increasing relevance to my country and to other developing countries  both in our efforts to participate more effectively and equitably in world maritime transport and also in considering new and improved programmes arising from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.82.	The financial support that UNDP gives to the programme of technical assistance of IMO is therefore of special significance to developing countries  and any action taken by the General Assembly to maintain and increase that support will be greatly appreciated by my country.83.	This year and next  we in Mauritius are organizing a series of activities to mark the one-hundred- and-fiftieth anniversary of the abolition of slavery and of the beginning of Indian immigration. We are confident that the Assembly will wish without hesitation to acknowledge the contributions of those innumerable men  women and children to the struggle for freedom and dignity and  at the same time  at the cost of their sweat  tears and tribulations  to the prosperity and wealth of the then colonial Powers. Mauritius wishes to recommend strongly to the Assembly that we celebrate in a resounding fashion the abolition of slavery.84.	Let us pledge here and now our whole-hearted support to humanity  and let us work towards change and improvement in the quality of life for all peoples. Let us have a more humane world system. Let us resolve to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  be it political or economic."
"98",4975,"MYS",39,1984,"ï»¿Sir  it is with special pleasure that I greet you  a distinguished son of Zambia and of Africa  as President of the General Assembly and offer you my warmest felicitations on your unanimous election. Yours is a heavy responsibility as you guide our work during a very difficult period for the United Nations  and I want to begin by assuring you of the fullest co-operation of the Malaysian delegation in all your efforts  because Malaysia's support for the United Nations is unstinting and unabashed.82.	It is this support which has brought me here twice to address the Assembly although I have been Prime Minister of my country for only three years. For far too long  the United Nations has been abused  denigrated and ignored. For far too long now  we have been hearing about the so-called tyranny and irresponsibility of the majority  about waste and ""paper"" resolutions and double standards. We all know that the United Nations is not without fault  but in the face of ignorance and bigotry  of myths and falsehoods  we must continue to proclaim our faith in what the United Nations at its best stands forâa world which is secure for all  just for all  prosperous for all and humane for all.83.	These were the ideals of international co-operation and justice proclaimed by the founding fathers of this institution: not a world in which only the rich and the powerful make the important decisions; not a world in which small nations fight proxy wars on behalf of big nations; not a world in which might is right; not a world half-rich and half-poor  half-well- endowed and half-deprived. What has happened now to those ideals? We who believe in them want also to believe that the founder-Members of the Organization meant what they said when they proclaimed the Charter of the United Nations. It is understandable that the excitements and the expectations of the dawn of 1945 should inevitably be tarnished in the cold light of experience over the last 39 years. But the sad truth is more than that.84.	For the first 15 or 20 years of the Organization's existence  we did not hear anything about the disproportionate voting strength of small Statesâ and there were small Statesâor about the tyranny of the automatic majorityâand there was often an automatic majority. Instead  we heard about the virtues of a more democratic international life as exemplified in the United Nations. What has happened to those sentiments? Were we naive to believe that those countries which loudly proclaimed such ideals in the early decades of the Organization did  indeed  believe in them? What  then  are we to make of the constant barrage of perverse criticism  the threats and the denigration which have now become fashion in certain quarters? Is it because the United Nations can no longer be manipulated and manoeuvred?85.	Malaysia  for one  would like to believe otherwise. Yet we see the big Powers continuing more and more to ignore and to belittle the United Nations. They have established a network of relationships outside the United Nations system to resolve world problems. They have formed their own economic clubs  to which from time to time the developing countries are permitted to make their supplications. But the clubs  like all exclusive clubs  essentially look after the interests of their members. In the meantime  in the economic as in the political field  the United Nations continues to be ignored. Indeed  we witness something even more negative  namely  the threat to withdraw from certain United Nations agencies. Unhappy about the direction and leadership of these agencies  they sometimes make these threats under the guise of management or budgetary concerns.86.	To that I wish to respond: we  the small and the poor  also pay. What we contribute may not be much  but in terms of our own budgets it is substantial indeed  sometimes even more substantial than the contributions of big nations. We do not like to see anyone squandering our money any more than the rich. But what we would like to see is not savings through the destruction of the agencies but a thorough overhaul of the system to ensure that it is cost- effective and serves the agreed objectives. Undermining the agencies is definitely not the way to tackle the problem  and so let us say: enough of this short-sightedness; enough of cynicism; enough of distortions and falsehoods. As we stand on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  let us first of all pledge ourselves once more to the United Nations and  in that spirit  to a practical and realistic appraisal of where we can go from here.87.	Looking back at the past four decades  I believe that from time to time we have succeeded in acting in the true spirit of the Charter. No one can deny that the United Nations has had its successes and it still does much valuable work  often in unspectacular ways. All this has been due to the consciousness that there exists an international community and that our national interest can in fact be safeguarded in the larger context of the international interest. It is this consciousness that we must constantly cultivate.88.	The fact is that the further development of the United Nations depends first and foremost on the attitude of the major Powers. It is they  more than anyone else  that are in a position to decide the future of the Organization. This is because the major Powers cannot be ignored. The resolutions of the United Nations can be ignored  as they have been. The weak developing countries can be ignored  as they have constantly been. The question then is: do the major Powers want the United Nations to become what it can becomeâa centre for resolving conflicting interests and a catalyst for peaceful changeâor will they abandon it because they can no longer manipulate it?89.	But  of course  the responsibility is not theirs alone. The smaller nations are disillusioned at the ineffectiveness of the United Nations  which has been paralysed on so many occasions because the major Powers have prevented effective action. But Malaysia has always believed that just as the major Powers must avoid alienating the smaller .countries by their obstructive policies  so also must the small countries prevent the alienation of the major Powers from the Organization through the wholesale imposition of decisions by majority vote. Speaking as a representative of a small developing country  I am very conscious of the fact that a United Nations resolution that is obtained by majority voting along group  political or ideological lines will not in itself solve any problem. There is often a need for greater realism and restraint. More efforts can be made through the process of negotiation and consultation to arrive at solutions of principle that are both realistic and practical.90.	But the principles must remain at the core of any solution. The United Nations  if it is to mean anything at all  must stand firm on principles  and there will be a need for adjustments and compromise on the means  the processes and the modalities. We  the smaller nations  cannot be blamed if we insist on that. It is hypocrisy to accuse us of being emotional or unrealistic  irresponsible or irrelevant only because those principles are now inconvenient to the major Powers 91.	I turn now to another subject of equal importance to contemporary international and human relations. I refer to the misunderstanding that is so prevalent in the Western world  fed by deliberate distortions by interested parties about what is happening in the Islamic world.92.	The fact is that there is a resurgence of faith in the Islamic world as well as among other religions. Do not allow yourselves to be manipulated so as to fear this resurgence or even the word ""fundamentalist""  which has triggered so many ancient suspicions and prejudices. Yes  we are the Islamic ""fundamentalists""  because we believe in the fundamentals of Islamâin peace  tolerance and justiceâand  yes  there are extremists just as there are extremists everywhere in every religion and in every phase of history. Surely no one can deny that  historically  there have been aberrations in all religions and it is plain prejudice or deliberate distortion to allow these aberrations to determine our perception and our judgement. Let us ask ourselves: would it be fair to judge Christianity by the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition  or by the obscenity of apartheid  or of Nazism? Would it be fair to judge Judaism by the perversities that political Zionism represents?93.	The answer is obvious. The current revolution in Islam deserves to be judged fairly and objectively. I do not deny that violence  injustice and much that is against universal good values have been perpetrated in the name of Islam. But the concentration on these aspectsâwhich  I repeat  are aberrations typical in any historical movementâto the exclusion of all others that are true and good does harm to the world. It leads to misunderstanding  fuels suspicions and reinforces prejudices to the detriment of us all.94.	And yet there are some who  for their own racist reasons  are only too prone to highlight and gloat over every excess  real or imagined  which they can focus upon. If all the money  time and energy spent on distorting what is going on in the Islamic world were spent instead on a careful and objective understanding of one of the most important developments in the contemporary world  how much better off we would all be. The great liberation movements after the Second World War could be understood only when people knew that Gandhi was not ""a half-naked fakir""  nor Kenyatta a representative of the forces of evil and darkness  nor Nasser an upstart and an irresponsible trouble-maker. Similarly  what is happening in the Islamic world today must be understood as a movement that seeks to consolidate political freedom  economic justice and cultural identity; a catalogue of values which everyone  if he is to be true to any notion of decency and civility  must surely support.95.	It is not my purpose in these remarks to place the current Islamic resurgence in its historical context. There is a long and turbulent history of relations between Islam and the West during which many prejudices became ingrained. What is more tragic is that these are now being revived  fanned and exploited by the Zionists to serve political ends. The great peoples of the Bookâthe Jews  Christians and Muslimsâhave much in common with each other  have contributed much to human civilization and surely have much more to contribute.96.	Why is it then that we allow one of the most significant movements of our timesâthe resurgence of Islamâto be wilfully misrepresented and misunderstood? Who stands to gain from such misunderstanding? Why cannot we instead turn to one another and learn from one another  from our respective historical experiences  from our dreams and hopes and fears? Let us find charity in our hearts; let Christians  Jews and agnostics alike find the charity in their hearts to recognize what is going on in the Islamic world for what it really is: a search for spiritual succour in a world that is confused and troubled. Let us be rid of hatred  of the anti-Islam propaganda of bitterness and prejudice that the Zionists continue to spew.97.	I appeal therefore for understanding between Jews  Christians and Muslims. Many Muslims today are disillusioned and shocked at what they regard as contemporary' aberrations in the Judaeo-Christian tradition  and this has resulted in a resurgence of Islamic orthodoxy and extremism. The Zionist-inspired Western reaction to this Islamic resurgence  as well as its aberrations of intolerance and self-righteousness  has further increased the separation and antagonism between the West and the Islamic world.98.	It is time that weâall of usâput a stop to this. The contemporary aberrations in the Judaeo-Christian traditions and  similarly  the contemporary aberrations  in a few instances  within the Islamic tradition must not be allowed to obscure their fundamental virtues. Let us study each other's teachings. Let us be true to those teachings. God willing  the great understand that this will generate will help Jews and Christians and Muslims alike to contribute first of all to peace in the Middle East and then to greater understanding in the world. It will at the very least stop the machinations of those with selfish and narrow  racist ends who are seeking to exploit ignorance and suspicion and prejudice. It will be a development of historic significance.99.	I would like to turn now to economic issues  and here my theme is consistency and fairness.100.	For a long time  the banner of free trade was held high  and the colonies of the metropolitan Powers were vigorously taught the virtues of free trade. At that time  and for years after independence  we could not export anything except primary commodities and  true to the lessons we had been taught  our markets were open to imports of manufactured goods from the industrialized countries. However  now that we ourselves have learned the trick of manufacturing and exporting goods  although the amount is insignificant  what has happened to that proud banner of free trade? It flies limply or at half- mast in the industrialized countries. We see quotas and other restrictions  so-called voluntary restraints and other threats and pressures. We even see our industrialization policies  which seek to attract foreign investment through such devices as export incentives  preferential financing and so on  being challenged. We also see to our surprise labour unions in industrialized countries which in the days of empire had not been in the least concerned about the lot of our workerâwho were then certainly exploitedâsuddenly become champions of our workers  urging them to demand higher wages and improved working conditions  even though our workers have already gained better treatment since independence. Why this unusual concern  we wonder? Is it coincidental that the result of this concern is that our products are less competitive?101.	We will be forgiven  therefore  if in the face of all this we are a little cynical about the principles of free trade which they have been preaching and about the interest of their labour unions in the welfare of our workers. Therefore I say this. Do not merely preach free trade  practise it. Do not be so presumptuous as to think that you know better than our labour leaders how to look after the interests of our workers. We can compete with you freely and fairly in certain areas. These are usually those of low- technology goods which  in any event  you  who are much higher up on the industrial scale  can best leave to us so that in turn we can import the higher- technology goods that you produce. In this way  we can all mutually fuel international trade  which is an essential engine of growth and the only real solution to our poverty problem.102.	I want to turn to another area in which the comfortable and the rich in the industrialized countries still have the colonial mentality and want to lead us by the hand. During colonial times  many of our forests were cleared for timber and for planting rubber  oil palms  tea  sugar  coffee  and so on. Little concern was then expressed about the environment. Now  as we seek to open up our lands for modern farming  for the generation of power and for industrialization  a whole host of environmentalists from the industrialized countries have descended upon us to educate our people about preserving the natural beauty of our tropical forests  and so on. Certainly  we want to preserve our forests. Certainly  we want to maintain our clean environment  our clean atmosphere. But  make no mistake; it will not be at the expense of the living conditions of our people. We will not accept a situation in which our rural people live in poverty and misery so that the rich  when they come by  can say ""What unspoilt beauty!""  tip the ""happy"" native children 10 cents to pose in front of a thatched hut  and then go their comfortable way. The preservation of the environment requires money  which we will not have unless we develop. We fully intend to develop  and it is we  and we alone  who will make the judgement about environmental standards and about the preservation of our natural beauty)  which we  surely  more than anyone else have an interest in preserving. Help the poor countries to develop economically and the environment will be taken care of. Being poor in a beautiful environment does not mitigate poverty.103.	While op the subject of environment  I want to draw attention to yet another imposition on certain poor countries. I refer to the pollution of the sea  specifically to pollution in the straits regarded as international shipping routes. More specifically still  I want to refer to Malaysia's experience in the Straits of Malacca. In the days when ships were not so numerous or so huge  their passage through the narrow Straits posed little problem for the littoral States. But now hundreds of these behemoths  filled with all kinds of goods  including dangerous chemicals and petroleum  clog the Straits. Every now and then they collide with each other  spilling their contents into the sea. While tankers no longer clean their holds in the narrow waters  other ships still do. There is still a considerable amount of rubbish being discarded into the sea. The net result is filthy Straits with patches of oil  pieces of paper  plastic and other rubbish. Eventually all this lands on our shores  making them equally filthy.104.	In the face of those developments  the equipment and boats which Malaysia maintains to clean oil spillage at considerable cost to ourselves are no longer enough. Now we have actively to consider sweeping the sea of the wastes and rubbish thrown or flushed out of ships. I believe that in the circumstances we are right to ask that the maritime nations and the shipping firms  which obviously benefit from using the Straits  should help to maintain the facilities for keeping the waters clean. I have no specific formula in mind but I am convinced that the international agencies concerned must examine this question and make necessary provisions for keeping the waters clean. The developing countries which face these Straits should not be further burdened with having to equip and maintain costly facilities for dealing with oil spills and extensive damage to fishing  sometimes for years. Nor should their polluted beach resorts  from which they earn a few tourist dollars  be cleaned entirely at their own expense. The ships generally belong to the rich and they must defray the cost  at least partially.105.	I have n these remarks focused on a number of broad issues affecting the United Nations  the Islamic world and the developing countries. However  I shall be failing in my duty in this general statement if I do not also touch upon certain other issues which are pertinent as Malaysia looks at current developments in the world.106.	Before doing so  however  may I take this opportunity  first of all  to express the appreciation of my delegation to the outgoing President  who carried out his tasks so admirably during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.107.	I would also wish to express from this rostrum  on behalf of the Government and the people of Malaysia  our warmest welcome and felicitations to the delegation of Brunei Darussalam as it takes its seat in the United Nationsâan event which has given us very special pleasure. Brunei Darussalam is a neighbour of Malaysia and a fellow member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]. Since 7 January this year  when Brunei Darussalam formally joined ASEAN as a full member  we have worked closely and amicably with it and we know that it will make many important and serious contributions to the work of the Organization. Malaysia looks forward to a future ci close and fruitful collaboration with Brunei Darussalam.108.	As we survey developments around the globe  we cannot but be filled with a sense of foreboding at the downward spiral of international understanding  of outrage at so much blatant injustice and even  alas  of cynicism at the wide gap between professions of principles and their practice.109.	Take the case of Palestine  which has been referred to for too long as an Arab-Israeli conflict.That is a deliberate misnomer  because the conflict is in essence and in reality an Israeli-Palestinian conflict  the root of which is the adamant denial by Israel of Palestinian nationhood. Of all those who insist on direct talks between the parties concerned  I ask: who are the parties but the Israelis and the Palestinians? Of all those who talk of democracy  freedom  self- determination and all the other lofty principles of justice and human rights  I ask: in the name of what can the people of Palestine be denied their right to their own independent homeland? Is it in the name of Israel's security  which can be ensured  in any event  in many other ways? Can this be seriously argued by countries which  at the same time  are vociferous in condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea? No. The fact is that the Palestinians are being denied their freedom because Israel wants it so and it has the support of a powerful ally to enforce its will. Let us avoid debating points. Let us avoid dredging up minutiae of history. This is the basic issue. Despite the clear will of the international community and the undeniable rights of the Palestinians  Israel adamantly and violently opposes Palestinian freedom. If another State were to do this  it would be rightly condemned  as Israel is by some  and rightly repudiated  as Israel is not  because of its powerful ally. And yet Israel and its friend attempt to portray it as the victim  the injured innocent.110.	Sometimes it is also said that the Palestinians  or more specifically the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  must first of all recognize Israelâand let us bear this m mindânot before Palestinian independence can be accepted  but before the PLO can be allowed to take part in any discussion on Palestine's future: an explicit recognition of Israel by the PLO  in return for which the PLO will be allowed an undefined seat in undefined negotiations about an undefined future for Palestine. This is insisted uponânever mind about the Fez resolution of the Arab Heads of State  never mind about the resolution of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  whose provisions about the security of all States in the Middle East are clear for all who wish to see. And yet  by the same token  have those supporters of Israel asked Israel for an explicit recognition of the PLO and for Palestinian freedom? The answer is no. Or even for an implicit recognition? Again  no. And  what is more  not only has Israel neither explicitly nor even implicitly recognized the PLO and Palestinian independence  it has quite explicitly and categorically rejected any possibility of dealing with the PLO or any prospect of Palestinian independence. In those circumstances  those who still point the finger of responsibility at the PLO cannot expect us to take them seriously. No doubt they have their own reasons for what they do  but they cannot expect us to believe that those reasons are remotely connected with any principle of democracy  justice or human rights.111.	As to southern Africa  how can we adequately express our outrage at the manner in which the rightsâand even the livesâof black Africans are being treated? At the risk of being misunderstood  I venture to suggest that if white people were treated by a black Government  or any Government for that matter  in the way that the black people of South Africa are being treated  the entire world would rise up and take decisive action. And yet what do we see? Certain countries press into service all manner of arguments under sophisticated labels  such as constructive engagement. They appeal for patience  they draw attention to practical realities and  in the case of Namibia  they even advance the almost incredible and totally irrelevant concept of ""linkage""âarguments which they themselves would not tolerate for one moment if the victims of this monstrosity that apartheid and the racist regime represent were whites. I urge those Governments to leap beyond oblique intellectualizing  beyond calculations of economics or power politics to understand that what is at stake is a moral issue. How can you support a Government whose philosophy is immoral and whose methods are brutal and cruel? How can you justify denying to the black people of South Africa a life of freedom and decency in their own land? History will judge you  and do not be outraged that  in the meantime  we are judging you too.112.	Looking elsewhere in the world  it is ironic to see in Afghanistan the contrast between professions of lofty principles and actual practice. In the name of good neighbourliness and fraternal relations  a vicious and bloody war is being inflicted on the people of Afghanistan. This violation  like any other violation of the independence and territorial integrity of a sovereign nation  must be resisted. Malaysia has therefore supported and will continue to support  in whatever practical way it can  the struggle of the valiant Afghan people for their freedom and honour. That is why we have given facilities for the mujahidin freedom fighters to have an office in Kuala Lumpur. That is why we continue to support the diplomatic efforts of the Secretary-General to seek a political solution to this problem. Faced with the might of stronger neighbours  small weak States need to know that the United Nations will not allow them to be trampled on by the boots of invading armies. Everything else must depend on this fundamental right to freedom and sovereignty.113.	Nearer to us in Malaysia  we see the same cynical manipulation of words such as self-determination and fraternal assistance and human rights in order to justify what cannot be justified  namely  the Vietnamese invasion and continuing occupation of Kampuchea. The ASEAN countries  which had offered a hand of friendship and co-operation to Viet Nam at the end of the Viet Nam war in 1975  have opposed and will continue to oppose this blatant violation of Kampuchea's independence and territorial integrity. The situation is ironic because Viet Nam  which once earned the high admiration of many for standing up in defiance and  finally  in triumph against overwhelming odds to uphold the right of the Vietnamese people to freedom in their own homeland  is committing now exactly what it had accused its adversaries of attempting to do: namely  the imposition of its will by armed might on a smaller and weaker country. This tragic irony is compounded by the fact that those of Viet Nam's neighbours which are members of ASEAN have categorically shown that they are fully ready to meet Viet Nam's legitimate security interest. A further irony is that the ASEAN countries had agreed in 1971 to the concept of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia and it is Viet Nam's continued occupation of Kampuchea which is the obstacle to the realization of a conflict-free neutral area untroubled by the rivalries of the major Powers  which Viet Nam also claims to be its objective.114.	The choice between conflict and co-operation is Viet Nam's. From the contacts and meetings  both public and private  that it has had with individual ASEAN countries  Viet Nam knows that ASEAN is flexible and sincere in its wish to bring the present conflict to an end  but ASEAN cannot and will not compromise with regard to the right of the Kampuchean people to choose their own form of Government free from any external coercion. We will stay the course. The position we have taken is not only in conformity with United Nations principles and relevant resolutions but offers a fair and honourable exit for Viet Nam. It is now up to Viet Nam to decide.115.	I would like to turn now to the subject of Antarctica  to which I feel compelled to refer as Malaysia was one of the sponsors requesting the inclusion of this item at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As we await the Secretary- General's study and the subsequent debate on this subject later during this session  I want to emphasize most of all that Malaysia approaches the forthcoming discussions with an open mind and with the hope that  by listening carefully to each other's concerns and views  we shall all be able to move forward together on this issue. I also want to stress that Malaysia raised this subject in a constructive spiritâ to build  not to destroy. We do not dispute the good that the present Antarctic Treaty system has done. But what we are seeking to build is a broader basis and a firmer foundation for international co-operation in Antarctica which would be acceptable to  and in the interest of  the international community as a whole and thus ensure the long-term stability and effectiveness of the system. We have an open mind as to how that can best be brought about. Of course we have some ideas of our own: in the particular circumstances of Antarcticaâa large land mass occupying some one tenth of the globe's land surface  situated in a strategic part of the world  with a fragile ecosystem and possessing rich marine and  possibly  mineral resources  a part of the world  moreover  with no settled inhabitants and where  indisputably  there is no recognition of the claims to sovereignty except between the seven claimantsâwe believe that there is at least a strong case for Antarctica to be in one way or another the common heritage of mankind.116.	But we are aware that there are practical and legal realities as well as a great deal in the way of national sensitivities which cannot simply be swept aside. The United Nations has only begun to consider this question of Antarctica and all of us will therefore need to proceed cautiously and carefully. Hence  whatever Malaysia's views may be  we will approach the forthcoming discussions with an open mind and sensitivity to the concerns  views and interests of other Member States. We earnestly urge a similar approach by all concerned. It is in that spirit that we have proposed the establishment of a special committee on the question of Antarctica. It can be expected that the discussions which will take place later during this session will not be conclusive. Such a committee should build upon the discussion in the General Assembly and examine the subject in greater depth so as to arrive at a consensus on the objectives of a regime in Antarctica and the machinery to achieve such an objective.117.	One matter that needs constant serious attention is the drug problem. As we are aware  the drug problem is international or global in character and knows no national boundaries. Thus  no country can handle this problem single-handed. It requires a serious and concerted effort at the international level by all countries and international agencies concerned.118.	The present co-operation at the international level has not resulted in much. There are many reasons for this  of which the lack of commitment and co-ordination among the various countries is a major factor. This lack of co-operation is due in part to the conflict of interest which may be commercial and economic in nature. It is also observed that some countries are reluctant to implement United Nations decisions relating to the prevention and control of narcotic drugs owing to various factors  including the lack of political will. This could also be because many countries do not consider their drug problems to be serious  partly because of their outlook and partly because their problems are small.119.	It should be noted that the drug problem not only brings with it criminal implications  but  if left unchecked  can weaken and eventually destroy the social and cultural fabrics of our societies. It also has security ramifications that can threaten the very survival of a nation. It is for this reason that Malaysia has adopted harsh laws to curb the drug menace. Other countries may take exception to these laws  but the best way they can help stop the harsh sentences on drug traffickers is by co-operating in the prevention of drug production and trafficking. We appeal to the world community truly to internationalize the prevention of drug trafficking.120.	I have  in these remarks  expressed my views openly and frankly. I do so because I take the United Nations seriously and I do not believe that the general debate at each session of the Assembly should be an exercise in platitudes or politeness. We must mean what we say  and say what we mean. I have tried to do that  although in doing so I may have caused some uncomfortable feelings. Only frankness  an open mind  a willingness to work hard on the details of issues and to accommodate other views and  above all  a firm commitment to the vision of the Charterâa world of peace  freedom  justice and human dignityâwill see us through the critical days that are upon us now. It is in that spirit that the Malaysian Government approaches its duties at  and to  the United Nations."
"99",5048,"NER",39,1984,"ï»¿The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly was concluded only a few days ago  under the distinguished presidency of Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  to whom  on behalf of the delegation of the Niger  I should like to pay a most sincere tribute for the dedication and skill with which he discharged his responsibilities  despite the constraints and numerous problems he encountered due to the high position he occupies in his country.190.	The unanimous will of this prestigious Assembly has given you  my dear brother Lusaka  the heavy responsibility of guiding the work of the thirty-ninth session. That choice does honour to you and your country  Zambia  and to our continent  Africa. We welcome that choice and wish to congratulate you most warmly.191.	I personally have had the great privilege of knowing you  Sir  for a long time here at the United Nations. Indeed  I have known you as a brother in our struggle  and I have been able to appreciate your great capacity for work and your deep knowledge of the functioning of the Organization. Humanism has characterized all your actions and the wisdom of each of your acts. It is by no means fortuitous that since 1979 you have been presiding over the United Nations Council for Namibia  which certainly would have carried out its historic task long ago if the manoeuvres and delaying tactics of those responsible for making decisions in the world had not time and again blocked your initiatives and your efforts. It is our hope that your spiritual and intellectual qualities will enable you successfully to carry out the new task entrusted to you. You may count on the constant support of my country's delegation.192.	I should like also  on behalf of President Seyni Kountche and the Government of the Niger  to convey to the Secretary-General our great appreciation of his tireless and diverse efforts in the service of the world since his election as head of the Organization. When he took office he devoted much study to the strengthening and renewal of the United Nations  and he has taken numerous initiatives since then; all of this deserves our appreciation and our support.193.	I wish finally to express to the State of Brunei Darussalamâwhich it has already been our great pleasure to welcome to membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference last January at Casablancaâthe warm congratulations of the Government and the people of the Niger on its admission to the United Nations.194.	The evaluation of the international situation given here at the thirty-eighth session on behalf of the Government of the Niger was not an optimistic one. The events we have already deplored and others that have occurred since that time have unfortunately not dispelled our apprehensions.195.	For years  the collective attention of the nations and Governments represented in this Hall has been focused on the continuing deterioration of the international situation and on its potential dangers for us all. But as though this were inevitableâ which makes one despair of human natureâthe situation seems to continue to deteriorate day by day  despite the considerable means at our disposal to establish the conditions for a better life on earth and to resolve all the problems facing today's world.196.	In South Africa  violence continues  and when I speak of violence I am not referring to the glorious spirit of revolt which increasingly rouses and encourages the blacks: I am referring to the savage  blind  continuous oppression which the whites of that country impose daily on those blacks  martyred by a despicable system which they are determined to combat and destroy. We in the Niger have been consistent on this issue  and we shall not change. As long as apartheid continues to humiliate and dehumanize our brothers  and as long as the white minority  with stupid stubbornness and perverse selfishness  continues to cling to this racist hydra  which holds it up to ridicule and makes it an international outlaw  we shall continue to fight this regime and shall refuse it any recognition as a part of mankind.197.	Similarly  the question of Namibia continues to be one of high priority for the United Nations. We have waited long  and we had long hoped that  thanks to efforts throughout the world  and particularly in the Security Council  this Territory  which is illegally occupied by South Africa  would achieve independence before 1984. Unfortunately  our faint warnings and the complacency which many of us have shown towards the minority racist regime of Pretoria have made it impossible thus far to attain that result. Today  the chances for success in achieving a negotiated settlement seem to be slimmer than ever. Therefore  the international community must react more firmly to South Africa's constant refusal to cooperate with the United Nations with a view to implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978).198.	I wish to reaffirm the Niger's active support for SWAPO  the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people  and for the national liberation movements of South Africa. We also assure the frontline States of our commitment to them. We express the hope that no respite will be given to the minority racist r6gime of Pretoria and that Africa  and the entire international community  will remain resolutely united in the face of South Africa's racist  colonial defiance.199.	But it is not only southern Africa which is a source of concern to the world today: in the Horn of Africa  instability has become endemic and has resulted in numbers of refugees never before seen by our continent. Peace there is exceedingly precarious  and war and famine have wrought ravages of which only the indifference of the media allows the broad masses to be unaware. To be sure  solutions have been sought  but these have apparently not been commensurate with the seriousness of the situation and the growing magnitude of events. The United Nations could still do more  and that is why we urge it to act vigorously.200.	In Chadâplunged into gloom and nearly destroyed by an excessively long and murderous warâwe must say that we begin to see a glimmer of hope in the comparative normalization  over a period of something more than two years  of the economic and social life of that country. The recent announcement of the withdrawal of foreign forces stationed on the territory of Chad gives rise to new optimismâto the extent  and only to the extent  that the commitments undertaken by the parties concerned are scrupulously observed  that any impulses to return in one or another guise are blocked or avoided  and that neither the territorial integrity nor the sovereignty of this fraternal country are compromised or crushed in the course of this operation. We have always said and reiterated that  in our view  the solution to the problem of Chad is a matter for our brothers in Chad alone  free from all expansionist  annexationist  ideological and colonialist designs. Today  more than ever  we maintain that position.201.	With regard to Western Sahara  we cannot but deplore the damage done to the OAU by this question  on which Africa has laboured so long at councils of ministers and at summit conferences  out of which the mere mention outside of such meetings gives rise only to delays and confusion. We in the Niger take it as given that the right of the Saharan people to self-determination must be respected and that the full implementation of the resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX)  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983âin favour of which my country voted unreservedly and without any ulterior motivesâmust constitute a decisive step in the right direction 202.	Since you too  Mr. President  are an African brother  this may be the place to express our regret that in a continent such as ours  where the structural weakness of our States should in the normal course of events strengthen our collective devotion to the ideals of dialogue  tolerance and peace  a mere transitory disagreement on one question or another should paralyse us and eclipse our greatest achievements and the joint efforts we should be making to help each other rehabilitate ourselves after centuries of foreign domination. What a catastrophe for mankind and for the world it would be if  for lack of consensusâon the question of disarmament  for exampleâthe next General Assembly session should be adjourned or jeopardized203.	Therefore  the Niger here appeals to Africa to do all in its power to save its prestige and its place in the world by saving the OAU  that is  by fulfilling its duties of cohesion  solidarity and unity.204.	Despite the constant preoccupation by the United Nations with the establishment of a stable order in the Middle East  and despite all the efforts that have been made to that end by each of our States  the situation in that part of the world remains explosive. Israel persists in occupying Arab territory and carrying out acts of aggression and sabotage against its neighbours. The Palestinian people is still waiting for the international community to redress the injustice from which it has suffered for many years now and to ensure thereby the recovery of its inalienable national rights.205.	The establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is an obligation of the United Nations and is in keeping with the vital interests of world peace  Therefore  it is indispensable that we continue to seek  under the auspices of the Organization  the beginning of an active process of negotiations in order to achieve a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis. And this is an appropriate time to stress that  to be just and lasting  the peace we are seeking must be based on the following principles  which have already been repeated time and again: the inadmissibility of the occupation of territory by force  and hence Israel's unconditional withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem; recognition of the Palestinian people's right to return  to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State in its homeland  Palestine  under the leadership of the PLO; and  finally  the Ml and total participation of the PLO in any peace process.206. At this stage  I would assure the martyred Palestinian people and battered Lebanon  as well as all the brother Arab countries of the battlefield  of the unswerving and active support of the Government till people of the Niger. The Niger  as is wed known  spares no effort to ensure the triumph of justice and right in that part of the world.207. When speaking of peace  how can we forget the war that has been raging for four years now between Iran and Iraq? The great loss of human life and the considerable material damage caused by this war to both sides and the disturbances it has created in international maritime navigation  and hence in international trade  call for energetic action by the community of nations to put an urgent end to hostilities. The efforts undertaken to that end are highly commendable  and they must be encouraged and stepped up. I have in mind particularly the efforts undertaken in the framework of the Islamic Peace Committee  those initiated within the framework of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the initiatives of the Security Council and the Secretary-General.208.	We note also  with great anguish and concern  other hotbeds of tension  particularly in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  two independent and sovereign countries  Members of the United Nations and members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  that have been struggling for many years now against foreign occupation. The Niger calls for the speedy implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolutions  which call  in particular  for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of those two countries and for respect for their independence and their status as non-aligned States.209.	I have in mind also the Korean peninsula  a hotbed of great tension  which today is divided as a result of the vicissitudes of history  but whose people aspire to national reunification. In the spirit of the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972  we encourage and support the efforts to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to this problem.210.	To sum up  everywhere in the world our action must be designed to encourage and systematize recourse to peaceful means for the settlement of disputes between States and to cultivate patiently and staunchly the spirit of detente and peaceful coexistence among all nations. That is one of the most reliable ways of making an effective contribution to the achievement of peace in the world  the highest aspiration of the peoples we represent.211.	Along with these many conflict situations  the world is also facing a severe economic crisis  which has had adverse effects on all our countries  particularly the developing ones. The drop in the prices of primary commodities  the decrease in development aid  the difficulties of access to international capital markets  the generalized monetary disorder caused  in particular  by the rampaging dollar  the high interest rates  the dizzying rise of public debt servicing  and the increase of protectionism have created an untenable situation in many developing countries.212.	The indicators in this regard are alarming. In 1981 the gross national product of the developing countries  taken as a whole  increased to only 1.5 per cent. In 1982 this rate fell still further. The per capita growth rate was therefore negative. Today the total foreign debt of those countries is more than $900 billion. The prices of their primary commodities  on the exporting of which many of them still depend  have fallen  In real value  to the lowest level since 1945  Thus  according to statistics famished by UNCTAD  in 1981 and 1982 the non-oil-exporting developing countries cost $34 billion as a result of the deterioration of their terms of exchange. Today the figure is probably close to $70 billion or $80 billion.213.	The situation of the African countries  on which I should like to dwell  is even more drastic. The years 1982 and 1983 were  as noted by experts of the Economic Commission for Africa  years of crisis for the African continent. Global production of goods and services was in a state of stagnation in 1982 and  contrary to forecasts  the growth rate for 1983 was very low; it was estimated at only 0.2 per cent as compared to 1982. Hence  since 1980  there has been a continued decrease  in absolute terms  of about 10 per cent per year in the per capita production in our continent.214.	The significant drop in their rates of exchange  together with other factors linked to the international markets  has slowed down or stopped the process of development in many African countries  whose ability to meet their investment needs has considerably decreased. It is no exaggeration to say that many of our countries now work solely to pay their debts  to survive or to try to manage their meagre gains. At the same time  the food situation of the continent has dangerously deteriorated not only because of the low level of agricultural production and discouraging problems in the rural areas  but also because of the unceasing drought besetting entire regions  particularly the Sahel. Thus  the food situation remains precarious in at least 24 African countries stricken by draught.215.	The Secretary-General  who visited the countries of the Sahel last January  brought back most useful information on the effects of the drought on human beings  on cattle and on the ecosystem. While he noted that after the terrible drought of the years 1970-1973  which caused considerable damage to the Sahel as a whole  commendable efforts had been made by the Governments of the countries concerned to replenish their decimated livestock and to lay down a real agricultural policy both at the national and the regional levels  he also had to note that those countries have not really pained anything yet; the paucity of their gains is quite obvious  not only because of climatic disasters and the adverse effects of desertification  but also because of the present serious international situation  which makes any real continuity in the majority of their development programmes impossible.216.	We are grateful to him for the attention he has given to our problems and in particular for the structures he decided to set up immediately both here and at Nairobi in order to follow developments in the situation in Africa. However  we know that the scope of the situation goes beyond his efforts and the means currently available to the United Nations family  whose resources are dwindling and drying up.217.	What we need is a global effort that requires the organization of a dynamic chain of international solidarity to assist the millions of men  women and children threatened by hunger  thirst  disease and death. We must also give these States the means to assume their duty of participating in the maintenance of balance in societies and world peace. Continuing to ignore their present difficulties could lead to explosive situations which would then have to be settled by perhaps asking the world to come together as a matter of emergency to assess and redress the damage caused by its own selfishness and uncaring attitude. Africa is indeed an interval put of tins planet. We must not be indifferent to its current difficulties and deficiencies.2I8. After all  this great and beautiful continent cannot be considered indefinitely as a continent of famine and hunger  of disasters and victims  of poverty and the poor  of incurable suffering and unremitting problems. After having been the cradle of mankind  it is still capable of great fruitfulness  which will one day undoubtedly benefit all peoples and all nations.219. It is therefore high time to act resolutely to stop the continuing fragmentation of the world economy and to cure those ills from which the most disadvantaged countries suffer. Any salutary action implies greater justice in trade relations  stabilization of the prices of raw materials  judicious monetary reform  a courageous solution to the debt problem of the third world  increased development aidâin brief  the search for ways and means to achieve the establishment of a new international economic order.220.	In May 1980  during a seminar organized here jointly by UNITAR  the Centre for Economic and Social Studies in the Third World and the Club of Rome  I stressed that ""... the violations of the dignity of man that arise from unjust poverty and destitution and the intense feelings of frustration that come from the wrongful distribution of the wealth of the earth intensify dissension among peoples and lead to confrontation and war between nations"".221.	We must put an end to this state of affairs if we really wish to contribute to harmony among men and to give a gathering such as ours the greatest meaning and effect possible on the course of the world and full credibility in the eyes of all the men  women and children who are waiting expectantlyâ they know not for whatâbut who are nevertheless waiting.222.	President Seyni Kountche would have come here personally and in his capacity as acting Chairman of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel [CILSS] had not the most catastrophic harvests the Niger has ever known obliged him to remain with his people to share their concerns  calm their fears and actively consider with them the measures to be implemented in order to save our herdsmen and our brave peasants  who are the victims of a combination of unfortunate factors and who have been deprived of the harvests they justly expected from their hard work. On his behalf and on behalf of all the CILSS countries  it is therefore my pressing duty to remind all Governments and institutions represented here that they must act in solidarity with regard to this situation."
"100",5093,"NGA",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation fully shares in the accolades and warm sentiments expressed by preceding speakers on your personal ability  competence and well-known achievements as an outstanding diplomat and untiring fighter for peace and freedom  I pay tribute to your dedicated service in the cause of the United Nations as the indefatigable President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and also to the consistent voice and role of your country in the common search for regional and global peace  justice and understanding. I feel confident that under your wise and able guidance this session will witness movement in most of the issues before the Assembly. It is therefore with great pleasure that I pledge to you the full support and co-operation of the delegation of Nigeria in the discharge of your difficult task.94.	Permit me also to pay tribute to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of Panama  for the skilful manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly.95.	My gratitude also goes to our distinguished Secretary-General for his work on behalf of the Organization in the cause of world peace and for persistently drawing attention to the economic problems confronting the world  and particularly the economic problems of Africa.96.	We welcome Brunei Darussalam to the comity of nations. Its admission as the 159th Member of the United Nations stands out as a reaffirmation of the principles of universality and self-determination  which constitute the corner-stones of the Organization. Nigeria extends its hand of goodwill to the new Member of this body and looks forward to working closely with Brunei Darussalam in the promotion of peace  progress  and economic and social justice in the world.97.	The world is today gripped by fear and uncertainties arising from an unprecedented degree of tension in relations between the super-Powers and their allies. In particular  the unending cycle of the growing military competition between the superpowers has led to a new round of deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe  feverish work on new systems of strategic nuclear weapons and intensified research into anti-satellite weapons. Ominous calls for the fresh accumulation of chemical weapons are being made by the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a manner that is certain further to hinder the negotiations on a convention on chemical weapons. The result of this intensified competition is reflected in the enormous sum of almost $700 billion  which represents world military expenditure for 1983. All this race to destruction is proceeding notwithstanding the existing arsenals of the two super-Powers  which are enough to create a nuclear winter that will engulf both the northern and southern hemispheres and perhaps end all civilization. It is no longer only the imagination of those whom some may call alarmists but also the well-documented research of eminent scientists that have shown the possibility that up to half of humanity may be the immediate victim of a major nuclear war. The other half will  to a lesser or greater extent  become secondary victims sooner or later. What is sure is that there will be no hiding place for any of us even though we have no part in  and indeed have continued to warn against  this irrational diversion of human and material resources for the accumulation of these terrible weapons of destruction.98.	For us in Africa it is particularly painful that this unprecedented threat to the existence of humanity coupled with greater diversion of resources should coincide with Africa's acute economic crisis. Natural calamities such as the widespread and persistent drought  the destabilizing policies of the apartheid regime of South Africa in relation to its neighbours  and the world economic recession  with the attendant selfish policies of the industrialized countries  have combined to produce a desperate economic condition  which alarmed the Secretary-General when he visited some African countries at the beginning of the year. True to his vocation  he immediately called the attention of the international community to the explosive situation and set up a high-powered group to make specific recommendations.99.	The current economic crisis in Africa has its immediate as well as its medium- and long-term dimensions. The emergency aspect emanates mainly from the devastating impact of the drought  which within the last decade has progressively spread to areas hitherto not affected by it. The prolonged drought has exacerbated the already inadequate food situation in the region. Over the years  food production has lagged behind the increase in population  and by 1983 the drought-stricken countries were importing over 28.7 million tons of cereals  as against only 4 million tons in 1970.100.	In addition to the climatic disaster suffered by African countries  there has been the profound impact of the adverse economic recession on the region. As the most exposed in the world  because of its unusually high degree of dependence on external sources for almost all critical and essential input for development activities  the African economy has been the principal victim of the global recession. The export earnings of African countries have tumbled with the collapse of commodity prices. The stagnation and decline in official development assistance in real terms and the increasing privatization of capital flows have hit Africa hardest  while escalating debt and debt-servicing and unprecedentedly high interest rates have spelt financial disaster for most of the countries of the continent.101.	Recognizing that the primary responsibility for the development of their economies rests on themselves  African countries have looked inwards and  at the tenth meeting of the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  held in May 1984  their Ministers of economic development and planning formulated and adopted a Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis 6 which is a framework for action for dealing with the crisis in its emergency  short-  medium- and long-term dimensions. This was closely followed by the Conference of African Ministers of Finance  held at Addis Ababa from 18 to 20 June 1984  during which the Addis Ababa Declaration on Africa's External Indebtedness was adopted10 to focus special attention on the region's growing external debt of over $ 150 billion and to suggest ways to address the problem concretely.102.	Africa is not alone in feeling the crushing impact of the severe debt crisis. Most developing countries have had to bear the same burden. The huge size of the debt of the developing countries and its impact on their economies make it imperative for the international community  as well as the international financial institutions  to address the subject with urgency and great imagination. In this connection  we recognize the important role of the IMF in helping members cope with their balance-of-payments problems. However  in so doing  the IMF should endeavour to show greater flexibility in its approach when prescribing adjustment programmes for each country.103.	Unfortunately  the experiences of several developing countries  including my own that have had to resort to the IMF have shown a certain deliberate insensitivity on its part to the possible consequences of its prescribed package as the price for its loan. Let me hasten to say that the present military regime in Nigeria accepts  and has indeed taken the initiative in instituting  realistic sacrifices to turn back the slide in the economy. However  such sacrifices must be within tolerable economic and social limits. The application of the IMF's conditions is unfortunately rather stereotyped and should be reviewed with the objective of paying more attention than ever before to the underlying circumstances of each State  in order to prevent severe and avoidable unrest stemming from the corrective measures and to provide the stability necessary for the achievement of the State's domestic economic  social and political goals. It is a bad doctor indeed who prescribes the same medicine for all his patients  irrespective of their ailments. This is what the IMF has been doing.104.	As we observe the world economic situation unfold  what emerges for most developing countries  particularly African countries  is that prospects of significant progress are extremely bleak. Even though it is being said that recovery by most industrialized countries from the recent global economic recession has manifested itself and taken hold  we must continue to ask when the light at the end of the dark economic tunnel will appear for developing countries. It is now clear that recovery in other regions does not necessarily produce a positive impetus or act as a catalyst  even in tentative forms  for economic development in developing countries  because of the fundamental barriers to their participation in international economic activities.105.	We cannot run away from the truth that for genuine economic recovery to take place in the world there must be willingness on the part of all members of the international community to redress those structural imbalances that contribute and condemn African and other developing countries to a life of poverty and economic underdevelopment.106.	The only way that vigorous global economic growth can be achieved and sustained over time is by the active participation of all countries  developed and developing  in mutually beneficial and equal partnership in global economic processes and activities. This calls for the adoption and the faithful implementation of a package of measures  both short- and long-term  which truly respond to the needs of all countries and regions  and of developing countries in particular. There must be a deliberate attempt and effort to resist the growing tendency to resort to protectionism  in the interests of a truly free world trade. The drift from the multilateral spirit must be arrested. We cannot reduce international relations increasingly to the bilateral level in a tumultuous world such as this one. Let us bear in mind that universal understanding and willingness to co-operate have beenâand still can beâan engine for so much change and so much good. We must not  therefore  wittingly or unwittingly  turn our backs on this rich heritage and reservoir of multilateral partnership which holds so much hope for our universe. We must return to the spirit of co-operation which is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.107.	It is for this reason that Nigeria  along with other members of the Group of 77  has consistently underscored the necessity for a global dialogue that will lead to reform of the structural imbalance which lies at the heart of the global economic malaise. My Government strongly believes that  until the structural imbalance in the economic relations between countries is redressed  friction and ill-will will remain to trouble and undermine the real and steady growth of the world economy. It is  therefore  unfortunate that  in spite of almost five years of strenuous efforts  nothing positive has taken place to permit the launching of the global negotiations. My delegation appeals to the Assembly to live up to the spirit of the Charter and embark on a course that will permit the early launching of genuine negotiations  so as to accelerate the attainment of the new international economic order.108.	The situation in southern Africa  particularly the question of apartheid and the issue of the independence of Namibia  is as explosive as ever. The inhuman system of apartheid  which is at the heart of the southern African problem  continues to thrive and to develop deep roots  partly through the manoeuvres of the apartheid regime  but also thanks to the support of certain Members of the United Nations. Those Member States  which profess a commitment to freedom and human rights and which therefore  should be in the vanguard of the struggle to eliminate apartheid  have unfortunately chosen to appease and reinforce that inhuman system through their open collaboration with it. How else are we to interpret the visit by the leader of the apartheid regime to Portugal  Belgium  the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom and the warm reception accorded to him? By their action  these countries have helped Botha to break out of the isolation to which the international community had condemned him and his inhuman regime.109.	There seems to be a well-orchestrated attempt to hoodwink the world about a non-existent process of democratization in South Africa. It is a strange democracy which enshrines in its constitution the exclusion from the electoral process of 23 million blacks  who constitute over 73 per cent of the population. We are therefore not surprised that the Coloureds and the Asians  whom the apostles of apartheid tried to delude  saw through the mask and massively boycotted the elections in their separate assemblies. That was an eloquent verdict on the so-called constitutional reform. The non-white people of South Africa have refused to be fooled. The international community has endorsed their judgement and unreservedly condemned this chicanery. However  the international community should go further and totally reject the deceptive image of peace-maker in southern Africa which South Africa tries so hard to project. By a sheer war of attrition  by aggression  by sabotage and by every conceivable means of destabilization  South Africa has succeeded in forcing unequal agreements on some of its neighbours. Even as the General Assembly is in session  the apartheid regime is continuing to exert pressure on Lesotho to enter into a defence pact with it.110.	South Africa is unrelenting in its bellicose posture  its subversion and its expansionist policies. Its post-Nkomati tactic has been to deceive the other party to the so-called non-aggression pact. In spite of that pact  South Africa has surreptitiously strengthened the Mozambique National Resistance Movement. The consequence of this has been an increase of pressure on the Government of Mozambique and the stage-managing of another sham truce. Last week's scenario  which was intended to create a cease-fire  was hypocritical and clearly promoted South Africa's ultimate objective of destabilization of the entire region. The world community must not allow an illegitimate regime  which tortures  dehumanizes  denationalizes and engages in numerous other atrocities against humanity  to assume for itself the mantle of a regional peace-maker and peace- broker.111. The Government of Nigeria calls upon the international community to play a decisive role in the liquidation of apartheid. This is an inescapable obligation to Africa and to the world as a whole. Nigeria wants to make it abundantly clear that appeasement  concession and accommodation will only set back the clock of progress towards the final liquidation of apartheid.112.	Let South Africa be warned that  notwithstanding the millions of dollars spent on subverting and misleading world public opinion and the world's conscience  one thing is certain: it will not get away with its heinous crimes against humanity.113.	Let the international community bear in mind that in this age of global interdependence no one will be spared the consequences of a racial war in southern Africa. Let the world know that history will not fail to record the Western world's unpardonable neglect of its responsibility to Africa  to the international community and to the United Nations over this issue of apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa.114.	Nigeria has always been in the forefront of the struggle to wipe out apartheid. The present federal Government  in its determination to explore new ways to combat apartheid  sponsored  together with the Special Committee against Apartheid  a Seminar on the Legal Status of the Apartheid Regime and Other Legal Aspects of the Struggle against Apartheid  held at Lagos from 13 to 16 August 1984. The seminar brought together jurists and social scientists representing the main legal systems all over the world.115.	In its Declaration  the seminar concluded that the institution and operation of apartheid made the South African Government a colonial regime; that its constitution  unique in the world  excluded the overwhelming majority from the exercise of sovereignty  specifically because they were of indigenous origin. Thus  the 23 million Africans in South Africa  representing 73 per cent of the population  have been treated as a colonialized people since the Union of South Africa was created in 1910. The seminar accepted that apartheid  the most monstrous form of racial dis-crimination  which also contains elements of genocide  constituted a special case of the violation of jus cogens. Moreover  the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid  adopted in 1973  linked that crime to a serious threat to international peace and security and imposed international criminal responsibility on all who committed the crime of apartheid and their accomplices. The seminar agreed that the General Assembly  speaking for the international community  was entitled to proclaim the South African regime as having placed itself in a situation of illegality. By its persistent violation of jus cogens  the South African regime has therefore isolated itself from the system of fundamental values which constitute the very essence of the international community. A State Member of the United Nations which has placed itself in a situation of illegality could be and should be expelled from the Organization.116.	Those are the conclusions of eminent jurists from all over the world. The General Assembly must take appropriate action.117.	Fourteen years ago  the Assembly rejected the credentials of South Africa because those who purported to represent that country were in fact unrepresentative. Ten years ago  the General Assembly adopted resolution 3207 (XXIX)  in which it called upon the Security Council ""to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""118.	The Security Council considered in depth the request of the General Assembly  and it was clear that the overwhelming majority of members concluded that the application of Article 6 of the Charter of the United Nations was the answer. A draft resolution to that effect was  most unfortunately  vetoed by three permanent members of the CouncilâFrance  the United Kingdom and the United States. Thus  the apartheid regime continues to enjoy the honour of membership of an organization whose basic norms it violates. With a solid legal opinion to proceed upon  the United Nations should now be in a position to rid itself  once and for all  of this canker. The time for the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations is overdue.119.	Another component of the problem of southern Africa is the issue of the independence of Namibia. The efforts of the international community to achieve independence for Namibia have been consistently frustrated by the intransigence of South Africa  through the introduction of extraneous considerations. Recently we have witnessed nefarious attempts by the South African regime to settle the Namibian question outside the framework of the United Nations. The question of Namibia is a classic case of decolonization  falling squarely within the purview of the United Nations; therefore  any attempt to bring about the independence of Namibia outside the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes a serious challenge to the international community and must not be allowed to succeed; otherwise  we shall be abdicating our responsibility towards the oppressed people of Namibia.120.	My Government totally rejects the pernicious attempts to establish a link between the withdrawal of Cuban defensive forces in Angola and the independence of Namibia. The United Nations must take positive action to end South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and bring about the immediate and unconditional implementation of resolution 435 (1978).121.	Turning to the Middle East  we note with regret that the situation today remains as volatile as it has been in previous years. The question of Palestine  which is the core of the problem  has so far defied a just  equitable and comprehensive solution  owing largely to the continued intransigence of Israel and the total support which it receives from the United States.122.	The international community has in the recent past witnessed the futility of attempting to find a military solution or of imposing a lopsided superpower solution to the Middle East problem. The invasion of Lebanon by Israel in 1982 and the tragic failure of the ill-advised mission of the so-called multinational force in Lebanon are both classic examples of the limits to the use of military power.123.	The solution lies in a negotiated peace  a peace that is just  equitable and fair  a peace that recognizes the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination  to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State in Palestine. The United Nations has already called for such a negotiated peace. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  called among other things for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. Such a conference should include the Palestinians themselves  the other interested parties in the region  the Soviet Union and the United States. We strongly support that proposal and call upon the United Nations to convene such a conference without further delay. We also call upon the international community and upon all concerned  particularly Israel and its supporters  to respond positively to this challenge of peace  under the auspices of the United Nations. To conclude in advance that such a conference will be unfair to any of the parties is to underrate the determination of the United Nations to find a permanent solution to this problem.124.	The situation in Kampuchea also remains troubling. We urge the Secretary-General and the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea to redouble their efforts to find a comprehensive political solution to the problem. Such a solution should be based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations which call for respect for national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity for all States  non-recourse to the threat or use of force in international relations  and the peaceful settlement of disputes. On this basis  my delegation supports the relevant General Assembly resolution on Kampuchea   which called  among other things  for the convening of an international conference on Kampuchea  with the participation of all the conflicting parties and other interested parties  with the aim of finding a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We also strongly support the call for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and for the strict observance of fundamental human rights  which should lead to the holding of United Nations supervised free elections that will enable the people of Kampuchea to exercise their right of self- determination and restore peace and stability to the region.125.	The unsettled political situation in almost every part of the world is unfortunate evidence of the persistent violation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  whose fortieth anniversary we plan to commemorate next year. Whether in southern Africa or the Middle East  whether in South-East Asia or Central America  whether in Korea or Cyprus  the resort to force or the threat of the use of force  the violation of the right of self-determination and the violation of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States continue to pose a severe threat to international peace and security. But much more alarming is the escalation of the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race.126.	The world  which is our common heritage  is being ominously imperilled by the nuclear-arms race  which has become the pastime of a few countries. There is great apprehension  which is fast becoming panic that the world is on the brink of a catastrophe of immense and universal proportions arising from the unprecedented nuclear rivalry of the two superpowers. No country can afford to be unconcerned about the present precarious situation  which may give the super-Powers and their allies cause for doctrinal or strategic satisfaction but which for the rest of the world evokes a constant nightmare. The concept of security  in the eyes of the super-Powers  is unfortunately related to the narrow interests of their alliances. The rest of the world is expected to feel secure as long as the two super-Powers continue their nuclear balancing act in the name of the doctrine of deterrence.127.	The fact that the need to ensure peace and security globally may be unrelated to the level of nuclear armament is totally ignored by the superpowers in their pursuit of the ever-elusive parity in nuclear-weapons deployment. Yet  as the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries stated during their Seventh Conference  held at New Delhi in March 1983  it is unacceptable that the security of all States and the very survival of mankind should be held hostage to the security interests of a handful of nuclear-weapon States. Nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war must therefore remain a priority task for the international community  particularly at this time when detente has collapsed and confrontation has become the watchword of the super-Powers. The General Assembly must insist that active negotiations on nuclear disarmament be resumed at the bilateral level between the super-Powers. The Assembly should also deplore the hindrances being placed in the way of meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament.128.	In this connection  Nigeria believes that the super-Powers must show determination to undertake the most basic step towards the non-proliferation  both vertical and horizontal  of nuclear weapons. Over the years  such a basic step has been identified as the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test- ban treaty. It is already 21 years since the conclusion of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water "" in which the parties expressed the objective of ""Seeking to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time"". The General Assembly has since made the achievement of the test-ban treaty the topmost priority. All the technical studies that can facilitate the conclusion of such an agreement have been undertaken. Yet no progress has been made. The vital missing element is the political will on the part of some nuclear-weapon States to reach an agreement. Yet it must be made clear that those who obstruct the conclusion of a nuclear-test-ban treaty cannot at the same time claim to be the champions of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. For so long as they show unwillingness to honour their commitment under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons whereby they undertook ""to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament ..."" for so long will they constitute impediments to an effective non-proliferation regime. If the viability of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is to be maintained  the nuclear-weapon States must  in the course of this session of the General Assembly  commit themselves firmly to negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.129.	It is clear from all available evidence that the only effective defence against nuclear weapons is never to use them; any use would constitute the greatest crime against humanity. To that end  the decision of the General Assembly with regard to negotiations on a convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons should be pursued with the utmost vigour. Any obstacle placed in the way of the work of the Conference on Disarmament in this respect should be seen as a great disservice to the maintenance of international peace and security. Similarly  negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and on a convention on chemical weapons should be an urgent concern of the international community . Progress in these areas is of the utmost importance for global security.130.	I have highlighted some of the major problems facing the international community today in the belief that we can honestly work together to solve them. The United Nations serves as a unique forum for the promotion of understanding and peace among all nations. It also provides a unique opportunity for Member States to engage in constructive dialogue and co-operation in our common quest for a better world. We must  therefore  strive to work together to uphold the principles of the Charter in the interest of mankind. I am confident that  with determination and given the necessary political will  we can overcome all obstacles in the way of lasting international peace and security and the achievement of an equitable international economic order."
"101",5139,"NIC",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Nicaraguan delegation  Sir  I should like to express our satisfaction at your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We also extend a brotherly welcome to the people and Government of Brunei Darussalam on the occasion of its entry into the community of independent nations.3.	The United Nations came into being as a result of the cry of the peoples of the world  who  tired of wars  exploitation and extermination  sought an organization that would help them to combat and fend off the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.4.	No one can fail to recognize United Nations efforts in defence of peace  justice  freedom and the independence of peoples. But  most unfortunately for mankind  there are policies  backed up by nuclear weapons  which blackmail  threaten  and attack the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. There are those that are characterized by their defiance  mockery and undermining of resolutions of the Organization. There are those that have defended actions that are shocking in their irrationality and threaten the future of mankind.5.	In Asia  Africa  the Middle East  Latin America and Central America  such policies are characterized by the use of force and disregard the nature of the historical problems affecting the peoples of those regions. They are aimed at solving social and economic problems by killing the hungry and ensuring the maintenance of the status of the privileged minorities. These policies ignore the economic crisis affecting the peoples and are based on a theory of natural selection which clearly favours the most powerful and accelerates the arms race.6.	This explains why they continue to oppose those who demand immediate collective action in search of solutions to economic problems  that is  those who are really fighting for peace and development.7.	Nicaragua has been a victim of such a policy since the last century and throughout this century  with its legacy of backwardness  brutal exploitation and absence of justice and freedomâin short  the absence of democracy. Such was the Scmoza dictatorship  the last monstrous offspring of this policy. Today Nicaragua is free and for the first time in its history is building an authentic democracy  becoming an example of patriotism  nationalism  independence and non-alignment. This is not to the liking of the United States authorities.8.	When Nicaragua condemns the South African regime for its racist policies and for subjugating those who should be the rightful rulers of that land  it is not to the liking of the United States.9.	When Nicaragua voices its solidarity with Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Mozambique  Seychelles  Swaziland and Zambia  as well as with the African National Congress of South Africa and with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States.10.	When Nicaragua demands Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the occupied territories and the right of the Palestinians to exist as a people and nation  recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as their only representative  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.11.	When Nicaragua reaffirms its solidarity with the people and the Government of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  when we condemn the policy of provocation against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and when we express our support for the just cause of the people of East Timor  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.12.	When Nicaragua condemns the policy of aggression against Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  when we support the reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea  and when we support an end to military manoeuvres and shows of force  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.13.	Nor is it to the liking of the United States Government that Nicaragua defends Puerto Rico's right to self-determination and independence  the return of Guantanamo to its legitimate owners  an end to threats to Cuba's integrity  the sovereignty of the Argentine people and nation over the Malvinas  and the complete implementation of the Panama treaties and an end to attacks launched from United States bases there against the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean.14.	When Nicaragua condemns the brutal coup against democracy in Chile and at the same time supports the right of the Chilean people to re-establish their basic freedoms  it is not to the liking of the United States Government. 15.	When Nicaragua condemns the heinous crime committed in the name of freedom against the people of Grenada and demands the withdrawal of foreign occupation troops so that the Grenadian people can exercise their right to self-determination  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.16.	When Nicaragua supports a negotiated  peaceful settlement to the conflict in El Salvador  which the Salvadorian people themselves must settle  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.17.	When Nicaragua supports democratic change in Latin America as a first step in solving the problems faced by our peoples  this  too  is not to the liking of the United States Government.18.	Nicaragua rejects the dismemberment of the State of Cyprus and the proclamation of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  and defends the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of this fellow non-aligned nation.19.	Nicaragua reaffirms its support for Bolivia's efforts to regain direct access to the Pacific Ocean.20.	Nicaragua is also saddened by the confrontation between two non-aligned nationsâIran and Iraqâ and demands an end to the use of chemical weapons; we support attempts to reach a just and honourable solution to this conflict.21.	Because Nicaragua wants peace  justice  freedom and democracy for the world  we shall continue to be non-aligned  even though this is not to the liking of the United States authorities.22.	Because Nicaragua wants peace  justice  freedom and democracy for the peoples of the world  we shall continue to condemn colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism  apartheid and racism and we shall continue to support just causes around the world  even though this may not be to the liking of the United States authorities and even though it means more sacrifice  suffering  threats and extermination for the heroic people of Sandino.23.	Forty years ago  all humanity celebrated the end of a nightmare. Five years were enough to witness all the horrors of fascism  which far surpassed Dante's inferno. But today  our country  Nicaragua  a small nation of only 3 million people  is the victim of a policy of extermination manifested over the past three years and eight months in the form of a war of overt aggression which the aggressor calls covert.24.	That policy is manifested when the United States Administration provides millions of dollars to go on murdering the peoples of Nicaragua and El Salvador; when it debates the irresponsibility of the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] in not having informed the Senate Intelligence Committee in advance about the mining of Nicaraguan ports rather than debate the terrorist act of laying the mines; when United States Army helicopters and United States citizensâalso casualties of this interventionist policyâhave fallen in our country; when children  women  teachers and doctors are murdered and the people's production  schools and food stocks are destroyed; when the decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague and United Nations resolutions are rejected  with the United States deeming itself judge and executioner of the nations of the earth. This entails a violation of the United States' own internal legislation and of international law.25.	Nicaragua wishes to reaffirm before the Assembly its belief in the validity of the Charter of the United Nations and its willingness to resolve peacefully international situations and conflicts through the means established in the Charter and under international law  prominent among which is the right to petition the International Court of Justice at The Hague.26.	That is why we have been making countless efforts on behalf of peace for the people of Nicaragua and the peoples of Central America. That is why Nicaragua turned to the International Court of Justice  whose order of 10 May 1984 could not have been clearer in ordering the United States Government to halt immediately military and paramilitary actions against Nicaragua  because these constitute clear and serious violations of international law and of Nicaragua's right to determine freely its own future. Its disdain and contempt of the Court's ruling were condemned by the international community.27.	In fact  everything indicates that these efforts and Nicaragua's unwavering willingness to achieve peace are not respected by the United States Government  which has been escalating its military and economic aggression against Nicaragua. To each peace initiative by Nicaragua and the Contadora Group  the United States Government has responded with terrorist attacks  the installation of military bases and a whole infrastructure for unleashing direct  massive military action against Nicaragua.28.	For almost two years  the member countries of the Contadora Group have been making a noble and serious effort to promote peace in Central America. This effort has enjoyed broad support from the whole world  including the Security Council and the General Assembly. As a result of that work  on 7 September 1984  the Contadora Group presented to the Central American Governments the revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.29.	Now it is for the Central American Governments and the United States Governmentâwhose involvement in the conflict cannot be denied by anyoneâto state clearly and definitively their positions. Nicaragua has already done so. On 21 September  we officially communicated to the Governments of the Contadora countries our decision to sign the Contadora Act immediately without amendments or changes of any kind  exactly as it was drawn up by the Contadora Group.30.	Today  before the Assembly  before the conscience of the world  we solemnly reaffirm Nicaragua's decision  and we call on the leaders of the countries of Central America to join us in supporting the Act  in the interest of the peace and tranquillity of our peoples. At the same time  we applaud the support given to the Act by the Governments of the member States of the European Community and by Spain and Portugal at the Conference of Foreign Ministers held at San Jose on 28 and 29 September.31.	The United States authorities have said they support Contadora. Their diplomats have tirelessly travelled around our region and the world claiming they defend those negotiations and peace. The international community has the right to expect the United States Government to support the Contadora Act unconditionally by immediately voicing its willingness to sign the Additional Protocol to the Act.32.	The winds now blowing over Central America presage a holocaust for our peoples. Today  as we appeal for peace in this body  which itself emerged from the ruins of war in order to fight for peace  Nicaragua continues to be subjected to the genocide of the terrorist policies of the United States authorities.33.	Amidst all this horror  we are making truly exceptional efforts to institutionalizeâby means of electionsâour democratic  nationalist  non-aligned  pluralist revolution  which defends a mixed economic system.34.	However  despite these efforts to reconstruct our country and to institutionalize democracy  the number of victims grows. To date  more than 7 000 Nicaraguans have been casualtiesâincluding children  mothers  youth and the elderlyâwhich in relative terms is equivalent to more than three times the number of American casualties in the Viet Nam war.35.	Moreover  there is the daily damage done to the economy by the direct impact of foreign aggression. Co-operatives  health centres  schools  machinery  construction equipment  day-care centres  food stocks and houses are being destroyed by this daily policy of terror. Our losses during the period 1981-1984 total $237 million. This would represent for the United States and the European Community  on a percentage basis  $102 billion and $284 billion  respectively  of their export earnings during the same period. To these figures should be added the credits  loans and grants that Nicaragua no longer receives as a result of United States pressure on Governments and multilateral agencies.36.	Nicaragua is today a country besieged  attacked and subjected to an unjust and illegal war  which is in danger of spreading. The United States has installed an impressive military infrastructure in Honduran territory bordering on Nicaragua. Its military presence has also been imposed on Costa Rican territory bordering on Nicaragua. United States warships are deployed menacingly off our coasts  and United States spy planes and military aircraft violate our airspace.37.	Dozens of mercenaries  among them United States citizens working for the CIA  pilot the planes and helicopters that launch attacks against economic  civilian and military targets and keep the aggressor forces supplied. Thousands of mercenaries function like a full-fledged army from their bases in Honduras and Costa Rica in operations co-ordinated and directed from military bases in Panama still occupied by the United States.38.	New plans are being worked out in the Pentagon and the CIA  this time to prevent the elections of 4 November in Nicaragua. Among other actions  they are contemplating renewed mining of our ports  aerial and naval attacks and the seizing of various areas. The military offensive is ready to begin on 15 October. The mercenary forces of the CIA and the Pentagon are already concentrated in the areas bordering Nicaragua in Honduras and Costa Rica. Also ready are the United States forces that would be used for bombings  troop landings and direct incursions into Nicaragua.39.	The Central American Governments are also prepared. They will go through the formality of requesting ""aid"" from the United States to eradicate the ""Sandinist threat"" from the area. And also ready is the ""Paul Scoon""  the puppet who would be intended to serve as the future President of the United States in Nicaragua. They have the actors in their assigned places with their roles memorized. Also prepared are the estimates of United States casualties during such an intervention. This amounts to an attempt to repeat the destructive and shameful actions against Grenada  but this time against Nicaragua.40.	From 12 August 1981 until 26 September 1984  Nicaragua has been making countless efforts on behalf of peace in bilateral talks with the United States  meeting with representatives of the United States Government on 16 occasions. Despite the concrete proposals presented by Nicaragua  the United States has always responded evasively or with proposals which can only be described as lacking in seriousness. At Manzanillo  Nicaragua has been very clear  consistent and flexible in responding to the concerns of the United States  which claims to feel its security in the region threatened by the Nicaraguan revolution. We have been firm and reasonable in proposing specific measures which would create a framework for mutual security for the United States and Nicaragua.41.	The Nicaraguan people  who yearn for peace  are willing to continue defending their independence  freedom  self-determination and democracy.42.	We know that the United States leaders are victims of their own history of intervention and aggression. There is not a corner of the world that has not suffered in one way or another the effects of those policies. All mankind must call upon the United States leaders to be level-headed and prudent.43.	At this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  in this month of October 1984  the people of Nicaragua want to go on record as voicing their desire for peace  while defending freedom  justice and democracy. If peace does not come and the war continues  and with it the likelihood of United States military intervention  we want the world to know that the Nicaraguan peopleâbarefoot  ragged  and with empty stomachsâare going to fight to the end  until we achieve peace  by either defeating the invaders or immolating ourselves if imperialist aggression leaves us no other choice.44.	Such is our morale. It is the same morale that made it possible for the peoples of Europe to wage their struggle of resistance against the Fascist war machine 40 years ago. We are certain that our sacrifice would not be in vain and we know that all 3 million Nicaraguans could be annihilated  but our example would triumph and be multiplied among the peoples of the worldâand among the people of the United States as well. This is our contribution to peace.45.	We wish to appeal to the leaders of the United States  in the interests of the peace and happiness of our peoples  to reflect on the enormous responsibility weighing on them at the present moment  and thus to leave the road to war and join us in the search for peace. In this way  we could begin a new era in the relations between our countries  in the interest of our peoples  including the real interest of the people of the United States.46.	The world has a right to know if the United States is willing to live in peace with the Central American peoples or if it insists on imposing war on us. The world has the right to demand of the current leaders of the United States a clear  definitive answer to a very concrete question. Are they for or against the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America presented by the Contadora Group on 7 September to all the Central American Governments? Are they for  or against  peace?47.	Many philosophers and men of politics have been quoted from this important rostrum. I should like to quote Jesus Christ  the humble man of Nazareth  who said: ""Blessed are the peacemakers""."
"102",5185,"NLD",39,1984,"ï»¿At the outset  allow me to say how happy we are to note that the representative of a nation with which the Netherlands maintains very cordial relations occupies the presidency at this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that the wisdom and considerable experience of the United Nations that made him such an effective President of the Economic and Social Council in 1981 will enable Mr. Lusaka to guide the representatives of the 159 nations represented in this Hall painlessly  if not effortlessly  through the months that lie ahead.2.	Allow me also to extend my country's warmest congratulations to the new Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam.3.	Yesterday  my colleague from Ireland  Mr. Barry  addressed the Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its member States. There is therefore no need for me to go over all the ground covered by him in his statement. Let me therefore concentrate on the functioning and future of the Organization to which we continue to attach so much importance. In this context  I should like to make a few remarks on international issues about which we are particularly concerned.4.	The theme for the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is apparently going to be ""United Nations for a better world"". Would it not be more appropriate to say ""We  the United Nations  for a better world""? Surely it is up to us  its Members  to be truly united in our efforts to shape a better world. After all  the Organization is no more than a tool in our hands and the United Nations can hope to be effective only to the extent that its Members allow it to be so. In the words of the Charter  ""We the peoples of the United Nations"" resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish our common aims and we therefore agreed to establish this international Organization. Its fundamental objectives are to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and to promote social progress and better standards of life m larger freedom. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations should be the occasion for a critical analysis of what we have been able to do in pursuit of those objectives.5.	Having said that  I would not wish to convey the impression that there is little or nothing to be grateful for. In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary General rightly points to the credit side of the balance sheet. I recall decolonization  peacekeeping operations  and human rights and  last but not least  the large number of occasions on which the Security Council has been able to deal effectively with complicated conflict situations. Furthermore  there is the valuable work of the specialized agencies in the fields of economic development and humanitarian assistance.6.	However  criticism of the United Nations is possibly stronger and more widespread today than at any moment since 1945. I need not enumerate the shortcomings of the Organization  nor would it be very fruitful to try to draw up a catalogue of our failures and disappointments. Most of us are only too familiar with these problems. But what seems to be lacking  in our opinion  is a sense of purpose  the political will to overcome our difficulties by common endeavour. Over the years  this has led to a gradual erosion of confidence in the Organization  which  in tum  has resulted in a retreat from internationalism and multilateralismâa process to which the Secretary General rightly draws our attention in his report.7.	Indeed  there is growing concern about the effectiveness of the United Nations as a framework for international cooperation  even to the extent that some see only diminishing returns in the search for solutions to the many problems we are facing today. The problem can undoubtedly be attributed in part to factors beyond the control of the United Nations  such as  for instance  the state of bilateral relations between States. The argument cannot stop there  however. The United Nations has an important role to play in the field of international cooperation  and its malfunctioning should be a point of major concern to the world Organization. It would seem to us that a careful examination of what went wrong and of what can be done to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations could have a salutary effect on its future functioning. I am convinced that the United Nations continues to be indispensable and that it can only emerge from a process of self-examination a stronger and healthier organization.8.	A basic prerequisite for the proper functioning of a world body is respect for the principle of universality. Unfortunately  time and again we are confronted with proposals in various organs of the United Nations which run counter to that principle. If Members continue to lay the axe to the tree  the tree will die. Hence my plea to reflect carefully upon the consequences of our actions. Honestly  I fear that in that case the very future of the United Nations is at stake.9.	In this context  I should like to express regret that the Republic of Korea has not yet been admitted as a full Member. Membership should be open also to North Korea if and when it desires it. Furthermore  we hope that the time is not far off when North Korea and South Korea will be able to sit down at the conference table so as to solve their outstanding differences.10.	At the end of this year  our term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council will come to a close. A thoughtful observer once remarked that ""to be elected to the Council is a privilege  and the general corpus of the United Nations would expect a country elected to [the] Council for two years to be fully and continuously worthy of this privilege"". I hope that the Netherlands passed the test successfully.11.	Prompted by the Secretary Generalâs 1982 report on the work of the Organization ' the Security Council has made an effort to reflect upon ways and means to enhance its effectiveness. Much to our regret  however  the Council has been unable to formulate any truly meaningful proposals. Needless to say  we  for our part  shall continue to look for opportunities to attain acceptance of at least some of the valuable suggestions contained in the Secretary General's report. The best hope of restoring the Council's role as an effective instrument of international diplomacy lies in the readiness of Member States to make use extensively  but also constructively  of the procedures set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.12.	However  the Security Council is frequently bypassed because of a profound distrust of the objectivity of the United Nations. The Council cannot carry out its mandate without the full political support of the major Powers in particular. This requires the serious engagement of those Powers in the work of the Council. United Nations mediation cannot and should not be the panacea in each and every international conflict. Bilateral and regional arrangements have an important role to play m the search for peaceful solutions to problems between nations. This cannot alter the fact that the Security Council continues to bear primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the world  especially in the case of serious conflicts. It should be self-evident that those who fail to abide by Security Council resolutions contribute by their action to the erosion of the authority of the Council. The gravity of this practice would seem to warrant particular attention's being paid to it.13.	The situation in southern Africa remains on the agenda of the Security Council. South Africa's refusal to implement Council resolution 435 (1978)  thereby delaying Namibia's independence  is a clear violation of the commitment of Member States to give effect to Council resolutions. We  for our part  continue to favour the imposition of further selective mandatory sanctions against South Africa as long as the South African Government continues to persist in denying the majority of its citizens their fundamental rights.14.	The Netherlands has consistently advocated an extension of the existing mandatory arms embargo against South Africa. In this respect  I should like to remind the Assembly of our efforts to arrive at a ban on arms imports from South Africa.15.	As far as the problems besetting the Middle East are concerned  my colleague from Ireland has set out the position of the 10 member States of the European Community in detail  but I should like to add a word on the United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the Middle East. Shortly  the Security Council will have to consider the possibility of a revitalisation of the role of UNIFIL. Withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon will provide the Council with a unique opportunity to re-establish UNIFIL as the guarantor of peace and security in its area of operations. We feel that this opportunity should be exploited to the full.16.	As to the war between Iran and Iraq  we felt encouraged by the acceptance by both sides of United Nations observers to monitor the undertaking of those two countries to refrain from attacks on civilian population centres. The search for peace between Iran and Iraq would be greatly enhanced by the readiness of both parties to make the fullest possible use of the instruments of the United Nations. We  for our part  continue to look with admiration to the secretary Generalâs endeavours to try and bring about an end to this conflict.17.	In Central America  the Contadora Group of countries is developing a comprehensive scheme for the establishment of peace and stability in the region. I am heartened by the progress being achieved in finalizing the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America [see A/39/562] When called upon to do so  the United Nations should lend its fullest support to the efforts of the Contadora countries  thereby encouraging the search for regional solutions to regional problems.18.	From the very beginning  nuclear disarmament has figured prominently on the agenda of the General Assembly  and quite rightly so. The destructiveness of these weapons confronts us with unprecedented dilemmas and makes it highly imperative that every effort be made to reduce to a minimum the risk of these weapons being used. Surely  our principal objective remains the achievement of stability at the lowest possible level. This can be achieved only through negotiations. We therefore fully support the appeal made by the President of the United States in his address to the Assembly [4th meeting] regarding the need to broaden the East West dialogue  which in turn should lead to the resumption of negotiations.19.	An aspect of the present situation which is of particular concern to us in the Netherlands is the unacceptable superiority of the Soviet Union in land based intermediate range nuclear missiles. We earnestly hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will be able to reach agreement on the substantial reductionâand preferably the complete eliminationâof this category of weapons. We attach great importance to the achievement of such an outcome. However  should the Soviet Union continue to expand its SS20 arsenal  the Netherlands Government would feel obliged to participate in the deployment of such weapons.20.	The Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva  embodies the vital interests of the world community as a whole in meaningful and verifiable agreements on lower and safer levels of armaments. Much to our regret  the potential of this negotiating forum is largely wasted by protracted procedural disputes. Bearing in mind the pace of technological development  early agreement on measures to prevent a destabilizing arms race in outer space should be a priority item on our agenda.21.	Recent events have again demonstrated the necessity of a complete ban on chemical weapons. Progress in the negotiations has been made  but not enough. We will continue to promote a ban on chemical weapons within the framework of the negotiations at Geneva.22.	One area in which the United Nations has made particularly relevant contributions is the promotion of human rights.23.	The United Nations has rightfully become a major source of hope for the individual who suffers from discrimination  persecution and degrading treatment. I observe within the United Nations system a growing preparedness to criticize human rights abuses which still occur in widely divergent geographical and political settings. I add that no State should take cover behind its sovereign rights in order to reject all forms of international scrutiny. At this session  the Assembly will be called upon to act on a proposal to further the cause of human rights and to agree on a draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  The text of this convention  which was drafted by a working group of the Commission on Human Rights which my country had the honour to chair  will hopefully carry the agreement of all Members of the United Nations.24.	Deliberate cruel or inhuman treatment of other human beings exists in forms other than those covered by traditional or more recent human rights instruments. The world continues to be plagued by the mindless  anonymous violence of terrorism. The most recent example of the ruthlessness of which the terrorists are capable was the bombing last week of the United States Embassy building in Beirut. The Netherlands Government strongly condemns such acts of political violence and calls for intensified international action to stop the scourge of terrorism.25.	In recognition of the need of the developing countries for outside assistance  the Netherlands Government announced a week ago that it will continue to devote 1.5 per cent of its national income to development assistance. A substantial part of this aid will be allocated to the multilateral financial institutions. Indeed  compared with the League of Nations  a major achievement of the Charter of the United Nations has been the recognition of the vital role of international economic cooperation.26.	Looking back  one can point to successes as well as to failures. A United Nations development system has emerged. Today's world would be unthinkable without it. But  at the same time  we have to admit that at present there is a stalemate in the ongoing dialogue between North and South. Many of us look at the state of the North South dialogue with growing impatience. So far  we have failed to see the launching of a new round of global negotiations where basic issues such as energy  food  money and finance  trade and aid would be discussed in an interrelated way. But we should also ask ourselves whether this concept is not overly ambitious and based on an overestimation of the role Governments can play in shaping world economic and social conditions. To support the continuing process of change  it is imperative that we clarify our often differing conceptions in a frank and constructive dialogue and that we identify common ground and concrete objectives.27.	First  in its approach to development cooperation  my Government is guided by the concept of differentiation  and we have come to recognize that fundamental differences in economic  social  political and cultural outlook call for a wide variety in our programmes  activities and measures. Secondly^ I am increasingly hesitant about the effectiveness of worldwide strategies which tend to overlook the diversity of the problems in the various countries.28.	Negotiations in sectoral conferences are also part of the overall dialogue. An important North South event of this year  the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August  has been moderately successful. It was possible to agree on a set of resolutions adopted by consensus which contain practical measures and concrete steps to boost United Nations activities in the field of industrialization  which is of paramount importance to the third world. However  the successful implementation of the resolutions will depend lately on the readiness of donor countries to provide the agreed additional financial means. We for our part intend to do so.29.	In another field of particular relevance to the third world  that of population  we have seen the successful outcome of the International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  although it was unfortunately marred by efforts to politicize it.30.	In a period of limited resources  the United Nations  like its Members  should be governed by rules of budgetary restraint and cost-effectiveness. Severe controls on official spending  proper management and a curb on regulatory activities are inevitable so as to secure the future of the Organization. As an important contributor to the United Nations budget and to the budgets of many specialized agencies and voluntary funds  we feel justified in asking the Organization to make as effective use of the available resources as possible. Budgetary restraint and cost-effectiveness are of equal importance.31.	With regard to efforts to control an expanding bureaucracy  I welcome the secretary Generalâs statement  in his report on the work of the Organization [see A/39/1]  that he will try to improve the efficiency of the Secretariat. We would hope that similar intentions will become manifest in the specialized agencies. UNESCO  of course  is a case in point. Inadequate management and politicization  as well as the pursuance of costly activities which were not supported by all Member States  are largely to blame for the unfortunate derailment of that organization.32.	A point of special concern for my Government is the financing of peacekeeping operations. Owing to the refusal of some important Members to pay their assessed contributions  the accumulated shortfall for UNIFIL will soon reach the figure of $200 million. At this session of the Assembly  the Netherlands delegation will consider what steps could be taken to redress this situation  which is manifestly unfair to the troop contributing countries and might in the end jeopardize the peacekeeping functions of the United Nations.33.	Within the framework of the United Nations  we pursue both a political and an economic dialogue. Over the years  we have created a web of organizations which are all engaged in one way or another in helping developing nations to help themselves. The world as it is today cannot do without this system. At the same time  we  the nations of that world  are responsible for the growing inadequacy of the system. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations would seem to be an appropriate occasion to reflect upon ways and means to improve its functioning  its decision-making processes and its cost-effectiveness.34.	It is in this spirit that the Netherlands delegation intends to submit proposals for streamlining the overburdened agenda of various United Nations bodies in an effort to try to revitalize the decision-making process. Surely it is not necessary for every debate to result in yet another resolution. A consensus can only be meaningful to the extent that we have reallyâand I repeat ""really""âharmonized our views. This is not to say that there are no differences in outlook; of course there are. But these should be discussed in the appropriate political forums. Let us try by all means not to paralyse the work of the technical sub organs of the United Nations system by the introduction of controversial issues which are more often than not extraneous to the work of those particular bodies. More than in the past  the Netherlands delegation will speak out against those practices  because they seriously undermine the proper functioning and possibly even the very future of the Organization.35.	In his report the Secretary General asks why there has been a retreat from internationalism and multilateralism precisely at a time when actual developments in the world would seem to call for movement in the opposite direction  and he expresses the hope that political scientists and intellectuals the world over  together with world leaders and diplomats  will reflect on this phenomenon. We certainly feel that positive response to the call of the secretary General to engage in an exercise in self-examination could be very useful.36.	At the same time  I want to recall the words of my predecessor when he addressed the first session of the General Assembly. He said:""We are firmly convinced that the success of this Organization is not to be found in a multiplication of machinery  of questionnaires and reports  but in deeds"". And  may I add  deeds of truly international cooperation. Here lies clearly a common task for the Members of the United Nations."
"103",5230,"NOR",39,1984,"ï»¿56. Allow me first of all to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that the Assemblyâs proceedings will greatly benefit from your experience  skill and wise guidance.57.	Allow me also to extend warm congratulations to the Government and people of Brunei Darussalam on their admission to membership in the United Nations.58.	The thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time of international tension and widespread human suffering throughout the world: the situation in Afghanistan  the Middle East  the war between Iran and Iraq and military conflicts in other areas give reason for great concern; disarmament negotiations have been suspended  while the arms race continues; the contacts between East and West are far from adequate; the North-South dialogue is at a difficult juncture  while severe economic problems and climatic conditions have adversely affected millions of people; and a great many people are denied basic human rights.59.	However  important strides towards the solution of those and other problems facing mankind can be made. It all depends on the decisions and choices that we make. Political leaders must choose the direction in which they want the world to develop. We have the technological means  as well as the economic and human resources  to spread opportunity and prosperity to all parts of the world; but for this we must face our common challenges together. Events and developments in one country affect the lives and destinies of people in other countries more directly than ever before. The word ""interdependency- cy"" designates a reality.60.	The United Nations continues to be the object of criticism. While pointing to the deficiencies of the United Nations  we should not overlook its achievements. At the same time  we should increase our efforts to enable the United Nations to play the role envisaged for it in the Charter.61.	Consequently  we should endeavour to strengthen the United Nations and thereby improve its ability to prevent conflicts and crises  and to settle such conflicts if they should nevertheless arise. In order to support the Secretary-General's efforts to this end  Norway  together with the other Nordic countries  has recommended  inter alia  improving the efficiency of the Security Council  strengthening the role of the Secretary-General  and enhancing the ability and capacity of the United Nations to launch peace-keeping operations.62.	The Security Council should feel a special obligation to bring about a strengthening of the United Nations. The necessary impetus should be given to ensure that the United Nations shall be able to meet the high aspiration of our peoplesâthat is  to enable every man and woman to enjoy freedom and peace in security.63.	Peace-keeping operations are important instruments in the hands of the Security Council. Such operations are a tangible extension of the authority of the Council to the area of conflict. By the same token  it is obvious that  in order to succeed  peace-keeping operations must have the full support of the Council  as well as the co-operation of the parties concerned.64.	Today  armament arsenals have reached such an extent that it is difficult to see that any additional increase would entail more security for those who possess them. Of course  every nation has the right to defend itself  but the continuing arms build-up becomes ever more dangerous and meaningless.65.	In our endeavours to create a safer world  efforts to achieve arms control and disarmament should be given the very highest priority. Agreements should be balanced and verifiable. Particularly with regard to nuclear weapons  it is important to improve the quality and consistency of the dialogue between the major Powers.66.	We can only hope that the Soviet Union will soon return to the negotiating table  without preconditions  and sit down with the United States in order to negotiate substantial reductions in nuclear weapons and accompanying measures which will create an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding.67.	This session of the General Assembly also has a grave responsibility to contribute to the resumption of such talks. In this connection  we should strive to create a basis for an agreed  balanced and verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons. In view of the present imbalances  such a freeze must be pursued in the context of negotiations on substantial reductions in nuclear weapons; that is to say  a freeze must be part of a settlement which at the same time establishes a balance between the nuclear arsenals.68.	As we prepare for the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  we must also endeavour to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Similarly  we attach great importance to the forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction  as proposed for 1986. We must also seek ways to reach agreement on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.69.	While reductions in nuclear arms must have first priority  it is also of vital importance to seek balanced and substantial reductions in conventional weapons. At the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  the necessary elements for an agreement have now been presented. It is equally important to stop the accelerated build-up of conventional arms in other parts of the world.70.	One area of particular concern is chemical weapons. It is with the greatest concern that we have learned that chemical weapons have recently been used. Such use must be denounced wherever and whenever it takes place. We must spare no effort in reaching an agreement on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons  as well as on the destruction of existing arsenals. The United States draft of a chemical weapons treaty represents an important contribution to the negotiations in this field.71.	Outer space has always attracted man's attention  and with modem technology we can now use space for various purposes. It is important that we should now also be aware of the potential dangers. In our vision of a safer and more stable world  there is no room for the militarization of outer space. This should be prevented through bilateral as well as multilateral efforts. We therefore urge that there be agreement on talks to find a basis for arms control and disarmament in outer space.72.	Questions relating to the building of confidence and security are important elements in all negotiations on arms control and disarmament. These questions also constitute a key element in the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. Thirty-five nations have agreed to work for Concrete confidence- and security-building measures that in turn can reduce the risk of military conflict and surprise attack. We hope that the Warsaw Pact countries will now demonstrate a positive will to discuss the concrete proposals presented by the Western participants. For our part  we are ready to give the most careful consideration to all relevant proposals presented by the other participants.73.	Let me also address another serious problem which requires our fullest attention. I am referring to the alarming increase in international terrorism. Nobody can tell today who will be struck by terrorist acts tomorrow. The problem therefore affects us all. Unfortunately  the appalling fact is that on several occasions there have been serious indications that Governments have been involved in such terrorism. That is  of course  a clear violation of international law. The assumption that the ends could justify the means is particularly dangerous since it would inevitably lead to anarchy. The world community must make an effort to counter terrorism and to take concrete steps to stop this intolerable development. The senseless attack on the United States Embassy in Beirut is a strong reminder of the urgent need to take international action.74.	The safeguarding of human rights must continue to be a priority task for the United Nations. Governments should comply fully with the provisions of the international legal instruments in this field. A more efficient international machinery  including a United Nations high commissioner for human rights  should be established. In our reactions to violations of human rights  it is essential that we apply the same standards irrespective of where the violations occur. We cannot accept the proposition that the violation of human rights in any one country is of no concern to the international community. On the contrary  there is a strong interdependence between respect for human rights and the prospects for international detente.75. The policy of apartheid represents a clear violation of human rights. The recent constitutional changes in South Africa do not fundamentally alter that policy. On the contrary  the reforms must be seen as an attempt to consolidate the present system. The international community should therefore continue to put pressure on South Africa to bring the policy of	to an end.76.	On the other hand  it has been encouraging to observe that democratic reforms are now under way in several countries in Latin America. This development should be welcomed in the hope that it will continue and be strengthened. In this situation we should offer our assistance and advice. However  no one has the right to exploit a fragile political and social situation in another country to promote his own interests. At the same time  we expect that a promise of democratic elections really means free elections where everyone can truly express his own conviction.77.	The Norwegian Government supports the efforts of the Contadora Group in bringing about a framework for peace  stability and economic development in Central America. We also welcome the talks initiated this summer between the United States and Nicaragua.78.	AH our efforts should be aimed at meeting the needs and aspirations of the individual. Our task should therefore be to create a world where every human being will have a better life. We have the means and the resources; let us also demonstrate that we have the necessary political will.79.	The need for such political will is emphasized in the latest annual report of the IMF.' Although the report opens with some rather positive observations on the economic situation  it makes it quite clear that these heartening developments are fragile and will not continue unless the major industrial countries adjust their policies and acknowledge their broad responsibility for the world economy. Those countries have a particular responsibility to contribute towards bringing about better living conditions in the developing countries. Our development assistance programmes should therefore be continued and intensified. There is also an urgent need for further concerted action to mobilize additional resources so as to meet  and if possible reach beyond  the objective set by the United Nations. Norway is ready to play a full part in such a joint effort. As regards official development assistance  net disbursements from Norway in 1983 reached the level of 1.06 per cent of the gross national product  a figure that will be surpassed this year as well as in 1985.80.	We must also increase our efforts to improve market access for developing countries. This would enable them to acquire a larger share of international trade and to service their debts  as well as to mobilize resources for their development programmes. In this way  they will improve their prospects for achieving better economic growth  which will also benefit the industrialized world. These questions will be in the foreground at the World Bank/IMF meetings starting today.81.	There is certainly no easy way out of these and other economic problems. It is obvious that national decisions and domestic action will not suffice. The situation therefore calls for international co-operation. What we need is to unite our forces in a common approach on a global scale. If we succeed in our joint efforts and co-operation  the results will have a beneficial effect on the world economy as a whole.82.	Our joint efforts to improve the lot of the developing countries will be frustrated unless we are able to address the problem of the far-too-high population growth in some regions. Some progress in reducing the growth rate has been made over the past years  but the overall picture gives reason for deep concern. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  reached agreement on the need for a more active population policy. We fully share the view that family planning must be seen in the context of economic and social development. We cannot substitute the one for the other. We particularly welcome the agreement reached at the Mexico Conference that improvement of the status of women is a prerequisite for any successful population policy.83.	The International Conference on Population has provided us with the basis for dealing with the population problem. It is now up to us  the States Members of the United Nations  as well as the other international organizations  to implement the decisions taken at Mexico.84.	More than ever  the peoples of the world have a common destiny. The political leaders of the world therefore have a common responsibility. Joint efforts are needed. This is not the time to retreat from international co-operation. On the contrary  we must increase our international collaboration. The United Nations  as a global organization  has a particular role to play. Every member country must therefore contribute to the increased effectiveness of the Organization. The Norwegian Government  for its part  is dedicated to the continued strong support of the Organization and its important work.85.	I will conclude  Mr. President  by expressing the sincere hope that under your guidance the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly will bring us closer to our common objectives."
"104",5276,"NPL",39,1984,"ï»¿I have the honour to convey to you  Sir  and to the representatives present here  the greetings of my Sovereign  King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  as well as his best wishes for the success of the current session of the General Assembly.382.	May I also on behalf of my delegation extend our warm felicitations to Mr. Paul Lusaka on his election to the high office of President of the thirty ninth session of the General Assembly. We are indeed happy to find a man of his eminence and ability guiding the work of this important session. He represents a country which is deeply committed to the principles of nonalignment and has always been in the forefront of defending the cause of international peace and justice. Nepal shares common characteristics and commitments with Zambia. My delegation is therefore confident that the deliberations at this session of the Assembly will be both meaningful and memorable.383.	I would be remiss were I to fail to express our appreciation to Mr. Jorge Illueca  who presided over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly with great distinction.384.	I would also like to take this opportunity to place on record our sincere appreciation of the Secretary General for his contributions in promoting the cause of international peace and cooperation and also for his efforts to enhance the image and effectiveness of the United Nations.385.	My delegation has the pleasure to welcome among us Brunei Darussalam  a country with which Nepal enjoys a close relationship.386.	Many distinguished speakers who have preceded me have given expression to their concern over the dangers and difficulties that we face today. Indeed  every passing year has been a witness to the drift and deterioration in the international situation. While the world moves from crisis to crisis  the actions of the international community have been more in the nature of belated reactions than of bold initiatives to forestall problems or make better arrangements for the future. The maintenance of international peace and security and the enhancement of global cooperation for the benefit of mankind presuppose a gradual but steady strengthening of an international order. This will require a universal acceptance of the codes of international conduct and a growth in trust and respect between nations.387.	These are the principles on which the United Nations was founded  and these are the principles that we are all committed to uphold. However  the gap between conduct and commitment has led not only to the aggravation of tension and trouble but also has seriously eroded the very effectiveness of the Organization. I sometimes wonder whether we can afford further deviation from the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Man's ingenuity in endlessly refining the supreme weapons of universal annihilation stands in stark contrast to deprivation and destitution of an unimaginable magnitude. A number of key disputes with potential for subverting the fragile structure of world peace continue to go unresolved. While poverty and economic hardship threaten a vast portion of the world's population  efforts to devise global economic remedies remain deadlocked. Violence and terrorism  bred by mass frustrations  are sapping the failing faith in human life and values.388.	If there was anything of universal significance in the dismal events of the past year it was our need to address ourselves to the most pressing problem of our time  the arms race. Yet we find the momentum in the reverse direction. The strained relations between the two superpowers have continued to feed on the infinitely ominous tendency to build  refine and stockpile weapons. Their competition in manufacturing and stockpiling weapons of mass destruction has triggered an intense race far in excess of the legitimate need for self-defence among the third world countries. While the arms race has been increasing both in intensity and scope  no progress is recorded in the negotiations with respect to priorities identified in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session  devoted to disarmament [resolution 8-10/2]. All the more frustrating is the fact that there appears to be very little prospect of an immediate breakthrough  notwithstanding the technical and legal groundwork laid down years ago. The stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament on such issues as the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty  agreement on the complete and effective prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and their destruction and on a convention prohibiting the development  production  stockpiling and use of radiological weapons cannot be explained other than as a result of the lack of political will on the part of the major Powers to come to any agreement.389.	It is true that all nuclear weapon States have expressed an aversion to using nuclear weapons. However  the very existence of such weapons in the present state of international relations presents an unprecedented threat to human life and civilization. Possession of these weapons confers on the major Powers a responsibility to negotiate ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate these weapons of annihilation.390.	Nepal has always insisted that continuing dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union undertaken in good faith will not only facilitate progress on all aspects of nuclear disarmament but also have a decisive impact on the general climate of international relations. A prolonged stalemate in the negotiations between the two superpowers could  in addition  have far-reaching implications for the proliferation of nuclear weapons  both vertically and horizontally. It might then be too late for the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to contain the situation any longer.391.	My delegation fully shares the general anxiety posed by nuclear weapons. We would like to stress  however  the need to tackle the problem of the production  refinement  stockpiling and  above all  international transfer of conventional weapons. Inferior to nuclear weapons only in their capacity to bring devastation  these immensely powerful weapons of mass destruction have been a major drain on the limited resources of many developing countries which are trying to outdo each other in acquiring them. These weapons have caused untold suffering in the years since the founding of the United Nations. My delegation welcomes the study on all aspects of the conventional arms race and on disarmament relating to conventional weapons and armed forces. We would support any initiative designed to promote security and stability at a lower level of armament.392.	My delegation shares the deep concern at the present prospect of the arms race extending into outer space and reiterates its appeal for negotiations to be initiated without delay and for action to prevent this development.393.	The past years have shown an increasing tendency to resort to arms in response to situations that could or should have been resolved through peaceful means. This has increased the opportunity for powerful foreign forces to intervene in the affairs of smaller nations. The superimposition of East West tensions on regional conflicts has further complicated the situation.394.	The situation in the Middle East  with all its complexities  continues to command the attention of the international community. The adamant refusal to heed reason and good sense has perpetuated the cycle of mistrust and violence. The national tragedy of Lebanon has only underscored the need to redouble efforts to find a solution to that continuing crisis. A just and lasting peace in that region can be achieved only through a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the problem  such as recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  and Israel's withdrawal from territories occupied since 1967.395.	The United Nations is the only universal forum within the framework of which efforts towards a comprehensive peace can properly be pursued. In the past we welcomed partial steps in the hope that they would be a prelude to comprehensive peace and justice. We stand ready to support any initiative that sincerely seeks to address the elements of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace that I have outlined. The United Nations should also take immediate steps to encourage national reconciliation in Lebanon  the withdrawal of all foreign forces and respect for the territorial integrity and legitimate sovereignty of Lebanon.396.	The continuing conflict between two nonaligned countries  Iran and Iraq  is a source of deep concern to the international community. That tragic war has caused immense human suffering and material loss and will have unpredictable consequences in a very sensitive area of the world. Nepal renews its appeal to both Iran and Iraq to agree to an effective ceasefire and seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute.397.	Utter disregard for the basic norms governing relations between States in many parts of the world has been a constant source of tension and a threat to international peace and security. Every State  big or small  powerful or weak  has the inalienable right to choose its own social  economic and political system. This basic and legitimate right of a State and people can be denied only at the cost of the ideals  purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Respect for these fundamental principles of interstate relations enshrined in the Charter is the only effective protection for States against the domineering influence of the big Powers. It is in this perspective that my delegation views the situation m Kampuchea and Afghanistan.398.	The situation in Kampuchea remains a matter of grave concern. Despite strenuous efforts by the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea  peace and stability have not come to that country and the situation remains precarious. Only a just solution of the military and political issues can lead to a comprehensive solution of the Kampuchean problem. My delegation once again reiterates its call for the total withdrawal of foreign forces  which alone can create the conditions in which the Kampuchean people can exercise their right to self-determination.399.	Similarly  developments in Afghanistan have been a cause of great tension and anxiety throughout the world. The General Assembly has more than once pronounced itself unequivocally on the principles involved and the action required. Only adherence to the will of an overwhelming majority of the international community can help facilitate a fair political solution that will ensure that the Afghan people determine their own destiny without intervention or interference from outside. The efforts of the Secretary General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  enjoy the full confidence and support of my delegation.400.	The situation in Central America remains volatile and tense. A feeling of insecurity and fear of destabilization caused by outside forces is fuelling violence and tension in the region. My delegation reiterates its support for Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  which reaffirms the right of the States in the region to live in peace and freedom. The efforts of the Contadora Group continue to receive our firm support.401.	The situation in Cyprus has taken an unhappier turn in the recent past. Nepal reiterates its support for the territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty and nonaligned character of Cyprus. My delegation believes that intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-general offer the best hope for a viable solution of the Cyprus problem  and it renews its support for the recent initiative taken by the Secretary General in that direction.402.	Nepal remains firm in its view that the aspirations of the Korean people for national reunification must be fulfilled peacefully  without outside interference.403.	Despite concerted efforts by the international community  South Africa persists with the abhorrent system of apartheid. It also continues to implement its policy of bantustanization  designed to make millions of citizens aliens in their own country The recent sham reforms to give a semblance of representation to the so-called Coloureds and persons of Indian origin is yet another manoeuvre of the minority racist regime to deny the majority their birth right. South Africa's policies constitute a supreme negation of all that constitutes the guiding principles of the United Nations. My delegation renews its call for effective international measures under the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  measures which alone can force the South African regime to respect the will of the international community  thus neutralizing a potential threat to international peace and security.404.	My delegation has repeatedly voiced its total opposition to South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. We strongly denounce the prevarications often resorted to by South Africa to delay indefinitely the independence of that Territory  for which the United Nations has the sole responsibility. My Government reaffirms its support for the just struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO. We also renew our appeal to the members of the contact group of five Western States to intensify their efforts for the early implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which alone constitutes the internationally accepted basis for the solution of the Namibian question.405.	Apart from the specific political and security issues to which I have referred  there are economic problems of an equally great magnitude which confront humanity and which must be taken into account seriously if we are to make progress in the great task of building a reasonably acceptable world order. In spite of attempts to strengthen international cooperation  the world continues to face increasing economic difficulties.406.	In the face of the pressing economic needs of the third world countries  the continued deadlock in the efforts to launch global negotiations is clearly unacceptable The Group of 77 has been approaching the issue with an open and positive mind  as was evident in the exploratory exchanges during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are dismayed that the London Economic Summit of the industrialized countries  held in June of this year  was conspicuously silent on the issue of global negotiations.407.	Our concern over this continued impasse arises from our conviction that the fundamental problems facing the international community in areas of development and international economic cooperation are global in nature and therefore require a global  integrated approach. Short of this  no measure  no solution  however well-intentioned  can adequately respond to the present crisis.408.	The much heralded recovery is limited to a few developed market economies. High interest rates  falling prices of primary products  fluctuating exchange rates  an increasing tendency to protectionism  a critical shortfall in resources of international development agencies and the high cost of imports have made the economies of developing countries even more vulnerable. In these circumstances  the negative attitude to the pressing needs of the developing countries is most regrettable.409.	The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in 1981  drew the attention of the international community to the plight of that group of countries  whose economies were extremely fragile and faced further deterioration if immediate international action was not forthcoming. The Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  adopted by that Conference '"" was a firm commitment of the international community to help to develop the infrastructure of the least developed countries and to launch sustained development programmes. A midterm global review of the implementation of the Programme is to be undertaken in 1985. Looking back  we cannot but express serious concern at the lack of progress in the implementation of special measures envisaged under the Programme. My delegation wishes to this opportunity to remind donor countries of their solemn commitments and urge them to come forward generously to realize the objectives set out in the Programme.410.	As a least developed  as well as a landlocked country  Nepal has a vital stake in the full and Successful implementation of the Programme. We have launched a coordinated and programmed effort to achieve the all-round development of our country  but our efforts need a good degree of international support. While we accept primary responsibility for our own national development  international cooperation can go a long way in helping us to help ourselves.411.	International development organizations have a vital role to play in achieving the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Shortfalls in the critically needed resources allocated voluntarily to those organizations are disturbing. Organizations like UNDP have  over the years  developed a highly refined skill to provide development assistance. Inability to use these valuable tools because of severe resource constraints would indeed be unfortunate. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the valuable assistance Nepal has been receiving from various United Nations bodies and agencies.412.	Given the interdependent nature of the world economy  energy  including new and renewable sources of energy  cannot be treated in isolation. It is an issue closely related to international finance and monetary questions and development assistance. Development of a sustainable supply of energy without excessively depleting natural resources is a great challenge to the international community. It was in this spirit that my country welcomed the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy  adopted in 1981 "" and the subsequent developments leading to identification of priority areas for immediate study and possible implementation.413.	Nepal has based its strategy for national development on an accelerated but prudent exploitation of water resources. However  the magnitude of the task in terms of resources and technology requirements is immense. We appreciate the interest and active participation of friendly countries and multilateral institutions in this undertaking.414.	Because we are aware of the fact that science and technology alone can give us a breakthrough in socioeconomic development  the activities at the United Nations in this field are of great interest to us. In the last few years we have made some institutional arrangements to mobilize local talent for national development. My delegation notes with satisfaction the work done by the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development in implementing the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development  adopted in 1979.We look forward to an early settlement of the issue concerning resources for the establishment of a financing system for science and technology.415.	The continued deadlock in the North South dialogue has reinforced the importance and urgency of South South cooperation. My delegation expresses satisfaction at the achievements of the follow up of the Caracas Programme of Action adopted by the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries  held at Caracas in May 1981.""416.	Nepal firmly believes that the strengthening of South South cooperation is an essential! ingredient of international cooperation and development. As a part of this process  the seven countries of South Asia are engaged in a programme of regional cooperation. We have already covered important ground at the conceptual stage  and an integrated programme of action has been adopted. The second South Asian Regional Cooperation Meeting of Foreign Ministers  held at Male on 10 and 11 July of this year  gave clear guidelines for the systematic implementation of the programme of action  launched in a spirit of mutual understanding for mutual benefit.417.	This brief survey of a few of the important issues facing us brings me back to the idea with which I opened my statement. The ideal world order which the Charter of the United Nations visualizes  viewed against ever-increasing and complicated problems  appears Utopian. It is  however  preferable to a course of events which  if allowed to grow unchecked  would lead to a world conflagration.418.	While the reality around us is bleak  we at least have some instruments to deal with it. The process of decolonization  except for Namibia  is almost complete. Human rights and human dignity have become important factors in international affairs; science and technology offer great prospects for attacking poverty and inequality on a global scale; and  above all  the United Nations offers a unique mechanism to deal with threats to international peace and security. The frequent side-tracking of the decisions of the Security Council and its failure to develop an effective common approach to potential threats to international peace and security have eroded respect for the Security Council and for the United Nations in general. If things are allowed to go on in this way  we face the danger of accepting difficulties without trying to solve them  with possible catastrophic results.419.	This places enormous responsibilities on each of the States Members of the United Nations. A rededication to the commitments undertaken under the Charter must mean a clear realization of the demand for cohesion and cooperation in facing threatsâpolitical  security and economic. International peace and security and international cooperation for global development are issues which override ideological interests. Given the sincere cooperation of all  the mechanisms provided in the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security  for social justice and for economic development are as valid today as they were at the time of their formulation.420.	Nepal has abiding faith in the principles and purposes of the United Nations. We stand ready to contribute in whatever way we can to strengthening this international instrument of peace and development. The present state of international relations and the crisis in the world economy have only reinforced our belief in the indivisibility of peace and development. This perception has led us to support the establishment of zones of peace in the Indian Ocean  South East Asia and any other region or country. We likewise support the recent initiatives of ASEAN to make Southeast Asia a nuclear weapon free zone. It has been our considered view that each initiative of this nature  be it the creation of a zone of peace or of a nuclear weapon free zone  will help to reduce tension and institutionalize peace  with a positive and salutary effect on peace  stability and development. 421.	Inspired by a desire further to strengthen peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries and in response to our national needs and aspirations  King Birendra has proposed that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. This proposal embodies our firm resolution to meet challenges of development in an atmosphere of stability and security  while contributing to the cause of peace and stability in our neighbourhood and beyond. This proposal reflects our traditional ethos and embraces the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and the purposes of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries. I take this opportunity to thank all those countries which have supported our proposal.422.	In conclusion  I wish to emphasize once again the gravity of the present international situation. The tendency to replace cooperation by confrontation  conciliation by conflict  mutual understanding by discord and accommodation by imposition cannot be allowed to grow unchecked. With its near universal membership and well-established principles  the United Nations continues to be our best hope for saving ourselves and succeeding generations from the scourge of war. What is needed is our will to use this machinery and effort to make it more effective. Nepal is ready to support any initiative in that direction."
"105",5340,"NZL",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election. When Africa's problems are looming so large  it is appropriate that an African should once again preside over the General Assembly. We are confident that your presidency will help make this session a fruitful one. New Zealand will do all it can to assist you.3.	We welcome the newest Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam  a country of our own part of the world  with which we have long-standing ties. New Zealand has long believed that the membership of the Organization should be universal. We welcome every step in that direction. We would not want to see the principle of universality compromised in any way.4.	I would not adequately reflect the views of most New Zealanders if I did not  right at the beginning of my first address to the General Assembly  talk about an issue that has become very prominent in public debate in our country. New Zealandersânot just a few of them  but people from all sectors of the communityâhave become gravely concerned about nuclear weapons and the continuing and deadly competition in their production  their refinement and their deployment.5.	New Zealand is a small and remote country  perhaps a little distant from the mainstream of world affairs. We are fortunate enough to live in a region that constitutes a pocket of tranquillity in a deeply divided and troubled world. Like many members of the international community  New Zealand faces serious economic problems and some social ones as well; but we are at least able to come to grips with these problems without having our attention diverted by those immediate worries out security that are all too familiar for many Members of the United Nations. We are not occupied; we are nobody's client; we have excellent relations with all our neighbours; in 1984 no other country has New Zealand in its sights. For our longer-term protection we rely on our membership of the Western Alliance. That membership is formally expressed in a security treaty with the United States and Australia which for 33 years has been a central feature of the foreign and defence policies of successive New Zealand Governments  including my own.6.	Against this background  why is it that New Zealanders are becoming increasingly worried about a contest that is centred in two capitals half a world away? With no more immodesty than many others  New Zealanders like to think of themselves as practical and sensible people. They are simply alarmed at the continuing build-up of nuclear arsenals  because they can see no sense in it. How does it make sense continually to augment and refine an existing capacity to make the rubble bounce and bounce and bounce again? New Zealanders have felt deepening frustration at the inability of the States that hold nuclear weapons  in particular the two super-Powers  to agree on practical measures to halt and reverse the process of building more and ""better"" nuclear weapons. If ordinary people everywhere can see the irrationality of that race  they ask  why cannot the super-Powers see it also? And  if they can see it  why do they not do something about it?7.	Quite recently  another dimension has been added to these concerns. Our people  like others round the world  have known for a long time that the possibility of nuclear war is a terrible and frightening one. They have known for very many years that if the countries that have these weapons eventually descend to hurling them at each other  then those countries and their peoples will be destroyed. They have also recognized that other countries  including New Zealand  would suffer very severely indeed. But New Zealanders had not previously supposed that the direct physical consequences for them could be overwhelming. If common humanity and concern for others dictated anxiety about nuclear war  it was thought  perhaps we could afford to be slightly less anxious than others.8.	Within the last year or so  New Zealanders have been told that even that last tattered shred of reassurance is probably no longer available. Reputable scientists from east and west have told us that the global  climatic and long-term biological consequences of a nuclear war would be much more severe than had been previously thought. What is more  that would be the case if even a relatively small part of existing nuclear arsenals was used or if the weapons were used only against so-called counter-force or military targets. The scientists have also told us that nuclear war in the north may generate a nuclear winter in the south as well. They have gone further and advised us that there is a possibility of the self- inflicted extinction of the human species. That  we are told  is what could flow from the deliberate  if irrational  act  the mistake  the miscalculation or the accident.9.	To New Zealanders this is a truly appalling state of affairs. Refinements or modifications of the predictions which the scientists have made about the consequences of nuclear war may be made as a result of further work  but they will concern only the exact range of utter disaster.10.	What the scientists have already made entirely plain to all of usâplainer than ever beforeâis that the nuclear weapons that may have helped to maintain an uneasy peace between two great countries for more than three decades have become a threat to the security and survival of countries and peoples everywhere. The situation we are facing is quite unlike any other with which the international community has had to grapple before. It is one from which  unpalatable though it may be to think about  no countryâ and  for that matter  no individualâcan back away. We shall not escape from it if the traditional prescriptions of great-Power politics are applied.11.	What the scientists have not demonstrated  of course  is that nuclear war will occur or that it is more likely now than it was in the past. But the question how close we may be to falling into the abyss does not take account of the essential point. The fact is that a nuclear war is possible  whether it is half a year or 100 years away or whether  as we all hope  it never occurs.12.	None of the nuclear-weapon States can tell us that it will not occur  that they will never do what they have in their power to do. The results of the use of nuclear weapons would be so grave that it is absolutely incumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States to do everything possible to avoid their use. And that would remain the case even if the consequences of nuclear war should be shown later to be only half or a quarter as bad as the scientists have predicted.13.	My Government can find no encouragement in the recent response of the nuclear-weapon States to this situation. The refinement and deployment of nuclear weapons continues apace. There are disquieting indications that the military competition between the super-Powers may  in the coming years  move to the new environment of outer space. Multilateral arms control negotiations are stalled and  in some cases  in danger of being discredited. I would ask the Soviet Union to respond positively to the United States invitation to resume key bilateral arms control talks in order to get a dialogue under way again.14.	My Government hopes that the two super-Powers will take a long hard look at the course of developments in the nuclear arms race. It is clearly in their own interests and in the interests of all of us to make a new and very much more determined attempt to reach agreements that will enable them to change direction. None of us underestimates the complexities involved in reaching agreements that will permit a mutual  balanced  verifiableâand very largeâreduction in existing levels of nuclear weapons. We are aware that it will not be easy to manage safely the transition to a more secure world where  as a stage in the road to their elimination  the number of nuclear weapons is drastically reduced and where innovations in weaponry  if they are to occur at all  are not of a kind that cause instability. That process will require trust and good will. It is also likely to require the taking of risks. But the most dangerous risk of all is to do nothing: to allow compulsive competitiveness to continue indefinitely.15.	We ask  in addition  of the Soviet Union that it reflect on the fact that many countries  of which New Zealand is one  have the greatest difficulty in under-standing its current reluctance to take part in bilateral arms control negotiations with the United States. The events that occurred between 1939 and 1945 gave the Soviet Union every reason to be concerned about preserving the peace. It will advance that cause by returning to the bargaining table and looking at ways and means of beginning the process of de-escalation.16.	Countries such as my own have to recognize that the contribution we can make to assist this process is limited; but we are bound to continue to try. There are several things we want to emphasize. The most urgent of these is the need for massive reductions in strategic nuclear arms. There are other things as well. New Zealand has  for many years  argued the case for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.17.	It needs to be understood that our advocacy of that measure is not prompted solely by the fact that one of the nuclear-weapon States continues  despite repeated pleas from all the countries in the region  to test its weapons in the South Pacific. We see a prohibition of the testing of nuclear weapons by any country in any environment as a critical first step in halting and then turning back the arms race. We have been disappointed at the lack of progress made in securing such a prohibition. My delegation will again at this session of the General Assembly sponsor a draft resolution which seeks to encourage and speed up that work.18.	A comprehensive test ban will also be of the greatest importance in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. Everything possible must be done to stop that from happening. My Government will want to take an active part in the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year. We see that Treaty as fundamental to world security.19.	There are  of course  other techniques of modern warfare which are not much less unpleasant than nuclear weapons. Biological weapons have already been outlawed. The need for a comprehensive agreement to outlaw the manufacture and use of all chemical weapons is another matter of concern to New Zealand. During the past year there appears to have been some prospect of progress in that direction. We urge the Conference on Disarmament to get on with the task.20.	If the international community is to chart a way out of the current impasse on nuclear weapons  this will be done through global measures in which the nuclear-weapon States will play the major role. But regional initiatives can also make a contribution. My Government regards the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) as a significant regional advance. We are also fully committed to  and will vigorously defend  the Antarctic Treaty  which demilitarized a whole continent to the south of New Zealand and prohibited the basing or testing of nuclear weapons and which  for more than 20 years  has effectively guaranteed the stability of that region.21.	Very recently  a new initiative has been taken in our part of the world. On the proposal of Australia and with the full support of my Government  the heads of Government of the 11 countries that make up the South Pacific Forum agreed on 28 August of this year  at a meeting in Tuvalu  on the desirability of establishing a South Pacific nuclear-free zone at the earliest opportunity. The heads of Government spelt out the principles that will be applied in the construction of such a zone. It was agreed that there should be no use  testing or stationing of nuclear devices in the South Pacific; that no South Pacific country would develop or manufacture or receive from others or acquire or test any nuclear explosive device; and that nuclear activities in the South Pacific would be conducted in accordance with applicable international principles and treaties  notably the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The meeting acknowledged the need for a South Pacific nuclear-free zone to respect the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight. It was accepted that South Pacific countries would retain their unqualified sovereign right to decide for themselves  consistent with the objectives of the zone  on their security arrangements and on such questions as the access to their ports and airfields by vessels and aircraft of other countries. It was agreed that in the course of the next year a draft of a treaty to establish the zone should be prepared.22.	This initiative represents  I believe  a major advance for the region. It would net  we know  spare us from the consequences of nuclear war but  when in place  it would significantly strengthen the existing measures  both global and regional  to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It would also  I believe  convey a clear signal that the South Pacific countries do not want their region to become an arena for rivalry involving nuclear weapons.23.	New Zealand would hope to be in a position to report to the General Assembly next year and  before that  to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that good progress has been made in creating a South Pacific nuclear-free zone. New Zealand and the other countries of our region naturally expect that  when the necessary work has been done within the region  all the nuclear-weapon States will co-operate with us to ensure that the zone becomes a reality.24.	The recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum turned its attention also to the evolving situation in New Caledonia.25.	The question is not really where that Territory is going. Rather  it is how it gets there  and at what pace. The French Government has  I believe  made a clear and irreversible commitment to self-determination for the peoples of New Caledonia. There is a particular mix of interests and problems that must be resolved carefully and by the people most directly concerned  that is to say  by all the ethnic groups that have a legitimate stake in the future of New Caledonia.26.	All members of the Forum agreed that the changes that are to come in New Caledoniaâand they must and will comeâshould be made speedily and peacefully  that is to say  without violence and without external interference. It is up to all parties concerned to exercise moderation. They must work together to achieve the kind of political future that satisfies the demands of a truly democratic and harmonious multi-ethnic society in New Caledonia.27.	A significant amount of progress has been made. A lot remains to be done. That was recognized at the Forum. There we were agreed that the process of decolonization would be advanced by a public statement from France about its commitment to independence for New Caledonia. We gave it as our view that the referendum planned for 1989 should be brought forward; 1989 was  we felt  too distant a date. And we suggested some intensification of preparation for the country's eventual independence to ensure the full and active participation of the Kanak people in the country's educational  vocational and administrative life.28.	We called too  at that Forum  on the Independence Front to play its part in the early and peaceful evolution of New Caledonia to independence by recognizing the need for independence to reflect fully the multiracial nature of New Caledonia.29.	What we stressed above all was the crucial role of dialogueâthat those involved should keep talking to each other. That was the message which the Tuvalu Forum sought to convey to France and to the Independence Front. I am hopeful that an initiative taken by the Forum to foster the process of dialogue will soon get under way and that a group of Ministers from Forum countriesâincluding New Zealandâ will be able to talk to the leaders of the Independence Front and to the French Government to tell each of them about the concern of the countries in our part of the world that New Caledonia should move through conference and dialogue  not through confrontation and dispute  to independence. We in the South Pacific have always found solutions to problems through dialogue  discussion  consensus; and it is through dialogue and consensus that we wish to see New Caledonia take its rightful place soon in the community of the nations of the South Pacific.30.	Neither we nor our South Pacific partners want to see unwelcome external influences intrude upon events of New Caledonia  nor to see the transition to independence marred by an outcome that is not in accordance with the wishes of all those in New Caledonia who have made that country their permanent home. Our part of the world has been fortunate in that it has been free from the conflict and violence that have so often accompanied decolonization elsewhere. We do not want that record to be blemished. I am confident that it will not be.31.	If it is important to all of us living in the South Pacific that our region remain free from conflict  we are equally concerned to ensure that our backyard  the Antarctic  does not become an area of international rivalry and discord. I have already noted that the Antarctic Treaty demilitarized Antarctica. What is even more important  the Treaty provides the only possible guarantee that the region will continue to be free from international rivalry and conflict. The study on the question of Antarctica  submitted by the Secretary-General should help countries more remote from the region to understand the contribution the Treaty has made and continues to make to the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations. I hope it will convince them that the Treaty system  which is open to all Members of the United Nations  must be preserved and strengthened.32.	I referred a moment ago to a conviction that there has been an irrevocable commitment to self- determination for the people of New Caledonia. I wish I could say the same about the situation in southern Africa. Namibia continues to be unlawfully occupied by South Africa. The United Nations has had no choice but itself to accept a special responsibility for the Territory. It has guaranteed to its people that they will be able to exercise their right of self- determination. But that promise has been subverted by South Africa's determination to accept no settlement except on its own terms  and by the military power which reinforces the obstinacy and aggression that South Africa has also shown towards its other neighbours.33.	I wish  too  that it could be said that the agreements South Africa has recently concluded with neighbouring States signified a new era in the region. Regrettably  they do not appear to be agreements made willingly in order to resolve difficulties and develop closer working partnerships  or agreements in which peace and justice were equally sought by both sides.34.	Nor can it be said that the South African Government has offered justice to the people of South Africa in its new constitutional arrangements. There is not the slightest indication that it is ready to share political power with the black majority. Nor is there any sign that it is willing to dismantle the system. The essence of that system is unchanged. In recent and separate elections the Coloured and Indian communities have spurned the South African Government's attempt to draw them into an alliance and  by so doing  have confirmed their rejection of the apartheid system.35.	New Zealand likewise rejects apartheid and all it stands for. We are committed in our country to building a multiracial society based on freedom  justice and consent. The South Africans have already learned that my Government will not compromise with a system that rejects those values.36.	If my Government believes that there is today more reason than ever before to keep the basic issue of war and peace right at the top of the agenda of the United Nations  we also see an urgent need to move quickly and firmly to tackle the economic problems facing the world.37.	The world economy is just beginning to emerge from the worst trial it has known for over 30 years. Investment and production have increased  inflation is down and world trade is increasing. But doubts persist. Unhappily  even now many countries have yet to benefit significantly from the recovery in some of the leading industrial economies. The international financial system has shown enough flexibility to survive the recent crisis. That is a relief. But it is hard to feel very optimistic about the future when many countries are still struggling to meet their financial obligations and in many others large numbers of people are actually facing starvation.38.	The protracted debates in international forums during the past few years have not done much to alleviate the real problems confronting us. New Zealand would like to encourage the development of a gradual movement towards pragmatism and compromise. New Zealanders have never seen much prospect of resolving the world's economic problems through confrontation. Dialogue and consensus are the techniques that we are trying to use in our own country  and they seem to us to hold out the best chance of success on the international scene.39.	The recent economic crisis has had at least one good result. During the past year or so  it has become widely recognized among industrialized as well as developing countries that  despite the role that international financial institutions have played in supporting the adjustment and development efforts of individual countries  the present international system is not working well. If proof is still required it can easily be found in the debt problem  on the one hand  and the problem of protectionism  on the other. More and more  international trade is escaping the multilateral rules that should safeguard the interests of all countries  including the smaller among them. The need for an overhaul is pressing. The task now is to find the right technique for the jobâthat is  a technique that will work. New Zealand has been active in the search for an acceptable and effective procedure for dealing with the problem. New Zealand supports a comprehensive review of the trade and payments system.40.	Before I finish I want to reaffirm my faith and my country's in the United Nations. Nowadays there are many people who question the usefulness of the Organization for their own countries if not for the world at large. I am not one of them. I believe that the Charter of the United Nations is the foundation of the system of international relations under which we have all lived for nearly 40 years. I believe that the essential function of the United Nations under the Charter is to discourage the use of force by one State against another. I believe that the Organization has played a part in saving us all so far from the catastrophe of a third world war. I belong to a generation in my country which has never experienced at first hand the ravages of war in the sense of the amount of fear that war brings  and throughout my lifetime the United Nations has symbolized  as it has coexisted with a level of peace for which we yearn  the fact that multilateral arrangements can be of benefit to the human race. I believe that the United Nations has an important contribution to make towards bringing the nuclear arms race under control and freeing us from the fear of nuclear war. I believe that I and all New Zealanders and our children can rest more peacefully because of the work that is done within the United Nations  and I believe that that is true for all peoples on our Earth."
"106",5385,"OMN",39,1984,"ï»¿I take great pleasure  Sir  in extending to you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am quite confident that your wisdom and competence will contribute to the success of this session. It is also my privilege to express our profound gratitude to Mr. Jorge Illueca  the President of Panama  for the able manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session.119.	I should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Secretary- General for the efforts he has made since he took office and to wish him every success in dealing with the difficult tasks facing the international community.120.	It is a pleasure for me to welcome Brunei Darussalam  under the leadership of Sultan Hassan Al-Bolkiah to membership of the United Nations.121.	Today  more than ever before  there is a growing sense of instability in the world. Threats of armed conflict increase  with no sign on the horizon that could make us hope that solutions will be found. Similarly  the anxiety and fear felt especially among the third-world nations  to which we belong  increase the possibility that  in any one of the hotbeds of tension  the situation will deteriorate into outright war.122.	The stage of international affairs that we are witnessing at present is particularly disturbing. On the one hand  there is an ever increasing feeling of insecurity and a tendency to resort to the use of force rather than to seek mutual understanding for the settlement of conflicts  while  on the other hand  the economic situation is constantly deteriorating.123.	It significant results achieved by the United Nations in humanitarian fields pale in comparison to the tragedies of war  the killings  the displacement of innocent people  the poverty and hunger that threaten millions of human beings. This is so true that any reference to achievements becomes there attempt to escape from reality.124.	The deterioration in the international political and economic situation has been and is being brought about by a growing trend towards the threat or use of force  continued interference in the internal affairs of States  exploitation of certain States by others and violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of many of them; and all this is combined with the heightening of confrontation between the super-Powers  the revival of the cold war  and the competition for spheres of influence  heralding an increased possibility of general confrontation.125.	Given that situation  it is necessary to intensify our efforts to observe more strictly the international legal norms and the principles and Charter of the United Nations  and to respect and implement the Organization's resolutions. The United Nations is the only organization capable of ridding mankind of the spectre of chaos  war and hunger.126.	The Assembly's agenda is composed of numerous  complicated items requiring concerted action by all countries of the world. Perhaps one of the most important and complex matters that have faced the Organization since its establishment is the question of the Palestinian people. It is now high time for Israel to understand that the only road to peace is through dialogue and negotiation  leading to a just solution that will restore the dignity of the Palestinian people and ensure their legitimate right to self- determination  including the right to establish their own independent State. Israel must also understand that resort to the use of force cannot guarantee its peace or security. It will not be able to achieve stability or ensure its interests if it persists in ignoring the interests of the Palestinians and continues to violate the sovereignty and security of neighbouring States.127.	Israel's rejection of the various peace initiatives and its frustration of all attempts to solve the Palestinian question make it responsible for the state of war and tension prevailing in the Middle East.128.	The Sultanate of Oman  which has supported all the efforts of those who seek peace in the region and work to achieve it  endorses the Geneva Declaration on Palestine calling for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  in which all the interested parties would participate. The endorsement by the General Assembly  at its last session  of the guidelines of the Geneva Declaration calling for the attainment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable  legitimate rights is an important step in the context of international efforts to achieve a political settlement of this conflict. We understand full well  however  that no conference will succeed without the participation of all the parties concerned.129.	We consider the Palestinian-Jordanian rapprochement  as evidenced by the continued and intensified bilateral talks  to be a positive and encouraging factor for mobilizing the Arab efforts and setting the stage for decisive action aimed at achieving a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.130.	For the past two years  Lebanon has been subjected to the burden of the Israeli presence in its country. The continued occupation of southern Lebanon by Israel reveals that the reasons given are illogical and mere attempts to justify Israel's brutal invasion of Lebanon. We demand that Israel cease its violation of Lebanese territory and withdraw unconditionally therefrom.131.	We are pleased to see today that the people of Lebanon are in the process of recovering from their ordeal  having formed a national Government which has begun to restore their confidence and security and to put a halt to all practices contrary to their independence  sovereignty and unity.132.	During the course of this year  the shelling of oil tankers of the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council  which were sailing between the ports of countries that are not engaged in the hostilities  constituted a clear attempt to expand the scope of the war between Iran and Iraq. Freedom of navigation is a principle which every Member of the international community recognizes and protects. Any violation of security and navigation in the Gulf regionâa region of vital economic and strategic importanceâcan lead to interference in the region on the part of the super-Powers. Therefore  we call for compliance with Security Council resolution 552 (1984)  which expresses the concern of the international community to ensure the freedom and safety of navigation in the region.133.	Oman noted with great satisfaction the acceptance by both Iraq and Iran of the Secretary-General's proposal  which resulted in an end to attacks against all cities in the two countries. Oman also supports all efforts and contacts initiated by States of the region with a view to reaching an early settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. We appeal to Iran to respond to those peace overtures  which serve the interests of the peoples of the two countries and the region as a whole  in the same positive manner in which Iraq has responded.134.	Recently  several ships in the Red Sea suffered damage as a result of mines. Endangering international maritime transport is an irresponsible act  and we call upon the international community to take a strong stand against that act. We also commend the work undertaken by certain States in clearing the navigation routes of the Red Sea of mines in order to make them safe and navigable.135.	Almost five years have elapsed since the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union took place. Despite resolutions of the United Nations and appeals from non-aligned countries and the Islamic world  the Muslim people of Afghanistan are still subjected to foreign domination. While we appreciate the efforts exerted by the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General  we cannot accept the continuation of this state of affairs as a de facto situation. We demand the immediate withdrawal of the Soviet troops and call for a peaceful solution which will ensure the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan and a safe and honourable return of the refugees to their homeland.136.	In South-East Asia  a solution is yet to be found to the problem of Kampuchea. We reiterate our call for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchean territory. We continue to support the Association of South- East Asian Nations in its efforts to work out a solution to the Kampuchean problem and to bring about national unity and self-determination for the people of Kampuchea without any foreign interference.137.	Conflicts and instability remain a cause for concern in the Horn of Africa. Oman takes great interest in the events unfolding in that area. We urge that an end be put to attempts at interference in the internal affairs of the States of the region.138.	We reiterate our condemnation of the apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa  which is contrary to the norms of international and humanitarian conduct. We hold the racist Government of South Africa responsible for the failure of the negotiations on Namibia  held at Lusaka last May  and at Mindelo  Cape Verde  in July. The obstacles South Africa introduced to impede the negotiations are part of a ruse by which it seeks to perpetuate the oppression of the Namibian people and the exploitation of their natural resources. We urge once again that efforts be continued to enable the Namibian people to gain the right to self-determination and independence.139.	The Indian Ocean remains the scene of rivalries between the super-Powers. By virtue of our geographic location as a coastal State and our membership of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  we are intent on implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We strongly urge that an end be put to the escalation of competition between the super-Powers for spheres of influence in this region. While we are satisfied to a certain extent by the limited progress which was achieved at the meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  held in July last year  particularly in regard to the draft agenda  we call on the Committee to intensify its efforts to conclude its preparatory work so that the Conference on the Indian Ocean can be held in the first half of 1985.140.	We are following with concern the tensions and violence in Central America. The settlement of disputes  whether internal or external  must be pursued on the basis of respect for the rights of peoples and the sovereignty of States. Intervention by the super-Powers in the internal affairs of States of the region must not be allowed. We call on the Contadora Group to continue its endeavours to formulate a solution that will ensure a return of stability and peace to the States of the region.141.	The call for disarmament is no longer a political question but  rather  a matter of human survival cr. this planet. The continued escalation of the arms race  especially the nuclear arms race  has created an explosive international situation  characterized by an increased dependence on force  and has led to insecurity and instability in international relations and to the waste of enormous sums and economic resources at a time when millions are suffering from extreme poverty  hunger and unemployment. We wish to express our concern and disappointment at the breakdown of the Geneva talks on disarmament. We urge all parties to resume those talks and effectively to eliminate weapons of mass destruction  which could cause total annihilation  but which some claim are of a defensive nature.142.	The international economic situation is in no better shape than the state of co-operation in the political and security areas. There is chaos in the international monetary system  while the shrinking of international trade  fluctuation in the prices of raw materials  proliferation of protectionism  constraints on the flow of capital and high interest rates continue to aggravate the balance-of-payments deficits in the developing countries  increase their indebtedness and diminish their ability to service the debtsâa series of events which has led to the bankruptcy of some of those countries.143.	We are all aware that the existing systems are incapable of solving the problems faced in the global economy. The lack of confidence between developed and developing countries and the narrow and subjective perspective in the approach to the crisis are the reasons for the failure of all North-South forums  including the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984.144.	The international economic crisis requires an immediate and comprehensive solution which will take into account the legitimate interests of all States. In spite of all the difficulties we have encountered  we still consider that collective and constructive dialogue  in which all States participate on an equal footing  is the best way to resolve the problems facing us and to identify and adopt long-term measures and reforms."
"107",5431,"PAK",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. My delegation is particularly happy that this office is being held by the representative of a country with which Pakistan enjoys close bilateral ties and shares common views. His unanimous election as President is a tribute to the constructive role that Zambia has consistently played in the quest for a just international order. It also recognizes his personal qualities of statesmanship and wisdom and his dedication to the cause of decolonization  freedom and justice. Let me assure him that he will have the full co-operation and sincere good wishes of my delegation.178.	I would also like to express the deep gratitude of my delegation for the great skill and dedication with which Mr. Jorge Illueca guided the deliberations of the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session.179.	It is a special pleasure for me to extend my warmest congratulations to Brunei Darussalam on its accession to membership in the United Nations and to welcome its delegation to our midst. As a fellow Asian and Islamic country  Pakistan has already established a cordial and fraternal relationship with Brunei and we look forward to working in close cooperation with it in the United Nations and in other international forums.180.	Allow me to express our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in the pursuit of international peace and security. Since he assumed office  we have admired his annual reports to the General Assembly not only for their evaluation of the achievements of the Organization but  equally  for their candid analysis of its inadequacies and recommendations for remedial measures.181.	This year again  as we undertake preparations to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  the Secretary-General's important report on the work of the Organization emphasizes the imperatives of strengthening multilateralism and revitalizing the role of the United Nations as mankind's only institution for the preservation of international peace and security.182.	The thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly has had an auspicious beginning because  after a long night of confrontation between the major Powers  we may well be witnessing the first light of a new dawn. It is our earnest wish that the hopes of a thaw in relations among the major Powers may not only be sustained but become a prelude to a new phase of detente in the interest of global peace and progress.183.	In an age in which the very survival of civilization is threatened  it is imperative that a beginning be made to break away from the pursuit of global domination and regional hegemony  which have so often brought countries of the world into apocalyptic conflicts.184.	The international community has before it a clear agenda which must be addressed in the interest of a peaceful and secure future. There are regional conflicts awaiting peaceful settlement and situations of colonial and alien domination that need to be rectified. There is the arms race  particularly the growth of nuclear arsenals which cast a shadow over the future of mankind. Accompanying these grim realities of the international situation  misery and deprivation afflict a vast section of humanity and an inequitable international economic order persists as a legacy of the past and continues to accentuate the gap between the poor and the rich.185.	International peace will remain elusive so long as powerful nations continue to resort to the use of force with impunity and until the frontiers of smaller nations are secure and their right to seek freedom and self-determination is fully respected.186.	Pakistan firmly believes that the security of smaller and medium-sized nations can be assured in an international environment of peace  stability and progress. In pursuit of these objectives  Pakistan has made unremitting efforts to promote co-operative and good-neighbourly relations and to seek peaceful solutions to the problems in our region. This attitude is clearly manifest in the sincere efforts made by Pakistan to find a peaceful settlement of the grave situation created by the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan  which continues to be a cause of deep concern to us and to the international community.187.	Ever since our independence  successive Governments of Pakistan have sought to develop fraternal relations with Afghanistan based on the historic ties that bind our two peoples and on the imperative of mutual co-operation dictated by geography  economic interdependence and political realities. Consistent with these objectives  Pakistan has continued to extend its hand of friendship to whichever Government was in power in Afghanistan.188.	The foreign military intervention in Afghanistan in 1979  however  brought about a fundamental change in that country. An indigenous national movement  directed against the presence; of foreign troops and the regime imposed by them  began a struggle for liberation throughout the length and breadth of Afghanistan. The ensuing conflict has witnessed ruthless military operations to stamp out the heroic struggle of the Afghans and has forced millions of Afghans to leave their homeland in order to seek shelter in neighbouring countries.189.	As a neighbour  Pakistan has been affected by these convulsions and has given refuge to over 3 million Afghans who have fled their country. We have provided them with shelter and with means of sustenance in accordance with our Islamic and humanitarian obligations. We shall continue to do so within our limited resources until conditions are created inside Afghanistan that will enable these unfortunate people to return to their homes in safety and honour.190.	Apart from the human suffering it has caused  the military intervention in Afghanistan has radically altered the environment of security in the region. It has created a potentially dangerous situation and has contributed to the heightening of international tension. The persistence of military intervention in this non-aligned country constitutes stark defiance of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States and the non-use of force in inter-State relations.191.	For Pakistan  the danger is direct and tangible  as is evident from the continuing violations of our territory from the Afghanistan side  which have resulted in tragic loss of innocent lives and damage to property. Recently  there has been a sharp escalation in the intensity and frequency of these violations. Last August  54 innocent lives were lost in incidents involving shelling and bombardment of our territory. The latest such attack  which occurred only last Thursday  took a further toll of 32 lives. The Government of Pakistan takes an extremely serious view of these wanton attacks  which have aggravated the situation on our northern borders. Pakistan has so far acted with restraint  and it hopes that the concern of the international community over the continuation of such attacks and their dangerous consequences will compel those responsible to desist from further aggression.192.	For Pakistan  therefore  as indeed for the entire international community  the continued occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces is a matter of utmost concern. We are deeply aware that the situation in Afghanistan does not admit of a military solution and can only be resolved through political means. We have  therefore  been working sincerely for a political settlement that would restore peace and stability to the region.193.	In our search for a solution to the Afghanistan problem  we have recently concluded another round of indirect talks through the intermediary of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General. This round has marked a further step forward in the diplomatic process initiated two years ago. We remain confident that this dialogue will ultimately lead to an honourable negotiated settlement. For our part  we will continue to extend our full co-operation to the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General in his search for a comprehensive settlement based on the principles enunciated by the United Nations.194.	The establishment of tension-free and good- neighbourly relations between Pakistan and India is clearly of crucial importance in bringing about a secure and tranquil environment in which peoples of these two countries can devote themselves fully to the urgent tasks of national development. Pakistan has  therefore  assiduously endeavoured to build up a climate of confidence  understanding and mutual trust with our neighbouring country. We are fully aware that the path we have chosen for ourselves may be long and arduous  but we shall remain undaunted by temporary set-backs in pursuing the charted course of peace and good-neighbourly relations.195.	Our offer to India in 1981 of a non-aggression pact remains an important initiative designed to remove mistrust and fear. We have also given constructive consideration to the proposal of a treaty of peace and friendship. Negotiations between the two Governments to evolve an integrated text made encouraging progress last May  and we remain confident that the gaps between the respective positions of the two sides can be bridged.196.	In accordance with our established policy of promoting good-neighbourly relations with India  we remain prepared to revive and intensify the negotiations and to take concrete steps to build mutual confidence and promote co-operation between the two countries. In the same spirit  we seek a just and honourable settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir question  which will ensure lasting harmonious relations and durable peace between the two countries.197.	The seven nations of the South Asian region  which together constitute a quarter of humanity  are today engaged in a vigorous and determined effort to increase and institutionalize their mutual co-operation for the economic and social progress of their people  in accordance with the principles of sovereign equality and mutual benefit. Pakistan has participated actively in this process because we believe that it will help to improve the living conditions of our people. It will also promote an atmosphere of confidence  stability and harmony in our region. Considerable progress has already been made in setting up a framework for South Asian regional co-operation  and we look forward to the summit conference next year  which would in itself be a landmark in the promotion of peace and understanding in the region.198.	As a littoral State on the Indian Ocean  Pakistan is fully committed to the goal of a zone of peace in the area  which it regards as an important element in the quest on the part of the Indian Ocean States for peace and security. We view the convening of a conference or the Indian Ocean as a step in that direction. We believe that the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area requires practical measures that would lead to the elimination of great-Power rivalry and military presence and the prohibition of nuclear weapons from the Ocean and from the territories of the littoral and hinterland States. States in the region would also have to commit themselves to settle peacefully all outstanding disputes and to ensure that a climate of confluence  peace and security should exist among themselves.199.	In our relations with the major Powers  we have adhered scrupulously to the policy of non- alignment  consistent with the interests of peace and security in our region. We will not be party to any military blocs or alliances  nor will we grant any military bases to outside powers or engage in collusion with one against the interest of the other. Development of our relations with the major Powers  as with other States  is on the basis of bilateralism and mutual benefit  and we desire to see the major Powers help in the promotion of peace in our region.200.	The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq  now in its fifth year  has already taken a vast toll in human life and has caused massive destruction of national wealth. The people of Pakistan are deeply anguished at the continuation of this conflict  which serves the interest of neither the belligerents nor any other country in the region.201.	If the conflict continues unrestrained  the flames that consume Iran and Iraq today are likely to affect other States in the region and to attract the involvement of outside Powers in this strategic part of the world. Pakistan has  therefore  made incessant efforts by using all its resources  bilaterally or as a member of the Islamic Peace Committee  to bring about an early end to this fratricidal conflict. We deplore its continuation and we deplore its expansion in the form of the use of chemical weapons and attacks on international shipping. We once again urge the belligerents to respond to the desire of the international community to end the hostilities and support all international efforts towards achieving peace  including the mediatory role of the Secretary- General  which deserves a rich tribute  particularly for its success in securing an agreement on the cessation of attacks on civilian population centres.202.	The Middle East question has been on the Assembly's agenda for more than three decades and remains the most explosive issue threatening international peace. At the heart of the issue are the Israeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian lands  the denial of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the relentless Israeli expansion against its Arab neighbours. Instead of responding to the opportunities offered by peace  Israel has persisted in its design to annex territories occupied by it since 1967 and has embarked on a systematic policy of changing the historic character of these territories  especially through the establishment of settlements.203.	Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon represents a new dimension in Israeli expansionism and its attempts to assert its diktat in the area. While compounding the Middle East conflict  the Israeli invasion of Lebanon has given rise to a new wave of violence in the area.204.	In spite of Israeli intransigence  the international community has repeatedly made proposals that could lead to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Last year  the General Assembly called for an International Peace Conference on the Middle East. In September 1982  Arab leaders offered the elements of a peace plan at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez. Proposals were offered by President Reagan  and the most recent proposals were made by the Soviet Union last July. All these initiatives demonstrate that the avenues of a just settlement remain open. What is required  however  is a concerted effort by the international community to compel Israel to respond positively to these initiatives with a view to recognizing the imperatives of peace and security in the region.205.	The principles on which a Middle East settlement must be based are clear and have been affirmed repeatedly. These include: withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the territories occupied by it since 1967  including Jerusalem; attainment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  including the right of an independent state in Palestine; the right of the PLO to represent the Palestinian people and to participate on an equal footing in all peace efforts.206.	The fulfilment of these conditions alone can ensure peace and security for every State in the Middle East. Any effort to achieve this objective by circumventing the essential imperatives for peace is destined to prove counter-productive.207.	Pakistan's commitment to the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States is also reflected in the position adopted by it on issues concerning regions located far away from us. Accordingly  we have consistently supported the international call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and the restoration of the right of its people to determine its own destiny free from external interference or pressure. Pakistan supports the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  the lawful Government of the country  in its struggle for national liberation and independence. It remains our hope that Viet Nam  whose people themselves suffered deeply from the privations of war  will recognize the futility of its presence in Kampuchea and respect the world demand for the unconditional withdrawal of its forces.208.	We also oppose any meddling by outside Powers in the affairs of the countries of Central America  whose peoples are engaged in a struggle to overcome deep-rooted socio-economic problems inherited from the past. The peace initiative of the Contadora Group offers the best hope for harmony and progress in the region and deserves the support of all countries.209.	It is an affront to mankind that vestiges of colonialism and racism should survive in southern Africa. We are convinced that  before long  the valiant people of Namibia and South Africa  who are waging a heroic struggle against colonialism  racism and apartheid  shall be free. Pakistan fully supports their struggle and will rejoice with them in their final triumph.210.	In South Africa  the racist Pretoria regime is pushing a new racial constitution in a sinister attempt to perpetuate the system of apartheid in new forms. In Namibia  it continues to resort to a combination of subterfuge and aggression to deny independence to the people of Namibia.211.	Pretoria has sought to obstruct the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia by linking it to extraneous issues and by intensifying its brutal repression of the people of the territory. As the just struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  continues  it is vital that the international community bring maximum pressure on Pretoria to secure early and faithful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We also affirm our solidarity with the front-line and neighbouring States  which have been frequent victims of Pretoria's aggression because they uphold the cause of justice and freedom in South Africa and Namibia.212.	In this nuclear age  disarmament is a moral imperative. In an absolute sense  the arms race threatens the survival of mankind and  while it continues  it represents a sinful waste of human and material resources. The build-up of nuclear stockpiles and the new dimensions of the arms race now reaching outer space have outgrown the logic and rationale of deterrence and only serve to bring closer the stark prospect of the extinction of human civilization. The arms race cannot continue unrestrained. It must be halted and reversed.213.	We are convinced that the absence of negotiations would only fuel  rather than control  the nuclear arms race. We therefore regret the continued breakdown of bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear forces and the suspension of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks  and we earnestly hope for an early resumption of negotiations.214.	The issue of the arms race concerns all peoples and  accordingly  the United Nations must play a central role in advancing the collective international thinking on disarmament for the promotion of its objectives. The lack of tangible progress on disarmament issues within the United Nations framework  therefore  remains for us a source of concern. Within the world body and also outside it  pressure must be maintained to outlaw the further development of weapons of mass destruction and to prevent the extension of the arms race to outer space.215.	The specific initiatives taken by Pakistan within the framework of the United Nations for negative security guarantees for non-nuclear States and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia stem from a comprehensive approach that we pursue in matters relating to disarmament. We feel that all efforts in the field of nuclear or conventional disarmament  whether global  regional or bilateral  or whether long-term or interim  are worthy of support by the international community. Similarly  we discern a valid co-relation between disarmament and the global security environment  and we stress the need for confidence-building measures  as experience has shown that goals of disarmament cannot be achieved in a political environment of tension and conflict.216.	Pakistan's abiding commitment to nuclear non-proliferation is reflected in our unqualified support for disarmament measures advanced in the United Nations framework  our consistent pursuit for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  our initiative for a joint declaration for non-acquisition of nuclear weapons by the States of the region  our offer to our neighbour India concerning inspection of nuclear facilities on a reciprocal basis  as well as our preparedness to explore ways to keep our area free of nuclear weapons. As repeatedly affirmed by President Zia-ul- Haq  Pakistan is committed  and shall remain committed  not to develop nuclear weapons or allow their deployment on its soil.217.	The deepening international economic crisis is evident in the world-wide phenomena of a steep decline in the level of economic activity by diminishing investments  increasing protectionism and a high level of unemployment. The developing countries have been its worst victims. Their vulnerable economic and social systems have been ravaged by the crisis  which is compounded by deterioration in their terms of trade  a reduced level of external demand for their goods  high interest rates  a reduced flow of official and private resources and a crushing and unprecedented burden of external debt. Efforts to improve this intolerable situation have been thwarted by the absence of political will on the part of the industrialized countries to engage in a meaningful dialogue on finding long-term solutions to the problems of the international economy.218.	The failure of successive gatherings  such as the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on. Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  is yet another reminder of the negative attitude of the developed countries  whose apathy towards the plight of two thirds of the world's population is reflected in the fact that even the Committee on the Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade failed to reach any agreement. Yet another example of this negative attitude is the failure of the Economic and Social Council  at its second regular session this year  to agree on measures in favour of the African countries  whose critical economic situation  aggravated by drought and famine  is recognized by all.219.	Claims of recovery by certain developed countries are of no solace to the developing countries which continue to suffer from present recessionary trends.220.	The undeniable interdependence between the economies of the developed and developing countries and the recognized need for an orderly and stable international economic system make it imperative that a dialogue commence in the interest of equitable economic relationships.221.	For five years now  the international community has been considering a proposal for a simultaneous  coherent and integrated examination of international economic relations by launching ""global negotiations"". It is indeed regrettable that these negotiations have not yet been launched in spite of broad agreement reached in 1979 at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  when it adopted resolution 34/138  and in 1980 during the eleventh special session.222.	The developing countries have made efforts to satisfy the concerns of the industrialized countries in regard to certain aspects of these negotiations. They have also shown flexibility  as is evident from the proposals of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983. We hope that the industrialized countries will show sensitivity to the need for a more stable and equitable international economic system by adopting a flexible and positive attitude towards these proposals.223.	The promotion of co-operation among developing countries is an important element in their endeavour to improve the well-being of their populations and rationalize their own economies. The efforts in most of those countries to bring about the necessary economic adjustment have often been undertaken at great economic  social and political cost. Though their achievements may have been uneven  their commitment cannot be faulted. While those efforts are important  they are not an alternative to a healthier and more co-operative relationship between the developed and developing countries.224.	We hope that the present session of the General Assembly will prove to be a turning-point in the impasse in the dialogue between the developed and the developing countries and provide the setting for the adoption of measures leading to the restoration of confidence in international economic cooperation and to the establishment of the new international economic order.225.	The international community today faces issues of a magnitude never faced by it before. The spectre of nuclear annihilation  the deprivation suffered by a vast section of humanity and the stunning pace of contemporary technological advance present unprecedented dangers  challenges and opportunities. The question that confronts us today is whether we have the imagination and the courage to act in concert to ensure an era of peace and progress for this generation and those succeeding it. Peace and survival cannot be taken for granted in the present age. Left to itself  our world will drift towards war and self- annihilation. A conscious  determined and collective effort is imperative to fulfil the vision of the United Nations for a peaceful  just and prosperous world."
"108",5474,"PAN",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  your election to the Chair at this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly represents just recognition by the international community of your merits and personal qualifications and of your political and diplomatic experience  amply demonstrated in the United Nations as well as in other international forums which have had the benefit of your participation.4.	Panama highly values your important efforts as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  a post which you have carried out for the last five years with exemplary dedication and effectiveness and a post in which you have made a most valuable contribution to the complete liberation of Africa and to the struggle to uphold the principles of the self determination of peoples and national independence. My delegation would like to welcome most warmly Brunei Darussalam  which became a Member of the United Nations last week. We hail its entry into the Organization as a sign of our era  an era in which we are moving steadily along the path of decolonization and towards the goal of the universality of the United Nations.6. I should like to join the voice of my delegation to the unanimous tribute which delegations have paid to the Secretary General. His tireless efforts to promote peace and his constant dedication to the achievement of international cooperation deserve the profound recognition of my delegation.7.	I should like to mention with special gratitude the official visit the Secretary General made to Panama in April of this year  which gave us a greater realization of the dedication with which Mr. Perez de Cuellar is carrying out the sensitive responsibilities entrusted to him by the international community.8.	The Secretary General may rest fully assured that Panama will encourage and support his efforts to tum the United Nations into a more effective Organization for the maintenance of international peace and security as well as the forum for the solution of the grave problems confronting mankind today.9.	Panama is located almost at the very centre of the western hemisphere  where  at the northern end of the Andes  it has a birdâs eye view of Central America and the Caribbean. Having a diversified ethnic  cultural and political makeup  my country has had  from the beginning  pluralistic neighbourly relations. At the same time  it offers the most expeditious route between the Atlantic and the Pacific  and in its settlement it merged men from the four comers of the world. It is precisely because of this geographical and intellectual situation that we at all times identify ourselves with the quest for harmony among the varied peoples of the Americas  who may not be united today but whose destiny is to be united in the future.10.	Inasmuch as it is a country characterized by the national personality of its people  the interoceanic and continental communications which are natural to the geographical location of Panama have linked it by culture with South America  the Antilles and the rest of the world. Hence our history  socioeconomic structures and culture identify and confirm us as a Bolivarian and Caribbean nation  while at the same time making us aware of our responsibilities as the neighbour of the Central American region.11.	That was indeed the vision of the liberator Simon Bolivar  when he aspired for us to be for the new world what Corinth was for classical antiquity. His dream began to forge a new reality when in 1826 he convened the Amphictyonic Congress in my country ""to obtain a system of guarantees which in time of peace or war would mark our new destiny"". This has been our mission in the past and it will continue to be our mission. In 1815  a well-known Venezuelan wrote about a republic which  crisscrossed by canals  would shorten distances in the world. Nine decades later  after we became a sovereign and independent Republic  we opened up an artificial waterway  thus speeding up world traffic.12.	These inter-ocean functions very early linked my country with the international community as a multilateral centre for trade and communication. Since the days of its discovery  after Balboa divided the southern sea in 1513  Panama has become the centre of geographic explorations through the Central and South American shores of the Pacific. During the three centuries of Spanish domination  we had the responsibility of being the meeting point for communications and trade of the metropolitan country and its overseas possessions. In time  this continued through rivers and over land  by means of a rail network  the canal  interoceanic pipelines  port systems  telecommunications and air navigation  the trade and banking complex  among others.13.	Although these physical structures imply worldwide functions  they are merely temporary means to enable us to utilize certain of our country's territorial attributes  which are part of the national Panamanian heritage. This is a very simple concept; yet paradoxically some have refused to understand it. The strategic geographical location of my country has time and again been the object of the greed of foreign Powers  which have exploited that part of our territory for their own benefit.14.	Nevertheless  my country has throughout history demonstrated its vocation to serve the international community  providing universal  effective  neutral  peaceful and safe access to the use of this natural attribute through various means of communication and exchange. We Panamanians ask only that our country should be used with respect for our sovereignty  integrity and national interests and that it should benefit in a suitable way the full development and the peace and security of our people and of our Latin American brothers.15.	The issues we wish to mention here before the international community are closely related to compliance with what I have just said.16.	First of all  it is our duty to inform the General Assembly about the implementation of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties' because of the importance of their proper implementation for world trade and communications and the very significant role of international solidarity and the United Nations in making it possible for the Treaties to be concluded and because of what compliance with those Treaties will bring to good relations and peace in the region.17.	The 1977 Canal Treaties were far from satisfying all the legitimate aspirations of the Panamanian nation. Nevertheless  we must emphasize the fact that they demonstrated the feasibility of finding a viable solution to a dangerous and complex colonial conflict between a small developing country and a major Power by means of a long and difficult process of negotiations  where both parties demonstrated the political will to make mutual and reasonable concessions on the basis of mutual respect for their sovereignty as nations.18.	This spared both peoples and all the users of the Canal inestimable damage and suffering and offered the entire international community an extremely valuable precedent. We are all morally bound to recall with constant gratitude the two courageous and visionary statesmen who were responsible for the Treaties  General Omar Torrijos and President Jimmy Carter.19.	Contrary to what was maintained by the opponents of the Treaties  ever since the colonial regime in the Cana! Zone was abolished and the bi-national regime and the joint administration were set up  the Canal has become much more efficient. When the Treaties came into force in 1979  the Canal was saturated with traffic and could service 13 000 vessels a year; today it can take 15 000. !n five years its daily capacity has grown from 37 to 42 vessels; waiting and transit time has been cut from 40 to an average of 23 hours. At the same time  the number of accidents to vessels in transit has diminished  despite the increase in their size.20.	With respect to the historic requirements of Panama  an important part of them has been completely or partially satisfied. On 1 October 1979  Panama regained jurisdiction over two thirds of the land and water under colonial occupation; it also regained control over its natural ports at both ends of the Canal. Many installations and infrastructure and service facilities were returned to Panama. The Canal itself and the most vital areas and installations remained under a bi-national regime of joint administration. On 31 March 1982  when the first stage of the transition period ended  the foreign police  courts and judges disappeared from the area and Panama gained full jurisdiction over its entire territory.21.	Following ratification of the Treaties  Panama has received payment of $352 419 000 for Canal operations. This is considerably less than the direct and indirect benefits received by its foreign counterpart and of course much less than my country legally deserves. Nevertheless  if the Treaties had not been agreed upon  Panama would have obtained only $9 800 000  the ridiculous sum paid to it under the colonial regime.22.	What is more important is that the Panamanian flag now flies throughout the former Canal Zone as the symbol of our full sovereignty  and in the areas still under temporary military occupation and where the United States flag still flies  the Panamanian national flag always has pride of place. Thus the words of General Omar Torrijos  who said that ""there is no colonialism that will last 100 years  nor Latin American who will put up with it""  are all the more relevant.23.	At the proper time  in compliance with the subsequent stages of the decolonization timetable agreed upon in the Treaties  on 1 October 1984 Panama will finally regain control of the areas and installations under military occupation at Fort Gul lick and the so-called School of the Americas and  more important  on 1 January 1990  the post of administrator of the Canal will be filled by a Panamanian. Panama is most determined that each stage should be complied with on time.24.	Progress with respect to the use of Panamanian workers in the administration  operations and maintenance of the Canal is much less satisfactory. The Treaties provide for a gradual increase in the proportion of Panamanian workers until  by 1999  there are no longer any foreign officials. However  already in 1979 more than 69 per cent of the labour force was Panamanian  and that figure has since increased only to 77 per cent despite the fact that there are many sufficiently qualified Panamanians. Those remaining from the colonial administration have been reluctant to give up the higher bureaucratic posts and so-called positions of trust  in particular  although such posts do not call for sophisticated technical knowledge.25.	The situation has been aggravated unjustifiably by the unilateral decision imposed by the United States majority which still exists in the Board of Directors of the bi-national Panama Canal Commission which directs the administration of the Canal. As a result of this  a number of privileges have been given to the United States officials working in the Canal administration  thus openly and directly discriminating against the Panamanian officials doing exactly the same jobs. This is a clear and direct violation of the 1977 Treaties  which explicitly prohibit all forms of discrimination on the basis of nationality and make no provision for the granting of such privileges.26.	To make matters worse  this measure  which was introduced in spite of the many earlier objections and protests by Panama  results in a heavy financial loss  which is being deducted from the earnings from the operation of the Canal  part of which belongs to the Panamanian side. Thus Panama is in the humiliating position of having to subsidize the cost of a measure which was adopted against its own better judgement and which constitutes an act of discrimination against its own citizens.27.	This is one more case of violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaties  which have been scrupulously observed by the Panamanian side. As in the majority of the other cases  these violations are based on the Murphy Law  Law 9670  which was adopted unilaterally by the United States Congress  on 27 September 1979  as internal legislation designed to govern the conduct of the United States Government in the process of the implementation of the Canal Treaties. This is a typical case of an illegal law which establishes provisions for one of the parties to a bi-national Treaty  contradicting what was ratified by both parties to that Treaty.28.	We refer only to the most flagrant and harmful aspects of the situation  and should give a few examples.29.	First  the Treaty clearly establishes that the rights and responsibilities of each of the two countries will be exercised through the Panama Canal Commission  which is a bi-national body  rather than directly by the respective Governments. It also states that the Board of Directors of that Commission  composed of representatives of both parties  is the supreme governing body. In accordance with the Treaty itself  the United States has a majority membership of the Boardâfive representatives as compared with four Panamanians. Following the ratification of the Treaties in both countries  Law 9670 attempts to turn the Canal Commission into a branch of the United States Executive  placing its leadership in the hands of the Secretary of Defence of that country and attempting to turn the Board of Directors into a mere supervisory board presided over by a representative of the Secretary of Defence. Thus it denies the essentially bi-national spirit of the Canal administration.30.	Secondly  the Treaties from the very beginning gave a slight numerical advantage to the United States side in the composition of the Board of Directors. Law 9670 further attempts to establish that there should be a quorum at the meetings of the Board only if there is present a majority of United States representatives  irrespective of the total number of members attending a particular sitting. In this manner  the presence of the Panamanian members is not taken into account for the determination of a quorum  and this places us in an inferior position.31.	Thirdly  this United States majority has imposed a so-called code of conduct on all the employees of the Canal  including the Panamanian representatives on the Board of. Directorsâdespite the fact that they voted to the contraryâand also the deputy administrator of the Canal  who is a Panamanian. Under this ""code"" the Panamanian representatives and the deputy administrator are assigned the status of United States employees  subject to the federal laws of that country  contrary to the Treaty  which defines them as Panamanian officials. This is contrary to the Treaty itself  which states that all the officials of the Canal must act in accordance with Panamanian labour laws.32.	Fourthly  Law 9670 attempts to apply on Panamanian territory United States federal laws and rules  giving the United States jurisdiction in our country even over Panamanian citizens and unions  contrary to what is contained in the Treaties ratified by both parties.33.	That is not all  but I have given sufficient examples to demonstrate the gravity of the situation and the consequences deriving from it. They are important not only because they are so many further violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaties freely entered into between both parties  but also because they impose onerous conditions which are harmful to the dignity and the interests of Panama. Thus  new  unnecessary conflicts are brought about  to the detriment of the good relations  understanding and cooperation envisaged in the Treaties  the proper development of which is thus impeded.34.	The other aspect of the discrepancies is that relating to the conditions of the protection and security of the Canal. The Panamanian attitude on this subject has always been based on the recognition that this is a sensitive Canal  whose best defence is neutrality and the universality of its services and whose best protection is the sympathy of the people residing in the area. As r sovereign nation Panama has a traditional vocation of neutrality and non-alignment in all matters relating to East West tensions and more particularly to its well-known decision to participate in actions of conciliation and peace-making in the Central American region. There is no need to elaborate on this  since everyone is aware that my country has taken an active part in the various efforts leading up to the Contadora process  is part of that process and provides the headquarters for its activities. Therefore  those who are friends and partners of Panama  particularly those friends carrying out activities on Panamanian territory  have the moral  political and legal duty to respect that stated vocation of country.35.	The 1977 Canal Treaties authorize the temporary prolongation of the presence of United States bases and troops on Panamanian national territory until the last day of this century  with the sole purpose of contributing to the protection of the Canal as it exists at present. Any activity of these bases and troops going beyond their exclusive mission of protecting the Canal runs counter to the Treaties allowing for their presence on the territory of my country. Hence we reiterate our protest against and rejection of the logistics  intelligence  planning or military training activities which are being carried out on Panamanian territory aimed against other countries in any region. Similarly  we repeat that such actions not only violate the letter of the Treaties and undermine Panamanian policies and sovereignty but also harm the interests of the other nations using the Canal. 36.	The international community and the United Nations made a significant contribution to the process that led to the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties  which have made and continue to make an effective contribution to mutual understanding and international peace and security and are a laudable precedent appreciated by all countries and organizations wishing to defuse disputes and foster peace and security. The proper implementation of the Treaties in all their aspects and at all stages meets the aspirations of all peoples  particularly the Latin American nations.37.	When Law 9670 was adopted  President Jimmy Carter engaged the word of the Chief Executive of the United States that the text would be revised jointly with Panama in order to bring it in line with the Treaties and with the interests of both countries. One of the Law's articles stipulates that the Law should be revised periodically. Nevertheless  in the last five years the protests of the Panamanian Government and its demands that the revision be conducted immediately have been constantly ignored and this has led to an accumulation of further violations  discrepancies and problems.38.	We should like once again to appeal  in the General Assembly  to international solidarity and understanding to ensure that the process of implementation of the 1977 Treaties be followed more closely and that nations friendly to Panama and to the United States seek their strict application. This appeal must consist in demanding the speedy revision of Law 9670 so as to bring it in line with the spirit and the letter of the Canal Treaties.39.	We would not wish this appeal to cloud the good relations existing between Panama and the United States. My country repeats this call precisely because we want to continue to improve these relations  and these violations are an obstacle to our aspirations. The United States introduced this law which is the source of the current problems  and it is therefore up to that country to take the appropriate steps. We trust that the good intentions of the United States authorities will be sensitive to this unanimous international appeal we are making here today.40.	Under the leadership of General Omar Torrijos  my country began important social and economic reforms which went hand in hand with a strengthening of national sovereignty and independence  and we are happy to say that there is no political violence in Panama at this time. However  such violence does exist in neighbouring countries which are still suffering from many structural injustices the effects of which are further exacerbated by the international economic crisis and the imbalances in the trade and financial relations existing between rich and poor countries.41.	The fact that there is an area of conflict nearby has given rise in Panama to a foreign policy basically aimed at contributing to the peaceful solution of the problems in the area by means of dialogue and political negotiations between all the parties to the conflict and at avoiding the exacerbation or generalization of conflict situations. This faith in genuine understanding among peoples has been confirmed throughout history  and we trust that it offers the best hope of hemispheric brotherhood in the future.42.	Thus  we consistently uphold the principle of Panamanian neutrality with regard to disputes between other countries in the area or between the great Powers. For this reason also  we endeavour to develop good relations with all nations of the area without exception  even though they may have political systems different from our own. As our experience has shown  dialogue and agreements jointly arrived at with all countries are the best way to protect the security and stability of each and of the international community as a whole.43. In the face of the dangerous deterioration of the regional situation  and in keeping with our experience  we prefer Panama to be a centre of understanding and conciliation rather than a party to confrontations. This basic principle has made my country one of the main sites for discussions to achieve peace in the world; the same principle animates the Contadora initiative.44 We can say today that Contadora has become one of the most important expressions of international political solidarity and an effective means for dialogue in the region. I need not repeat here the readjustment this initiative has accomplished through the Contadora declaration  the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America  the Document of Objectives and the document on measures to be taken to fulfil the commitments entered into in the Document of Objectives and the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. But it is worth recalling that this process has brought to the fore the fundamental principles which have inspired and given purpose to the initiative  that dialogue has become possible and that that dialogue has led to the identification of specific problems and many consensus understandings on the way to a solution. At the same time  it has been possible to contain the trend towards generalization of the state of war which a few years ago threatened the region. What has already been achieved makes it possible to envisage that the necessary agreements will be arrived at shortly to implement the Contadora objectives.45.	At a time of grave peril the world placed great hopes in Contadora. The complexity and very nature of the problem required a process that was both patient and bold  laborious and painstaking  and that also required discretion  despite demands for spectacular action which would not have truly helped. As is well known  the revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America  handed over to the five Central American Governments on 7 September 1984  reflects the observations which those Governments had formulated earlier with respect to the original version of that document following an extensive exchange of views.46.	This has made it possible to arrive at viable formulas of understanding which express the many points of agreement necessary to guarantee respect for sovereignty  mutual security and mutual respect and neighbourly relations between all countries in the areaâpreconditions to ensure the political stability and social and economic development required by the people of Central America. Therefore  it is now up to the five Governments to make their final comments on the revised Contadora Act  before 15 October  in order that they may sign it soon  at a forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the countries of Central America and of the Contadora Group.47.	When that has been done  it is above all the responsibility of the Central American Governments themselves to bring about an honourable and lasting peace. It is their duty to show the political will that they have repeatedly spoken about  by speedily adopting the legal commitments in the Contadora Act. Similarly  it is the duty of other Governments with interests in the region and links with it unequivocally to support the adoption and implementation of this agreement  with full respect for the self-determination and sovereignty of the Central American nations.48.	To state here that Contadora has played its role and that the Central Americans themselves now bear the main responsibility in no way means that Contadora's responsibilities are over  or that it has relinquished them  as some seem to think. Contadora's role will continue through its cooperation in orchestrating the agreement  but above all it must maintain an effective presence as long as peace continues to be threatened.49.	From now on the international community will have to redouble the solidarity that it has always given to these negotiating efforts. Its support is today more important than ever in calling on the Governments of all the countries concerned to sign and fully to implement the Contadora Act  and in asking those countries with interests in and links with the region speedily to subscribe to the Additional Protocol  thus committing themselves to contribute to peace and cooperation in Central America. In that way  everyone can contribute to bringing about the peace which the people of Central America  the continent and mankind deserve.50.	The amphictyonic vocation which Simon Bolivar gave to my country forms an indelible part of the national consciousness of Panamanians. Like the other Latin American countries  Panama is closely linked with its sisters in America  not only by our historic and cultural traditions but also by the present similarity and interrelationship of our structures  problems and aspirations  because of which nothing that affects other Latin Americans can be a matter of indifference to us. Moreover  since we share similar difficulties and goals  it is of course of necessity the duty of our nations to act together in ever more effective ways  so that we may save ourselves and develop together  for otherwise we shall sink separately.51.	As is well known  very serious trade and financial difficulties are part of the current problems of Latin America. The main causes of these problems are to be found beyond our borders and outside the control of our countries. There is a wise Japanese saying that the first thing a good businessman must desire is the prosperity of his customers. Indeed  that is the only thing that can develop the market  and only equity in the terms of trade can guarantee it. However  mistaken economic strategies by certain industrialized countries have resulted in turning their partners into debtors  stifling the market instead of contributing to its prosperity.52.	It is well known that the unjust and disorderly structure of international economic relations no longer corresponds to contemporary reality  resulting in harm to all the developing countries. To make matters worse  there is a growing deterioration in the terms of trade between the poor countries and the industrialized countries  the effects of which are worsened by the protectionist and restrictive measures imposed by the major economic Powers  and particularly by the artificial and unreasonable increase in interest rates.53.	Nevertheless  the major economic Powers still do not listen to our warnings. They have continued to ignore the urgent call for a North South dialogue  global negotiations and other initiatives. At the same time  they continue to overlook the fact that the freeze in the East West dialogue and the escalation of the arms race  with their inevitable budgetary and financial effects  are costly to the developing countries and are daily speeding up the deterioration of our economic situation  presenting the world with new threats.54.	Confronted with this situation  Latin America continues to show its political maturity  the best demonstrations of which are the Quito Declaration issued by the Heads of State or Government of the Latin American and Caribbean countries at the Latin American Economic Conference  held from 9 to 13 January this year and the Cartagena Consensus of 22 June.55.	Since it is the mistaken economic policies of certain industrialized nations and their financial organizations that have brought about this situation for the Latin American countries  those nations and creditor institutions can do no less than to accept that they share the responsibility for the present level of indebtedness. Furthermore  in view of the great social and political upheavals that the situation could cause  it is impossible to claim that the problem is exclusively financial or that the Latin American Governments should accept forced insolvency to please creditors who have forgotten their share of the responsibility. The problem requires serious political consideration  and there must be a joint solution  bearing in mind the interests of both sides  since the only answer is the structural improvement and the development of the Latin American economies.56.	The Government of the Republic of Panama  through me thanks the United Nations for its efforts for peace and mankind. We are convinced that not only our country but the whole international community will solve our problems on the basis of dialogue  political negotiation and mutual respect between States. That is the best contribution we can make for the benefit of our peoples."
"109",5521,"PER",39,1984,"ï»¿To come to the rostrum of the General Assembly is cause for deep emotion. One feels the mysterious force of world brotherhood even though this does not conceal the clouds on the horizon. We must place ourselves above all controversy and seek only peace. Our feelings at the beginning of this address are those of sympathy and solidarity with those who do not enjoy peace  with those whose lives are threatened and whose property is destroyed  with those who have faced fratricidal wars and have been maimed  with those who are the living testimony to acts of violence and intolerance.3.	Ore might wonder why the United Nations has not prevented those evil actions  but perhaps we fail to see how much suffering has been avoided by means of quiet and intense actions  how many tears have not been shed and how much blood has not been spilt as a result of the persistent efforts of this great universal institution. However  we cannot really live in tranquillity so long as peace does not prevail all over our planet. May our words and our deeds together work towards that lofty objective.4.	From this rostrum authoritative words have been spoken by high-ranking world dignitaries on questions relating to arms. I am not a special authority on those questions. For that reason I shall deal mainly with matters falling within my competence and the competence of Latin American nations: the threat of financial colonialism on the one hand  and the threat of terrorism on the other.5.	Following the oil crisis and the proliferation of Eurodollars  a change took place in credit systems. Great encouragement was given to the investment of these great flows of capital  and this imposed a responsibility on the debtor nations as well on the lenders. Enormous obligations were thus created  and now we face difficulties in trying to repay.2096.	World organizations have endeavoured to find formulas in this regard  and the formula most frequently resorted to is that of prescribing a drastic reduction in public expenditure  which can be7.	World peace requires that a solution be found to the problem of indebtednessâa realistic solution. Of course we accept advice with regard to seeking economic health. We welcome prescriptions  but we should not wish them to become a kind of death certificate. There must be a clear conception of the fact that austerity must go along with new measures towards development. All credit granted for development must be revised and brought into line with the conditions which prevail today. If we continue to follow the old patterns  paralysis will be inevitable  and that paralysis must be of fundamental concern to the United Nations  because it could be a prelude to war.8.	Here very often when the arms race and nuclear weapons are discussed one may perhaps see in them the major threat  and all our concerns are focused on them  but we must also consider the concern over wars in gestation which are based on economic problems  on unemployment  on malnutrition  which are brought about by an economic system that is not well suited to present-day realities.9.	Austerity without recession means  for us  a policy that would accept the principle of fiscal discipline  of cuts in so far as they are possible  but without going beyond what is possible. We all know that in our countries  particularly in Latin American countries  most of the budget is devoted to the payment of wages and services  and therefore only a very small part is devoted to public works and to capita! formation by the State. Therefore  of course  an exaggerated cut would tend to bring about the elimination of those items  and thus the State becomes a spectator rather than an actor. It ceases to be an important employer  and it defers works  usually having to do with public health  education  energy supplies and nutrition. We must therefore ask from this rostrum that the competent organs speed up the processes  that they seek better absorption of resources in world markets and that they grant credits speedily  attempting to reduce in so far as possible the local counterpart  because the lending of credit on the basis of a high local counterpart makes it almost impossible to use the funds.10.	In my country and in the Andean region generally  and most particularly in Ecuador and Colombia  our immediate neighbours  where we still see the tradition of an old society  where there are basic concerns  where we see what Toynbee used to speak about and admireâa very severe geographical challenge overcome by perseverance  effort and the talents of the Andean societyâthere  of course  in our remote past there was no international exchange. There was not even a monetary system. Let us recall that in Rome currency was as important as the sword. In the Andean civilization  which assumed Roman proportionsâif we drew a line from Pasto in Colombia to the Maule River in Chile  it would equal the distance from Gibraltar to Jerusalemâa system of justice was established  a system of solidarity based on a code of ethics. It was possible to maintain full suppliesâsupplies which we now long forâand a regime prevailed which heralded our present policy of social justice  during a time when people had to till the soil for the orphans  the widows and the disabled.! 1. Such a society  which some find Utopian and some find merely archaic  has left us with a basic teaching; it has shown us that it is possible to have governmental organization and social justice even in the absence of money. Today's world lacks moneyâ not completely  but in part. No one would ask that we go back  but we should note that there is a precedent and that justice and order can be attained even in the absence of money. That is the basic message of the Andean civilizations at this time when money is so scarce. That is why we seek this blending  not only of races  of Europeans and of the indigenous populations of our continent  but a blending which is expressed in all spheres of action and culture  and one that should not exclude a mixing of the economy.12.	For that reason  any proposal made to Latin America  and especially to those areas where the time-honoured traditions still prevail and the old population is found to be pure and almost intact  must go through a regional screen  a screen which allows for the reaffirming of national identity  a screen of realism; it must not be a foreign  alien and cold prescription.13.	There is a tendency to resolve economic problems in terms of balance  in terms of figures  in terms of red and black  but such balance sheets do not resolve the problem unless they take into account the political and social situation and  above all  the minimum standard of living which we all desire for our peoples.14.	I therefore take the opportunity of my presence at this august rostrum to reiterate the appeal which I have made in other forums for a change to be effected in the financial and credit systems at the international level so that we may assist our peoples to move forward.15.	In brief  our request is that at the economic and financial levels we resort to creativity and to imagination to provide the answer that we continue to seek. In the world today  the situation can be defined in terms of financial colonialism  and dependency can be as serious a question now as it used to be at the political level before the entire world awakened to freedom and before the creation of an organization of the broad scope of the United Nations in which the nations of the world are represented and through which all nations have access to the world debate and can make known their views on the basis of justice and equity.16.	We are also concerned about the problem of terrorism. Just as the arms race is a prelude to warâ and members of the Assembly have discussed that subject with authoritative expertsâterrorism is the anticipation of war; its objective is to create a climate that is likely to lead to bridgeheads or beach-heads from which conflagrations can emerge. Terrorism is typified by cowardice. Attacks  killings and destruction occur  after which the aggressor withdraws to the shadows. The economy of weak nations is damaged and discord is sown in places where solidarity had hitherto prevailed.17.	In Peru we have had the disagreeable experience that in part of the sierra there have been hostilities because of terrorist action. As a result  74 humble local government and education authorities have been cruelly and treacherously assassinated. At least 100 defenders of public order have lost their lives in the past three years  and hundreds of innocent and peaceful peasants  tradesmen and members of indigenous communities have also fallen. In some cases the aggressors too have lost their lives. But  for us  all blood shed is equally important and all suffering touches us.18.	We therefore hope that these terrorist movements  which always have international origins  may be wiped out. It is a fundamental task of the United Nations to put an end to them. To effect a cure is much more costly and complicated. We must eradicate the scourge of terrorism.19.	That this movement has arisen not from within the affected country but from without has been amply demonstrated by the fact that there is a well- thought-out strategy of destruction of the entire energy system. The main target is the electricity system of a country  a system built with much sacrifice and invested with the hopes of the people. Terrorists attempt to halt rural electrification  which we are all interested in advancing. Electricity towers are toppled  energy cables are cut  power-stations are blown up and communication lines are cut by the blowing up of bridges. Poor countries which have scarcely sufficient resources for their development  given the population explosion  find that they must use their resources not to create new wealth but to replace what has been destroyed by such cowardly acts.20.	The international nature of this problem is confirmed in the communication system because  whenever damage is done  the news automatically goes around the world. It is exaggerated and it is used to the detriment of the country in which the terrorist act originated. This has been proved time and again.21.	Finally  terrorism is related to another scourge of humanity  the drug trade. The drug trade finances terrorism. It is the marriage of crime and vice. Out of that marriage has been born this threat to peaceful peoples whose normal lives should be zealously guarded by them and by the community of nations so worthily represented in the United Nations.22.	Mr. President  the high office that you now occupy and which has brought Zambiaâthat dear and friendly nationâan election for which we congratulate you  was once occupied by a modest  humble and eloquent Peruvian  to whom I am attached by the strong bonds of family and motherland. I am referring to Victor Andres Belaunde. Victor Andres had the good fortune of witnessing the birth of the United Nations and 22 years later  this Organization  after having heard in this Hall his advocacy of world peace  saw him die. His last words were divine words and they have continually been repeated in this Hallâpeace on earth  peace to the peoples of goodwill.23.	Peace on the American continent  An intelligent and swift resolution to the problem of the Malvinas  Peace in Central America  that part of the continent so much in need of work and normalcy  nutrition and development. Peace in the three nations which converge on the Gulf of FonsecaâNicaragua  Honduras and El Salvadorâa Gulf which is clamouring for a development plan  because problems can be solved there which affect all three countries  be they related to fishing  energy  storage or port facilities. What a good thing it would be if the money spent on fratricidal discord could be used for constructive activities  so that these peoples which converge on that Gulf could meet each other there and celebrate a second independenceâeconomic independenceâ and security against conflagration or fratricidal threats!24.	I do not wish to speak at length about all the problems that are of concern to this Assembly  in which we find such distinguished representatives from all nations  but I did want to emphasize those two concerns of our hemisphere.25.	However  there is something that I should like to add in these words of welcome to you  Mr. President  and that is the close co-operation at the executive level which you receive from another great Peruvian  Javier Perez de Cuellar. I believe that I will be forgiven if  as President of Peru  I do not conceal the pride I derive from the names I have mentioned  because that allows me  in fervently reiterating our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations  to say that Peru is in the United Nations not only in our repeated adherence to it  but also in our actions in it."
"110",5568,"PHL",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me to congratulate the President on his election to chair the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His reputation as a skilled diplomat and a statesman of wise judgement assures us of the sober yet dynamic leadership that we need in the Assembly to accomplish our tasks.99.	We should all be sadly remiss if we failed to commend the Secretary-general on his endeavours in the cause of peace and on his report on the work of the Organization. The secretary General is both a staunch defender and a stem critic of the United Nations. In performing that important and necessary task he has put all of us in his debt.100.	The Philippines warmly welcomes Brunei Darussalam as the 159th Member of the United Nations. The historic ties between Brunei and the Philippines are centuries old  and these have found modern reaffirmation in their active partnership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]  where they share common goals  aspirations and perceptions of regional peace  security and stability with the other members of ASEAN.101.	I speak today at the same rostrum where my illustrious predecessor  Mr. Carlos P. Romulo  on many occasions delivered  with great eloquence and uncommon wit  the Philippine policy statements. Mr. Romulo has sought retirement after a long public life in distinguished service to his country and people and to humanity  as a passionate advocate of the United Nations  sharing deeply its resolve to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". We all miss Mr. Romulo at these sessions of the Assembly  but we find comfort in the thought that we can still avail ourselves of the gems of wisdom that he has left in the annals of this international body.102.	Of the numerous photographs taken by the astronauts from outer space  there is one that is firmly impressed on our minds. It is the picture of the earth  taken from hundreds of thousands of miles away  showing a globe of ethereal quality and breath-taking beauty  suspended in space  calm  serene and peaceful. But as we look around us we are confronted by the chilling realization that we live in a world riven by suspicion and distrust  a world obsessed by the frenzied competition to accumulate weapons of mass destruction  a world where peace is constantly challenged by the overwhelming drive to dominate  to impose one's superior will on weaker parties  and to use both guile and armed strength to achieve such ends.103.	Indeed  the peace of the world today hangs in a fragile balance; the world is on the brink of a self-imposed holocaust of dimensions so vast it could erase human civilization from the face of the earth.104.	Let me turn to a most vital issue of our time. The subject of nuclear arms and their control has for too long been cluttered with the doctrines  concepts and esoteric jargon of the war room strategist and nuclear arms specialist. It is time for us to sweep all these aside and get down to the elementary facts which all of us can understand.105.	First  nuclear weapons do not confer absolute security  and accumulating more and more of them diminishes security. Secondly  there can be no limited nuclear war. Once nuclear weapons are used  their use will escalate into a full nuclear exchange that could spell the death of all of us. The profound global climatic changes following the onset of the nuclear night  as both Soviet and American scientists have recently described it  will not spare even those of us outside the immediate areas of nuclear blast and radiation. Thirdly  human civilization as we know it will be effectively exterminated.106.	Our generation has coined a word to describe the deliberate destruction of a group of peopleâ ""genocide"". What word shall we use to describe the extermination of the entire human race? Shall we call it ""humanicide""? Will the nuclear superpowers in the end be responsible for this absolute  this final crime against humanity? Shall they be the ultimate perpetrators of ""humanicide""?107.	The nuclear Powers have among them more than enough of the instruments of nuclear death to extinguish the human race. By the same token  they have in their hands the power and the means to ensure the survival of human civilization on earth. The options are clear to all of us.108.	Surely  it should not be impossible for the nuclear Powers to see that  for man to survive  there can be only one possible course: we must utilize to the fullest extent the available means of negotiation and diplomacy to end the nuclear arms race and to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons.109.	In the light of recent statements of the leaders of the superpowers  we are encouraged by the possibility of new initiatives emanating from them that could lead to resumption of negotiations.110.	All over the world the flashpoints of danger of last year and prior years continue to fuel global unrest and instability. Foreign troops continue to occupy Kampuchea  imposing on its people the terrors of war and economic deprivation and sending thousands of them desperately to seek refuge in other lands. My delegation hopes that the repeated calls of the international community for the total withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Kampuchea and a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem will finally be heeded by the parties concerned. The Philippines will continue to work for the ultimate triumph of the principle of self-determination in Kampuchea.111.	Thousands of people have died and are dying violently each year in Afghanistanâpeople trapped in a savage war between foreign military occupiers and the Afghan fighters who seek to restore their national independence and sovereignty. The Philippines will continue to support the efforts of the secretary General to achieve a peaceful political solution to the problem of Afghanistan.112.	We should guard against the illusion that stability has been achieved in the Middle East. Until the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is accepted  the Middle East will remain a tinderbox posing serious threats not just to regional peace but also to the peace of the entire international community. We therefore urge renewed discussions on the modalities for the establishment of a Palestinian State.113.	Success continues to elude the efforts of several States to bring to an end the dangerous conflict between Iran and Iraq. My delegation will fully support conciliatory efforts to bring peace and stability to the Gulf  a region of sensitive importance to many States where protracted war between two countries heightens the risk of escalated violence and enlargement of the area of conflict.114.	The inherent evil of apartheid continues to fuel violence in South Africa and instability in that part of the African continent. South Africa's new Constitution  which purports to liberalize its policy of racial separation  merely deepens the chasm between the black majority and the white minority. Until the vast majority of the disenfranchised population is made a full part of the political process  apartheid will remain.115.	The people of Namibia  long deprived of their independence  continue to pursue their struggle for national liberation. My delegation hopes to see the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  so that the Namibian people can finally beg n the task of building a nation and a viable economy which can contribute to peace and progress in southern Africa.116.	The internecine conflicts in Central America have destabilized a once peaceful and prosperous region of the world  exacting a grim toll  through armed violence  in lives lost and properties destroyed. My delegation  sensitive to our close historic and cultural ties to the countries of Central America  fully supports the initiatives of the Contadora Group for the restoration of peace and stability in that region.117.	Tensions persist in the Korean peninsula. My delegation takes a positive posture on the initiatives undertaken by both sides that could lead to a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. The interests of world peace and security would be served if North and South Korea could return to the negotiating table. In keeping with the principle of universality  they could  if they so desired  become Members of the United Nations without prejudice to reunification.118.	A cause of future conflict lies at the bottom of the sea. In the past  wars have been fought over mineral deposits on land. The fabulous abundance of poly-metallic nodules in the deep seabedâthe future source of manganese  cobalt  copper and nickelâ could trigger dangerous conflicts and confrontations  unless the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea's and the regime set out in the Convention for the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the deep seabed in the international area are implemented and respected by all.119.	We note with concern  therefore  the Provisional Understanding regarding Deep Seabed Matters concluded at Geneva on 3 August 1984 by eight industrialized countries. In our view  the agreement is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 120.	The Philippines has ratified that Convention and my delegation earnestly urges others to do the same so that it may come into force very soon.121.	The dismal picture of the world today is becoming even gloomier and more tragic because of the increasing economic inequalities among nations and peoples. The consequence is the uncontained deterioration of conditions in the poorer countries of the world. There can be no real peace without economic security.122.	Peace  as understood by small and poor countries and their peoples  means the satisfaction of the basic needs of man; it means the preservation and sustenance of human life and the improvement of its quality. Since the United Nations is a vital instrument for peace  it must have the development of humanity at the very heart of its activities.123.	It is in the interest of all countriesâdeveloped and developingâthat global economic recovery should be sustained in a manner which would effectively halt the massive debilitating effects of recession on international growth and stability. The early signs of economic recovery  however  have not made the desired impact on the development efforts of small and poor countries. On the contrary  for many of them their efforts at development have been even more difficult  if not altogether frustrated.124.	For economic recovery to foster global peace and security  continuous efforts should be undertaken towards a comprehensive and equitable solution of the development problems of many countries. To attain this objective  the position of the developing countries in such areas as international trade  global industrialization  money and finance  food and agriculture  and energy should be taken fully into account.125.	The requirements of the developing countries in international trade would include  among others  first  the liberalization of trade and the reduction if not elimination of nontariff barriers  such as quotas  seasonal restrictions  licensing requirements  variable levies and antidumping regulations; and  secondly  the elimination of the so-called voluntary export restraint schemes which are undertaken on a bilateral and discriminatory basis outside the principles and rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.126.	Developing countries need to augment their industrial output and to increase their share in total world industrial production to support the self-reliant growth of their economies. But in order for them to be able to do so  they should be provided with all the needed assistance  including the transfer of technology. In the final analysis  the meaning of industrialization is to contribute to the eradication of endemic poverty in the developing world.127.	In many developing countries the problems of hunger and malnutrition cannot be adequately addressed because of their balance of payments difficulties and mounting external debts. This suggests that current international efforts to relieve food scarcity in many areas of the world should be expanded. The impediments to food sufficiency and its availability on a wider basis  including the problems of production and distribution  should receive intensive scrutiny.128.	The international monetary and financial system should be made increasingly responsive to the needs and interests of developing countries. The reform of the system should be supportive of a balanced and equitable development of the world economy and accelerated development of developing countries. It should also encourage the flow of official development assistance and increase regional development finance in response to the growing needs of developing countries. Furthermore  the reforms should focus on the resolution of the external debt problems of developing countries  now estimated to be in excess of $550 billion.129.	Food and energy are interrelated. Every increase in the price of energy has adverse repercussions on the costs of production and distribution of food. The need to industrialize and to produce adequate food supplies will require an increase in energy supplies. If  however  the costs of access to energy supplies are prohibitive  the developing countries would be even more seriously handicapped in their development programmes and projects.130.	After 39 years of the United Nations  the picture of the world today seems indeed bleak and discouraging. The prevalence of pockets of war in many comers of the world  of unprovoked acts of aggression by more powerful nations against weaker nations  of unabated racial discrimination  of the growing economic imbalance between the rich and the poor countries of the world with the resulting social inequalities and of the spreading hunger and misery among large sections of the earth's populationâall that and more are the hard realities we must face.131.	Many independent observers feel that  tested in the light of its aims and the principles embodied in its Charter  the United Nations has failed  and that it seems unable to accomplish the objectives for which it was founded. This may not be entirely correct or true  but it should make us take a hard second look at the Charter itself  because the perceived inadequacies of the world Organization may actually spring from factors inherent in its own constitution.132.	We must not allow initiatives to review the Charter to languish from lack of support. We should devote our most vigorous and sustained efforts to make the Organization a more effective instrument for the attainment of its avowed objectives.133.	The United Nations  after all  is the only remaining hope of mankind for universal peace and security. It is man's last best hope to free himself from hunger and fear. In your own words  Mr. President  ""the world would become a more dangerous place without the United Nations"". Accordingly  our solemn duty is to preserve and strengthen the world Organization while the opportunity exists and while time may still be on our side. That is the challenge confronting us today."
"111",5628,"PNG",39,1984,"ï»¿I join previous speakers in extending to Mr. Lusaka my delegation's congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to express our appreciation of the exemplary manner in which his distinguished predecessor  Mr- Illueca  presided over the thirty-eighth session.315.	On behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government  I extend a special welcome to Brunei Darussalam on its becoming a Member of the United Nations. As a neighbour in the region  Papua New Guinea has close ties with Brunei. Brunei and Papua New Guinea representatives sat together as special observers at the annual meetings of Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations before we decided to become a full member this year  and at the regional meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.316.	Many of the items on the agenda for this session of the General Assembly have  in one form or another  been on its agenda since my country joined the United Nations nine years ago. Resolutions dealing with these items have been debated and adopted  but little progress has been made in giving effect to some of them. Circumstances which first led to the inclusion of these items on the agenda still prevail  or have even worsened.317.	In the interim  issues which once seemed somewhat abstract  and problems which once seemed rather remote  have gained concreteness and immediacy for my country. Without wishing to detract in any way from the intrinsic importance of other items on the agenda  I propose to focus on those issues and problems.318.	But let me begin by stating that  despite the slow and sometimes frustrating progress being made in dealing practically with certain items  the Government and people of Papua New Guinea remain as strongly committed to the United Nations  as the Prime Minister of my country  Mr. Michael T. Somare  reaffirmed when he addressed the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. In fact  recent developments have  if anything  increased the importance which we attach to the United Nations  and strengthened our commitment to it. As the White Paper which guides the Government's conduct of Papua New Guinea's foreign relations makes clear  diplomacy plays a ""vital role ... in serving our national interests"". We have a vital interest in participating as effectively and constructively as we can in the General Assembly's deliberations and ""in supporting a strengthened United Nations system"".319.	We meet at a time of greatly increasedâand increasingârivalry between the super-Powers. Communication between their leaders has probably reached an all-time low. Even talks about arms control and disarmament have broken down. The resulting tensions can be felt in all parts of the world.320.	Third-world countries have been affected by rivalry between the two super-Powers in variousâ but almost always destructiveâways. Some have fallen direct victims to the insecurity felt by the leaders of the super-Powers as a result of the rivalry between them. Afghanistan is an example. Others have become the location of contests between foreign and/or domestic forces  as in Central America and the Middle East. Yet others have suffered at the hands of forces allied with  or acting for  one of the super-Powers. Kampuchea is an instance.321.	As the Government of a newly independent and developing country  we attach particular and great importance to the rights of such countries to be secure  free from attack or other forms of unwelcome interference by their neighbours. That is why we have been  and remain  so strongly opposed to the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. That is why we have condemned the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. That is why we have called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from other countries  including Lebanon  and welcome the recent agreement between the French and Libyan Governments to withdraw their forces from Chad.322.	Every day more than $2 billion is spent on arms by the super-Powers. The figure is many times the total world expenditure on foreign aid.323.	Regrettably  much of the money being spent on arms comes from the budgets of Governments in the third world. Meanwhile  the population of third- world countries is increasing and the prospects open to citizens of third-world countries for equitable participation in development processes and in their fruits recede. The gap between developed and developing countries widens. And international tensions continue  in consequence  to rise.324.	The arms race between the super-Powers is not  however  the only arms race in the world. Nor is rivalry between the super-Powers the only source of armed conflict. The terrible and costly war between Iran and Iraq is only a particularly deplorable example of armed conflict between the forces of neighbouring third-world countries. It is  moreover  a conflict which carries with it the calamitous possibility of drawing in other  outside Powers  unless it can be promptly contained.323. Regional bodies can make an effective contribution to limiting the effects of rivalry between the super-Powers  in restraining other international conflicts  and in arms control. The achievements of ASEAN  as well as proposals adopted by the South Pacific Forum  spring to mind.326.	Direct dealings between the Governments of neighbouring countries can make a similar contribution. So can direct dealings of a non-official kind. And here the recent rapprochement between the Japanese and South Korean Governments  as well as the offer of emergency relief for South Korea by the North Korean Red Cross  come to mind  perhaps as models for further developments directed towards reducing divisions and tensions in the North Pacific region.327.	My Government is concerned about the long-standing animosity between the two nations in the Korean peninsula. They were one people; they can once again be one people. No one from outside can find a solution to their problems. Reunification as their goal is for them  and them alone.328.	If the United Nations  a body founded in the aftermath of war and dedicated to preventing further war  fails to play its appointed part  where can the peoples of the world turn? Members of the United Nations have the required machinery at their disposal to work for the reduction of international tensions  control over the manufacture and distribution of arms and  ultimately  complete disarmament. The responsibility to act is squarely ours. Dare we  especially the representatives of newly independent and developing countries  where other needs are so urgently pressing  fail our children and other members of our families  our fellow citizens and other human beings by not using that machinery with sufficient will and might?329.	Certain of the issues and problems raised by the situation which has been developing on my country's border with Indonesia since February of this year once seemed abstract and remote from Papua New Guinea. But some at least are  without doubt  generally familiar to people from other countries. They are among the issues and problems which I have suggested have gained concreteness and immediacy for my country.330.	As with many other newly independent countries in Africa  Asia and the Pacific  the national boundaries of Papua New Guinea were drawn up  without regard for local geography or custom  by our former colonial rulers. But  as with most other newly independent countries  we have accepted them. Apart from some minorâand welcomeâadjustments on the border with Australia  so have our neighbours.331.	The Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia recognize one another's sovereignty  integrity and independence. Under a Treaty concluded in 1979  we agreed not to allow our respective border areas to be used ""as sanctuary  staging areas  bases or for illegal activities against each other"". Despite the difficult terrain and strong ties between traditional border-dwellers on both sides  the Government of Papua New Guinea has honestly tried to abide by that Treaty.332.	We have always respected the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Regrettably  however  it has appeared clearly that the reverse has not always been the case. On several occasions in recent years  we have protested to the Indonesian Government at what we believed to be violations of our territorial sovereignty. Those violations have included the intrusion into our territory of military aircraft  the destruction of a village near the border and the construction at four points of a major highway into Papua New Guinea.333.	In each case  the Papua New Guinea Government has sought an explanation of the violation before protesting. In line with our policy of independent and constructive neighbourly co-operation with the Governments of nearby countries  we have then sought to look beyond our protest for ways of avoiding a repetition and of maintaining and strengthening good relations with the Government and people of Indonesia.334.	Let me emphasize that there is no disagreement between the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia as to where the international boundary is or should be. We have a joint border agreement which governs the administration of our common border. It is reviewed every five years; it is being reviewed now. We co-operate in many other ways.335.	None the less  my Government has not been satisfied with official responses to most of our protests. In only one case  and only after joint verification by the surveyors from both countries of the road intrusions into Papua New Guinea territory  did they admit that the mistake was unintentional and apologized publicly for it. Our two Governments agreed to close off the sections of the road permanently and did so last August. Four permanent concrete markers were installed at the points of closure and  because of the difficult terrain  we have both agreed to put in additional monuments to identify the border more clearly.336.	The situation on the border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia has been disturbed for reasons other than the border violations I have mentioned. I refer in particular to the unprecedented influx of more than 10 000 Indonesian citizens who have crossed into Papua New Guinea since February and remain in my country contrary to law or established procedures.337.	Living conditions in the border area do not provide for much more than basic subsistence at the best of times. Despite a special border development programme  Government resources in the area are not great. The strain caused by the presence of some 10 000 people in camps on the Papua New Guinea side of the border has  therefore  been considerable. Suffering  including a number of tragic deaths  has resulted.338.	The Government of Papua New Guinea is doing what it can to cope with the unprecedented situation. We deeply appreciate the assistance which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the Indonesian Government and voluntary agencies have given in caring for the people in these camps. But we would urge them not to lose sight either of conditions in the area around the camps or of the circumstances which have caused the people in the camps to leave their homes. Those circumstances are not of the Papua New Guinea Government's making.339.	Although we are under no legal obligation to do so  my Government will treat people who meet the normal international requirements as refugees. We hope that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  as well as members of the General Assembly  will be able to help us find them permanent homes. But let me make it clear that the responsibility for deciding who can remain in Papua New Guinea belongs to the appropriate authorities in my country. Border-crossers who do not qualify for refugee status in the normal way will be expected to return to their homes in Indonesia. The people and Government of my country cannot afford to keep them. They have no real right to stay. But let me add that we are sensitive to the need for them to be given certain assurances about their safety  well-being and reintegration before they go back.340.	The Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia agreed to use diplomatic means to negotiate effective bilateral arrangements for the return and reintegration of the border-crossers into Indonesia. Those negotiations  though difficult  have been useful and productive. Both Governments appreciate the need for the safety of the returning border- crossers to be publicly assured.341.	The Papua New Guinea Government has been unable to persuade its Indonesian counterpart to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to monitor the re-entry and subsequent situation of the border-crossers  but we appreciate the Indonesian Government's agreement to allow Papua New Guinea officials to be present at the points of entry and to visit them in their local environment. I hope that arrangements for the return  including the assurances that we have sought on behalf of the border-crossers  can be finalized soon.342.	Nuclear issues are neither abstract for nor remote from Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries. They have concreteness and an immediacy which both Governments and people hi the region regard as being generally most unfortunate. As with other issues I have discussed  regional organizations have been active on nuclear issues.343.	Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have been persistent  vocal and consistent opponents of the testing  proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. We are  therefore  party to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. We have acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and are following preparations for the Third Review Conference of the Parties to that Treaty with close interest. We not only subscribe to the London Convention on the dumping of wastes at sea's but support its extension to prohibit the dumping of all nuclear wastes.344.	In line with the policy and treaty commitments I have outlined  successive Papua New Guinea Governments have regularly strongly protested against Japanese proposals that nuclear wastes might be dumped in Pacific Ocean. We have done the same in respect of the flagrant disregard for local opinion and welfare displayed by the French Government in continuing its nuclear-weapons-testing programme in French Polynesia.345.	We cannot help noting the close and deplorable connection that seems to exist between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain narrowly self- interested Powers in the region. We feel deeply about the threat those policies pose not only to the health and environment of the region but also to the political rights of Pacific islanders. 346.	The Governments of many countries which we regard of primary concern to Papua New Guinea share our views on nuclear issues. Thus  the 18 representatives of Asian and Pacific countries who attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government regional meeting in my country's capital  Port Moresby  in August this year condemned the French Government's nuclear-weapons-testing programme as well as proposals to dump nuclear wastes in the Pacific.347.	The 13-member South Pacific Forum has agreed on the ""desirability of establishing a nuclear- free zone in the region at the earliest possible opportunity"". Similarly  the Foreign Ministers of six member Governments of ASEAN recently agreed to undertake a study towards the realization of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region.348.	The proposals which are before the South Pacific Forum extend to the prospective banning of the testing  acquisition or reception  stationing  development  manufacture or use of nuclear weapons in the region. A working group  in which the Papua New Guinea Government hopes to play an active part  has been set up to consider relevant legal and other issues. A draft treaty should be prepared for consideration by the Forum in 1985.349.	The proposal of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers is but a recent example of the practical ways in which ASEAN serves wider interests. Like other proposals for concrete and immediate action on an urgent issue  it is most welcome.350.	Colonialism has a concrete and immediate meaning for most Papua New Guineansâindeed  for most Pacific islanders. It is a meaning born of direct  recent and personal experience. While we were  mercifully  spared the worst excesses of colonialism experienced in Africa and Asia  we still attach great value to the right of self-determination and to its customary outcome  independence. We pay close attention to the conditions and rights of peoples in the remaining dependent territories.351.	Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have taken a particular interest in developments in the French territoriesâNew Caledonia  French Polynesia and Wallis and Futunaâand in the last of the United Nations trust territoriesâthe United States Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. So have the Governments of other independent South Pacific countries. New Caledonia has been of special concern to us and to the Governments of the South Pacific Forum.352.	My Government has noted the constitutional and electoral reforms approved by the French Parliament in May  especially those which hold out the possibility of eventual independence  but  like other members of the South Pacific Forum  we cannot see why a referendum on the issues should not be held before 1989. Therefore  we urge that the date should be brought forward. Additional poetical and administrative powers should be transferred from Paris to Noumea as a preparatory step. The rights of the indigenous inhabitants  the Kanaks  and the other ethnic groups which make up the genuine local population of New Caledonia should be safeguarded by the exclusion of transitory or short-term residents from participation in the vote.353.	As recommended by the South Pacific Forum last August at Tuvalu  the French Government should make a public statement that describes independence as ""the desirable  logical and acknowledged outcome"" of the scheduled referendum. It should act to ensure that the Kanak people can play a full and active part in educational  vocational and administrative institutions in New Caledonia. The Forum also agreed that a delegation of ministers from Forum countries should hold discussions with the French Government as well as leaders of the independence movement.354.	All significant political actors in New Caledonia  outside the Government  have expressed strong reservations about the reforms approved in May  but their reasons  motives and constitutional objectives have varied widely. We note especially that the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front has announced that it proposes to hold its own elections before proclaiming a ""provisional independent"" Government.355.	The Papua New Guinea Government  therefore  repeats its call to the French Government to bring forward the date for self-determination  to make more urgent preparations for it and to safeguard the interests of the Kanaks as well as those ethnic groups that have a legitimate stake in the future of New Caledonia We do so not only because of our cultural bonds and political sympathies with the Kanaks but because of the threat to stability in the South Pacific posed by continuing delay.356.	The Papua New Guinea Government has been pleased to participate in visiting missions sent by the Trusteeship Council to observe the plebiscites on termination of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. We are pleased to note that the Constitution of Palau and the rights of the Papuans are fully respected by the Administering Authority.357.	As I have already indicated  we are conscious of the connections which sometimes pertain between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain Powers. Papua New Guinea  however  will not condone attempts to override or bypass the provision in the Palauan Constitution that outlaws the entry of nuclear weapons into Palau.358.	We will also not condone attempts to deny  delay or qualify the abstract right to self-determination by the people of dependent territories  however remote they might be from areas which we normally describe as being of primary concern to Papua New Guinea.359.	My Government urges Palau and the United States Government to take the necessary and appropriate measures to enable both the Trusteeship Council and the Security Council to consider and finally determine the status of free association which the Micronesian people wish to have as the basis for their self-determination and independence.360.	Apartheid practised by the racist Republic of South Africa  is the most systematic form of institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation. The international community has repeatedly condemned as a ""crime against humanity"" and called on the South African Government to revise its racist policies in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Assembly has expressed deep concern over the grave situation in South Africa as constituting a threat to international peace and security. In resolution 36/172B  the Assembly endorsed  as a ""framework for effective international action for the elimination of apartheid  the Paris Declaration on Sanctions against South Africa  adopted by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  held in Paris in May 1981.361.	Papua New Guinea finds it difficult to understand why some Members of this body continue to condone the actions of a regime which has persistently spurned United Nations resolutions by supporting South Africa indirectly through various actions. Their action in this respect is indicative of the indifference of those Members of this world body which at the same time profess to be the guardians of human rights and the dignity of mankind.362.	Time and time again  the General Assembly has adopted resolutions seeking to redress the abhorrent situation that exists in Namibia  but to no avail. Despite the intensive efforts of the Secretary-General and the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the Pretoria regime continues to flout the relevant United Nations resolutions with cynical impunity. Papua New Guinea will continue to support United Nations efforts in pressing for an early and peaceful settlement of this long-standing question. The framework espoused in resolution 435 (1978) remains the only acceptable solution to the Namibian question. We strongly urge all concerned to facilitate speedily the implementation of United Nations initiatives and plans so that Namibia's independence will not be further delayed. In this respect  we deplore the injection of extraneous elements into the question of Namibia's independence. Therefore  Papua New Guinea rejects the so- called ""linkage"" rationale.363.	On the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  we urge all parties to the dispute over the future of the islands to accord the same right of self- determination to the people who call those islands ""home"" and to work together for a peaceful solution.364.	Interdependence seems increasingly to be a feature of international economic relations as perceived by leaders and observers from developed countries  but the perception from developing countries is often rather different.365.	Like the Governments of the developed countries represented at the London Economic Summit held from 7 to 9 June 1984  the Papua New Guinea Government welcomes signs of recovery from the recession which has burdened all economies during the early 1980s; but we cannot help noting that the benefits of recovery are becoming immediate and concrete in developed countries while remaining rather more remote and abstract in developing countries.366.	Fundamental adjustments must be made to the structure of international economic relations if the commitment to international equity and order  of which my Prime Minister spoke in this Assembly in 1983  is to be put into practice. We must not allow our current relief at the effects of recovery to divert attention from our previous concern with the causes of recession. We must also not forget why proposals for a new international economic order  North-South dialogue and South-South co-operation were first included in the Assembly's agenda and why they still appear there  even if they seem to generate less excitementâand perhaps less hopeâthan they once did.367.	As with other developing countries  the economy of Papua New Guinea relies on unprocessed agricultural and mineral products for most of its export income. Manufactured goods are imported. Foreign aid from the Governments of developed countries  especially Australia  assists in our development.368.	The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the statement made by the representatives of developed countries who attended the ministerial council meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] in Paris in May that their Governments intend to ""strengthen and improve trade  financial and investment relations with developing countries"". We appreciate their recognition that doing so is ""a matter of mutual interest"". However  more than words prompt and practical actions are needed. Deeds speak louder than words.369.	The Papua New Guinea Government is a party to trade agreements with Australia  New Zealand and  through the Lome Convention  the European Economic Community. They provide non- reciprocal  preferential and mainly duty-free access to their respective markets for unprocessed exports from my country. However  much as we appreciate the benefits we receive under these agreements  we need to increase in-country processing in order to find employment for our youth. And we need markets for those productsâmarkets which in developed countries are often heavily protected by tariffs and other means.370.	The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the commitment made by participants in the London Economic Summit to urge resistance to and reduction of protectionism. But  as I have already suggested  what we seek is prompt and practical action. Participants in the London Economic Summit also agreed ""to maintain and wherever possible increase flows of resources"" to developing countries. But progress being made towards attaining the current  modest target for aid of 0.7 per cent of the gross national products of donor countries set by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD has been slow. We trust that the emphasis being placed by OECD members on ""increasing aid effectiveness through strengthened aid co-ordination"" will not be to the disadvantage of the people and Governments of developing countries.371.	The Government of Papua New Guinea has acceded to the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities  set up under the auspices of UNCTAD. Let me; therefore  restate our regret at the continuing delay in bringing the Fund into operation. Let me say  too  that we find little solace in the rather lukewarm reference to the Fund made in the Declaration issued at the London Economic Summit.372.	My Government repeats its previous calls to the Government of the United States to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  especially in view of difficulties that have arisen over the activities of United States tuna boats in the South Pacific. Let me add that we look forward to a successful outcome to negotiations between members of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the United States Government  and we hope for finalization of a mutually acceptable fisheries agreement. 373.	The Papua New Guinea Government is  of course  a member of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. We are also a close and interested observer of another successful example of South-South co-operation  ASEAN.374.	We benefit from the technical co-operation agreements we have with two ASEAN members  Indonesia and Malaysia  and two other countriesâ China and South Korea. Although we do not  as yet  have technical co-operation agreements with the four other ASEAN membersâ-the Philippines  Singapore  Thailand and Brunei Darussalamâwe do  however  appreciate their assistance provided in various forms on a bilateral basis and through another regional body  the Colombo Plan.375.	In fulfilment of our commitment to collective self-help and self-reliance through South-South co-operation  we hope to be able to give practical assistance to our partners in return.376.	At the beginning of this address  I said that I would focus on issues and problems which had once seemed abstract and remote from Papua New Guinea but which have become immediate and concrete. My decision to do so was not meant to imply that other items on the agenda for this session of the General Assembly are necessarily less important. There will  in fact  be further opportunities for the Papua New Guinea delegation to make our positions known on other issues.377.	The approach I have adopted here was intended to give expression to the Papua New Guinea Government's basic approach towards the conduct of its country's foreign relations of active and selective engagement with issues and factors relevant to our national interests. My Government's foreign policy is geared to preserving and increasing international co-operation and maintaining and extending the rule of law. We have a particular interest in supporting a strengthened United Nations system. Towards that end  my statement has been intended to show the sense of purpose and direction with which my delegation intends to deal with issues before the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"112",5674,"POL",39,1984,"ï»¿192.	Please accept our sincere congratulations  Mr. President  on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are truly gratified to see the Assembly in the hands of a distinguished son of Africa and representative of the nation of Zambia  with which we have friendly relations and whose efforts for the cause of peace and development we are following with great sympathy and appreciation. Your experience of many years in presiding over important United Nations organs  your personal diplomatic talent and your negotiating skill fully guarantee the efficient conduct of our work.193.	Acknowledgements of a high order are due to the outgoing President of the Assembly  the President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca.194.	I cordially greet our indefatigable Secretary- General  doctor honoris causa of Poland's oldest Alma Mater  Jagiellonian University in Cracow.195.	Let me also take the opportunity of extending from this rostrum  on the threshold of the United Nations fortieth anniversary  my warmest congratulations on his recent 75th birthday to the only signatory of the Charter of the United Nations among us  that outstanding statesman  First Vice- Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Mr. Andrei Gromyko.196.	We welcome in our midst a new Member of the United Nations  Brunei Darussalam.197.	Not quite 200 years ago  on 5 May 1798  in the land which today hosts the United Nations  a nation- a! hero of both Poland and the United States penned these words:""I  Tadeusz Kosciuszko  being on the point of departure from America  declare and resolve that  unless I make other disposition in my will of my property in the United States  I hereby authorize my friend Thomas Jefferson to use it in its entirety to purchase Negroes . . . and to grant them their freedom in my name . . . teaching them to be defenders of their freedom  their country and social good order.""198.	These words bear witness to the Polish ideals which inspired the noblest minds in our country's past  its will to freedom and social aspirations. It is well-nigh symbolic that Tadeusz Kosciuszko was the name conferred during the last war on the First Division of the reborn Polish Army  which  fighting alongside the victorious Soviet forces  brought freedom and independence to Poland.199.	Let me take advantage of this solemn occasion to draw attention to the fortieth anniversary of the Polish People's Republic  which we have recently celebrated in our country. Historically speaking  it represents only a fraction of the thousand-year annals of the Polish State but it marks the consummation of the profound social changes that have been accomplished in a spirit of socialist ideals.200.	For centuries Poles sought an answer to a question summed up as follows: our country is Poland  but what kind of Poland is our country to be? For it was by turns strong and weak  enlightened and backward; a land of justice and of privilege; long partitioned  briefly independent between the two World Wars  then struck down by Nazi occupation and in danger of total annihilation by German fascism. And yet it never stopped being Poland  for our people  owing to its love of fatherland and freedom  had withstood even the most dramatic upheavals of history.201.	The achievement of the last 40 years is the final resolution of the dilemma: what kind of Poland? The answer was given by democratic social forces  left-wing intellectual movements and the political parties of the working class.202.	The Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation  published on 22 July 1944  called on the Polish people to fight ""for a Poland which would never again be threatened by the Germanic hordes  for a Poland which could be sure of lasting peace  the opportunity for creative work and a flourishing future"".203.	This programme resulted in Polandâdevastated by the war of which it was the first  albeit victorious  victimâceasing to be a pawn in international relations  gaining permanently secured frontiers and anchoring its existence to a natural  good- neighbour alliance and inviolable friendship  in accordance with that simplest of wisdoms  that friends are best sought close at hand.204.	This k why subsequently the Poland which  to quote the words spoken by Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski in the Polish Parliament  ""was at loggerheads with her neighbours  entangled in 'exotic alliances' and banked naively on the goodwill of the Western Powers  has receded far into the past. Today Poland's place is unambiguously and enduringly defined. Her international position depends directly on her significance in the socialist community. Our national interests are all on one sideâon the side of peaceful coexistence between nations ... To live among friends  to have their joint guarantees and at the same time to be one of the underwriters of the post-war territorial and political order in Europeâthis is the essence of the Polish raison dâÃ©tat.205.	The Polish People's Republic is the homeland of all Poles. Its identity is a blend of a continuity of history and a youthfulness of system. These have been at the basis of the Polish people's achievements and of the transformations of the past 40 years. This is not mere rhetoric. Only revolutionary political solutions could steer Poland on to a path of progress. Socialism was the only system that was capable of accomplishing this. We do not gloss over the shadow cast on the record of Polish achievements by the crisis of recent years with which we are still contending. We have gone into its sources frequently and frankly  in this forum as well as elsewhere.206.	As far as the internal causes are concerned  we are dealing with them ourselves  since Polish problems are the business of Poles alone. That we are succeeding is evidenced by the normalization of life at home  the closing of society's ranks behind its basic interests on the platform of the Patriotic Movement of National Renaissance  the results of the country-wide local elections and the advances in socialist democracy. Further proof is the broad amnesty sponsored by the Patriotic Movement of National Renaissance and recently enacted by the Sejm.207.	The external causes of the Polish crisis  like those of many other crises  should  however  be tackled by the joint efforts of the international community. By this I mean the removal from international relations of imperialist diktat and multipronged coercion. This is precisely the task of the United Nations  whose Charter lays down non-interference in the internal affairs of States and cooperation between them on equal terms.208.	In the last few years  hallowed principles of international intercourse have been brutally violated by certain North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in their dealings with Poland. The attempts to use blackmail  diktat and restrictions as instruments of political pressure on Poland  a policy of which the present United States Administration is the driving force  were bound to prove a fiasco.209.	The way in which some NATO countries have been treating Poland prompts thoughts that reach back beyond the current ideological confrontation. We encountered instances of attitudes of expediency towards Poland much earlier in our history. There were Western politicians in the past who applauded the partitions of Poland. We have not forgotten the cynical response of Horace Sebastiani  the French Foreign Minister  to the savage suppression of the November uprising in Poland in 1831: ""Order reigns in Warsaw""âwords that were to epitomize the whole of European reaction and feelings about Poland. We are familiar with the pro-tsarist  conservative attitude of America to the January uprising of 1863  which included the betrayal of the Kosciuszko  on which Polish patriots were sailing to assist their countrymen fighting in Poland. At Versailles in 1919  some Western States opposed the reversion to Poland of her native territories of Silesia and Mazuria and the restoration of our access to the sea. David Lloyd George  who questioned our right to Upper Silesia  later  declared  after Hitler's aggression  that Poland had got what it deserved. The Poles remember who sneered at their claims at the Potsdam Conference  who tried to prevent Poland becoming the 51st signatory to the Charter of the United Nations who temporized for years over recognition of the final nature of Poland's western frontier and who in  this day deliberately underplays Poland's contribution to the defeat of fascism.210.	So  if anyone now sets out to lecture us on the management of our affairs and to expound the principles of tolerance  he had best make sure that there are no skeletons in his own closet and that he has a clear conscience as regards the Poles. Tolerance and reconciliation for the sake of the supreme national good have deep-seated humanitarian roots in Poland.211.	The Government of the Polish People's Republic feels obliged to inform the General Assembly that for a number of years our country has been the target of unparalleled propaganda aggression by the media of certain NATO countries  above all the United States. The broadcasts in Polish of ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Voice of America"" consist of deliberate dissemination of disinformation and lies  incitement of social unrest and attempts to destabilize the internal situation in Poland.212.	We wish to state at this juncture that we fully support the proposal of the Soviet Union  announced yesterday from this rostrum  on the inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any action by States aimed at undermining the socio-political systems in other sovereign States.213.	Poland's position with regard to the policy of the United States was spelled out in an official note addressed to the United States Government on 3 November 1983  and most recently in a document of 16 August 1984. A day later  a ceremony was held at the White House which demonstrated yet again that the United States means to press on with its blatant interference in Polish internal affairs. On this occasion  the objects of manipulation were not only recent developments but also more ancient history. The fortieth anniversary of the Warsaw uprising was used to hark back for manipulative purposes to such historic events as the Kosciuszko insurrection of 1794  the November uprising of 1830 and the January uprising of 1863  twisting their meaning to suit the current needs of the anti-communist crusade. Anti-Polish purposes dictated another attempt to reinterpret the Yalta and Potsdam agreements  the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  and other international accords. It is therefore worth pointing out from this rostrum that the Charter of the United Nations  to which the United States President referred on this occasion  expressly states that: ""Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize ... to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State . . . "".214.	It should be recalled that bilaterally  on 1 June 1972  the United States and Poland adopted a document in which they agreed that the development of peaceful co-operation between nations must be based on ""the principles of territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers  non-interference in internal affairs  sovereign equality  independence and renunciation of the use or threat of use of force"". Three years later the United States Government solemnly confirmed in the Helsinki Final Act its will to uphold those principles.215.	It is therefore reasonable to ask this. How do unlawful restrictions and other hostile measures in the political  economic  scientific  transport and other fields square with principle VI of the Helsinki Final Act  which requires the signatories ""in all circumstances [to] refrain from any ... act of military  or of political  economic or other coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by another participating State of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind""?216.	How can the pledge made by the United States  in common with the other 34 European and North American countries  of its will to improve and expand mutual relations and further rapprochement and better understanding among nations accommodate a decision to continue propaganda aggression and to this end modernize the anti-Polish American broadcasting stations ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Voice of America""?217.	How is the unilateral  arbitrary suspension or severance of international agreements to be reconciled with international law's fundamental rule of pacta sunt sevanda? What has a policy of carrots and sticksâdispensed by one of the world's great Powers according to the extent to which other States are prepared to toe its line and carry out its wishesâto do with observance of the principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of States? Many more such questions present themselves.218.	We listened with attention to the address by the President of the United States in which he offered to the world the arrangement of relations on a partnership basis; but still fresh in our memory was the statement he had delivered on the occasion of ""Peace Through Strength Week""  only two days before he appeared in this Hall  in which he resolutely spoke in favour of negotiations from a position of strength.219.	The world  however  awaits from the United States not merely a change of rhetoric. Something much more important is neededânamely  a departure from the policy of confrontation. In the case of Poland  this should mean the lifting of United States economic restrictions and the cessation of propaganda aggression. Only that would make possible the normalization of bilateral relations.220.	I wish to add that the various discriminatory restrictions applied heretofore against Poland have been in utter dissonance with the principles of the free flow of trade  about which the President of the United States spoke at such length in his address here. We expect those valid principles of international economic co-operation to be implemented by the United States with regard to Poland also.221.	Against the backdrop of the anti-Polish arbitrary policy of the United States and of certain other NATO countries  it is with particular respect and appreciation that we regard the independent and objective stand taken vis-Ã -vis our country by the non-aligned countries and the majority of the neutral countries  guided as they are by the principles of theCharter of the United Nations and in particular the principles of sovereignty and the inalienable right of every nation to determine the directions of its internal development. We can give this full credit  especially as our bilateral relations with most of those countries are expanding fruitfully in a spirit of friendship  mutual respect and reciprocal benefit. This area of our foreign relations will be consistently developed in the future also.222.	The history of nations is not a collection of miscellaneous events into which one can dip as required  as if it were a storage room for property. International documents  based on reciprocity  embody an agreed balance of interests and determine the degree of States' interdependence. Concern has therefore been understandably aroused in Poland by the practice of challenging the validity of fundamental agreements that form the bedrock of security in Europe. This applies in particular to the decisions reached by the Big Three at Yalta and Potsdam  decisions that laid down the framework and guiding principles of the post-war peace settlement. These provisions were definitively endorsed in bilateral treaties and sealed at Helsinki by the signatures of the leaders of 35 European and North American States on the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Without the Yalta and Potsdam agreements there would have been no Charter of the United Nations and no Helsinki. Those documents  which constitute an indissoluble whole  are the basis of the territorial and political organization of Europe.223.	The astonishing thing is that the numerous interpreters of Yalta invariably address themselves to what is not contained in the decisions of that Conference  while they skirt round their essence and purpose. These were clearly and unequivocally stated: the destruction once and for all of German militarism and fascism  as the main threat to peace. The Yalta document further proclaimed:""Only with continuing and growing co-operation and understanding among our three countries  and among all the peace-loving nations  can the highest aspiration of humanity be realizedâa secure and lasting peace.""Such a peace would  in the words of the 1941 Atlantic Charter  which foreshadowed the United Nations  ""afford assurance that all men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want"". That is an important heritage for contemporary and future generations. Only dialogue  understanding and cooperation between the great Powers and all the countries of the world can free humanity from the threat of nuclear holocaust. The policy of the arms race and confrontation  of the severance of agreements and suspension and obstruction of co-operation  increases the risk of such a catastrophe.224.	In political assessments it is actions  not words that are the proper measure of the behaviour of States. The first of September was the forty-fifth anniversary of Hitler's invasion of Poland  the act of aggression which started the Second World War. If our minds go back to those years  it is not for the purpose of musing on the events which left Poland standing alone against an overpoweringly superior enemy  but in order to be wiser in the future. Paper guarantees failed to shield Poland from havoc and to prevent the death of millions of human beings.â225.	The first and most crucial lesson that we have learned from our experience in September 1939 is that security cannot be guaranteed by ""exotic alliances""; it can be guaranteed only by the natural ones that stem from a community of interests. We are bound by such an impregnable alliance with the Soviet Union and the other States members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The peaceful coalition of socialist Statesâthe Warsaw Treatyâhas for nearly 30 years been the guarantor of peace in Europe. The second lesson taught us by the Second World War is the necessity of developing a system of security in Europe which will ensure that the security interests of all its nations are equally protected.226.	On the other hand  the policy of arms race and confrontation and international tensions foster the mobilization of forces hostile to peace and destabilize the situation in Europe and other parts of the world. We perceive a particular threat to peace in attempts to change the political and territorial map of Europe as shaped by post-war developments. The problem is not that the Polish frontiers are in jeopardy. They are inviolable and permanent. Nevertheless  the resurgence of Grossdeutsche ambitions and revisionist currents in the Federal Republic of Germany  accompanied as they are by militarization  cannot be shrugged off by anyone in Europeâleast of all  in view of our historical experience  by the Polish people. On issues of fundamental significance to the nation there are no differences between Poles. The tragedy of the Nazi occupation is still too fresh in their memory. That is the context in which we view the militarization processes of the Federal Republic and weigh the declarations against the facts. The declarations are full of peaceful reassurances; the facts often tell a completely different story. On 2 May 1984  the Federal Chancellor said at Oxford: ""The security and peace policy of the Federal Republic of Germany serves an important political purpose: overcoming the division of Germany and Europe"". On 28 June 1984 the Council of the Western European Union lifted the last remaining bans and restrictions imposed on the Federal Republic  allowing it to go ahead with production and possession of strategic bombers and medium- and long-range missiles. As a result of the deployment in Western Europe  and in particular on the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany  of new United States nuclear missiles systems  the security of Europe has diminished; the threat to world peace has increased. There is a close link between the forces professing Grossdeutsche ambitions and those seeking the military instruments for the pursuit of these aims.227.	We judge and shall continue to judge the Federal Republic of Germany as we do other countries: on the evidence of facts  actions and political practice. We listened with attention to the statement of the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany  and in particular to his remarks pertaining to the territorial integrity of all States of Europe within their present frontiers and proclaiming that the Federal Republic of Germany has no territorial claims at present and will have no such claims in the future  in accordance with the provisions of the treaties concluded by it with Poland and other socialist States.228.	We are ready to enter into dialogue with the Federal Republic of Germany and with all forces and States  regardless of their socio-political systems that recognize the existing realities in Europe and wish to make an honest effort to further detente and improve East-West relations. I declare from this rostrum that we are prepared  as we have always been  to entertain any constructive proposals that could lessen the danger of war in Europe.229.	In the present extremely tense and complex world situation  a fundamental question looms ahead  namely  what to do to steer international relations out of the deadlock and on to a path of lasting peaceful co-operation among nations and States? To answer this question  what is needed is  first and foremost  authentic consideration of the good of one's own country and of the common good of humanity  bona fide political intent and bold imagination. The search for an answer ought to start in the most critical area  with improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States  since those two leading nuclear Powers bear an exceptional responsibility for the fate of the world. Soviet-United States relations exert a decisive influence on the overall climate of relations in the world in all fields  as was so conclusively demonstrated in the 1970s. We express the hope that today's meeting between the First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and the President of the United States will contribute to recognition by the United States Administration of the realities of the contemporary world  a world of different socio-economic systems. There is no sensible alternative to the peaceful coexistence of those systems. The policy of confrontation can only lead to a catastrophe.230.	We attach supreme importance to averting the nuclear threat and to halting and reversing the nuclear arms race. This purpose would be served by following up the momentous initiative of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Konstantin Chemenko  concerning the elaboration of  and agreement on norms of behaviour among the nuclear Powers and other Soviet proposals currently on the table  namely  those concerning a ban on the militarization of outer space and a moratorium on the development of anti- satellite systems  as well as the most recent one  submitted yesterday  on the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind. A concrete contribution to reducing the nuclear threat has been made by the Soviet Union through its unilateral no-first-use pledge. We appeal once again to the other nuclear Powers to enter into a similar commitment.231.	We also hail the Soviet Union's readiness to abide by its earlier constructive proposals for armament reduction should the United States and the other States members of NATO show signs of being prepared to restore the situation that existed prior to the deployment of cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe.232.	Our programme is also aimed at the elimination of current regional conflicts and tensions. Behind most of them we detect both the goals and the results of an imperialist policy based on a position of strength and designed to preserve the remnants of colonialism and reinforce neo-colonial practices and racism. Ample evidence of this is provided by the history of the prolonged and appallingly tragic conflict in the Middle East. Now that the sterility and fragility of any settlement predicated on forcing the Arab world to conclude separatist agreements with Israel have been so starkly revealed  solutions of a universal  equitable and lasting nature can be all the more irrefutably seen to be the only effective ones. They are guaranteed by the programme of action set out in the Soviet Union's proposals on a Middle East settlement of 29 July 1984 reiterates its complete readiness to make a positive contribution to the implementation of that programme.233.	We are greatly disturbed at the conflict between Iraq and Iran. It is draining the life-blood of two nations which are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  delaying their development and exacerbating their mutual antagonisms.234.	We condemn the imperialist policy of aggression  destabilization and intervention in Central America. The brutal occupation of Grenada continues. The people of Nicaragua  who are fighting to decide their future free from outside interference  enjoy the deep sympathy and support of Poland.235.	We categorically demand that the NATO States responsible for the situation in southern Africa respect the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council concerning the independence of Namibia and the ending of the policy of apartheid and its degradation of human dignity.236.	We avow our solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in its defence of its revolutionary gains and with the policy being pursued by its Government in the interests of the normalization of the situation in South-West Asia.237.	We are in favour of the settlement of the disputes in South-East Asia by means of political dialogue between the States directly concerned  without any outside interference whatsoever  and of the immediate reinstatement of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to its rightful place in the United Nations.238.	We support the consistent struggle of the Korean people for reunification on the basis of the recent constructive proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.239.	Ten years have elapsed since the adoption by the General Assembly of the historic Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. To this day it remains a document of immense significance. Although we are still a long way from application of the principles of international economic relations  the intervening period has borne out the Tightness and justice of the objectives which that Charter delineated. In the light of that Charter  we can clearly see that tensions in the political area are being used to destabilize economic co-operation and that disruptions of the latter in tum impede the improvement of political relations. This lowers the threshold of international security in its various fields.240.	A serious problem for the world economy is the global debt crisis  which cannot be solved on a long-term basis without profound reforms in the world monetary system  the removal of protectionist barriers to the exports of debtor nations  a substantial cut in effective interest rates and a flow of fresh financial resources. Consequently  we are in agreement with the recommendations of the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Finance of 11 Latin American countries at Cartagena in June 1984 especially with regard to the desirability of joint discussion of financial problems by the debtor and creditor States.241.	The way to remedy the situation is to place economic co-operation on an equitable and democratic footing  as was urged by the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in their Declaration of June 1984. Awareness of the dangers inherent in the deterioration of economic relations led Poland to submit a proposal to the United Nations for the reconstruction and reinforcement of such relations. We welcome and acknowledge the report of the Secretary-General on confidence-building in international economic relations  prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution 38/196  containing the replies of over 20 Governments and international organizations. The implementation of this initiative would make possible a gradual increase in economic security and an expansion of economic co-operation that would be beneficial to all. We consider it our duty to follow up our initiative and are counting on further support for it in the United Nations.242.	An extremely important factor in strengthening international security is the broad process of preparing societies for life in peace. This concept was first given codified form in the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace  which my country had the honour of sponsoring. At the current session of the General Assembly another review will be made of the implementation of that Declaration. The record does not give cause for optimism  but that makes discussion all the more necessary. Societies expect greater involvement by politicians in efforts to further understanding among nations  to eradicate prejudice  intolerance and arrogance and to show moderation in speech and responsibility in action. We hope that these aims will be reflected in the document which the General Assembly will most likely adopt in conjunction with the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.243.	Our perception of the responsibility and the role of heads of State or Government is in tune with the initiatives of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The correctness of our opinions was confirmed at the Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the Non-Aligned Countries to the General Assembly at its Thirty- eighth Session  held at United Nations Headquarters last October on the initiative of Mrs. Indira Gandhi  which was also attended by the Chairman of the Council of State of the Polish People's Republic  Mr. Henryk Jablonski. It significantly broadened our comprehension of the position of the non-aligned countries and the very positive role played by the Non-Aligned Movement in a number of matters of vital concern to the contemporary world.244.	In a year we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Its second 40 years will be launched by the International Year of Peace. On 9 May 1985  we shall also have the fortieth anniversary of the victory of the united forces of democracy over fascism. We shall observe this date as a day of struggle for peace and international security and against fascism  racism  hatred and intolerance. I should like to announce here that a World Congress of Intellectuals will be held at Warsaw on this occasion. We count on all peace-loving forces in the world to support this undertaking.245. At this session and in all its international endeavours  Poland  which is open to co-operation with all States  will faithfully implement the lofty goals of the United Nations. Our programme is the programme embodied in the Charter of the United Nations."
"113",5745,"PRT",39,1984,"ï»¿215. I should like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to an office in which you will represent the Group of African States. Portugal has worked closely with your country  and 1 want to express here my appreciation of the efforts undertaken by Zambia with a view to finding a constructive solution for the problems of southern Africa. 1 am convinced that your well- known qualities and wide-ranging knowledge of the United Nations will enable you to make a decisive contribution to the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly.216.	I also wish to pay a tribute to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  the representative of a country and a group with which we are linked by traditional ties of friendship.217.	I also wish to express my satisfaction at the admission of a new Member State  Brunei Darussalam.218.	I address the General Assembly completely aware that I represent a small country devoid of hegemonic ambitions and of any wish to exercise any kind of dominance over other nations. However  I am also fully aware that I represent a nation with more than eight centuries of history; a nation which is the cradle of a language spoken by more than 150 million people and therefore one of the main means of communication in our time; a nation which consequently does not regard itself as a lesser participant or as less responsible in the great questions with which humanity is concerned as we approach the end of this century. Small countries have the right and the duty to make their voices heard. By virtue of their size  with all that that implies  their experience and vision differ from those of the great Powers and they can make a valuable contribution in helping to find just and balanced solutions for many of the problems that beset the international community.219.	As in the case of other countries represented here  the struggle for independence  the preservation of our national identity and the maintenance of a foreign policy not subject to alien interests has been a constant in our history.220.	In our opinion  the main world problems burdening our generation are not insoluble. On the contrary  they are amenable to constructive solutions based on recognition of the fact that others have the right to exist and to be different  for only with an understanding attitude and goodwill can peaceful coexistence among States be preserved.221.	The great majority of the conflicts and tensions that disrupt the international scene in our day gravitate around two main axes: that between the northern and the southern hemispheres  and East- West relations.222.	The ever-widening gap that separates the rich countries of the North from the less developed countries of the South is undoubtedly one of the main challenges facing the international community today and must be addressed with courage and determination  but also in an intelligent and efficient way.223.	In an epoch such as ours  characterized as it is by prodigious progress in science and technology  the struggle against underdevelopment and the train of miseries and human suffering which it carries with it is  in our opinion  first and foremost a moral imperative which no State belonging to the international community can ignore. Our participation in and commitment to the North-South dialogue should be seen in that context. The convening at Lisbon last April of a conference under the auspices of the Council of Europe on the theme ""North-South: Europe's Role""  the conclusions of which can be found in the Lisbon Declaration	is evidence of that commitment.224.	My Government has been receiving positive reactions to that Declaration from countries on several continents. Its recommendations are being followed up within that European organization  where on this very day a round-table on this theme is beginning with the participation of decision-makers from several European and third-world countries.225.	We reiterate that we continue to consider indispensable the launching of global negotiations within the United Nationsâwithout prejudice to ongoing sectoral negotiations in competent forumsâ on the main problems relating to international co-operation  with the aim of supporting the efforts of the poorest and least developed countries  which are faced with difficult problems resulting from the protectionist trends in international trade  the increase in interest rates  the appreciation of the dollar and the burden of their external debts.226.	The United Nations should not abandon the high mission which has been entrusted to it of bringing about an authentic North-South dialogue based not on the logic of egoism but on the spirit of solidarity.227.	Next year we shall celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly of a series of resolutions and declarationsâamong them resolution 1514 (XV)  which is of particular importanceâ-that have contributed decisively to the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination  a right enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. That has led to the appearance in the international community of many new States  particularly from the great African continent  to which my country is linked by historic^' and cultural ties and a spirit of understanding and friendship  and which holds a very special place in Portuguese feelings.228.	Indeed  in a little over two decades the colonial empires became part of history and  with greater or smaller vicissitudes that need not be recalled  were slowly replaced by newly independent States with varying resources and specific problems. However  all of them strive to achieve a common goal: to play a constructive role in the international community and to struggle for the progress of Africa and the improvement of the life of their peoples  while respecting their traditional values and their own identity.229.	This task  the magnitude of which makes it necessary to take the maximum advantage of available human and material resources  the stability of their societies and economic growth  has unfortunately been made even more difficult by the persistence of grave international tensions which  we regret to say  have not yet been eliminated. Similarly  the recession in the world economy since the beginning of the 1970s  which is largely responsible for the fall in commodity prices  has sharpened structural disequilibrium  which  in tum  has had an unfortunate impact on the stability of institutions taking their first tentative steps.230.	In spite of the worthy efforts of the FAO  food shortages in the African continent have been increasing dramatically. This is an extremely serious phenomenon not only from the humanitarian point of view but also socially and politically. None of the countries represented in the General Assembly can neglect it  especially in view of the surplus in world food production. FAO and IFAD can make a valuable contribution in addressing this problem. However  this will be possible only if the countries with the necessary means increase their financial support for those institutions.231.	It was recognition of the fact that there was a link between the drought in Africa and the slump in grain production in that continent that led the Secretary-General to make his appeal in December i983. That appeal retains all its urgency and validity.232.	The drought continues at a tragic level and nothing points to its end; rather  the threat of desertification now arises.233.	Forced to try to meet within a few years challenges that other nations overcame in the course of centuries  Africa has been trying to find solutions for its problems of economic development that would give real substance to the notion of non- alignment. With that in mind  Africa has spared no effort to safeguard the identity of its peoples and the independence of the continent.234.	Portugal has sought to support initiatives aimed at alleviating suffering  intensifying international co-operation  promoting the development of the areas of the world where deprivation is greatest and helping the victims of natural disasters  regional conflicts or cyclical famines. It was with this goal in mind that my Government  in spite of its limited financial resources  sought to participate actively in the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984; my Government considers that Conference to be an extremely positive example of the possibility and desirability of international co-operation. We believe that international co-operation should be strengthened to prevent new flows of refugees. Every effort should be made by the various countries to address the causes of these movements of population which originate in food shortages.235.	In this context  I would also mention that my country is among the 30 main contributors to the financing of the programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My country also intends shortly to sign a general co-operation agreement with the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.236.	The recent adherence of Portugal to the constitutive agreement of the African Development Bank and the furtherance of relations it implies form part of the same policy.237.	I should also like to express our satisfaction at some initiatives in matters of North-South cooperation recently undertaken by the consulting groups of the World Bank and UNDP. I think it is appropriate to mention in this context the recent co-operation agreement between Portugal and UNDP concerning the recruitment and participation of Portuguese technicians in the programmes to be carried out by United Nations volunteers in the African countries with which we have special relations of co-operation.238.	Similarly  we have endeavoured to participate actively in regional development schemes  as in the case of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference [SADCC]  which is a living example of what can be attained when a group of countries decide to pull together to take advantage of the specific potential of each for the benefit of all. The hoped-for success of this SADCC experience  in several of whose projects we have participated  and its contribution to the balanced development of its member States will certainly have an important impact on their stability and allow us to envisage with greater confidence the future of the area.239.	I would now like to make a brief reference to the situation in southern Africa and the sense of anticipation with which we have been following the developments in that region in the last few months. These developments have allowed some hope that a sincere dialogue may have begun in the region  a process that has been eased by the creation of a climate of mutual confidence and that may lead to a just and lasting solution to the problems of the region.240.	For the past few years  the question of Namibia has been one of the most serious concerns of the international community and of the United Nations  which has spared no effort to solve it.241.	The position of Portugal in this matter is well known. We support the independence of Namibia and firmly oppose all actions liable to delay the exercise by the people of Namibia of their right to self-determination in order to choose freely their own future. Whether at the United Nations or in contacts with other countries or representatives of the Namibian people  we have expressed unambiguously the concern we feel at the delay in implementing the relevant United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We have also stressed the dangers that may arise for southern Africa if this matter continues to drag on  believing as we do that the necessary conditions for a negotiated  peaceful and internationally acceptable solution now exist.242.	We therefore hope that  in this matter also  realism and a spirit of dialogue will prevail so that the political obstacles that have so far delayed the independence of Namibia may finally be removed.243.	It is only fair to mention the efforts that the front-line States have made in this respect. They are amply demonstrated by recent international meetings promoted in that region of the continent  which lead us to believe that their possibilities of intervening in that process are by no means exhausted.244.	The Republic of South Africa will have to respond in a constructive manner to the appeals of the international community regarding Namibia and abandon in favour of negotiation a position of confrontation which has led to deplorable acts of direct aggression against neighbouring Statesâa course of action which cannot and should not be allowed. 245.	If these negotiating efforts are to have a lasting  beneficial effect  it is not enough that they be pursued in a spirit of openness and flexibility and within the context of scrupulous respect for the obligations freely assumed by the parties. It is necessary to move without timidity or artifice towards the complete abolition of the system of apartheid and bantustanization  which lies at the source of and exacerbates the serious internal tensions. Portugal  whose direct opposition to any form of racism and racial discrimination is well known  cannot but condemn these practices in the clearest terms.246.	The solution  therefore  to the grave problems afflicting southern Africa  as recent facts show  lies fundamentally in intensifying the dialogue in a constructive spirit  progressively permitting the creation of the conditions for a better understanding that will allow all those living in the region to exercise  without undesirable external interference  in peace  justice and freedom  their legitimate rights as free men and full citizens of their countries.247.	Thus  Portugal  as the European country geographically and historically closest to Africa  cannot but support the efforts of the African leaders and of the Organization of African Unity to preserve the identity and genuine independence of the States of the continent. For that reason  we believe that we are particularly able to understand the just aspirations of Africa  its desire for progress and its wish to preserve its roots in a rapidly changing world. The cultural vitality of the African civilizations enabled them to survive the colonial period. With self-determination  political freedom was attained in recent decades. It is now the task of all of us  in particular within the framework of the United Nations  to help Africa meet its great and possibly most important challenge: the acquisition of economic independence. For our part  we will do everything within our means to respond positively to requests for assistance in achieving that goal  one that must be reached as soon as possible for the good of Africa and  I would add  for our own good as well.248.	The question of the Middle Eastâwe say this with concernâcontinues to be a serious source of international instability  and efforts to solve it satisfactorily have yet to prove successful.249.	As I had occasion to say here at the thirty- eighth session [6th meeting]  the Palestinian question is at the core of the situation in the Middle East. Until it is satisfactorily resolved we cannot hope for decisive  or even important  progress along the road to peace in that region.250.	No efforts should therefore be spared to find a solution that takes into due account not only the right to existence and security of all the States of the area but also the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to self-determination and the right to a homeland. Portugal has supported  and will continue to support  all initiatives based on those principles  which will open the way for understanding among the parties .and take into consideration their legitimate expectations.251.	The situation prevailing in Lebanon also causes us the greatest concern  for we see that a country which just a few years ago was one of the most stable in the region is now on the road to fragmentation  its territory serving as a battlefield for factions and foreign Powers  carrying with it the risk of an escalation that may create a conflict of even greater proportions.252.	The war between Iraq and Iran is also spreading  slowly but surely  to the Gulf region  threatening the stability of the countries of the region and the freedom of navigation. The consequences of this aggravation are too serious for us to remain indifferent. We expect  therefore  that no efforts will be spared to try to find a solution acceptable to the conflicting parties  bringing to an end a war which has lasted for four years with extremely heavy costs in terms of human life and material resources and which seriously endangers world stability.253.	My country  for historical reasons of consanguinity- language and civilization  is connected to Latin America by profound ties that help us to understand in a more direct manner the problems afflicting the region. Such problems are ancient  deriving from great economic backwardness and social injustice and  in many cases  from a blatant lack of political democracy.254.	As a point of departure  it is therefore necessary to understand the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the region who  we are certain  will be able to find their path to economic development  social well-being and pluralism.255.	We are also well aware that in the past few years the tensions between the super-Powers have superimposed themselves on those endogenous vectors. My country has condemned interference  from wherever it may come  because it believes it essential that the peoples of the region  free from external pressures or subversion  find solutions to their own problems. In our opinion  such solutions can only be the result of a peaceful dialogue between the contending factions. The Governments in power should also realize that the elimination of the opposition will not bring peace and that the conflicts among the different countries cannot be resolved by force but only through a global political and diplomatic solution.256.	In line with our support for General Assembly resolution 38/10  we will follow with the greatest interest the efforts of the countries like those of the Contadora Group which are familiar with the diversity and complexity of the problems and the specific circumstances and characteristics of the conflicts.257.	In effect  Central America has now reached a crucial moment when the risk that the conflict may become generalized has never been greater and when the attainment of serious solutions establishing a just balance between the various contending interests is imperative  so that tensions may decrease  respect for the inviolability of borders be maintained  levels of armament reduced and free societies built.258.	Within this context  my Government will participate in a few days' time in a meeting in Costa Rica with the Central American Governments  those of the countries of the Contadora Group  of the European Economic Community and of Spain  where an attempt will be made to find new orientations in the fields of political and economic co-operation that may point to solutions to the problems of the region. The peoples of the region  having suffered so much in past decades  have the right to redoubled attention and support from the international community. We sincerely hope  therefore  that this meeting will be fruitful and will signal the beginning of a process of regional appeasement. 259.	I will now speak about human rights  a theme to which my Government assigns the highest priority. In effect  we believe that political and social institutions  both national and international  ought to serve the dignity of mankind. Thus  we do not believe there is any justification for discriminatory attitudes and diverse criteria in judging the instances of human rights violations that continue to occur systematically  not only in countries of Latin America or Asia or in South Africa but also in other areas  namely  the Soviet Union.260.	In the long list of acts perpetrated against human rights  one which my country considers most degrading is that of torture  still so prevalent in certain countries. My Government therefore hopes that the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment? which will be presented to the Assembly at this session will be approved without difficulty.261.	It is necessary to overcome once and for all the false concept that the sovereignty of the State can be legitimately invoked to deny the international protection of human rights. Moreover  we must provide the United Nations with means allowing the international community to verify in loco respect for these rights in the various States.262.	In addressing the matter of human rights I shall mention the question of East Timor. I should like to call attention to the progress report of the Secretary-General  which informs the Assembly of the consultations which have taken place and the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia through their permanent representatives in New York. The report also describes the activities of the humanitarian international organizations in East Timor  which we would like to see work more.263.	Those consultations and contacts were very useful  and we therefore cannot but praise the actions of the Secretary-General. His efforts deserve our firm support. It was in this spirit that we agreed to postpone the debate on the question of East Timor until the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Without dialogue there can be no solution to international conflicts. We are entirely sincere when we say that we want to see a solution found to the problem of East Timor and that we are confident a global solution  one that respects international principles and human rights principles  can be found if this dialogue continues.264.	The state of East-West relations has been deteriorating in the past few years as a result of a series of events  among which we might stress the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan by military forces of a foreign. Power; but other unilateral actions  in clear violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  have also contributed to this deterioration.265.	As is the case with international relations in general  it will not be possible for East-West relations to evolve to more stable and constructive patterns if the countries responsible for them do not show moderation in their conduct and do not respect the independence and legitimate interests of othersâif  in short  they do not respect the principles enshrined in the Charter  particularly the principle of the non- use of force or threat of force.266.	We are convinced that if they do show such respect  a constructive East-West dialogue will resume  one that will reduce the arms race  that will make more remote the danger of an armed conflict and that will contribute to the greater economic and social development of all concerned. In this context  particular relevance must be attributed to arms control negotiations  to the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  now in progress at Stockholm  and also to the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  both those that are already taking place on the reduction and control of conventional forces and those thatâit is still hopedâmay begin shortly with the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space  particularly in the nuclear field.267.	The stockpiled military arsenals already constitute a threat to the survival of humanity and of our civilization  and they absorb resources which  if used in another way  would contribute to boosting the social  economic and cultural progress of peoples. However  just as weapons do not cause wars  so arms control and disarmament  by themselves  cannot guarantee the keeping of the peace. Peace must also be assured by the creation of a climate of confidence in international relations and by the adoption of measures that promote openness in the field of military activities  thereby reducing the possibility of surprise attacks; hence the importance we attribute to the success of the Stockholm Conference.268.	Equally  chemical weapons  because of their particularly inhumane effects  have long since aroused mankind's revulsion. Portugal considers that the total prohibition of these weapons would be a significant step towards achieving the goals of disarmament.269.	If arms control is not a sufficient condition for keeping the peace  we must also guard against the perverse effectâthat it might become a factor for disturbing the peace. Arms control makes the eruption of armed conflict more remote only to the extent that it contributes to a stable balance of forces at the lowest possible level. We therefore believe that the beneficial potential of such agreements can be maximised only if they lead to balanced and verifiable results. We hereby renew our plea for the resumption of a dialogue between the super-Powers on all the relevant aspects of this vital question  while at the same time we urge them to avoid the temptation to use such important endeavours for propaganda effects or for obtaining unilateral advantages.270.	Moved by these beliefs in the need to create a more peaceful and secure world  where a collective security system may become an effective fact  my Government wishes  finally  to express its confidence in the role that the United Nations may come to play. I am thinking mainly of strengthening the role of the Organization in the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  of situations that lead to international friction or threats to the peace. We think that in such cases the Security Council and the Secretary-General ought to play a more active role  so as to overcome the current situation where disputes get to the United Nations only when they reach the point of insolubility.271.	We therefore regard as being of the greatest interest the suggestions by the Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  for making the actions of the main organs of the Organization in defence of peace more effective. 272.	Indeed  never more than today has the use of multilateral forms of negotiation  dialogue and cooperation been so necessary. And  paradoxically  never has the use of formulas of multilateral cooperation been so forgotten or passed over in favour of other forms of intercourse between States which  under the pretext that they are more efficient or expeditious  have sometimes led to situations of greater political tension.273.	For small countries like ours  with a humanist  open  tolerant and peaceful vocation  this retreat from international solidarity is disquieting. Let us then  we ourselves and all the rulers of the world  devote our keenest attention to this matter  so that confidence in international institutions may be renewed.274.	Next year we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. There could be no more appropriate occasion for serious reflection  which our political and ethical duties and the imperatives of universal consciousness make ever more necessary. The United Nations can and should see the scope of its action in modern international life widened"
"114",5791,"PRY",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like to begin by extending our most cordial greetings to Mr. Paul Lusaka  the representative of the Republic of Zambia  upon his election to the presidency of this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  the largest of all world forums. I wish also to greet the Secretary-General  whose effective work merits our country's full understanding and support  and to welcome the admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations.281.	Paraguay has worked unceasingly to achieve the goals and objectives of the economic and social development it has set itself. The economic crisis besetting mankind today  undoubtedly one of the most intense in history  has not seriously affected our economy thanks to the timely measures that our Government adopted.282.	We have applied the achievements of science and technology principally to agricultural and livestock research  and this has led to excellent results in those fields  with a considerable increase in production that has directly benefited the great majority of workers in our country  namely  those engaged in agricultural activities.283.	With regard to social issues  there have also been considerable achievements and this has been reflected in the stability and peace that prevail in our country.284.	I can state with legitimate pride that the Republic of Paraguay enjoys true democracy and that the rule of law prevails in our land  where our citizens are developing and improving our democratic institutions. In Paraguay there are no political prisoners  nor are there any terrorist attacks to disturb our peace and  through the division  balance and interdependence of State powers  a healthy and active political life is guaranteed.285.	Within this framework  periodic elections are held in accordance with the provisions of our national Constitution  with the participation of all legally constituted parties within an active  genuine  democratic multi-party system that reflects the political maturity achieved by the Paraguayan people and brooks no interference of any kind.286.	Within the context of regional integration  Paraguay and Brazil are jointly constructing the Itaipu hydroelectric facility  which will be the largest in the world. On 25 October 1984  there will be a meeting between the President of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner  and the President of Brazil  General Joao Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo  at the construction site in order to mark formally the beginning of operations  and this will undoubtedly constitute a milestone of the greatest importance in Latin American relations.287.	With respect to Argentina  another neighbouring country  we are continuing our work with it at a speedy pace  on the Yacyreta hydroelectric project. In August there was a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Paraguay and Argentina at the construction site  marking the political will of both Governments to continue and accelerate the pace of construction of the project.288.	This  then  shows that the development policy of the Government of President Stroessner has fostered initiative and participation on the part of all of our citizens  leading to the optimum utilization of natural resources and creating the proper conditions for continued co-operation with friendly countries  countries of the United Nations  whose support is always useful  for it helps to give shape to the plans established by the Government to ensure sustained development as planned for the future.289.	The agenda of this session of the General Assembly contains many items and serious outstanding questions that are endangering international peace and security.290.	We are struck by the fact that the great problem facing the world in the political arena is the arms build-up  which has entered upon a truly dangerous and alarming stage. While at the same time economic problems beset entire peoples  expenditures on armaments consume billions of dollars every year in an arms race which may well lead us to very serious and irreparable situations in the future.291.	The characteristic fact that regional conflicts or conflicts between specific countries are not submitted to the United Nations or to competent regional bodies is still the sad reality of our day. The side-stepping of the United Nations with respect to matters of international peace and security leads us to believe that very often the parties involved do not have the political will to request assistance from the United Nations.292.	The proliferation of nuclear weapons is another burning issue which is horrifying for the peoples of the world. It is absolutely essential for countries that do not have nuclear facilities to be protected against any danger that might stem from the use of such weapons. The fear of collective holocaust is a daily reality which surely deserves the attention of this Assembly.293.	The Assembly's agenda once again includes items of the utmost importance for the security of today's world  such as the issues of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. In the latter country  a major Power  in flagrant violation of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  has been applying its full might. The time has come for the United Nations to succeed in putting an end  once and for all  to such interventions  which only bring about insecurity and instability and which are a clear mockery of justice and of respect for the sovereignty of entire peoples.294.	The problem of the Middle East continues to be of great concern. There is only one option: that the United Nations will achieve in that part of the world the necessary atmosphere so that with its assistance  final solutions may be found for all the nations of the region  so as to satisfy their needs on the basis of international law and in keeping with their just aspirations.295.	The conflict in the Persian Gulf is another manifestation of insecurity which endangers international peace. The countries involved must find by means of dialogue or through the United Nations a lasting solution to this problem which may  at any moment  lead to a serious world-wide conflict.296.	We certainly cannot forget the problem of Central America. The undisguised intervention by a major Power from outside the continent  through one of the States in the region  results in imminent danger to peace  and insecurity and mutual suspicions have turned an entire area into one of serious conflict. We await with optimism the outcome of the efforts which are being made in the region to achieve lasting and stable peace and to avoid interference by interests from outside the continent which can gravely upset the stability of the American continent.297.	In the economic field  North-South relations have not yet found the path of understanding and coexistence which we all desire. Any effort which nations may make regarding these questions not only will lead to an enhancement of the standard of living of millions of human beings but will also bring about international peace  for there can be no true peace when millions of children suffer for lack of food and other means.298.	There has been almost no effective progress in the North-South dialogue despite the fact that various meetings have been held on the world economic situation. Developing countries feel the great weight of the external debt which cannot be paid and which keeps them from being eligible for new funds which they need to make social and economic progress.299.	The payment of the external debt of the developing countries is one of the most urgent problems before the international community today. The United Nations cannot remain indifferent in the face of this real problem  which endangers dozens of countries and their respective economies. The raising of interest rates by the international banks compounds the situation and makes it difficult to find a solution to this problem  which is further complicated by world economic recession.300.	Paraguay has administered the funds it has received and it is up to date in meeting its international commitments  and therefore this problem does not affect it directly. But we have feelings of solidarity for those Latin American countries which are making major efforts within the Cartagena group to solve this serious problem.301.	The United Nations must strive to make use of all possible means in the search for a solution to this question  which endangers not only the economy  but the very existence and sovereignty of many countries with dependent economies. Various technical bodies have met  and their recommendations reflect agreement that this is a very dangerous question. The Organization should take direct practical measures and should obtain from creditor countries and banks  first of all  a containment of interest rates and  then  better conditions for the payment of the debts which affect so many peoples in the international community.302.	The tragedy of countries which export raw materials persists in the face of the constantly increasing prices of manufactured goods. There has been so much talk on this subject that there is general scepticism on the question  but international solidarity and justice in relations among countries unquestionably demand that we strive to close the widening gap between the industrialized countries and the countries which produce raw materials.303.	Along with concerns aroused all over the world by the global economic recession  which has resulted in unemployment  poverty and all sorts of other problems  there is another grave concern: the limitation or reduction of the contributions made by certain highly developed countries to international financial bodies and to specialized agencies of the United Nations to enable them to carry out their projects in the developing countries. A serious and humane re-examination of those contributions would result in an incalculable improvement in the progress and development of more than 100 countries which need funds and development programmes to raise their standard of living.304.	The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea'6 is now a reality. AH developing countries hope that its provisions will come into force soon and that land-locked countries in particular will be able to benefit from their legitimate share of marine resources.305.	The decolonization process being carried out by the United Nations is worthy of our consideration. The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples deserves the support of all the world's free peoples  and from this rostrum we greet all the new countries which in recent years have joined the international community and the United Nations as a result of that process.306.	We are pleased at the integration of East Timor into the Republic of Indonesia. To this question must be applied a basic principle of international lawâthe integrity of nations; no circumstances or outside interference can delay that decision.307.	The international community continues to desire the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas; this must be achieved through direct dialogue between the authorities of South Korea and North Korea. The Republic of Korea continues to make tireless efforts to reunify a divided people  and it has taken important steps to reduce tension and promote reconciliation  steps which have been welcomed with satisfaction by world public opinion. Experience in earlier events shows us that it is important to have a prior understanding and a basic agreement between South and North Korea; thus  both parties should be encouraged to return to the negotiating table  and the United Nations should lend its support to such efforts.308.	The solution of the problem of the two Koreas does not involve those countries alone. The breach of the peace and of the political-military balance in that area will affect that part of Asia  with serious consequences for many States Members of the United Nations. The international community knows that the Republic of Korea meets all the requirements set in the Charter of the United Nations for admission as a full Member of the Organization. Its admission would be a major step forward in the solution of the problem and would guarantee responsibility  and it could contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. The logical conclusion of this question would be the inclusion of the two Koreas without threatening to perpetuate the division of that nation.309.	The question of the Malvinas Islands continues to be a matter concerning which the international community is searching for a solution that would preserve universal peace. In this connection  we reaffirm the pacifist tradition of our country and its solidarity with friendly nations  which lead us to support all initiatives with a view to achieving a negotiated solution  based on international law  to the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. Paraguay would be glad to see a resumption of bilateral negotiations between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom  and to see the Secretary-General use his good offices for that purpose.310.	At the beginning of the dispute  Paraguay was one of the sponsors of the draft resolution which the General Assembly adopted as resolution 37/9. At the thirty-seventh session  our representative stated the following:""As a founding Member of the United Nations  and respectful as we are of the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter  we feel the responsibility and the duty to participate in the debate on this item in order to contribute to the search for a peaceful solution ..."" 311.	We stress the need to make progress along that path of negotiations  and we reiterate that Paraguay has never recognized the use of force or military occupation as a way of acquiring territory.312.	Our generation has the absurd distinction of having turned man into a beast whose prey is man and of being a generation in which the unbridled and fanatical forces of terrorism act mercilessly and heartlessly in all countries and in all spheres. We refer here to both international terrorism and terrorism within countries. The United Nations must consider practical measures for putting an end to terrorism in all its forms. We know that study of the underlying causes of terrorism is necessary for the understanding and repression of the phenomenon  but we do not consider it acceptable for the fight against terrorism to be subordinated to the solution of its causes.313.	While it is true that this picture of the world is not an encouraging one  since problems proliferate and disagreements among nations continue  the Republic of Paraguay continues to hope that the United Nations will find the right path that will lead mankind to a happy future  and we renew our faith in man as the subject and protagonist of history  in the certainty that man will win in the struggle for a better world in which we can live and coexist in peace."
"115",5856,"QAT",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Lusaka our most cordial congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. We are confident that he is worthy of the high post entrusted to him and that he will undertake the responsibilities associated with it with all the sincerity and dedication the international community expects from him. We wish him personally continued success and we wish his friendly country continued progress and prosperity.70.	I am also pleased to extend our sincere thanks and gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Illueca  who presided over the General Assembly at the thirty eighth session with the competence and objectivity deserving of the praise of all Member States.71.	I cannot fail to express  on behalf of my delegation  our great appreciation and thanks to the Secretary General for the efforts he has made and continues to make in the service of the international community  in keeping with his belief in the mission and the principles of the United Nations. We wish him continued success in the realization of the great aspirations the international community attaches to the institution he oversees.72.	Our belief in the United Nations as an international Organization dedicated to peace becomes greater day by day end is renewed whenever a new Member joins its ranks  thus reaffirming our conviction that the United Nations fulfils a strong desire among all peoples and represents for them a precious dream for the realization of which all have striven through their membership of it. In this regard  the State of Qatar extends a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam on the occasion of its admission to the Organization as an active and effective Member which  together with the other States Members  will contribute to the prosperity of the world. We also express our pleasure at the historical and cultural ties between our two countries and we hope they will continue and develop.73.	The deteriorating and explosive political situation throughout the world is evidence of the inability of the United Nations to establish international peace and of its failure to find solutions to the difficult problems that have been before it for a long time. At ""he same time  we do not deny the many sincere efforts that the Organization has undertaken and continues to undertake to find solutions to these problems.74.	We share the Secretary Generalâs analysis of this inability as a logical result of the betrayal by the superpowers of the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which in turn has made the Organization incapable of implementing the necessary measures for solving these problems and at the same time encourages those States in their orbits and under their protection to disregard ail laws and violate all international principles. Perhaps the best example of this is Israel's defiance of all humanitarian principles and the fact that its protectors and defenders always fabricate excuses and justifications for it.75.	We must all work together to safeguard the Charter of the United Nations and not permit it to be violated by any party. It is incumbent on all Members of the United Nations to respect the Charter and to commit themselves to its defence  considering it the document that unites them in this international institution. We must all raise the level of our actions and feel pride in being members of this international community for the security and stability of which we all strive  and not follow our whims or serve our narrow  selfish interests  which would result in the destruction of the world in which we live.76.	The hopes and aspirations of the international community for the establishment of peace and harmony in place of aggressive confrontations  with their dangerous consequences  make it essential that justice prevail in relations among the members of the international community and that causes of conflicts be dealt with.77.	In this respect  it is the view of my delegation that the Palestinian question  which has been before the Organization since its foundation  cannot be solved and no solution can be implemented without the restoration of all the occupied Arab territories  including Holy Jerusalem  and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and to establish an independent State on their national territory.78.	The Arab position has always been a positive one  aimed at finding a peaceful  just and comprehensive solution to this question. The latest Arab initiative in this regard is contained in the Final Declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  adopted at Fez on 9 September 1982. That initiative was met with obstinacy and rejected by Israel  which refuses to understand anything but the policy of the79.	Not satisfied with rejecting all international resolutions and honest initiatives  Israel continues its aggression  planting on Arab territories settlements that all agree are illegal and an obstacle to a peaceful solution.80.	The international community must therefore reject these illegal practices and must put an end to the usurpation of the territories of others through the settlement policy pursued by Israel  in defiance of international public opinion  and to the imposition of Israel's will on the basis not of right but of force and coercion.81.	The Israeli enemy continued its aggression against our Arab nation and expanded the circle of this aggression when it invaded fraternal Arab Lebanon in 1982. It has maintained its occupation of the southern part of that peaceful country and continued its disgraceful practices in violation of the Geneva agreements and international treaties.82.	In the view of my delegation  it is the duty of the international community to adopt all the necessary measures to ensure immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and to put an end to those practices which contradict international treaties and agreements. Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon is the primary precondition of the success of the Lebanese Government's effort to restore stability and security in all regions of the country and to assert its authority throughout Lebanese territory  as is the right of every Government of a sovereign State.83.	The war which has been raging for more than four years between the Republic of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  two Muslim neighbours  constitutes for us a source of continuing and serious concern. Qatar  together with its fraternal States in the Gulf Cooperation Council  has made every possible effort to find a solution to this conflict. We hope that this catastrophe will soon end and that peace will prevail between the two fraternal States. We welcome the response of the Republic of Iraq to the international pleas and mediation efforts aimed at ending this war. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond to those pleas and that good and reason will prevail  in the interest of the peoples of the two countries  the security of the region and world peace. We hope  too  that all disputes will be settled through dialogue and the exchange of views rather than through war and bloodshed.84.	With regard to the security of the Arab Gulf region  Qatar firmly believes that to be the responsibility of the States of the region alone and that the means of achieving this will be readily available once the big Powers refrain from interfering in their affairs. Based on this belief  the six Arab Gulf States have initiated among them political  economic and security integration and coordination  within the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council. This undertaking constitutes clear evidence of the desire of the member States of the Council that peace and prosperity should continue to be the symbols and goals of the Council.85.	The State of Qatar views with increased concern the continuing presence of Soviet forces on the territory of Afghanistan. It sincerely hopes that the Soviet Union will respond positively to international appeals and initiatives and withdraw its forces from Afghanistan  leaving the Afghan people freedom to choose its political regime and determine its own future.86.	The current situation in the African continent constitutes one of our major concerns. We sincerely hope that proper solutions will be found in the near future so as to end the suffering of the peoples living in regions where tensions prevail. My country reaffirms its support for and solidarity with the Namibian people in their just struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and with the national majority in South Africa in their courageous struggle against the apartheid policies practised by the ruling racist white minority. In line with its beliefs and its ties with and concern for Africa  the State of Qatar took part in the Conference of Arab Solidarity with the Struggle for Liberation in Southern Africa  held at Tunis from7 to 9 August 1984.87.	We call on all States that cherish peace and justice  particularly the major Powers on whose support South Africa depends  to use every means available to put pressure on the South African Government and prevail upon it to respond positively to international efforts aimed at bringing about a just and comprehensive settlement of this situation and to block the attempts of the South African Government to prevent a peaceful solution in that vital part of the world.88.	With regard to the Korean peninsula  the State of Qatar hopes that North Korea and South Korea will be able to find a peaceful solution to their problem through direct negotiations  without outside interference.89.	The importance of the discussion in this international body of the crisis in the world economy increases with every passing year. This has been particularly true since the beginning of the present decade. Developing countries continue to confront an economic recession  the effects of which are reflected in their inability to increase economic growth to the minimum level required to achieve their planning goals A large number of the less developed countries continue to face the spectres of poverty  hunger and the deterioration of their production sectors.90.	At the present time  the international community is facing an economic situation whose effects will not be confined within the borders of the developing countries. On the contrary  the whole world will be affected by its negative influences. This situation constitutes a constant threat to international peace and security and will create additional international problems  which we shall be forced to confront and to spend time and resources resolving.91.	For all these reasons  the State of Qatar believes that the international community as a whole must realize the need to concentrate increased efforts on removing the factors that have brought about this international economic crisis and  in particular  the injustice inflicted on the developing countries by the current imbalance in the world economic situation. This awareness of the danger posed by the crisis must be translated into immediate and practical steps first to alleviate and finally to resolve the economic crisis.92.	The developed countries must adopt policies which encourage imports from the developing countries. The developed countries must also work to reduce tariff and other barriers against these imports  and also give increased attention to stabilizing the international monetary system.93.	States  particularly major industrial States  must also pay greater attention to the effects that their domestic economic policies and the decisions they adopt concerning external economic and commercial relations  particularly with the developing countries  have on the international economy.94.	It has now become obvious to the international community that the rise in interest rates on the United States dollar has led to burdening the developing countries with additional interest payments on their debts  which in turn creates more imbalances in their balance of payments  raising rates of inflation and confronting these countries  especially the less developed ones  with continuing crises in all sectors.95.	The problems of the international economy today are obvious and have previously been discussed and talked about in various international bodies. What is important at this time is to institute the corrective measures that will establish' a just and stable international economic order.96.	The State of Qatar is of the view that global negotiations must get under way  and it considers these negotiations to be the framework through which a discussion of the major problems could take place and appropriate solutions arrived at. The various international organizations have not established a comprehensive programme for achieving that goal. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  adjourned without adopting effective decisions regarding the major problems facing the economies and international trade with developing countries.97.	Therefore  the State of Qatar believes that a review should be undertaken of the resources of these organizations and an assessment made of their ability to resolve these crises and problems so that the international community may be spared any catastrophes."
"116",5902,"ROU",39,1984,"ï»¿I have the greatest pleasure in conveying to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations and best wishes for success on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.79.	The work of the Assembly is taking place in a very complex international situation and in an environment marked by particularly grave tension. The policy of maintaining and re-dividing zones of influence and spheres of domination and the policy of force and the threat of force are intensifying. Old conflicts among States have been aggravated while new ones have emerged. Manifestations of the current economic crisisâwhich affect practically all States and particularly the developing onesâhave been amplified  thus further heightening world economic and political instability.80.	A particularly aggravating factor in the international situation is the acceleration of the arms race and  first and foremost  the nuclear-arms race  which has increased the danger of a new world war which  under present circumstances  would inevitably become a destructive thermonuclear war. The switchover to deployment by the United States of medium- range nuclear missiles in the countries of Western Europe and the consequent use of nuclear counter- measures announced by the Soviet Union have further aggravated the entire world situation  and especially the situation in Europe.81.	The interests of peace  the policy of detente  co-operation and security demand that everything be done to halt this dangerous course of events leading towards tension and war  to avoid a nuclear catastrophe  which  for all practical purposes  would mean the very destruction of human civilization and of those conditions necessary for the existence of life on our planet.82.	Romania  and its President  Nicolae Ceaugescu  believe that the fundamental issue of our time is the halting of the arms race and the implementation of substantial measures of disarmament  first and foremost nuclear disarmament  thereby defending the supreme right of man and of peoples to existence  to life  to freedom  independence and peace.83.	In the current international circumstances  Romania and its President stand for and resolutely militate for the halting of the deployment of United States medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and the establishment of a programme with a time-limit for the withdrawal of those already in place  as well as for the cessation of Soviet nuclear countermeasures and the establishment of a programme with a time-limit for the cancellation and elimination of measures which have already been implemented. Likewise  we consider that everything must be done for the urgent resumption of Soviet-United States negotiations aimed at achieving adequate agreements  which must ensure the elimination of medium-range and tactical missiles and of nuclear weapons from Europe.84.	Romania believes that European countries on whose territory medium-range nuclear missiles have already been deployedâor where such deployment is envisagedâbear a special responsibility for the fate of their own peoples and for the fate of peace in Europe and throughout the world. Those countries must be the first to act resolutely to stop the deployment of United States weapons  to cancel the counter measures and to bring about resumed negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States.85.	Since the deployment of nuclear missiles concerns the life and existence of all European peoples  it is necessary for all States of the continent to participate actively in the conclusion of agreements and understandings providing for the elimination of missiles from Europe  thus barring the way towards a nuclear catastrophe. In this spirit  we hold that  simultaneously with the resumption of the Geneva negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States  it would be necessary to set up a consultative commission of the countries belonging to the two military alliances in which other European States  including neutral and non-aligned countries  would also take part. Such a commission would consider the proposals put forward and make its contribution towards achieving an agreement between the two sides.86.	Given the special importance of these problems for the peace and security of the entire world  we believe that it is the duty of all States Members of the United Nations to do everything possible to contribute to finding adequate solutions responding to the interests of the peoples and the need for dÃ©tente and stability throughout the world.87.	The Romanian delegation intends to hold wide consultations  in an open spirit of co-operation  with all interested delegations in order to find the best ways by which the General Assembly can contribute to the attainment of these objectives.88.	In defence of peace  a huge movement of peoples is developing in Europe and in other regions of the world. This powerful movement has already achieved some important results. Many cities have declared themselves nuclear-free zones. The Romanian people  using all its strength on the great front of peace  nourishes the conviction that by acting in a firm and united manner the peace movement  progressive forces and peoples throughout the world can put a halt to the dangerous course of events leading towards tension and war and can promote disarmament and peace.89.	Giving expression to the will and fundamental aspirations of the entire Romanian people for peace  President Nicolae Ceausescu stated in a speech delivered on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the National Day of Romania:""From this solemn meeting we appeal to all heads of State and Government  to all peoples of Europe and to the entire world to unite our efforts in order to bar the way towards a world war and a nuclear catastrophe. We have succeeded for close to 40 years now in preventing a new world war  but now we are facing a very grave situation. We must do everything possible before it is too late  we must go beyond all considerations and put an end to the arms race  and above all the nuclear-arms race  to ensure the supreme right of all peoples to existence  to life  to independence  to freedom and to peace.""90.	Faced with the grave danger posed by the unceasing escalation of the arms race  and first and foremost the nuclear-arms race  it is imperative to draw all the necessary conclusions and to take action to eliminate nuclear weapons  fully taking into account the severe warning of those scientists who have demonstrated that the use of only a part of existing nuclear arsenals would result in the destruction of all of civilization and would obliterate even those conditions necessary for life on our planet. In a future world war  in a nuclear war  there would be neither vanquished nor victors; nuclear weapons would not take into account differences between social systems; they would destroy nearly all of mankind.91.	This is why it cannot be argued in any way that the production and deployment of new nuclear weapons would constitute a means of enhancing security and peace. Quite the contrary: any new nuclear weapon increases the insecurity of peoples and the danger of the destruction of civilization and mankind. Attempts to play down the seriousness of the danger of the use of nuclear weapons are aimed solely at deceiving peoples and at influencing and hampering the struggle of the masses for peace and disarmament and for the cessation of the policy of confrontation and the use or threat of the use of force. The peoples must be openly told that their survival and the survival of future generations are in danger  that there could be no justification for the continuation of the arms race or for testing and producing new nuclear weapons.92.	Taking into account the huge quantities of nuclear arms that have been stockpiled  when each sideâthe United States and the Soviet Unionâcan destroy all mankind at least 10 times over with the weapons they already possess  there is really no point in maintaining that several hundred missiles more or less could affect the balance of forces between the two sides. There is therefore no justification whatever for continuing to test and produce new nuclear weapons. That is why it is necessary to act with all due responsibility for the interests of the peoples and of mankind  and to cease the production of new nuclear weapons and eliminate the existing ones; that is fully in accordance with the interests of civilization and of all the nations of the world.93.	Consequently  Romania has resolutely stood  and will continue to stand  in favour of the cessation of the arms race  and first of all the nuclear-arms race. We believe that a wide range of firm measures are required in this field  including the achievement of a turning-point in the disarmament negotiations  which for several years now have been practically at a total stalemate.94.	We also believe that the Soviet Union and the United States must resume their negotiations in all fields of nuclear disarmament and that a conference should be convened  with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States  with a view to achieving the cessation of the production of new nuclear weapons and of proceeding to the gradual reduction of existing ones and eventually to their complete elimination.95.	We believe also that  within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament  at Geneva  the time has come to intensify negotiations designed to reach  without delay  a generally accepted agreement on the banning and destruction of chemical weapons  on the basis of the proposals submitted to the Conference. The actions envisaged for the attainment of that objective must be an integral part of the efforts to achieve the prohibition and elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.96.	We attach great importance to the work of the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. Romania will continue to do everything in its power  in co-operation with all the other delegations  to ensure that that Conference makes a contribution  through its proceedings and its practical results  to the strengthening of confidence and security in Europe and that it fully meets the expectations of peoples for disarmamentâand  in the first place  nuclear disarmamentâand for the building of a united Europe  free of nuclear weapons  a Europe of peace and co-operation between all its States  whatever their social systems.97.	In our view  it is also necessary that everything be done to reach agreement urgently on concrete measures at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  those negotiations have been deadlocked for many years now. If both sides acted responsibly  demonstrating the necessary political will  an understanding could be reached. Even if it did not ensure substantial reductions  it would have a positive impact upon the peoples. It would thus be proved that it is possible to reverse the trend of escalation of the arms race and to make progress on the road to the achievement of a balance of forces based not on an increase but on a decrease in armed forces and armaments.98.	Romania has consistently stood and acted for developing co-operation with all the Balkan States  enhancing trust and co-operation among those countries and turning that region into a zone free of nuclear weapons and foreign military bases. We likewise support the creation of such zones in northern and central Europe as well as in other parts of the world.99.	In our view  it is absolutely necessary to agree on concrete measures for the cessation of the arms race in outer space and for strict observance by all States of the obligations they have undertaken  pursuant to the international agreements in force  to begin serious negotiations with a view to preventing the extension of military competition to this area and ensuring the effective use of outer space for exclusively peaceful purposes  in the interest of all mankind. We therefore support the proposal by the Soviet Union that negotiations for the prevention of the militarization of outer space should start.100.	In Romania's view  a realistic way to achieve tangible progress towards disarmament is the freezing of military expenditures by all Statesâand in particular by the great Powers  which are heavily armedâto be followed by the reduction of military budgets. The funds thus saved could be channelled to the development of the countries making such reductions  as well as to support the efforts of the developing countries. We appreciate the activities to this end carried out within the United Nations  and Romania will act in favour of continuing the process of drafting principles to guide States in their negotiations of international agreements for freezing and reducing military expenditures.101.	An essential cause of the extremely grave tension in the international situation and the increasing danger of war is the fact that now  almost 40 years after the end of the Second World War  military confrontations and conflicts are taking place in various regions of the world  resulting in huge human and material losses and in the widening and perpetuation of tension and suspicion  which prevent solutions by means of negotiations and threaten peace throughout the world ever more seriously. That is why Romania constantly acts in favour of the political settlement of all disputes between States. We consider it imperative that the highest responsibility should be shown  in the overriding interests of peoples and of international peace and security  to ensure the cessation of military conflicts and the elimination of hotbeds of tension and to solve all issues in dispute among States by the only possible means: negotiations and peaceful methods. No matter how difficult and long the negotiations may be  they are preferable to any military confrontation  for such confrontation does nothing but complicate relations among States and worsen the international situation.102.	It is in this context that Romania  as always  stands and firmly acts for a comprehensive solution in the Middle East and for a just and lasting peace  based on Israel's withdrawal from the territories occupied following the 1967 war  on the guarantee to the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State  and on the safeguarding of the right to a free and independent existence of all the States of the region. I would recall that  to that end  President Nicolae Ceausescu  as long ago as 1978  took the initiative of proposing the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  in the framework and with the active participation of the United Nations  a conference in which all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]âthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian peopleâthe Soviet Union and the United States would participate  as well as other States that could contribute to the solution of the complex problems of that part of the world. Romania considers that this initiative  which has recently been endorsed by an ever-increasing number of States  is completely valid today and that increased efforts by the international community are required so that such a conference may be convened as soon as possible.103.	With regard to the situation in Lebanon  Romania has been calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from that country  for w-de reconciliation among the internal political forces  and for guaranteeing the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon.104.	Deeply concerned about the continuation of the war between Iraq and Iran  which is causing great human and material damage and creating new threats to the stability and peace of the region  Romania stands firmly for the immediate cessation of hostilities  for the withdrawal of troops by both sides within the internationally recognized borders that existed before the beginning of the conflict  and for the solution of all the issues between the two countries exclusively by the peaceful means of negotiations. We are concerned also about the trend towards escalation of the conflict in the Gulf area  and we stand for the immediate cessation of all military action in that region  as a first step towards the peaceful solution of the war between Iraq and Iran.105.	The fundamental interests of strengthening world peace and security require that everything possible be done and increased efforts made to ensure an urgent political settlement of the problems in other parts of the world  that a definitive end be put to interference in the internal affairs of other States and that the inalienable right of each people to its free and independent development be strictly respected.106.	In accordance with those guidelines  Romania reaffirms its solidarity and active support for the stand and the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts and actions aimed at the peaceful  democratic and independent unification of the country. Romania once again stresses its full solidarity with the struggle of the peoples of Africa for the total elimination of colonialism  for the protection and strengthening of their national independence and for their free advance towards economic and social progress. In that connection  we extend our full support to the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  to achieve independence and for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning Namibia's accession to independence. We firmly oppose the policy of apartheid and we call for full equality for all the citizens of South Africa and their full participation in that country's political life.107.	In general  we consider it necessary that the United Nations act to fulfil its responsibility to bring a halt to military conflicts and to find peaceful solutions to all disputes between States solely through negotiations and other methods of peaceful settlement based on the fundamental principles of international law.108.	In the spirit of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  adopted in 1982  we believe that the implementation of the proposal submitted at the last session by Nigeria  the Philippines and Romania on the establishment of a permanent commission on good offices  mediation and conciliation for the settlement of disputes and the prevention of conflicts among States^ is of the greatest importance. That body should act promptly and efficiently to prevent the emergence of new military confrontations and to promote the peaceful settlement of conflicts and any other controversial issues between States.109.	An important contribution to the strengthening of world peace and security and to the development of broad international co-operation can be made by the creation of good-neighbourly relations between States. The debates held up until now on this subject within the United Nations and the proposals and suggestions that have been advanced form the bases for proceeding to the elaboration of an international document that would contribute to developing and encouraging good-neighbourliness between States.110.	An essential requirement for the peace and security of all peoples and for the very future of mankind itself is the elimination of underdevelopment  the reduction of the gap between rich and poor countries and the establishment of a new international economic order.111.	H is well known that in recent years  as a consequence of the world economic crisis and of a policy of excessively high interest rates  the overall economic situation has deteriorated considerably. Against that background  the gap between developed and developing countries has continued to widen. AH the negotiations conducted between North and South have up until now yielded virtually no results.112.	Under these circumstances  Romania suggests that  during the course of the discussion of international economic problems at the current session  efforts should be concentrated on seeking ways to get real negotiations under way  within the United Nations  between developed and developing countries so as to overcome the world economic crisis  to solve in an equitable manner the problems of underdevelopment and to establish a new international economic order.113.	In that spirit we favour the urgent launching of global negotiations within a special committee  either by making use of the experience gained by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea or within the framework of a United Nations conference open to the participation of all Member States. Within such a context  a programme of measures designed to assist the developing countries could be worked out  along with a comprehensive treaty on new principles to govern international economic relations. Romania is convinced that it is in the interest of both developed and developing countries to reach  without delay  a new understanding and to tum to a new policy with regard to world economic problems. It is high time that we do everything possible to find ways effectively to support the developing countries  to eradicate underdevelopment and to establish a new international economic order  which is an objective necessity for the stability and economic development of the entire world.114.	Particularly compelling is the need to find a radical  comprehensive solution to the problem of the foreign indebtedness of the developing countries. The policy of high interest rates  together with the effects of the economic crisis  can be blamed to a great extent for the current situation. In light of the serious situation that exists in this area  Romania believes that a comprehensive  rather than a selective  solution is required  one that can enunciate general principles for settlement of the foreign indebtedness of the developing countries.115.	In our view  such a solution must include complete cancellation of indebtedness for the least developed countries and a reduction by a significant percentage of the indebtedness of other developing countries  as well as a general  longer-term rescheduling of all debts at a reduced rate of interest or even without interest. At the same time  it would be necessary to set a maximum ceiling for the interest rate for older loans  not to exceed 7 to 8 per cent  and to deduct from the total debt any interest paid above that level. For new loans to developing countries  the interest rate should not exceed 5 per cent. A comprehensive solution would also have to make provision for a debt-service ratio of no more than 10 to 15 per cent of the annual export earnings of the countries concerned116.	The solution we are proposing would also have to allow the developing countries access to international credits under favourable conditions and provide for the creation of a replenishment fund for credits that would be created by contributions from the developed countries.117.	At the same time  in the interest of fostering the entire process of world economic development  the existing international monetary system must be reorganized on new and equitable bases  with strict observance of new principles governing relations between States  so that the system can contribute to the stimulation of economic development in all countries  and  primarily  in the developing countries.118.	We believe it is necessary to redouble our efforts in order to secure broad and unhindered access for the developing countries to the discoveries of modem science and technology and a substantial transfer of technology to those countries on favourable terms appropriate to their specific development needs. It is also essential to expedite the process of negotiation in the framework of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in order to complete the drafting and adoption of a code of conduct on the transfer of technology and to finance  through existing United Nations mechanisms  the implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries in order to assist in creating and improving the scientific and technological capabilities of those countries.119.	Romania attaches the greatest importance to the problem of countering the extremely harmful practice of the outflow from developing countries of trained manpower  which is depriving those countries of an essential element of their potential for economic and social development. While we express our appreciation for the efforts of the intergovernmental group of experts set up within UNCTAD  we believe it is necessary to increase efforts to work out  in the shortest possible time  an appropriate framework for international co-operation to forestall the adverse consequences of the outflow of trained personnel from the developing to the developed countries. We consider that an international convention or agreement to regulate this problem should contain provisions making incumbent on persons with a higher education or on the companies hiring them the obligation to reimburse the countries of origin for the expenses of their training and education and to compensate for losses incurred.120.	In the endeavours to restructure international economic relations and establish a new international economic order  and to overcome underdevelopment  particular importance must be given to expanding and deepening economic co-operation among developing countries and to strengthening their solidarity and unity of action. To this end  Romania favours the convening of a summit meeting of those countries  with a view to developing their economic co-operation and defining a common strategy for negotiations with the developed countries.121.	In a world dominated by contradictions and insecurity and by grave threats to peace  the problems of the younger generation should occupy a place of primary importance in the preoccupations of States. The future of each nation and of all of mankind is directly linked to the education of youth in the spirit of the most noble ideals of work  freedom and peace.122.	The observance in 1985 of International Youth Year with the theme ""Participation  Development  Peace"" is an expression of the great responsibility which devolves on the United Nations in this field. International Youth Year  through preparations and activities carried out for many years  will become a significant event in the life of the young generation  designed to make a contribution of great importance to the unification of the forces of the younger generation and to increasing its participation in the economic and social development of all countries and the struggle for social progress  cooperation and peace all over the world. We should like to express our conviction that the decisions that will be adopted by the General Assembly at its current session  on the basis of the recommendations formulated by the Advisory Committee for the International Youth Year  will give new impetus to intensifying the participation of the young generation in the overall efforts for a settlement of major problems of our time and for building a more just and better world.123.	In view of the complexity of the problems of international life  Romania believes that it is necessary for all States  irrespective of their social systems  to participate in the settlement of those problems  and consequently it favours the enhancing of the role of small and medium countries  of developing and non-aligned countries  which are the ones most interested in promoting a policy of co-operation  independence and peace.124.	We believe that the United Nations and other international bodies have an important role to play and that they should contribute more and more actively to efforts to ensure the participation of all States m international life on an equal footing  in the interests of detente  independence and peace  and to the democratization of all of international life.125.	For its part  Romania is firmly determined  now and in the future  to expand its relations with all States  irrespective of their social systems. We are actively developing co-operation with all socialist countries  first of all with our neighbours  and with the developing as well as with the developed countries and  indeed  with all States of the world.126.	Our international relations have always been based on equal rights  strict observance of the principles of national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage  renunciation of force and the threat of the use of force  and the right of each people to choose its own means of economic and social development  without any outside interference.127.	In the spirit of Romania's foreign policy of broad international overtures  of peace and co-operation  on the basis of the mandate entrusted by the President of my country  the Romanian delegation is firmly determined  together with other delegations  to make its full contribution to the success of the proceedings of the current session of the General Assembly  which has on its agenda items of particular importance. We are deeply convinced that through responsible commitment and through efforts on the part of all States and Governments and of all peoples  it is possible to avert a world war and a nuclear catastrophe; it is possible to preserve peace  the most precious possession of mankind  to ensure the triumph of a new policy of equality and respect for national independence  and to build a better  more just world.128. As was recently stressed by the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu:""Despite the differences in the social systems of our countries or different political and philosophical concepts  even despite the existing divergences and disputes among some States  we must overcome them all and bring to the forefront the interest of each and every people  of all of mankind. We must act with great determination and must respond to the expectations of the peoples and of all of mankind."""
"117",5948,"RUS",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. Lusaka  I congratulate you on your election to the office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Our congratulations also go to the representatives of Brunei Darussalam  a State which has become the 159th Member of the United Nations.58.	For almost 40 years now  the words ""the United Nations"" have been firmly established in the world's political vocabulary. There is virtually no major international problem in connection with which those words would not be spoken in different languages  both in this Hall and outside it.59.	The extensive involvement of the United Nations in world affairs and developments is determined by the very mission of this forum  which was brought into being in order to unite the political will and potential of States for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.60.	The conclusion reached by the founding Members of the United Nations was very simple indeed. It was born of the experience of the most bloody and destructive war that has ever befallen mankind. Indeed  it was precisely through united efforts that the aggressor was crushed. High was the cost of the great victory whose fortieth anniversary will be observed next year. All the peoples who fought against fascism contributed to that victory  but the Soviet Union's decisive role in it is indisputable.61.	United efforts were and are still needed today in order to build the post-war world. For it is the main lesson of the Second World War that States must stand together in the fight against war.62.	It is common knowledge  however  that as the war-ravaged earth was still smouldering and thousands of towns and villages were in ruins  the international atmosphere once again began to deteriorate and ultimately to become critical. This happened through the fault of those who  in their quest for world hegemony  began to behave contrary to their obligations as allies in the anti-Hitlerite coalition  oblivious to the lessons of the past.63.	In disregard of the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which they too had just signed  a group of States set out to escalate their military preparations by putting together a system of aggressive military blocs with the North Atlantic Alliance as its pivot. Those States pledged themselves to a policy based on a position of strength  a policy of brinkmanship. They are responsible for the advent of the cold war  which for a long time froze the normal flow of international life for which the peoples of the world yearned.64.	As a result  in the post-war years the world has been in a state of fever. And whenever international relations were markedâas was the case during the period of detenteâby budding cooperation between States with different social systems  no effort was spared to undermine those positive processes  which is exactly what happened at the whim of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] military bloc. It is precisely this trend in world politics that is the source of the situation that characterizes the international climate today. The threat of war has grown and the foundations of world peace have become more shaky.65.	This course  which is manifest as never before in the current policies of the United States and of those who choose to be its accomplices  is opposed by a broad front of peace-loving States and forces.66.	The Soviet Union is in the vanguard of active champions of peace. It has been and remains faithful to its solemn pledge taken right after the criminal Fascist swastika was crushed and the Hitlerite war machine smashed. The essence of that pledge has not faded with the years; it is to fight resolutely to ensure that the flames of world war never flare up again. The fact that it has been possible for almost 40 years to ward it off is largely to the credit of the countries which pursue a policy of peace among nations and frustrateâby their international prestige and influenceâaggressive and adventuristic designs wherever they originate. The Soviet Union is one of them.67.	Together with other socialist countries  we shall continue to work in the interest of improving international relations. This is precisely the thrust of the documents of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  held at Prague on 4 and 5 January 1983  and of the high-level Economic Conference of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  held in Moscow from 12 to 14 June 1984.68.	The Soviet Union and the States of the socialist community are concentrating their efforts on attaining the key objective of preventing a nuclear disaster. For if the destructive potential currently amassed in the world were unleashed the human race would probably cease to exist. To prevent that from happening is a goal of overriding importance. AH States represented in the United Nations should contribute to its achievement. No one and nothing can relieve them of the responsibility they have assumed under the Charter of the United Nations for the destiny of present and succeeding generations.69.	As was stressed recently by Mr. Chernenko  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: ""The world has radically changed. Its problems cannot be solved by force ... it is imperative to adopt a policy of realism  reason and business-like cooperation in solving the problems that face mankind.""70.	Those who truly hold dear the interests of peace cannot confine themselves merely to stating that there exists a threat of nuclear war. It is necessary to pinpoint the source of that threat. Clarity in this regard is not merely a matter of historical fairness. An understanding of the factors that are pushing mankind towards a nuclear abyss also determines the answer to the question whether or not this calamitous process can be stopped  and how.71.	It is of fundamental importance to compare the two political trends and the two approaches to the problem of nuclear weapons.72.	Right after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world witnessed the inception of a policy of ever greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons and nuclear blackmail. The Soviet Union forcefully called for the outlawing of these most deadly and destructive weapons. Indeed  as early as 1946 the Soviet Union submitted at the United Nations a draft international convention on the prohibition for all time of the production and use of nuclear weapons and on the destruction of their stockpiles. I am sure there are some present here in this Hall who witnessed the discussion of this item at that time.73.	Yet our former allies in the struggle against fascism did not have the heart to vote for that proposal. Their reaction then was bound to make the peoples apprehensive and it did cause serious apprehension.74.	And what is the situation today? Statements are being openly made at the highest official levels that the United States has the right to deliver a first nuclear strike  that is to say  to unleash a nuclear war.75.	Our country sought a ban on nuclear weapons both when it did not possess them and after it developed them. Today  as before  the Soviet Union favours prompt measures to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. This is the aim of a comprehensive set of initiatives advanced by the Soviet Union.76.	Whenever the United States side showed realism and the will to come to agreement on the basis of the principle of equality and equal securityâsomething that did happen beforeâit proved possible to reach important accords. Thus  a major step forward was taken with the conclusion in 1972 by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and the Treaty on the Limitation of Antiballistic Missile Systems.77.	However  in the years that followed  our attempts to reduce or at least to limit nuclear arms failed to produce concrete results. The tug of war between the groups that determine United States foreign policy has been won by the militaristically minded. They attempt to devalue the existing Soviet American accords by wrecking what was achieved earlier through long and painstaking work on both sides  as was done with the SALT II Treaty.78.	They broke off and refuse to resume the trilateral talks between the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom and the United States on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests. They stalled the ratification of the Soviet United States treaties on the limitation of underground nuclear weapons tests and on peaceful nuclear explosions that had been signed a long time ago. And what tremendous efforts were required to arrive at those treaties and agreements.79.	Those and other similar actions are but a few examples of the policy of the United States  whose central objective is to try to secure military superiority for itself.80.	Stories intended to mislead people are being churned out in profusion. Not that they are particularly reticent about saying that  should they eventually feel like negotiating  they would do so only from strength. To that endâthey claimâthe United States must first build up its military muscle.81.	It took Washington a long time to send its team to the negotiating table at Geneva. However  at the talks the United States side followed a scenario that was not designed to lead to agreement. How else can one describe the fact that while negotiating the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe our partners did exactly the opposite? BeforehandâI repeat  beforehandâthey set the date for deploying new United States medium range missiles on the territories of several Western European States. We were told to accept the United States position or else there would be no agreement. So there is no agreement.82.	As to the Soviet proposals paving the way to agreements  they were rejected out of hand. Anything aimed at reaching agreement on the basis of equality was opposed with hostility.83.	It was Washington's deliberate intention to wreck the negotiations on nuclear armsâboth medium range and strategic. And it succeeded in this. Juggling with words ostensibly in favour of negotiations is a false propaganda ploy. Its purpose is obvious.84.	Now they rejoice that they were able to keep the timetable and begin the deployment of their missiles in Europe  as planned. Even here in the course of the General Assembly one can meet representatives of Western European States who are rubbing their hands with pleasure over the fact that the plan for deployment is being implemented.85.	It makes no difference whether deception is crude or cleverly packaged. A good idea is being exploited for unsavoury purposes.86.	We have noticed that there are realistically minded politicians and statesmen in the West  including the United States  who realize that it is precisely in this way that the issue of negotiations is being used.87.	No  the path of stockpiling of nuclear weapons is not the right path to follow. The movement must be in the opposite direction  leading to the removal of these weapons and to their subsequent elimination both in Europe and throughout the world. This is the course of our policy.88.	The Soviet Union is in favour of serious talks. Not only are we prepared for such talks  but we are insisting on them. Our proposals on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe remain valid. They neither offer advantages nor do any harm to either side. The United States must remove the obstacles it has put in the way of the talks. Unless these obstacles are removed  of course  these talks will not take place  and this is what the United States has in mind.89.	It is often asked: since it is difficult for the time being to arrive at a radical solution to the problem of nuclear arms  would it not be possible to take steps that would create a favourable atmosphere for that  raise the level of trust among States and ease international tension?90.	We are convinced that such steps are both possible and necessary. An effective measure of this kind would be the implementation of our proposal  endorsed by the United Nations  for a quantitative and qualitative freeze of nuclear weapon arsenals by all States which possess them. Thin could be done in the first place by the Soviet Union and the United States on a bilateral basis to set an example for other nuclear Powers to follow. Could we not do this? We propose to Washington: let us set such an example.91.	For the time being it is necessary at least to suspend the nuclear arms race. The world has crossed the line beyond which any further build-up and improvement of these arms is not only dangerous but senseless.92.	In the present circumstances it is futile and hopeless for anyone to expect to get ahead and gain military superiority. It is absolutely illusory to hope to win a nuclear war: whether global or limited  blitzkrieg or protractedâwhatever the nuclear war doctrines.93.	Such is the authoritative and unanimous conclusion of scientists and competent military and civilian experts of world renown  with the exception of those  of course  who have lost their honour and conscience or those who were not at all endowed by nature with either.94.	What kind of people can fail to see that peace today is fragile? In spite of the obvious  they once again proclaim a policy of ""peace through strength"". Moreover  they are trying to elevate this policy to the level of statesmanship. All we hear is that strength  strength and  above all  strength is the guarantee of international peace. In other wordsâweapons  weapons and still more weapons. But does not the experience of the pastâboth recent and remoteâ show otherwise?95.	In the face of the currently aggravated dangerous military and political confrontation it is extremely important not to miss the chance. Agreement should be reached on freezing nuclear weapons and prospects opened up for a subsequent reduction of arsenals of these weapons. 96.	Sentiments in favour of such a solution have become widespread in the world. As is well known  the broadest sections of the population in the United States and other Western countries spontaneously come out in favour of this solution  and we fully understand their aspirations.97.	Only ill will can guide those who spawn all kinds of insinuations that the Soviet Union all but manipulates or is behind this movement. Let them ask what it is that the people who take to the streets in mass marches of protest are fighting for. Let them ask those people themselves. Let them ask those people  not us. They will give only one answer: they are fighting for life. What kind of people can assume that the Americans or the British  the French or the Italians  the Germans or the Dutch wish to perish in the flames of nuclear war? We think that those who hope to crush the antinuclear movement by punitive measures realize it full well.98.	In this light  what is the value of the human rights rhetoric in which they just love to indulge in their speeches  statements before various commissions and committees  in articles and voluminous reports to parliaments. In fact  the proponents of the arms race do not care a bit about these rights  including the paramount human rightâthe right to life.99.	There can be no justification for any action that pushes the world to nuclear war. It is only natural that last year the General Assembly adoptedâat the Soviet initiativeâby an overwhelming majority of its Members resolution 38/75 condemning nuclear war as the most hideous crime that could be committed against peoples.100.	A nuclear age requires that political thinking be consonant with its realities. Where categories such as ""strength""  ""deterrence"" and ""superiority"" still prevail in this thinking  they must be replaced by concepts of the non-use of force and of trust  equality and mutual regard for security interests.101.	It would be of fundamental importance if nuclear Powers observed  in relations between themselves  certain norms that were formulated by Mr. Chernenko in his statement last March. It is proposed that these Powers: regard the prevention of nuclear war as the primary objective of their foreign policy  preclude situations fraught with the risk of nuclear conflict and  should such a risk arise  hold urgent consultations in order to prevent a nuclear conflagration; renounce the propaganda of any nuclear war scenario  whether global or limited; assume an obligation to forgo the first use of nuclear weapons; under no circumstances use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries which have no such weapons on their territory  respect the status of the existing nuclear free zone and encourage the establishment of new such zones in various parts of the world; prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in any form; not transfer to any recipient whatsoever such weapons or control over them  not deploy them on the territory of countries where there are no such weapons and not extend the nuclear arms race to new environments  including outer space; seek  step by step  on the basis of the principle of equal security  the reduction of nuclear armaments up to and including the complete elimination of all types of such weapons.102.	The Soviet Union is in favour of reaching agreement at any time with other nuclear Powers on the mutual recognition of such norms and making them binding. This would serve to reduce the risk of the outbreak of a nuclear conflict.103.	In view of its special urgency  it is necessary to single out the question of preventing the race in nuclear and other weapons in outer space  which some want to turn into a staging area for war. We all know who is seeking this.104.	The extension of the arms race to outer space  unless checked in time  could become an irreversible process. Effective measures are needed to keep outer space peaceful.105.	No one country should believe that this is for others  not for it  to decide. Such an attitude would be a big mistake.106.	A major step has been our initiative in calling for Soviet United States talks on preventing the militarization of outer space. We believe that the Soviet Union and the United States  as the leading Powers in the field of outer space exploration  should do all they can to keep outer space peaceful and in particular  with a view to accomplishing this task  to lay the foundations for multilateral agreement. This idea seems to be alive among many States. Full responsibility for the failure to hold the talks rests with the United States side. Washington is unwilling to engage in the talks.107.	Ask any man in the street in any town in the United States  in the Soviet Union or in any other country whether he believes that nuclear weapons should be stationed in space  beyond the Earth's atmosphere  at an altitude of hundreds of kilometres  and that outer space should become a springboard for war preparations  or whether he feels that this should not be allowed to happen. There is no doubt that the answer will be unequivocal: this cannot be allowed.108.	We urge the United States Government to recognize that the militarization of outer space threatens the whole of mankind  including the American people themselves. We express the hope that the United States will refrain from actions which would make irreversible the process of turn outer space into an arena of military rivalry and it will be willing to engage in talks with a view reaching an agreement. For its part  the Soviet Union continues to be in favour of starting such talks as soon as possible.109.	The General Assembly would be doing a good thing if it forcefully voiced its concerted opinion that the militarization of outer space should not be allowed to take place and that outer space must be used solely for the good of peoples and not for sowing death and destruction on Earth. We hope that every member of every delegation in this Hall will give serious thought to this.110.	In seeking to promote this goal in every possible way  the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"". What we are talking about is  in the first place  the banning  without delay and for all time  of the use of force in and from outer space against the Earth  as well as from the Earth against objects in outer space. In other words  agreement must be reached on the prohibition and elimination of space attack weapons of all systems  whatever their mode of basing  designed to destroy objects in space. This applies above all to States with major space capabilities. 111. The United Nations should speak out emphatically and with all its authority in favour of achieving reliably verifiable agreements on a bilateral and a multilateral basis. The way must be opened for concerted and constructive efforts by States which could eventually lead to the creation of a world organization for the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes.112.	Among those present here there are bound to be people who in 1982 witnessed the Soviet Union solemnly assume in this Hall a unilateral obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. That decisionâwhich was not an easy one to takeâis of exceptional importance.113.	Our country continues to urge the other nuclear Powers  which have not yet done so  to assume a similar obligation. This would also be a tangible historic contribution to international confidence building. Much is said about trust and confidence  but by no means is everything done to bring it about.114.	Surely the implementation of the proposal of the socialist countries to conclude a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force in relations between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Alliance would help to dissipate mutual apprehensions. It would be a welcome decision if an obligation not to be the first to use either nuclear or conventional weapons against one anotherâin other words  not to use forceâwere undertaken by States whether or not they belong to military alliances or have a neutral or nonaligned status.115.	We have also submitted these and some other major proposals at the Conference on Confidence and Security building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  meeting at Stockholm. They have been submitted in combination with certain confidence building measures in the military field.116.	Representatives of NATO countries  on the other hand  take what is actually an obstructionist position with regard to these proposals. What is proposed under the guise of military and technical measures is a programme  which they have drawn up  of poorly disguised espionage. The measures they are trying to sell do not  of course  affect a single inch of the territory of the United Statesâthat is  the country in which the foundations of the military machine of the NATO bloc are to be found. It is on Soviet territory that they are proposing to carry out these measures.117.	The same can be said about the prospects of the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The fruitless ""data"" discussion started by the Western participants has long been stalling those talks.118.	The NATO countries are evading the business-like discussion of cardinal questions  above all those dealing with arms reduction  although without such discussions there can be no real strengthening of security and stability on the European continent. At the Vienna talks too  there should be no place for any of the kind of political manoeuvring in which our negotiating partners like so much to indulge.119.	Some two years ago at Geneva the Soviet Union introduced at the Conference on Disarmament draft basic provisions for a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. That draft constitutes a well-balanced basis for agreement. Some of its provisions were subsequently revised and amended to accommodate the positions of the other participants in the talks.120.	Not everyone wants to see a successful completion of those talks. Some would rather see them fail. It would seem that the ostensible interest of certain States serves to conceal their plans for a build-up of chemical weapons. Such tactics should be strongly condemned. We may presume that certain War Departments are doing this. But where are the statesmen? Where are true sobriety and farsightedness  a wide-angle look at peace and the fate of the world?121.	The drafting of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons should be speeded up  and the United Nations could contribute to this in no small measure. With time this problem will become eve:  more intractable.122.	Our country expresses its readiness to take part in multilateral negotiations on the limitation of naval activities and naval armaments and on the extension of confidence-building measures to seas and oceans  especially to regions with the busiest sea lanes or with the highest likelihood of conflict situations. We have already put forward a proposalâ and this is worth recallingâfor an agreement on appropriate measures  including those applicable to particular regions  such as the Indian  Atlantic or Pacific Oceans  the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian Gulf.123.	The convening of an international conference on the Indian Ocean is being inadmissibly delayed. The United States and some of its allies disregard the will of the littoral States that wish to see a peaceful Indian Ocean and clear skies above it. As before  the Soviet Union continues actively to advocate the turning of this ocean into a zone of peace  something that would be a major step towards preventing the militarization of the world's oceans.124.	The arms race is seriously damaging to people even when the guns are silent  for it is increasingly consuming intellectual and material wealth and impedes the solution of global problems such as the elimination of hunger and disease  the search for new sources of energy  and the preservation of the environment.125.	These tasks will not be accomplished either by declaratory statements or by attempts to make assistance to other countries contingent on their acceptance of a particular model of socioeconomic development. Something else is required  namely  the renunciation of all forms of exploitation and of the use of trade and economic ties as tools of political pressure  and a restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.126.	By pressing for the implementation of tangible measures for curbing the arms race and achieving disarmament in close connection with the solution of world economic and social development problems  we consider that reduction of military budgets in either percentage or absolute terms is a promising way to achieve such a goal. And yes  I am talking about military budgets.127.	Together with the other States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty  the Soviet Union has submitted a proposal to the countries of the North Atlantic bloc to begin talks on the question of the mutual non increase of military expenditures and their subsequent reduction. In our view  there should be no obstacles to the participation of States that do not belong to these military and political groupings in implementing the proposed measures.128.	However  so far there has been no response from the NATO countries  and that is no accident. If a picture were taken today using the most sophisticated modem technology to show on a planetary scale the magnitude of the worldwide military preparations by the United States and its allies  it would reveal a view that would stun any thinking person: a palisade of missiles; strategic bombers; naval armadas plying the waters of the seas and oceans; hundreds of military bases scattered all over the globe; and colossal stockpiles of weapons of every type.129.	Some may say that the Soviet Union too has weapons on land  in the air and on and under water. Our answer is: Yes  we do have them  but not by our choice. The objective facts of post-war history irrefutably show that it was not the Soviet Union  not socialism  but rather the other side that initiated the arms race and each of its new spirals. That is where the truth lies.130.	Forced to take countermeasures  our country did so only in response to  and to the extent commensurate with  the protection of its own security and that of its friends and allies. We have never sought  nor are we seeking  superiority. We stand for maintaining military equilibrium  and at the lowest possible level at that.131.	We have put forward no less than 100 constructive initiatives from the rostrum of the United Nations alone. The whole world knows that it was the Soviet Union that came forward with the most radical proposalâgeneral and complete disarmament combined with general and complete control. No one else has proposed this.132.	Numerous proposals have been made by the Soviet Union to curb the arms race in some of its areas. We have proposedâand our proposal still standsâthat agreement be reached on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests and on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems of such weapons.133.	The Soviet Union has also been making sustained efforts to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces by proposing that this problem be solved on both a global and a regional basis.134.	The world community welcomed the Soviet initiatives that brought forth major international treaties and agreementsâthe Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof  the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction  and so on. They continue to serve their purpose to this day and serve it well.135.	We have voluntarily and unilaterally assumed a number of obligations ranging from no-first-use of nuclear weapons to practical steps limiting our armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.136.	While making its own constructive contributions  the Soviet Union reacts favourably to proposals made by other countries. We support the idea of establishing nuclear free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the globe. We have responded positively to the recent initiative by Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  contained in their Joint Declaration  which urged all nuclear Powers to stop the build-up of nuclear weapons and begin to reduce their stockpiles.137.	The proposals that we have made constitute an impressive list of initiatives aimed at easing international tensions and developing peaceful cooperation among States.138.	Yet no matter what proposals or arguments we advance  our counterparts say ""no""âthey are not acceptable.139.	They swear that they favour a halt in the arms race  but only through modernization of arms and through improvement and stockpiling of weapons. Is it not absurd? It is absurd  indeed  and it underlies the entire policy. They would have people believe that they favour a reduction in world tensions  but only by establishing more and more military bases  by intensifying military preparations  by militarizing outer space and by deploying new kinds of United States nuclear weapons in Europe.140.	What is needed to prevent hunger and disease from claiming the lives of countless millions of people? According to the logic of NATO countries  this can be achieved by throwing as much money and resources as possible down the insatiable maw of the war industry.141.	It would appear that there is no other path towards ensuring peace than war preparations. This is twisted logic  a logic of frenzied militarism.142.	All States must have a clear understanding of why none of the important and acute international problems is being solved at present. This applies first and foremost to nuclear weapons and the arms race.143.	They are not being solved because the NATO States do not want it. The instigator of this policy is  of course  Washington. It has firmly linked its foreign policy plans with the further stockpiling of nuclear weapons as well as other types of weapons of mass destruction. It has put up an insurmountable wall on the path to agreement.144.	Even elementary decency is lacking in cases where representatives of the two Powersâthe Soviet Union and the United Statesâmeet to discuss one thing or another. Everything the United States side says is intended to secure unilateral advantages for the United States. Therefore  from the very outset things are doomed to failure. If there are political genes  then failure is genetically inevitable.145.	If you read closely the documents setting out the policy of the United States Administration for the futureâand there are quite a lot of themâyou will see that these documents  which are imbued with the spirit of imperial ambitions and enmity towards the Soviet Union and other peace-loving States  glorify the course aimed at United States domination m the world and extol arms and strength. Thus  they set the stage for deadlocks i.e. solution of all the acute problems of today.146.	We are convinced that each State  irrespective of its social system  whether big or small  will realize that this is a course that leads to a further aggravation of tensions in the world  to an increased risk of a nuclear catastrophe. 147.	The Soviet delegation is authorized to state before this high forum that the Soviet Union will follow the same policy course it has pursued up to now  namely  the course aimed at peace  disarmament  limitation and subsequent elimination of nuclear armaments  and the solution of other acute problems of today.148.	One should face the truth squarely. It is precisely the current United States policy that has made the gap between these two courses in world politics wider and deeper than ever before and has virtually blocked the paths leading to agreement.149.	Today  many people are wondering anxiously if everything has been lost and the only thing left is to acknowledge that international relations have plunged into total darkness.150.	We do not accept such a view of the situation in the world. A feeling of doom is alien to our world outlook. An insurmountable barrier must be erected against war. An end must be put to the stockpiling of weapons in the world.151.	It is understandable that prevention of war is a difficult task. The flywheel of military production is revolving continuously  and influential forcesâ which place the interests of dominating the world above everything elseâwill not stop it.152.	Examples are readily available; they are at handâall you have to do is reach for them. In defiance of the elementary norms of international law and morality  an act of banditry was committed against tiny Grenada  which dared to assert its sovereignty. It was occupied and robbed of its independence.153.	We are witnessing gross interference in the internal affairs of El Salvador. No effort is being spared to prop up the regime of the stooges who are committing brutal crimes against the Salvadorian people.154.	A real siegeâmilitary  political and economicâhas been mounted against Nicaragua  whose people  defending their national freedom  independence and democratic achievements  are heroically resisting in the (ace of the undeclared war organized against it by Washington. But the Nicaraguan people want just one thing: they want their independence and they want to resolve their internal affairs as they themselves see fit.155.	The United States still cannot reconcile itself to the existence of socialist Cuba. Threats are being made against Cuba to force that country off the course to which it has been committed in both words and deeds.156.	The situation in Central Americaâwhere a dangerous pocket of tension has been createdâ should be settled by peaceful means on the basis of an unconditional cessation of United States interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region. Possibilities for such a settlement have been opened up thanks to the constructive approach of Nicaragua and Cuba and to the initiative of the States of the Contadora Group. The Soviet Union supports the efforts to reach a political settlement of the problem.157.	Turning now to the Middle East  here again we can see what the imperialist policies mean for peoples and countries. Still fresh in our memories are the barbaric acts in Lebanon undertaken in an attempt to force upon it a capitulation agreement with Israel  and these acts are still going on today.158.	Yet the facts show that the United States  which relies upon ""strategic cooperation"" with Israel  has no intention of establishing lasting peace in that region.159.	The Soviet Union has recently put forward a proposal on the principles of a Middle East settlement. That proposal is well known and has evoked a broad response. We call upon all parties to the conflict to act with sober minded regard for each other's legitimate rights and interests  and upon all other States to facilitate the search for a just settlement in the Middle East.160.	Provocative intrigues continue against sovereign and nonaligned Afghanistan. The foes of the Afghan people will stop at nothing and will not abandon their hope of plunging it back into medieval darkness. To this end  military incursions from outside are being organized. Is it possible to solve the foreign policy aspect of this problem? Yes  it is. The way to do that is to stop forming  arming and infiltrating into the country from outside gangs of anti-government bandits and saboteurs and not to interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. There can be no doubt that Afghanistan has followed  and will continue to follow  the path it has chosenâthe path of independence  freedom  social progress  peace and nonalignment.161.	In Southeast Asia the situation is being exacerbated by the policy pursued by outside forces. Acts of provocation against Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea are going on unabated. Attempts are being made to pit their neighbours  the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations against those countries. We regard the initiative of the three countries of IndoChina on turning Southeast Asia into a zone of peace  good neighbourliness and cooperation  as also their efforts to start a political dialogue among the States of the region  as constructive.162.	The Soviet leadership has repeatedly stated its positions on the question of its relations with the People's Republic of China. Those positions are well known. The Soviet Union favours normal  good neighbourly relations between these two great States.163.	Obstacles are being put in the way of the normalization of the situation in the Korean peninsula  thus increasing tension in the Far East. The Soviet Union has consistently affirmed its solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of their homeland  without any outside interference. The proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea provide a positive basis for a settlement of the Korean question164.	The racist regime of Pretoria has all but been formally named a ""historical ally"" of the United States. In defiance of the decisions of the United Nations  that regime is trying to keep Namibia under the colonial yoke for as long as possible and is threateningâm particular by overt interventionist actionsâthe independence of Angola and other neighbouring African States That regime could not engage in such lawlessness were it not for the complicity of some major Powers.165.	There can be no doubt  however  that the Namibian people will win their freedom and independence. In the present day world  the colonial policy of South Africa and its patrons is a historically doomed anomaly.166.	The economically weak countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America are being virtually plundered by industrialized capitalist States. The Soviet Union  like other socialist countries  will continue to render assistance  to the extent of its capabilities  to the newly independent States in their efforts to develop their national economies. International economic relations should be restructured in such a way that all countries of the world can make economic and social progress.167.	Of late  the world has been increasingly confronted with dangerous symptoms in the policy of the United States  such as claims to impunity and licence to do anything it wishes. It does not scruple to declare any criminal ways and means legitimate if these can serve the desired ends. In world affairs  it intends to follow the logic of the idea that one does whatever one's left foot desires. And so it tramples on other peoples' lands with soldiers' iron heeled bootsâleft  right  left  right.168.	We are convinced that the time is ripe to take the most serious notice of the fact that certain States  living set out to achieve military superiority and to pursue the policy of terrorism in international affairs  have resorted to actions designed to undermine the socio-political systems of other States.169.	There is a very long list of documents  decisions  resolutions and various provisions to which States have affixed their seals and which specifically provide that it is inadmissible for countries to interfere in the internal affairs of others. Even the United Nations as a whole has no right to intervene in such matters. It is only necessary to look at Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations  which states precisely that. When that Article was discussed and adopted in the course of the discussion and adoption of the Charter  everyone solemnly and unanimously supported the idea that not even the United Nations should have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of States.170.	Yet  flagrant violations of this international law are being committed today before the eyes of the world  while those responsible say that they are acting in such a way simply because they do not HI the social system of some State or other. This destroys the very possibility of ensuring peaceful relations and mutual trust among States and increases the threat of war. Such policies and actions flout the international rules of conduct. They cannot be tolerated and must be terminated. The United Nations  in our view  should speak out emphatically in support of the rule of law in international relations.171.	In the light of what I have said  the Soviet Union is submitting to the General Assembly for its consideration an important and urgent item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system of other sovereign States"".172.	We propose that the United Nations resolutely condemn the policy and practice of State terrorism as a method of dealing with other countries and peoples. It is necessary to renounce any action aimed at changing or undermining by force the social systems of sovereign States  destabilizing and overthrowing their legitimate Governments  or initiating military action to that end on any pretext whatsoever  und to halt any such action already in progress.173.	All States are duty bound to respect the inalienable right of the peoples of the world to decide for themselves their own destinies and to pursue independently their own political or any other kind of development.174.	Our proposal stems from the Soviet Union's approach of principle. The adoption of this proposal would contribute greatly to preventing and eliminating international conflicts and to consolidating moral and political barriers against aggression and war.175.	There is much truth in the statement that the international situation is directly dependent on the state of Soviet United States relations. Today  as always  our country believes in the maintenance of normal relations with the United Statesâand there has been much talk about this. Until the recent past  that is precisely how these relations were developing  although not without certain vicissitudes  whereas in the years of the Second World War they were relations of allies.176.	In recent years these relations have been disrupted through the efforts of Washington. They have spared no effort to destroy all the gains accomplished together and to undermine the trust that had been built up earlier. What is more  they all but flaunt their indifference to the reputation of the United States side as a partner in international affairs. Yet  that is not something to flaunt.177.	History does not begin on the day when a particular United States Administration comes into office. The periods when the two Powers combined their efforts to defeat fascism will stand out as the best pages in the history of Soviet United States relations; and those who determine United States policy today have a great deal to do if they wish their words and the obligations they assume to be trusted. No attempts to substitute modifications in form for the substance of a policy and for the need to move away from militarism towards a policy of peace can be meaningful. That is nothing but an empty vessel. What is required is the determination to make such a move if one is truly guided by good intentions in United States Soviet relations and is really working towards peace. That alone can carry some weight on the political scales.178.	The Soviet Union believes that it is precisely concrete deeds  not verbal assurances that can lead to normalizing the situation in our relations with the United States. The Soviet Union will not be found wanting. Every American  every American family  should know that the Soviet Union wants peaceâ and only peaceâwith the United States.179.	We have developed normal and  in a number of cases  good and fruitful relations with the countries of Western Europe  but we cannot disregard the fact that some of them have permitted the deployment on their territories of new United States nuclear missiles intended for use as first strike weapons.180.	Nor can one overlook the fact that in some quarters hopes have not yet been abandoned of revising the post-war realities in Europe. Recently such revanchist sentiments have been fuelled by statements which seek to question the commitments assumed by the members of the anti-Hitler coalition. We would caution against yielding to that dangerous frenzy and we appeal for sober mindedness. No one has the right to disrupt what has not merely become a pillar of international law but was born of the innumerable sacrifices of the last world war.181.	We regard the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America  which make up the majority of the Movement of Nonaligned Countriesâan influential force in the world todayâas our fellow fighters in the struggle between those who work for peace and those who work against it. It is the intention of the Soviet Union to continue to do everything in its power to deepen and develop friendly ties with those countries.182.	It is our firm conviction that it is possible to correct the current alarming tilt in international developments  to halt the arms race and to set it on a downward spiral  to reduce and then totally eliminate the threat of war. This requires the combined efforts of States  nuclear and nonnuclear  big and small  regardless of their social systems.183.	As Mr. Chernenko has stressed  ""the Soviet Union will cooperate fully with all States which are prewired  by practical deeds  to help to ease international tensions and to create an atmosphere of trust in the worldâin other words  with all those who genuinely seek to consolidate the foundations of peace and not to prepare for war.""184.	The future of mankind is the common responsibility of all countries and all peoples  and the peoples of the world are entitled to expect that the United Nations and all its activities will be imbued with a sense of that responsibility."
"118",5995,"RWA",39,1984,"ï»¿In accordance with a solid tradition  the delegations of States Members of the United Nations are meeting for the thirty-ninth time since it was founded for an annual evaluation by international diplomacy of the record established by the great family of nations since the last session of the General Assembly  in connection with the Organization's task of promoting peace and progress in the world on the basis of constructive dialogue and peaceful coexistence.2.	This is not a purely routine gathering nor a mere ritual repeated automatically every 12 months. Rather  the annual session of the General Assembly is an ideal opportunity for Member States to exchange opinions on the serious  major concerns of our day and solemnly to reaffirm their faith in the purposes laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. It is in that spirit that the Rwandese Republic is taking part in the work of this session.3.	At the present time  the international community is confronted with many major threatsâthreats that result from the increase in hotbeds of tension  from the persistence of conflicts for which attempts at settlement and mediation have remained ineffective  and from the crisis that continues to undermine the international economy.4.	Given these threats  only tireless efforts  within the framework of the objectives of the United Nations  allow for a measure of optimism as to the prospects for a calmer and more harmonious atmosphere in international relations.5.	While  at the political level  serious dangers continue to threaten international peace and security  on the economic level the situation remains characterized by stagnation that persists and worsens as the years go by.6.	The negative repercussions of this situation  which is a tragedy for the least developed countries  whose socioeconomic prospects remain particularly grim  are many. I will mention but a few: galloping inflation  the constant deterioration of the terms of trade  the heavy indebtedness that is a source of concern for many developing countries  the slowdown in economic growthânot to mention the deficits and food shortages facing different parts of the world  and above all the African continent  which is haunted by the spectre of hunger caused  in particular  by its unpredictable climate.7.	The size and seriousness of these problems  which are made more acute by the structural imbalances that now characterize international relations and by the protectionist designs of the industrialized countries  mean that comprehensive  lasting solutions are urgently needed.8.	The rich and industrialized countries  in close cooperation with their partners in the third world  must adopt new strategies to ensure the implementation of programmes and action plans better adapted to the objective of promoting the economic development of the developing countries  which  in fact  are becoming poorer day by day  and of reducing the gap  which is widening steadily at the expense of those countries on the economic level.9.	This objective is a challenge. It would not be difficult  much less impossible  to meet that challenge. It is a question of will  of determination and of political commitment  which should be reflected specifically in the stabilization and upward revaluation of the prices of commodities and raw materials on international markets  in an increase  in terms of volume and quality  of development assistance  especially for the least developed countries  and in the reduction of the interest rates on the international financial markets.10.	Above and beyond these measures  the objective of giving new impetus to the world economy  taking into account the interests and needs of all the partners  is dependent on the structural and fundamental reforms that are necessary to make the present system more harmonious and to establish a new international economic order based on complementarity and active and effective solidarity.11.	Global negotiation on international economic cooperation for development  the principle of which was decided on at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  remain the appropriate framework for the promotion of that new international economic order.12.	We therefore deplore the fact that those global negotiations have not yet begun. Such negotiations should make it possible to adopt specific provisions to promote  within the framework of mutually beneficial cooperation and firmer solidarity  the economic launching of the so-called developing countries and the steady development of their partners in the industrialized world.13.	It is in this spirit that the Rwandese Republic attaches a great deal of interest and importance to the North South dialogue  the long overdue launching of which would be in the interests of the entire international community.â14.	In spite of the efforts made by the United Nations  especially within the framework of the tasks of its specialized agencies  such as UNDP  UNCTAD and UNIDO  we must recognize that this dialogue is now at an impasse. Thus  the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna from 2 to 19 August 1984  concluded its work without having arrived at concrete results  contrary to the hopes and expectations of the developing countries  whose industrialization needs remain considerable because the transfer of the capital and technology that would make it possible for them to ensure the development of their natural resources has not taken place.15.	Apart from the North South dialogue  Rwanda attaches a great deal of importance to the promotion and strengthening of horizontal cooperation among the countries of the third world. We support the objectives of the Lagos Plan of Action for the implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in April 1980  with a view to the progressive promotion of the socioeconomic integration that will make it possible for our continent to achieve collective self-reliance. Furthermore  Rwanda seeks the continuous development of its relations of cooperation with other third world countries  on the bilateral as well as the multilateral level and especially within the framework of Arab African cooperation16.	The crisis that is undermining the world economy and that worsens steadily as the years go by is certainly a generalized one. However  its impact is felt in different degrees according to the specific problems that stem from it or that it exacerbates for given countries  given regions or given categories of countries.17.	Hence  the effects of the crisis are particularly serious for a country which  like Rwanda  is one of the group of least developed countries and is confronting various handicaps  such as being landlocked  lacking natural resources and suffering from a shortage of arable land  a problem that is all the more important since agriculture constitutes the main economic activity of a population with a particularly high growth rate and a disproportionate economic growth rate.18.	Faced with these handicaps  Rwanda relies above all on the national effort to ensure the development of its economy  but the resources that can be thus mobilized are tragically inadequate given the magnitude of our needs For example  we are compelled to have recourse to intervention by our foreign partners for more than 60 per cent of the finance needed to implement the most important and urgent part of our five-year development plan.19.	In these conditions  an increase in international development aid is of crucial importance for a country such as Rwanda. We are therefore extremely concerned at the steady trend towards reduction in the financing capacity of international agencies such as UNDP  the World Bank and  more precisely  its subsidiary the IDA  whose work is particularly appreciated by the developing countries which are not in a position to meet the terms for credit at market rates. At the same time  with rare exceptions  we have witnessed a stagnation of resources devoted to development aid in the framework of bilateral cooperation.20.	In this context  few industrialized countries have been able to meet the target and commitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development aid and  furthermore  pledges made at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in September 1981  have not yet been followed by concrete action with a view to reducing the constraints faced by that category of countries.21.	Far from yielding to pessimism  as far as we are concerned  Rwanda remains convinced that the efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting effective solidarity in the international community will make it possible to stem the negative effects of the present crisis and to offer to the third world countries the resources they need to escape from underdevelopment.22.	On the basis of this convictionâwhich is at the same time an expression of hopeâon behalf of the Government and people of Rwanda  I should like from this rostrum to reiterate the most heartfelt and sincere thanks of our people to all the partners  friendly countries and international organizations that support our country and will continue to back it in its development efforts.23.	The African continent  where most of the countries in the least developed category  as defined by the United Nations  are located  is particularly harshly affected by the effects of the international economic crisis. In addition to the negative factors inherent in this generalized and persistent crisis  Africa is at grips with natural disasters such as drought and desertification  which  because they considerably reduce agricultural production  year after year worsen the problemâand I would even call it the tragedyâof hunger  which  according to available statistics  threatens approximately one third of the total population of the continent.24.	In the course of years  the number of African countries facing the dramatic effects of climate changes increases steadily. Thus  this year  as a result of a long and unusual drought  Rwanda  my own country  registered a deficit of 60 per cent in its normal agricultural production. Given that situation  the Government of Rwanda was compelled to request emergency food aid from its foreign partners in order to make it possible for the hardest hit population to confront the present shortages.25.	My delegation wishes here to renew the sincere thanks of the Government and people of Rwanda to all the friendly countries and international agencies that responded so generously to our appeal.26.	Rwanda feels that international cooperation in respect of food strategy is necessary in order to promote the adoption and implementation of appropriate programmes of action that can make it possible for the countries experiencing climate disturbances and a progressive reduction in their agricultural production to guarantee food self-sufficiency.27.	At the political level  the situation prevailing in the international community is still marked by a number of crises  the persistence of tension in various parts of the world and the pursuance of overt conflicts that bear the seeds and the growing danger of a new world cataclysm. These tensions and conflicts stem from differing interests or from the determination of oppressed peoples to obtain  at all costs  recognition of and respect for their most fundamental rights  such as the right to freedom and independence.28.	Countries which express complete support for the ideals of the United Nations cannot remain indifferent to the fate of those peoples. It is in this context that the Government of Rwanda is very attentively following initiatives aimed at promoting a policy of detente in southern Africa and at putting an end to the violence that so seriously imperils development in that longsuffering region of the African continent.29.	For several months  that policy seems to have been prevailing; even in that racist minority South African regime which has accustomed us to its arrogant will to defy continually principles of morality and international ethics.30.	Should we believe that that regime has now changed for the better and that it is now inspired by a real and effective will to commit itself to constructive changes with regard to respect for rights recognized for all peoples under the Charter of the United Nations? Raising this question is tantamount to voicing the hope and the wish that the course of dialogue  to which South Africa seems to be committing itself  will enable its neighbours to remove those obstacles which it is placing in the way of their security and development and  at the same time  that this dialogue will turn out to be a constructive one  making it possible to achieve the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people to independence  as well as those of the majority of the South African population to live in a society in which the value of man and his dignity will no longer be determined by his race or the colour of his skin.31.	If this hope and aspiration are not achieved  it would be an illusion to expect a positive effect from what  for South Africa's part  would be a parody of dialogue and a game of duplicity likely to jeopardize the development taking place in southern Africa that would promote and facilitate the implementation of the process laid down by the United Nations in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) aimed at ensuring Namibia's accession to independence. At the same time  that evolution should commit South Africa to a policy of genuine democracy  putting an end to the humiliations and acts of oppression imposed in that country by a minority regime which practices anachronistic racism.32.	The Rwandese Republic reaffirms its solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  which is recognized by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  in its struggle  in particular at the diplomatic level  for recognition of the right of that people to self-determination and independence  in accordance with the relevant decisions of the United Nations and without the imposition by South Africaâwhich is in military occupation of and illegally administering the Territory of Namibiaâof conditions extraneous to the problem of the independence of Namibia  which would constitute unacceptable interference in matters relating to the sovereignty of another country.33.	The Rwandese Republic would also like to reiterate its solidarity with the authentic liberation movements recognized by the international community which are struggling for the triumph of human rights  dignity  freedom and justice in South Africa. Thus  the Rwandese Government condemns as a ruse which deceives no one the constitutional amendments to which the Pretoria regime has resorted in desperation  as well as the electoral masquerade in which it has engaged within the framework of a strategy designed to perpetuate its odious policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. The Rwandese Republic demands the cessation of this policy and the establishment in South Africa of a genuinely democratic society based on equality of rights and respect for the dignity of all South Africans.34.	The amendments made to the South African constitution are only internal minor changes in a system whose basic principles have in no way changed. Thus  because they are black  the majority of South Africans continue to be treated as foreigners in their own country  kept outside political institutions by a regime which exploits them to the hilt and denies them their most fundamental rights. Furthermore  the policy of forced migration of populations and the establishment of bantustans with sham independence continues unabated. This is why the Rwandese Republic continues to denounce the reactionary  unacceptable policy of the South African Government. In the present context  this consistent attitude of the Government of Rwanda is accompanied by the fervent wish that the staunch supporters of the doctrine of apartheid will heed the voice of reason and the legitimate claims of the oppressed people. At the same time  we hope that South Africa will do everything necessary to fulfil the commitments it has undertaken vis-Ã -vis certain frontline States  in order to establish a climate likely to ensure genuine and effective detente in southern Africa  in a spirit of mutual respect and in the interest of the sacred cause of independence and freedom.35.	It is in this spirit that the General Assembly calls for profound  substantive changes in South African policy to ensure the positive development of the situation prevailing in that region and the establishment of a just and democratic society in South Africa to end the vicious circle of excessive violence.36.	The Rwandese Republic firmly believes in the virtues of dialogue as long as it is constructive and free from ulterior motives designed to compromise established principles and concepts.37.	The Government of Rwanda believes that it is in the context of such a frank and constructive dialogue that other major political problems facing Africa should be satisfactorily solved. I have in mind here the conflicts in Western Sahara and in Chad  which  along with the problems of southern Africa  are matters of great concern to the Organization of African Unity [OAU].38.	The conflict in Western Sahara is a problem of decolonization  and it can be solved only through respect for and the application of the universal principle of the right of all peoples to self-determination. By virtue of this principleâand we deplore the fact that it can be applied in a selective manner  to the detriment of the people of the Saharaâthe necessary steps should be taken in good faith and a spirit of confidence to enable that people freely to decide its own future.39.	To this end  at the nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted a resolution advocating a direct dialogue between the protagonists in the conflict and the organization of a referendum in Western Sahara. The timetable established in this connection has not been respected  but the resolution nevertheless constitutes a suitable basis for an equitable solution that deals just with the Saharan people and enables them to exercise their rights. In the same spirit  the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly adopted resolution 38/40 on 7 December 1983.40.	Deeply committed to the universal principle which recognizes and establishes the right of all peoples without exception to self-determination  the Rwandese Republic cherishes the hope that Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO will embark resolutely on negotiations in order to achieve a ceasefire without delay and organize a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU.41.	For some 20 years  Chad has been in the grip of a fratricidal conflict resulting from divisions and disputes which sap its energies  despite the appeals for dialogue and national reconciliation constantly made by the international community  particularly from this rostrum.42.	Thus  during the thirty-eighth session  on behalf of the Rwandese Republic  I noted that the continuance of this conflict seriously impeded the development of that brother country  which needs the contributions of all its sons and daughters to ensure its reconstruction and guarantee the rehabilitation of its economy  which has been devastated by so many years of war. Last year I also stressed that this work of national reconstruction and rehabilitation constituted a challenge which all the people of Chad had to meet in order to ensure their future. There is one prerequisite in this regard: the people of Chad must overcome the divisions and disputes which fuel the struggles for power and the futile quarrels. Indeed  the settlement of the Chadian problem is first and foremost a matter for the Chadians themselves  united in their efforts to achieve the fundamental goal of effective and lasting national reconciliation and in the search for a political settlement that will enable the people of Chad to safeguard the higher interests of their country  preserve Chad's territorial integrity and consolidate its independence  while guaranteeing that all their vital energies will be devoted to rebuilding its institutions and developing its economy.43.	In the Horn of Africa  the political climate is still marked by continuing tension  which causes grave concern. The Rwandese Republic believes that the parties involved should adopt  within the context of brotherly dialogue  a strategy that can bring peace  security  detente and stability to this area  which is one of the most sensitive in Africa. This strategy should be worked out and adopted on the basis of the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes  as advocated by the United Nations  the OAU and the Movement of Nonaligned Countries. The delegation of the Rwandese Republic is convinced that respect for these universal principles  which form the basis of international morality and ethics  will promote within the comity of nations fruitful relations transcending the political and ideological differences that result in the kind of disputes of which we see examples in the present situation in the Horn of Africa.44.	While we must deplore the problems that hinder the promotion of a climate of security in Africa  we have to say that the continent does not have a monopoly of tensions and conflict situations. The objective of promoting genuine  effective and constructive detente within the international community is hampered by latent or declared conflicts which are developing or are being carried on in other parts of the world.45.	For more than 30 years  faithful to the principles of international law  the countries that love peace  justice and freedom have deplored the situation prevailing in the Middle East. It is a dangerously explosive situation  which seriously threatens the security of the States of the region  and even international security  because of the denial of justice to an entire peopleâthe Palestinian peopleâthrough the unacceptable  arrogant policy of a State  Israel  whose policy has become the law of force  replacing the force of law. The rejection of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  the occupation of Arab territories  the annexation of the Holy City of Jerusalem  an aggressive policy in constant defiance of the principles of international lawâthese are some aspects of a continuing crisis which the United Nations constantly deplores  a crisis that is the responsibility of one State that has not drawn the lessons of its own history and has therefore become an implacable and unyielding enemy of a people fighting for the recognition of its most elementary and fundamental rights.46.	In the view of the Government of Rwanda  whose solidarity with the Palestinian people results from an objective analysis of the factors involved in the crisis and whose position on the matter has been constant  any solution to the Middle East conflict aimed at establishing a comprehensive  lasting peace in the region must be based on recognition of  and respect for  the inalienable  fundamental rights of the Palestinian people. These include the right to its own homeland  in which it may establish the institutional and governmental structures of its own choice  with respect for the principles of international law  under the auspices of its legitimate and authentic representatives. In this spirit  I repeat  on behalf of the Government and people of Rwanda  the unswerving support of the Rwandese Republic for efforts to preserve cohesion within the Palestinian resistance  as well as our solidarity with the Palestinian people  which  under the banner of the Palestine Liberation Organization V.PLO]  is pursuing its just struggle  in legitimate self-defence  to secure recognition of its rights  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  the OAU and the Movement of Nonaligned Countries.47.	The State of Israel  which rejects out of hand decisions concerning respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  is also notable for a blatant disregard for the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States. It seems to have set itself the goal of placing Lebanon under its protection  jeopardizing the efforts of the leaders of that martyred country to implement a comprehensive plan that would guarantee security and stability for the benefit of all Lebanese and would open the way to national reconciliation. Part of that country's territory has been under Israeli occupation since the tragic events of June 1982. Faced with this situation  the delegation of Rwanda believes that the total  unconditional withdrawal of the foreign troops of aggression that occupy nearly one third of Lebanese territory will enable the Government of Lebanon to exercise its sovereignty over the whole of its territory  preserve the independence of its country and work to rebuild its economy in a climate of peace  security and national reconciliation.48.	Five years ago  the differences that for more than 100 years had been a source of tension between Iraq and Iran erupted into an open conflict which has caused ever-increasing casualties and material losses. Recent developments in this conflict  and the prospect of a merciless war of extermination  give rise to grave apprehensions about the risk of its leading to a large-scale confrontation  which would be a serious threat to international peace and security. The United Nations  the Movement of non-aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have spared no effort to persuade the two belligerents to take part in negotiations to end an absurd and costly war which seriously jeopardizes the interests of two brother countries that are raising the stakes in a way that harms the interests of their peoples. Once again  the delegation of Rwanda expresses the hope that Iraq and Iran will be persuaded by the repeated appeals to return to the path of peace and once and for all to abandon the path of hate and bloody and destructive conflict.49.	Since the thirty-fifth session  among the serious problems which  because they interrupt the momentum gradually acquired by the policy of detente  stand in the way of international peace and security  the Organization has been dealing each year with the crisis which broke out at the end of 1979 in Afghanistan. The majority of Member States have taken a clear stance in favour of the total and unconditional withdrawal from that country of foreign forces  in order to enable the Afghan people to settle its problems in full sovereignty and free from all foreign interference.50.	In Southeast Asia  since December 1978  the Cambodian people has been tragically undergoing foreign interference in a political crisis which has turned into a bloody power struggle.51.	We regret to have to note that there has been no tangible and substantive progress towards a settlementâsettlement remains entirely theoreticalâof the situation in Afghanistan and Cambodia  which sows the seeds of tension and instability in Asia  harming the spirit of detente and harmony which should underlie international relations.52.	In this context  it is urgently necessary that the needed steps be taken to foster and facilitate the search for political solutions to the Afghan crisis and the Cambodian problem  with scrupulous respect for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes.'3. That same reliance on the fundamental principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations should also be seen in the context of bringing together in unity nations which are still divided.54. In line with these principlesâwhose complete implementation would promote the effective establishment of an atmosphere of peace and detente throughout the worldâthe Rwandese Republic greatly appreciates and supports the tireless efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting gradual normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  while waiting for the realization of the legitimate aspiration of the German people to regain its unity at the end of a process in which dialogue and respect for the right of all divided nations to seek the ways and means to regain their unity in peace and free from all outside interference and pressure constitute a principal element.55.	Rwanda firmly believes in the virtues of dialogue and is devoted to the principle that divided nations have the right to seek  by themselves and without outside interference or pressure  the best formula to promote the reunification of their countries and the participation of their peoples in building a world of peace  complementarity and effective solidarity. That is why we also support realistic initiatives aimed at ensuring  in that spirit  the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.56.	Since 1974  the island of Cyprus has faced de facto partition. Despite the efforts made by the United Nations  this problem persists  and there seems to have been no progress along the lines hoped for by the international community as a whole towards the achievement of a solution which would allow every Cypriot citizen to return to his home and to live in a country where communal characteristics complement one another rather than sowing fratricidal quarrels.57.	The problem of Cyprus is one in which reunification should be brought about through peaceful negotiations  without outside interference and with respect for the territorial integrity of the country.58.	The serious concern aroused by the persistence of open crises and by the proliferation of hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world has been exacerbated by the present escalation of the arms race  a frenzied race which is dragging mankind towards a new conflagrationâtowards its own annihilation. The arms race will lead to massive genocide; it has already had a negative impact  with a continuing and increasing build-up in the struggle for influence.59.	In spite of the efforts made by nations which cherish peace and which are aware of the effects of this arms race and of this escalation  there has yet to be any substantial progress towards disarmament. It is timeâhigh timeâthat negotiations were resumed and that they resulted in the adoption of effective  specific measures in the context of true and effective detente  in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions  resolutions which are in keeping with the wishes and aspirations of the international community.60.	The preservation and promotion of peace requires a staunch and persistent will to negotiate in order to achieve the gradual and balanced reduction of the arsenals which were established and which grow day by day in an atmosphere of mistrust and fear  pressing the Powers directly involved unceasingly to arm themselves further.61.	In this process  we see a spiral which I would not hesitate to call frenzied; it takes up major human  material  scientific and financial resources which would be more usefully employed for humanitarian ends  especially the promotion of social and economic development  in particular for the disadvantaged countries.62.	The Rwandese Republic is convinced that the frenzied arms race can in no way guarantee international security and that  on the contrary  it is leading mankind inexorably to the brink of the abyss  and we share the same concerns and the same aspirations of all the other countries that are actively pressing for the limitation and reduction of expenditures on arms  which should be reallocated to peaceful and humanitarian objectives. This reallocation would be a highly significant and positive factor towards curing the ills of the world economy  particularly in the present period of continuing crisis.63.	In referring to the great political  social and economic problems now at the heart of the concerns of the international community  I wished to review  on behalf of the Rwandese Republic  the main challenges which the United Nations must contribute to meeting in order to remove the major obstacles to the promotion of more harmonious international relations  marked by an effective will to establish a climate of peace and security and to provide for the social and economic development of all peoples in a spirit of mutual trust and active solidarity.64.	In spite of the very real difficulties we must continue to confront with hope and optimism  the Organization has a generally positive record in this regard  in so far as it remains within the context in which  for 39 years  the Assembly has regularly adopted resolutions and decisions defining appropriate means of settlement for the great political  social and economic problems of today.65.	The Rwandese Republic regrets that most of these resolutions and decisions remain dead letters. But this should not make the United Nations lose sight of the noble objectives of the Charter and thus to inspire hope for a better world  a world based on the great vision of peace  security  and social and economic progress in a climate of dialogue  mutual trust  complementarity and solidarity among peoples.66.	It is in that spirit that today  on behalf of Major General Juvenal Habyarimana  President of the Rwandese Republic and President Founder of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development  I solemnly renew the commitment of the Rwandese Republic to continue to contribute  to the best of its ability  to efforts to consolidate and strengthen confidence in the United Nations  on the basis of the fundamental principles enshrined in its Charter. In this respect  the delegation of Rwanda hopes that the work of the General Assembly at the present session will lead to decisions that will enable the United Nations to establish new landmarks on mankind's journey to the effective and complete implementation of the objectives which flow from those principles.67.	In that context  Mr. President  you have been entrusted with a very important task  that of guiding the work and the debates of this Assembly. In view of your talents and your experience as a wise and knowledgeable diplomat  the delegation of Rwanda is convinced that you will be able to discharge  in an outstanding manner  the difficult task entrusted to you  which is a tribute to your outstanding personal qualities and your competence  and a tribute also to the constructive role played by your country  Zambia  in the United Nations.68.	In expressing in my turn  as other speakers before me have done  our warm and fraternal congratulations on your election as President of this thirty-ninth session  I should like to stress that your election does outstanding honour to our continent and  in particular  to a country with which the Rwandese Republic is gratified and honoured to have excellent relations of brotherly friendship.69.	I should like also to pay a tribute to Mr. Jorge E. Illueca  who presided over the work of the thirty eighth session with most commendable efficiency.70.	I should like also to take this opportunity to renew to the Secretary General the expression of the great esteem which the Rwandese Republic has for the farsightedness  competence and dynamism with which he dedicates himself to the achievement of his noble and onerous task.71.	Finally  before leaving this rostrum  I should like  on behalf of the Rwandese Republic  to welcome into the United Nations its 159th Member State  the independent Sultanate of Brunei Darussalam. The Rwandese Republic heralded its accession to independence on 1 January 1984 as a further step in the achievement of one of the fundamental aims of the United Nations  the liberation of all peoples from the yoke of colonialism. Its admission bears witness to the universality of the Organization as well as to our unswerving devotion to the principles enshrined in the Charter."
"119",6040,"SAU",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to congratulate his friendly country on the prominent international role which it plays. I am confident that his excellent qualifications will facilitate his effective contribution to the success of our deliberations and to the achievement of positive results.130.	On behalf of my Government  may I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the able and objective manner with which Mr. Jorge Illueca  the President of the Republic of Panama and President of the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session  conducted the work of that session. I should also like to mention here that President Illueca  as the first Head of State to preside over a session of the General Assembly during his term of office  has helped to reinforce  through his prominent position and great competence  an enhanced public awareness of the increasing importance of the United Nations in relations between States and in the life of the peoples of the world.131.	I should like also to express appreciation for the great efforts exerted by the Secretary-General in the various fields and activities of the United Nations. With commendable dedication and perseverance  he has guided the Organization in its endeavours through difficult circumstances in a manner which deserves our appreciation  good wishes  and full support.132.	It gives me great satisfaction  furthermore  to express the happiness of the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia upon the admission of a sister State  Brunei Darussalam  to the United Nations. We are confident that its wise leadership and ancient history will enable it to make an effective contribution to the work of the Organization.133.	The capacity of the United Nations to continue to serve as a safety-valve  trusted and respected for the preservation of international peace and security on the one hand and for the establishment of a just basis for co-operation among States in the political  economic and social fields on the other hand depends to a great extent on its ability to perform its role  not only in confronting problems that endanger international peace and security  but also in finding effective solutions to those problems.134.	However  if we review the events of the past 12 months it becomes evident that we have returned to the General Assembly after a year in which there has been no sign of a breakthrough in resolving international and regional conflicts which threaten peace and security in one region or another. Peoples who have been robbed of their rights and who have been oppressed still survive  but in conditions of deprivation and injustice and in the grip of aggression and expansionism. The world has witnessed no progress towards the resolution of the problems posed by the inequitable economic  financial and trade relations between States. Numerous countries are  moreover  now afflicted by critical social problems  such as the problem of drug addiction  which  in certain areas  has reached epidemic proportions. It could become difficult to contain such problems within the geographic confines of specific States. Thus  concerted action by the international community is called for to confront and overcome such problems and eradicate their roots  in order to ensure the protection  safety and vitality of societies.135.	The lack of progress in the efforts to find solutions to the key problems threatening peace and stability and to tackle effectively their underlying causes  in their human dimensions  on a just and balanced basis  will hinder our ability to ease for present and future generations the increasing fear of a life filled with crises and disputes.136.	Nevertheless  the discouraging spectacle of the past 12 months  which persists  makes it even more necessary for us to do everything possible to unravel the intricacies of these problems  whether economic  political or social  and to find solutions to them.137.	The role of the United Nations should not be limited simply to stating the prevalence of international problems and crises. Rather it should be to articulate practical suggestions which will enable the international community to confront imminent dangers and find solutions based on justice and objectivity.138.	The non-acceptance by certain States of the supremacy of law  the absence of moral inhibition in their actions and the lack of preventive measures are among the basic factors that cause such Stages to prefer aggression and expansion and to depend on force for resolving problems. Therefore  if we really want to establish peace and security in the world  we have no alternative but to adopt moral and legal principles to guide us through the intricacies and complexities of modem international relations.139.	In this regard  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  by adhering to Islam as its creed and conviction and to the Koran as its constitution and guide  has established firm foundations for its dealings with other States. Because Islam is a creed that promotes freedom  stands in the way of aggression and exploitation  opposes injustice in all its forms and strives for equity and fairness  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia deals with others on a basis of equality  refrains from interfering in the internal affairs of others and respects the principles of national sovereignty. In the international arena of the United Nations  we comply with its Charter  support its efforts and oppose any action that attempts to weaken it or to replace the authority of international law with the instruments of force and the means of terror. The conduct of relations by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has reflected  and will continue to reflect  its sense of belonging to the whole international community as one family  as well as its belief in the principles of peace based upon right and justice.140.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  like all the other members of the international community  formulates its position on international matters and crystallizes its foreign relations through its adherence and commitment to international bodies and organizations. In this context  the Kingdom is proud of its membership of the Gulf Co-operation Council  which was established in conformity with the charters and resolutions of the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and with the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Charter of the United Nations. The Kingdom's membership of that Council is not a mere political commitment or temporary attachment; it represents the reality of our destiny  reflecting our common aspirations for a future based upon stability  prosperity and progress. The Council has takenâas Sheikh Sabah Al- Ahmad Al-Jaber Al- Sabah  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Information of the State of Kuwait pointed out in his speech yesterday âeffective and constructive steps towards the attainment of political  economic  social and cultural co-operation  as well as security  between its member States. It has thus demonstrated that it is a positive factor for stability in the region and a deterrent to foreign interference  especially in problems that are the prime concern of the Gulf States themselves.141.	The prestige of the United Nations  which embodies the hopes and aspirations of nations and peoples for peace  the confidence placed in it by the international community and its capacity to carry out its responsibilities depend on its ability to find effective solutions to the problems that confront Member States on the one hand  and those that threaten international peace and security on the other.142.	Some of the problems which the United Nations has faced for a considerable time but for which it has been unable to find solutions are becoming increasingly serious and threatening. This is simply the result of a fundamental disregard of the basic reasons underlying these problems. The questions of Palestine  Jerusalem and the Middle East  which confront us and are under consideration here  are clear examples of such an approach.143.	The question of Palestine is the most serious example of international political injustice. It reflects the reality of Israel's reckless attitude towards human principles and established norms and its flagrant defiance of the resolutions adopted by the international community  as represented by the United Nations  as well as its determined pursuit of aggressive policies and racist practices.144.	Israel is without doubt making every effort to create the impression that the question of Palestine has reached such heights of complexity that it is impossible to find a solution to it  and that the Middle East is a region prone to crises and conflicts  aiming by all such claims to perpetuate instability in the region and foment disputes and trouble  thus arousing fear and despair in people's hearts. It seeks thereby to frustrate efforts aimed at establishing a stable peace in the region so that it may carry out its aggressive  expansionist designs without restraint or control.145.	The logic and reality of the situation refute these Israeli claims. The Zionist presence is the reason why this region suffers from crises and conflicts. The claim that the Palestinian question has become so complicated that it is incapable of solution is therefore baseless and should be rejected. The truth at the core of this problem is clear and completely unambiguous. The numerous United Nations resolutions condemning the aggressive acts of Israel and confirming the right of the Palestinian people to their homeland and the Arab character of Jerusalem need no further reiteration here.146.	However  the real impediment and basic obstacle is the reckless attitude of Israel to all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations  its obstruction of efforts by the United Nations to solve these problems  its total rejection of any genuine movement towards peace based on right and justice and its lack of seriousness with regard to all initiatives aimed at establishing peace in the region.147.	While the Camp David agreements cannot serve as a framework for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  as has been proved  Israel claims that its signature on those agreements and its withdrawal from the Sinai prove its inclination towards peace. In reality  however  its ratification of the agreements was a pretext to enable it to annex the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  Jerusalem and the Golan  to expel the legitimate populations of those areas and to install Israeli colonies. It considers those agreements to be an alternative to any other peaceful solution to the problem of the Arab territories it still occupies and in which it practises the ugliest forms of oppression and terror  denying not only the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people but also their right to exist as an entity. Consequently  the Zionist aggression against the Arab States is continuing  despite the false claim that Israel will respond to just demands if it considers that the security it asks for has been realized.148.	The reality of the situation indicates otherwise. Israel still demonstrates through both its conduct of affairs and its aggressive practices that it is seeking land and not peace. That is why we witness the full-scale Israeli effort to stockpile its arsenals with the most modern and destructive weaponry. The extended interpretation of its security claim beyond the Arab fold proves  furthermore  that it is the Arabs and not Israel who are in need of security. Israel has always been the aggressor and has devastating weapons not possessed by any Arab State  while its security is being assured by East and West alike.149.	For their part  the Arabs have proved that they seek peace based on justice  not a peace imposed by force and oppression. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez in November 1981 and September 1982  demonstrated the definitive Arab momentum towards peace. The Arab States articulated their understanding of the peace process in the decisions contained in their Final Declaration/ decisions based on international legitimacy and conforming to the international will reflected in resolutions of the United Nations.150.	This deep conviction of the Arabs of the necessity of establishing a just and lasting peace in the region should not lead to their paying a high price for believing in justice  right and peace. The Arab States have carried out their historic responsibility and have given all they can to establish peace and stability in the region  thereby affirming their genuine belief in peace as a policy. The Fez decisions once again demonstrate the Arab consensus for a peace based on justice. Those decisions have taken into account the reality of the situation in the region and contain the basic principles that can serve as an objective point of departure for the establishment of a just and durable peace. Among those principles is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self- determination and to the establishment of their own independent State  on their land  under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative.151.	The land of Palestine lies in the midst of a large area inhabited by hundreds of millions of people  deep in the geographical heartland of a vast Arab and Muslim world  a fact Israel  by its aggression  continues to defy. Nobody has ventured so far in imposing such a heavy burden upon the international community  in breaking international laws and conventions and in defying the international will as have the Israelis. As a matter of fact  Israel constitutes a political  economic and moral burden on the States which support it.152.	We believe that what we need now is to make a determined effort towards taking the necessary effective actions and measures for applying and carrying out what has already been adopted in resolutions  as well as to take a definitive stand on the way in which the initiative for peace can be launched.153.	Consequently  it is imperative to address the basic components of a just solution for the question of Palestine  foremost among which is the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  a people tyrannized in their own country  displaced from their homeland and deprived of their natural rightsârights which peoples of all nations of the world enjoyâas well as the withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories  especially Jerusalem.154.	In this connection  I should like to reiterate the warning given by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  by all Muslim countries and by all peace-loving States in the world with regard to the gravity of Israel's schemes to alter the physical character of Jerusalem and to violate the security and sanctity of the Al- Aqsa Mosque  as well as of other Muslim and Christian shrines in Palestine.155.	A definitive momentum towards peace exists in the Arab and Muslim world. The great fear is that the inability of the United Nations to handle this persistent problem  as well as the stubbornness of Israeli extremism in violating the sanctity of the holy shrines in Palestine  will force the Arab and Islamic nations to mobilize all their capabilities to confront Israeli extremism  at great cost and with consequences which will not affect only the Middle East.156.	The situation in Lebanon remains fully charged with dangers that risk an explosion at any time. The continuation of the Israeli military presence in Lebanon and the persistence of Israel in fomenting disputes and friction among different Lebanese factions  as well as its interference in internal Lebanese affairs  are further proof of its expansionist intentions and aggressive designs.157.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sister Arab States have exerted great efforts to co-operate with the Lebanese Government and to support its endeavours to return conditions to normal. We will continue to spare no effort in this direction  but such efforts will not be fruitful and will not bring about genuine peace in Lebanon unless the Israeli invasion and occupation is ended in all its forms and manifestations.158.	Preventing Israel from interfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon and the total unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory are two prerequisites for the normalization of the situation in Lebanon and for the rededication of efforts aimed at the realization of a just and total peace in the Middle East.159.	The war between Iraq and Iran has entered its fifth year and continues to rage. The toll it has exacted from both the Iraqi and the Iranian peoples has been heavy in all areas. It is a senseless and totally unjustifiable war. The Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations have all called for and worked towards putting an end to this tragedy between two neighbouring countries. Furthermore  the Gulf Co-operation Council  as stated yesterday by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar  has exerted extensive efforts in this direction. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported and contributed to all these efforts. Iraq has announced its readiness to stop the war. Iran has not yet responded to that call. This war can have no victors  given the damage it has inflicted upon both countries. The positive attitude displayed by Iraq should be matched by Iran  and an end brought to this bloodshed between two neighbouring Islamic countries. As their immediate neighbour which perceives the gravity of events taking place  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is concerned for the security and stability of those two countries.160.	I should like to recall here the complaint lodged by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  over the attacks upon shipping in our territorial waters and in adjacent water lanes two months ago. On behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  I should like to thank the 13 States in the Security Council which understood the facts of the matter and appreciated the truth. Guided by their realization of the interest that all parties  especially those in the area  have in warding off aggression  they voted on 1 June 1984 in favour of the draft resolution before the Council. That important stand taken by the Security Council has strengthened our hope that the Council will pursue its efforts and that the Secretary-General will continue his good offices to bring about the cessation of the Iran-Iraq war  with its possible repercussions upon the region and the world at large.161.	Among the major problems confronting the international community and requiring urgent and effective solutions is the situation in Afghanistan and the continuing Soviet military occupation of that country. The Soviet presence there has entered its fifth year. The Afghan mujahidin are waging a fierce war in defence of their religion  their fatherland and their rights. We reiterate our appeal to the Soviet Union  as a super-Power with a correspondingly great obligation with regard to peace and security in the world  to withdraw from Afghanistan and let the Afghan people determine their own destiny and choose the system that they desire for themselves.162.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to the stand taken by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  which has called  in particular  for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the granting to the Afghan people of their right to self-determination  this stand being in support of the Islamic people of Afghanistan  their holy war and their right to liberate their country. Furthermore  we support the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General in this regard and draw attention to the fact that any such efforts should take into consideration the rights and demands of the Afghan163.	We also wish to express our gratitude once again to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for its great humanitarian role in offering hospitality to more than 3.5 million Afghans. This represents a considerable economic and social burden  which Pakistan continues to bear generously and graciously. Such a noble staid by Pakistan should not expose it to aggression and violation of its territorial integrity by the puppet Government in Kabul.164.	South Africaâthat natural ally of Israel  by virtue of the similarity of their circumstances and interestsâstill practises the most repugnant form of discrimination  despite repeated world-wide condemnation and rejection and in spite of the international community's call on the South African Government to desist from such policies. We reiterate our denunciation and condemnation of this racist policy and support all the steps taken by the United Nations. South Africa has rejected all humanitarian considerations  as well as appeals made by numerous countries of the world  and has ignored historical realities  being induced by the lure of short-term gain which will lead it to the inevitable and tragic consequences that have befallen every society founded on profound structural contradictions.165.	The persistence of South Africa in rejecting solutions to the problem of Namibia  thereby denying all Namibian rights  can scarcely help it to perceive the consequences of negating the rights of the Namibian people in their own territory. The moral of the lesson of Rhodesia has not yet been grasped by the forces of expansionism and conquest despite the short time that has elapsed since the fall of racist Rhodesia. Namibia must recover its rights in their entirety. All African citizens must live freely in their own land. We support the rights of the Namibian people and stand behind the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity in their efforts to eliminate racist practices and end the alien occupation in Namibia.166.	Disarmament has become a vital issue today for the security and progress of the world. The arms race and the gigantic sums being spent to finance it have resulted in increasing tension in the world. This situation has forced many countries  especially developing countries  to earmark a substantial part of their limited n sources for defence  at the expense of their progress and social and economic development. In this context  I should like to express our appreciation of the initiatives and resolutions the United Nations has attempted to implement over the years. At the same time  we hope that the efforts by the Organization  which is respected by the whole world  will achieve some progress in protecting humanity from the imminent dangers and safeguard the developing countries from being drawn into the conflicts and the struggles for influence which threaten all humanity. Among the matters on which the United Nations can take decisive action is an embargo on armaments for Israel  South Africa and other States already possessing devastating weaponry  especially because these further complicate global disarmament.167.	Today  as throughout history  economic problems are among the major causes of international tension  whereas they could be among the major factors for the generation of mutual understanding and co-operation. In spite of the increasing signs of economic recovery in some of the major industrialized States  the world still faces a decline  in international trade  especially in the trade of developing countries. The rate of unemployment is still high in the industrialized countries  while exchange rates for the major foreign currencies and interest rates are marked by sharp and frequent fluctuations. Moreover  the foreign trade balance and the balance of payments of many industrialized countries continue to suffer from serious inconsistencies  while the protectionist trend in the developed States is still on the rise.168.	The great disparity among the States of the world with regard to the quantity and kind of natural and material resources they possess renders cooperation between the peoples of the developed and developing countries imperative. That disparity should promote understanding  encourage dialogue and strengthen solidarity among the States of the world  rather than be the pretext for consecrating the imbalance and widening the gap between rich and poor States.169.	As a developing country  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recognizes from its own realities what difficulties developing nations go through in order to attain the standard of living they desire. Our Kingdom  being aware of its responsibilities as a member of the world community  is anxious to strengthen the bonds of co-operation among States and is eager to participate actively in solving the development problems confronting the developing countries of the world. Accordingly  as soon as it had the financial means  it sought to invest a significant portion of those means in supporting efforts aimed at strengthening the development drive in developing countries. It has become our established and traditional policy to fulfil our commitments in that regard.170.	In this context  the Kingdom reaffirms its belief in the necessity of positive action to achieve the objectives of total development and genuine progress and prosperity for all the peoples of the world. To realize this goal  it is necessary for development assistance both to continue and to increase  which in turn requires genuine co-operative efforts to strengthen existing development organizations and to increase their resources and their capacities to play a more effective and realistic role in meeting the demands of this critical phase. Total development is the basic prerequisite without which we cannot hope for a continuously developing world in which nations can exchange benefits and complement each other's needs.171.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that it will be possible to secure the requisite financial resources to effect the necessary economic changes  and to achieve during this decade a reasonable standard of development in the developing countries generally  when the industrialized countries of both the Eastern and the Western blocs shoulder their responsibilities fully and meet their financial obligations under the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the targets of official development assistance defined therein. It is no longer possible to accept the excuses given by industrialized States with regard to either the size or the terms of their assistance or their international responsibility in connection with the economic difficulties faced by developing countries.172.	The increasing trade protectionism in the industrialized countries is a regrettable trend which has been proved both useless world-wide and destructive to the foundations of international trade. In the light of this  we repeat our appeal to the industrialized countries to recognize the need to abolish the protectionist measures they have adopted and confirm their commitment to the letter and spirit of the free international trading system. Further  we call upon them to address problems through existing international channels and in accordance with valid international agreements and covenants.173.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pledged its full support for the efforts being exerted to develop and strengthen economic co-operation among developing countries and for the strategy of collective self- reliance. I wish to reiterate and confirm our continued support for these efforts. We consider them to be an integral and complementary part of the efforts being exerted to promote wider international economic co-operation. We accordingly welcome efforts to strengthen trade co-operation among developing countries and to establish a comprehensive system of trade preferences among developing countries  and we wish such efforts success.174.	The complete interdependence of the problems and interests of world tradeâcommodities  finance and developmentâmeans that they must be handled in a comprehensive and complementary manner. This is because focusing on one factor alone will lead to a temporary solution that favours that factor above the others and thus to the dead end to which all previous attempts led us. Consequently  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports the idea of global economic negotiations and finds no sound alternative for reaching a fair solution of international economic problems that will prove stable and durable.175.	The consciousness of peoples is one of the strongest motive forces of the events of its history. We are living at present in an age in which the most detailed economic data reach the furthest corners of the globe to reveal the full picture of what is taking place. Consequently  the importance of interdependence has become obvious and undeniable. It has also become evident how important for the improvement of international economic conditions is serious collective effort  together with extensive economic co-operation in the solution of international economic problems. The developing countries have demonstrated their genuine desire for sincere co-operation to promote the welfare of the international community through their great flexibility and distinct inclination towards practicality and objectivity in making their demands in the field of international economic co-operation for development. They have long been awaiting a positive response from the industrialized countries. The world community is called upon today to reinforce confidence in the institutions and mechanisms of international economic co-operation and especially in the programmes of the United Nations and its specialized agencies.176.	I take this opportunity to call upon the industrialized countries not to lose a golden opportunity for establishing the foundations of fruitful co-operation between themselves and the developing countries  and to be instrumental without further delay in reviving a serious dialogue and starting a new round of global economic negotiations  in a spirit of mutual confidence and sincere co-operation  for the good of the international community. At the same time  we call upon the developing countries to maintain the momentum in a realistic and flexible manner. I want to reiterate our firm belief that the difficulties which face our efforts to activate international economic co-operation and build a new international economic order based on justice should not in any circumstances become a reason for despair. On the contrary  they should motivate us to continue our efforts for the well-being of humanity.177.	Reviewing present international conditions  we find that international problems have but increased in depth and gravity. This is confirmation to us that the role of the United Nations acquires greater importance whenever the possibilities and opportunities for interaction and co-operation among States increase.178.	Peace based on justice and not peace based on the balance of terror is the objective of this international Organization. Indeed  it is the only path to security and stability. The consciousness of injustice among peoples deprived of self-determination is the most explosive time bomb threatening the world.179.	All of us  I am sure  hope that this session of the Assembly will provide an excellent opportunity for the peoples of the world to find solutions to their regional and global problems  with wisdom and a sense of collective responsibility. Certainly it is in our common interest to strive for the superiority of law and justice over oppression  and for freedom over subjugation  so that peace may prevail and nations may realize their dreams in progress and prosperity."
"120",6077,"SDN",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure  in the name of the people and Government of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan  to extend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are happy to see a distinguished African and a seasoned diplomat presiding over the deliberations of this important forum at a time when international relations are passing through a critical and difficult phase. We are confident that  with your well-known wisdom and tact  you will lead our deliberations in the way best suited to the achievement of our aspirations.106.	Our deepest gratitude and appreciation also go to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for the excellent and successful manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session.107.	We also congratulate Brunei Darussalam on its accession to membership of the United Nations. We are convinced that  with its rich historic and cultural heritage  Brunei Darussalam will contribute in a most positive manner to the enhancement of our efforts to ensure peace  prosperity and stability.108.	For a long time following our independence  we continued to be captive to an alien culture and civilization far removed from our heritage and spiritual and cultural values. Then  on 25 May 1969  came the revolution that emancipated the will of the nation and gradually took the country back to its cultural heritage  through the Islamic way of life. The Sudan  by choosing the Islamic way of life  is a proponent of unity and fraternity for all its citizens  Muslims as well as adherents to other religions. The Islamic way of life in our country means conciliation and love  with no violence and no imposition. It means rule by democracy and rationalization. It is rule that interacts with human civilization  open-mindedly and in a spirit of compromise.109.	President Nemery  in his address to the nation on 1 January this year  said:""We shall not allow anybody to lead us to conflict and disunity in the name of religion. Sudan  under the shadow and by virtue of Islam  will be a model of the peaceful coexistence of different cultures  beliefs and religions. God willing  Sudan will be a model for a real Islamic awakening  uplifted by the values of Islam and renewed by its teachings. We shall not be a nucleus for embattlement but will  rather  remain a model admired by all.""110.	The Islamic way of life in our country is an expression of the will of the Sudanese people to determine their national goals and ultimately create a just and caring society. It is a way of life that respects human rights in their totality  including the rights of non-Muslims  enabling them to practice their beliefs and cultural activities.111.	All these values were embodied in a wonderful national consensus when the Sudanese people joined in vociferous processions commemorating the first anniversary of the application of Islamic law and the holding of the International Islamic Conference  in which hundreds of Islamic leaders and scholars participated. The Sudanese people have thus confirmed their unswerving commitment to the application of Islamic law. They have provided an adequate reply to all campaigns launched by those who wanted us to remain captive to alien values and cultures. Through those processions  the Sudanese people reaffirmed their determination to stand steadfast against all who intend to threaten our national unity  in contravention of regional and international charters and in defiance of sound international conduct.112.	The Islamic way of life in Sudan rests on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations which stipulate the right of each State to choose its own political  economic and social system. This rebirth in Sudan will be a driving force  encouraging us to meet our national  continental and international commitments. In the League of Arab States  we shall continue to be faithful to the Palestinian cause. In the OAU  we shall spearhead the struggle against colonialism and racism. My country contributes effectively to the work of the Organization of the Islamic Conference towards fulfilment of the hopes of the Islamic peoples. As a founding member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  we reaffirm our commitment to its principles and we shall endeavour to steer it away from big-Power axes and struggles.113.	On the regional level  we work to promote political and economic co-operation with our Arab and African neighbours through bilateral and multilateral channels. We have therefore established joint ministerial commissions and bodies concerned with co-operation and integration  as called for at the Lagos economic summit  in order to utilize our countries' capabilities in construction and development. One of the main manifestations of that cooperation is the common efforts of the Central African Republic  Sudan  Egypt  Uganda and Zaire towards that end. In addition  I must mention the integration of Sudan and brother Egypt  which provides a successful model for the ideal pattern of co-operation between two neighbouring States.114.	The serious international economic crisis is still at the top of the international agenda. The United Nations system is particularly concerned about that crisis  owing to its negative impact on all aspects of international relations  in particular the widening gap between developing and developed countries and the lack of progress towards the dialogue and co-operation between those countries that is necessary if the structural problems affecting the world economy are to be addressed.115.	The critical economic situation in Africa  by virtue of its depth  severity  scope and duration  poses a direct threat to the lives of millions of Africans throughout the continent. In addition to the impact of the international economic crisis  Africa has had to endure severe natural disasters. Persistent drought and creeping desertification are wiping out agricultural land and livestock. This has exacerbated the situation to such an extent that all projections indicate that Africa will continue to suffer the impact of the current crisis even if there is a marked recovery in the international economy.116.	The impact of the international situation on Africa is reflected in declining export earnings as a result of the continuous decline in commodity prices  steep rises in the cost of imported capital goods  services and agricultural inputs and a drying up of the financial resources so necessary for investment. In addition to all this  the debt-servicing burden has ballooned to surpass export earnings. The combined impact of these factors has resulted  in the short term  in suffering and sacrifices and  in the long term  would undermine and halt our development efforts.117.	Sudan  together with many other African countries  is now facing the impact of the current economic crisis  coupled with the impact of devastating climatic conditions. For three years  Sudan has been hit by a persistent drought  which was most severely felt in the Kurdufan and Darfur regions in the west and in the eastern region. The affected area is approximately equal to half the area of Western Europe. We are particularly alarmed at the drought because the affected areas include important agricultural and livestock production centres. The devastating impact of drought on the economy of the affected areas and on the economy of Sudan as a whole needs no elaboration.118.	Despite these difficulties  Sudan remains a refuge for over a million refugees from neighbouring countries. We are sheltering the increasing numbers of refugees out of respect for and commitment to the relevant international conventions. Our doors are never closed in the faces of these refugees. We continue to share with them the limited resources and services at our disposal. Caring for refugees  however  is a heavy burden for any individual country; is a common international responsibility. In this context  we welcome the results of the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  and hope that the international community  and especially the donor countries  will mobilize the resources necessary for the implementation of the projects prepared by the host countries. Most of those projects  despite good and thorough preparation  await the necessary financing.119.	This is only a small part of what Africa is experiencing as a result of the severe crisis  international attention and additional resources must be focused on support for the efforts of the African countries to face the crisis. The initiative of the Secretary-General earlier this year was a most valuable catalyst in focusing world attention on what is happening in Africa and in urging the international community to step up its assistance to meet both the urgent needs  particularly serious food shortages  and the medium- and long-term needs for the rehabilitation of agriculture  industry and infrastructure  thus making possible the resumption of endeavours towards economic and social development.120.	We fully recognize that dealing with the current crisis is the primary responsibility of the African countries themselves. However  the scope and nature of the crisis make it necessary that the international community  in a spirit of co-operation and mutual interest  assume a basic responsibility in supporting the African efforts.121.	We believe that the World Bank's plan for Africa will be very useful in securing the necessary financial resources to help the African countries meet the crisis. However  we regret that the latest World Bank meeting did not achieve a clear international commitment to provide the necessary economic resources for Africa  despite statements of support and sympathy from all the donor countries. We hope that the responsible officials of the World Bank will continue their efforts to achieve that end. We also hope that bilateral and multilateral channels  and particularly the United Nations and its programmes  will be used to provide the necessary resources to support the efforts of the African countries.122.	Africa is facing this serious economic crisis while also facing other serious political challenges posed by the deteriorating situation in southern Africa. There  the Pretoria racist regime continues to practise its inhuman apartheid policy and to deny the African majority its legitimate rights. It maintains its illegal occupation of Namibia and continues to pose a serious threat to southern African countries and to Africa as a whole.123.	This year  the Pretoria regime came up with yet another plot in a series of plots to entrench its apartheid system. This is the so-called constitutional reform  which grants the Coloureds and those of Asian origin separate chambers in the Parliament. These ""reforms"" appear to enable those minorities to participate in government  but in reality they attempt to precipitate a conflict between those groups and the black majority  which is denied even this sham participation. However  despite these attempts to entrench apartheid and perpetuate the suffering of the black majority  the sinister efforts of the white minority regime were frustrated at both the national and the international level. At the national level  the groups that the so-called reforms were designed to appease boycotted the elections and participated in the popular uprising against the ""reforms"". That uprising reconfirmed the unity of the peoples of South Africa against the tyranny of the white racist minority. Repression and new Sharpeville and Sowe-to massacres could not stifle the uprising.124.	At the level of the international community  which the white minority attempted to appease by a facade of moderation and gradual reform  the so- called constitutional reforms elicited only rejection and contempt. The international community understood the real objective of those ""reforms"" and rejected them  as it had earlier rejected the Bantustans. The resolution adopted by the General Assembly last Friday and the similar Security Council resolution reaffirm that international rejection. We hope that this clear international consensus will mean the continuance of international pressure and action to eradicate the abominable apartheid system.125.	One hundred years have passed since the foreign domination and occupation of Namibia began. The Namibian people is still struggling to achieve self-determination and independence. However  there is no sign of an imminent solution to this problem. The situation poses a basic challenge to the ability of the United Nations to expedite the achievement of Namibian independence in conformity with the peace plan endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978). It is imperative here to denounce and reject South Africa's attempts to use Namibia's independence to serve its own interests and to link it to extraneous issues that are not part of the peace plan. The settlement of the question of Namibia necessitates  therefore  continued and serious international action to achieve independence for Namibia and continued material and moral support for SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.126.	Sudan has always paid particular attention to developments in neighbouring Chad. What takes place there directly affects us because of the close links of blood  common history and geography. We continue to call for respect for Chadâs security  territorial integrity and unity. We have insisted that the Chadians should be left to solve Chad's problems and achieve national reconciliation without any foreign involvement or interference. Indeed  my country has made tireless efforts towards that objective  but continuous foreign interference and intervention have exacerbated the problem and undermined efforts to facilitate the achievement of a Chadian solution by the Chadians themselves.127.	In the light of the serious situation in Chad  Sudan calls upon the international community to continue efforts in support of the legitimate Government of Chad  under the presidency of Hissene Habre  and in support of its efforts to achieve national reconciliation and safeguard Chad's independence  unity and territorial integrity.128.	We have no doubt whatsoever that a settlement of the question of Chad can be achieved only by the Chadians themselves  free from any foreign pressures or interference. Efforts or arrangements related to the question of Chad must not be at the expense of the independence of Chad  its unity or its territorial integrity.129.	While the development of events in the Middle East and the tragedies encountered by the Palestinian people have continued to endanger peace and security in the region and the world at large  they also represent a real challenge to the credibility of the United Nations and its responsibility to confront the aggressor and restore justice and legitimacy.130.	The situation in the Middle East is rapidly deteriorating as a result of Israel's intransigence  its policy of aggression and expansion  its denial of the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  its annexation of Arab land and its establishment of illegal settlements  together with its persistent criminal practices aimed at stifling the voice of right and justice and at eliminating the Palestinian problem  which is recognized by the international community as the core and essence of the Middle East question. The international community has also demonstrated its consensus in various forums  and most recently at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  to the effect that no just and lasting peace can be established in the Middle East without the total and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and the exercise by the Palestinian people  under its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  of its rights to self-determination  to return to its homeland and to recover its possessions and its right to establish its own independent and sovereign State on its territory. In this connection  the implementation of the recommendations of the Geneva Conference  adopted by the General Assembly last year remains an urgent priority if the international com-munity is to fulfil its responsibility for achieving peace and security on the basis of right  justice and international legitimacy.131.	In the absence of a deterrent against the aggressive Israeli practices  Israel will continue to be encouraged to defy the will of the international community and to continue its irresponsible practices unabated. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon has demonstrated once more that the situation in that region will continue to be riddled with imminent dangers unless Israel is forced to abandon its policy of aggression and expansion. The whole world has witnessed its genocidal practices in Lebanon  a continuation of its cruel and repressive policies in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  the Holy City of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. In strongly condemning the Israeli policies and practices  the international community should force Israel to withdraw totally from Lebanon  in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions  to enable Lebanon to regain its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.132.	As we reconvene in an atmosphere of international instability  hotbeds of tension  foreign intervention in the internal affairs of others  economic crisis and natural calamities  there is no option but to follow the path of peace and stability through the adherence of Member States to the principles of the Charter and the implementation of collective security arrangements provided for in the Charter.133.	There is no doubt that technological advances and the resulting interdependence of States make any set-back in the peace process in any region a threat to the peace and security of others. In this connection  the Sudan has shown heightened concern vis-a-vis recent events in the Red Sea which culminated in the deployment of mines in that strategic waterway. This concern is but a continuation of previous efforts and an initiative undertaken by the Sudan leading to the Quadripartite Summit Conference  held at Taiz in 1977  which was aimed at declaring the Red Sea a zone of peace  free from big-Power struggles and hegemony. Recent events have reconfirmed the need for concerted action by the littoral States in order to secure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. That is why we have again called for a meeting at Khartoum of the Foreign Ministers of the littoral States. We hope that current consultations between the States concerned may lead shortly to the desired goals. This will consolidate the current efforts aimed at transforming the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  particularly as the Red Sea is one of its most important natural extensions.134.	The Iraq-Iran war is entering its fifth year. We in the Sudan are closely following developments and feel great sorrow at the continuation of this war between two countries which are linked by bonds of religion and geographical proximity. What really arouses sorrow is Iran's defiance of all appeals and international efforts emanating from the United Nations and from regional bodies with a view to halting this prolonged war  which may extend to all the other countries of the region. From this rostrum  we wish to commend the conciliatory attitude of Iraq and its efforts aimed at putting an end to this war and its aftermath. On the other hand  we call on Iran once again to be reasonable and accept these peace initiatives in order to stop the waste of human and material resources.135.	The Sudan firmly rejects the use of force in solving conflicts and appeals for the settlement of differences through dialogue and negotiation. Guided by that principle  we call once again for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea so as to enable the two peoples to exercise their right to self-determination freely and without any external intervention or pressures.136.	We also call for a peaceful settlement in Cyprus  in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General. It is our hope too that the conflict in Korea will be solved peacefully  in accordance with the aspirations and wishes of the Korean people  in a manner that will enable them to exercise their free will without any foreign intervention and to contribute positively to international efforts to achieve international peace and co-operation.137.	Our world faces many problems and many dangerous conflicts. The greatest of these problems is the arms race and  in particular  its nuclear dimension  now extending to outer space. We express our profound concern that no tangible progress has yet been achieved in disarmament  a situation which may lead to a confrontation between the two superpowers. This horrible danger which threatens the very existence of mankind makes it imperative that the great Powers overcome all the difficulties preventing total and comprehensive disarmament. The astronomical figure of $1 000 billion spent on armaments should be channelled towards developmental efforts and international economic co-operation.138.	In conclusion  allow me to express our appreciation of the Secretary-General's continuous efforts  as described in his report on the work of the Organization  outlining the main issues facing the United Nations and the future of international economic co-operation. Now that we are on the threshold of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of this august body  we hope that the report will be the basis for our discussions during this session and in the interim so that we may reassert the achievements of the United Nations and seek ways and means to avoid any shortcomings. By so doing  the United Nations will be able to mobilize the aspirations of the people of the world.139.	May I take this opportunity to reaffirm our unflinching support for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and our continuous efforts to bring about the noble goals enshrined therein."
"121",6123,"SEN",39,1984,"ï»¿The General Assembly has by the unanimous decision of its members  Sir  elected you President of its thirty-ninth session. That outstanding election had been expected  since Africa's continental organization  the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  adopted two resolutions recommending your candidacy for that office  at Nairobi in June 1981 and at Addis Ababa in June 1983. Your country's many friends throughout the world supported that recommendation  thus reaffirming their confidence in and friendship for Africa  Zambia and you  personallyâconfidence and friendship of which we are justly proud. We ask you  therefore  to accept our warm fraternal congratulations. As President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  you have shown discreetly and effectively your eminent qualities as diplomat  statesman and champion or the right of peoples to independence. I had the honour of presiding at your side over the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  held in Paris in April 1983  and I am therefore in a position to say how great was your positive contribution to the success of that gathering. There is no doubt that  with such qualifications  you will be able to guide the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly to a most successful conclusion.41.	I wish also to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who  as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session and at a particularly difficult time in world affairs  worked with courage and clear-mindedness to reaffirm the mission of the United Nations: to promote peace and harmony among nations.42.	In this connection  I cannot fail to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  whose broadmindedness  analytical abilities  independence of judgement and fidelity to the ideals of the United Nations we were able to appreciate yet again when he visited Senegal in January 1984. His journey to the furthest corners of our continent was an act of faith which provided further proof that  with goodwill and using the right means  the plight and the hopes of a great part of mankind can be calmly identified  and that solutions can be sought and found if we are imbued with a spirit of international solidarity and praiseworthy generosity and brotherhood.43.	I wish finally to welcome the sister country of Brunei Darussalamâlike Senegal  a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conferenceâto membership of the United Nations. Its devotion to the ideals of peace  justice and harmony as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations are the best guarantee that Brunei Darussalam will be able to contribute with determination and effectiveness to the promotion of the United Nations and to the achievement of its purposes.44.	Once again we  the representatives of the world's peoples  States and Governments  have come together to consider the situation and future of mankind  and to do so despite the differences in our ideological choices  political systems  spheres of culture  traditions and customs  aware that the civilizations of which we are the products and the authors are complementary  aware also that 159 nations cannot in a meeting lasting only a few weeks together work out exactly what action must be taken to improve the lot of mankind without first being convinced that common interest must prevail over the obstacles to dialogue and solidarity.45.	Rich countries and poor  wealthy peoples and those stricken with the despair and pessimism which result from the world crisis  are we not all assailed by the same anxieties and obliged  if we are not to be destroyed  to stand shoulder to shoulder in the face of the many dangers threatening man and his environment?46.	It was in the spirit of the need for such reflection by the international community that the head of State of Senegal  President Abdou Diouf  called on me to come here to address the Assembly.47.	I shall begin by referring to the political problems with which the United Nations is once again confronted  together with the economic issues with which the third world in general and Africa in particular are constantly concerned  in the ever-diminishing hope that peoples and individuals will Unite to prevent an apocalypse which  if it were to occur  would certainly spare no people and no country 48.	Given that risk  are we capable of taking the leap forward which the nations of the world expect of us and which we must take if we are to put to good use the immense potential of the human mind and the wealth of imagination granted to us by nature?49.	For nearly 40 years  a modus vivendi seems to have been established among the industrial nations  in particular those of the northern hemisphere. Those nations have thus achieved technological progress and economic stability  guaranteed and protected by a system of relations which safeguard the essential element: the continuance of that technological progress and the maintenance of the economic stability which  despite the ups and downs of our times  we see today.50.	At the same time  we note in various parts of Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Middle East numerous hotbeds of tension and conflict which rend the peoples asunder and set against each other neighbour countries which reason dictates should cooperate in trust and friendship. Sometimes  even within a single population  civil war breaks out  costing the lives of children  the elderly and people in the prime of life  sowing death and destruction in the name of opposing ideologies  and heightened and exacerbated by a conflict of interests often alien to that country.51.	In this tense situation  is it not time for the nations of the world  both rich and poor  industrialized and developing  to agree to overcome their rivalries and tensions  through joint efforts and constructive dialogue  in order to guarantee to all the free command of their common destiny?52.	Today  South Africa continues to occupy Namibia illegally  despite the relevant United Nations resolutions designed to enable the brother people of Namibia to recover  without any hindrance  its full right to freedom  independence and dignity. In this regard  my country  Senegal  solemnly reaffirms its complete solidarity with SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the glorious people of Namibia  and we support Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Namibian question is a decolonization problem  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which recognizes that those countries and peoples have the inalienable right to self-determination and national sovereignty.53.	The countries members of the contact group should  to that end  bring direct pressure to bear on the Pretoria Government  in pursuance of the efforts that they are now undertaking and that  in all honesty and objectivity  we must emphasize. Since contact has been established  we feel it is appropriate to continue and even increase it so that South Africa will be brought to accept the United Nations settlement plan.54.	I cannot conclude this section of my address without welcoming  on behalf of my Government  the praiseworthy initiatives repeatedly undertaken by the Secretary-General. Thanks to him  the technical aspects of this matter  involving the composition  status and deployment of the military element of UNTAG and the choice of the electoral system provided for in the settlement plan  have already wen agreed upon.55.	Notwithstanding the slow pace of the talks and the acknowledged limits of the progress recently made at Lusaka  Zambia  and Sal  Cape Verde  on the way towards negotiations between the parties involved  Senegal encourages those efforts and advocates a cease-fire conducive to the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) as a whole.56.	South Africa  because of the abhorrent practice of apartheid  which the Pretoria regime persists in further refining by successive reforms  such as the recent bogus constitutional reform  deserves to be once again unreservedly condemned by the international community. My country  Senegal  denounces this inhuman policy of racial segregation and expresses again its solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa and its legitimate representatives  the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. We also energetically repudiate the infringements repeatedly committed against the territorial integrity  sovereignty and security of the front-line countries  and particularly the constant threats made by South Africa against Angola and Mozambique  whose Governments and brother peoples aspire only to peace and development.57.	In west Africa  the question of Western Sahara continues to be the subject of the international community's attention. My country  Senegal  wishes to see a peaceful settlement of that dispute  in accordance with resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX)  adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 38/40.58.	With regard to the question of Chad  we can only hope that the recent developments emanating from the Franco-Libyan disengagement agreement of September 1984 may lead to national reconciliation in Chad and to scrupulous respect for the integrity and sovereignty of that country  under the leadership of its legitimate Governmentânow recognized by the OAU and by the international communityâ without any outside interference. It is truly high time for that martyred country  rent by internal conflicts and assorted kinds of intervention for the past 20 years  to be able finally to enjoy the peace  national unity and stability so essential to the flourishing of its people and the development of its economy.59.	Just as in Africa  the racist Pretoria Government continues to trample the Charter of the United Nations under foot by oppressing peoples aspiring to peace  so in the Middle East  Israel has been maintaining an atmosphere of tension through its aggressive and annexationist policy against the Arab peoples of the area in general  and the Palestinian people in particular. Israel's systematic recourse to force has inevitably blocked all the peace initiatives undertaken in recent years. The long list of resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly is  in this regard  highly indicative of the indifference and cavalier disregard shown by the Tel Aviv Government for the international community's decisions.60.	Now  more than ever before  we must reaffirm the inalienable right of the brother people of Palestine  regrouped within the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  its sole and legitimate representative  to dignity  self-determination and independence  and to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State on the land of Palestine  in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions. We must  by all legal means  induce the international community to compel Israel to put an end to the settlements. We must actively support the Lebanese people  which is now gravely divided  to achieve its unity and territorial integrity and regain its stability  free from the acts of aggression perpetrated daily against its sovereignty. We must spare no effort to obtain total withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied by Israel by force since 1967. We must  finally  foster the conditions for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  with due respect for the right of all the peoples of the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries.61.	My country  Senegal  had the great honour  thanks to the confidence placed in it by the international community  to preside over the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. We know that since then the Secretary-General  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  as well as the Al- Quds Committee  presided over by King Hassan II  of Morocco  have made repeated efforts to ensure progress on this question. Those efforts should be encouraged and continued  because my country  which presides over the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  believes that an International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the full participation of the PLO  should be able to bring about a definitive solution to the Middle East question.62.	As is well known  for four years now there has been a fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq that has taken the lives of thousands of innocent persons; huge material losses have occurred and vast resources have been wrested from the development of the two countries in a deadlocked conflict  and all this has been to no avail. Given this sorry state of affairs  all the initiatives that have been undertaken have proved fruitless. Senegal  which is a member of the Islamic Peace Committee seeking peace between those two countries  takes this opportunity to repeat to the Security Council  the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference that it has always supported and will continue to support them in actions designed to obtain a rapid and definitive cease-fire between Teheran and Baghdad and peace negotiations on the basis of the fundamental principles of international law and the stability of the countries of the region.63.	On the Asian continent  Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue  as is known  to be subjected to the laws and domination of foreign Powers. It is therefore only proper to hold that the people of Afghanistan and the people of Kampuchea are entitled to just recognition of their legitimate aspiration to the free choice of their political system and their leaders. In this connection  Senegal will continue to press actively for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those two countries and for just respect for the Charter of the United Nations with regard to them  through the peaceful application of the good offices machinery of the Secretary-General and the quest for a negotiated solution between the parties concerned. So far as Senegal is concerned  in both cases the main objective is to enable the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples to exercise their right to decide  in all sovereignty  their own destiny.64.	In Kampuchea  more particularly  after three years of praiseworthy and sustained diplomatic efforts  the implementation of the relevant resolutions on this question is still encountering certain obstacles  but they should not deter us from our goal  which is the restoration of peace to Kampuchea and the region. To that end  it should be emphasized that the work of the United Nations  through the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea  presided over by Senegal  far from being directed against this or that State is  rather  designed to secure conditions necessary for a constructive dialogue between all the parties concerned. In this connection  certain States should reconsider their attitude and join the international consensus on the question of Kampuchea  particularly as that consensus takes into account the concerns of all the interested parties. Experience has shown that the use of force is not the way to solve this dispute. It is through constructive and responsible dialogue that all the parties concerned can put an end to this conflict  which has lasted far too long. In the Korean peninsula  we keep coming back to the idea of the peaceful reunification of the two sides within the framework of a sincere and fraternal quest for common ground. Our country will therefore continue to support any idea designed to secure this objective and based on the free will of the entire Korean people.66.	Finally  in Central America  if the principle of respect for the right of peoples to self-determination is observed by all  in the sub-continent and elsewhere  there is some hope of seeing the peoples of the region co-operate effectively in easing the many tensions and eliminating the hotbeds of conflict that prevail there. It is in this spirit  and this spirit only  that Senegal intends to continue to give active support to the efforts of the Contadora Group.67.	The picture of the world situation is certainly not an encouraging one. However  like the weather  international political developments are always characterized by a predictable alternation of overcast periods and periods when the elements of nature come together to produce fine weather. Thus  there is no room for despair; rather  we should be optimistic and organize our efforts. Today more than ever those efforts must be applied to the constant search for the most appropriate solutions to the varied economic and financial problems affecting the world and  more particularly  the developing countries.68.	The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis  which must not be viewed as a short-term phenomenon  much less as a cyclical occurrence  because it is deeply rooted in the superimposed imbalances and accumulated inequalities which have dominated the international economic system during the 1980s.69.	I shall not refer here to the elements of that crisis nor to its many manifestations  because other speakers have already done this and the United Nations itself  at various levels  has considered all the aspects of this crisis with admirable conviction and determination.70.	In May 1974  at the urging of the countries of the third world  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  then in December that same year the Assembly adopted the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States . This new international economic order was and is still supposed to correct  inequalities  remedy injustices and close the immense gap that exists at all levels between the rich and the poor countries. It is in the light of these objectives that I wish  on behalf of. Senegal  to emphasize  in this last half of my statement  two fundamental subjects of particular interest for almost all African countries: the indebtedness of the third world and the phenomenon of drought and desertification.71.	Our countries in particular have felt the full force of the world crisis. To varying degrees in recent years  they have recorded large balance-of-payments deficits  aggravated by a sharp decline in their industrial and agricultural production  thus bringing about a steady fall in their per capita income. On top of this  the phenomenon of decreased rainfall has caused a marked foodstuffs deficit  Moreover  the prices of their raw materials and commodities nave consistently dropped while the costs of importing capital goods  manufactured articles and finished products have experienced an unprecedented exponential increase. This has led to a considerable fall in the export earnings of our countries.72.	The well-known inadequacy of financial re-source flows and the structural difficulties we have experienced have forced us  in order to ensure a minimum of development  to contract major debts for the purpose of breaking the deadlock. Thus  the foreign debt of the developing countries increased from $244 billion in 1977 to $625 billion in 1982 and at the end of 1983 stood at $785 billion.73.	The result of such a situation could not fail to be a serious reduction in the gross national product of our countries and a drastic restriction of their capacity to absorb the effects of the world crisis.74.	At the same time  and on the international level  we have the effects of the following factors: persistent monetary instability; fluctuations in ex-change rates  over which we have no control; the particularly high level of interest rates; new protectionist barriers imposed by the industrialized countries; the increase in shipping rates; interest payments on commercial credits: and the constant rise in energy prices and in the cost of oil products and derivatives.75.	As the final blow to our development efforts  we then have  on the monetary side  the inadequacy of financial resources  particularly on concessional terms  the stagnation or even decline of the real value of official development assistance when considered in the light of the cumulative effects of inflation and the drop in the prices of raw materials and  to crown it all  the conditions imposed under the lending policies of official and private financial institutions.76.	The developing countries are certainly not prey to despair  but how can they hope to see any light at the end of the tunnel tomorrow unless specific measures are taken today gradually to end a critical situation whose consequences could  like a shock wave  reach those tomorrow that believe today they are well out of its reach?77.	A few months ago  the Secretary-General undertook the praiseworthy initiative or visiting several countries in the black continent with a view' to mobilizing additional resources to support the already fragile economies of the African countries. While we congratulate him on this move  we at the same time renew our appeal to the international community and the specialized financial institutions to organize a world conference on indebtedness to seek the best ways to study this contemporary phenomenon  analyse its evolution and define the most appropriate remedies  in order to give a new impetus to our countries' economies and free them of the bottle-necks and other obstacles trapping them in the maze of mechanisms which are now in place and which have led to the present state of affairs.78.	Throughout this period  drought and desertification have inexorably dominated and invaded our continent. In 1983 no fewer than 35 African countries were afflicted by the phenomenon of drought  which is no longer limited to certain areas of west Africa but has spread to east Africa  central Africa and even southern Africa  where on both sides of the equator the existence of vast forest areas with dense vegetation stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans should guarantee regular rainfall; this  however  is now threatened.79.	Some countries of Asia and the Americas are seriously worried by the prospect of the same calamity as is threatening the African countries.80.	Drought is a phenomenon characterized each year by the virtually complete absence of precipitation in areas where irrigation is little known or unknown  thus ruling out any chance of normal agriculture and therefore of a harvest. Desertification occurs like a disease that wherever it goes destroys vegetation and watercourses  dries up rivers  streams  lakes and ponds and wipes out the food plants and aquatic and land animals on which man usually feeds.81.	Every year the Sahara desert in the north of Africa  from Mauritania to the Sudan  from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea  moves tens of kilometres southwards  making hundreds of thou-sands of hectares unfit for agriculture and causing the movement of thousands of people and their livestock  separating them from their traditions and way of life and causing problems for the people in their new grazing areas.82.	The African countries concerned  thanks to the support and understanding of the international community  have organized themselves into sub regional and regional zones to tackle the problem of this dual phenomenon of drought and desertification. As has been indicated by the United Nations Sudano-Saheli- an Office [UNSO]:""The purpose of the fight against the effects of drought and desertification is essentially to rehabilitate and protect the productive potential of the land  water and other natural resources and  at the same time  to develop and strengthen man's ability to exploit these resources ..."" It was in this spirit that the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  composed of eight West African countries  was set up.83.	In 1973 the Secretary-General created UNSO  which between 1973 and 1978 developed into the leading organ of the United Nations system directly mandated by the General Assembly to co-ordinate the activities of United Nations agencies designed to help the countries of the Sudano-Sahelian region in their struggle against the effects of drought. UNSO's mission has since developed to cover  in particular  in addition to the Sudano-Sahelian zone  that situated north of the Equator  and to deal with the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification  adopted by the United Nations Conference on Desertification  held at Nairobi in 1977.84.	Just a few weeks ago  in July  on the initiative of President Abdou Diouf  a ministerial conference on the two phenomenaâdrought and desertificationâ was held at Dakar  with the participation of the European Economic Community  the United Nations  FAO  UNDP and UNEP  as well as UNSO  which played a particularly active role in the preparation and conduct of the conference and in the achievement of results.85.	Among the conclusions of that conference  which we have communicated to the competent organs of the agencies I have mentioned  the concept of countries stricken by desertification has been accepted  with all the practical consequences that logically follow the adoption of such a concept by the United Nations. My Government hopes that at this session the General Assembly will draw up and adopt a resolution defining precise measures and appealing to the international community to make available increased resources to give effect to the conclusions of the Dakar conference. We are glad that the question of countries stricken by desertification and drought has been included in the agenda of this session.86.	The three fundamental ideas of UNSOâand here let me pay tribute to the officials of that agency for their hard work in seeking solutions to the thorny problem of countries stricken by desertificationâare the following: first  aid to the various countries and their regional institutions in the field of planning and formulating projects and programmes designed to fight the effects of drought and desertification; secondly  aid in the mobilization of the necessary resources for the implementation of the various projects and programmes  either on a bilateral or a multilateral basis or through the United Nations Trust Fund for Sudano-Sahelian Activities  with a considerable increase in the resources made available to UNSO  which at present are insignificant compared with the magnitude of the problems; and  thirdly  the management of the Trust Fund and the implementation  through the resources of that Fund  of the projects and programmes to which UNSO contributes.87.	It is obvious that the work of UNSO cannot exclude a range of decisive actions jointly conducted by the countries concerned to help them work out and implement a coherent policy for combating this phenomenon.88.	In conclusion  let me say that our world is today burdened with difficulties of all sorts. Besides our political problems  we now have many questions to ask about the economic future of the peoples whom we represent. Should we not at last be emphasizing what unites us and casting a veil of reason over what divides us  in order to concentrate on what is essential: fostering our solidarity and giving each other reciprocal support. This means that we must act together to eradicate focal points of war  reduce tensions between peoples and turn a deaf ear to the appeals of the sirens of discord and over-armament. To support each other reciprocally means that we must pool the immense technological progress achieved by mankind for the service of mankind and against the policies of the mass destruction of the resources of our planet. To support each other reciprocally means to be responsible and show solidarity with the poor peoples  impoverished by nature or threatened by calamities  those living in the more arid areas of our world or in islands surrounded by the oceans but without rainfall. We must help them to confront this real everyday hardship.89.	Only then need we not despair of ourselves  for we shall be menâmen of peace  men of dialogue  men of generosity; men of a generation which will not have lived for nothing and which  having explored the moon  skirted the planets Mars and Saturn  circled Venus and admired Orion  will come back to Earth to control  with head held high  its own destiny  the destiny of mankind."
"122",6169,"SGP",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me to congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His abilities and reputation for integrity and goodwill are widely known  as are also his wide experience of the United Nations and his tireless commitment to the Organization. We shall all be well served by his presidency. I am confident that under his leadership the ability of the Assembly to further the objectives of the United Nations will be enhanced.232.	As we approach the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  the imperative need to strengthen the effectiveness of the Organization and enhance international peace and stability has been underscored by the continuing turbulence in international relations. New conflicts have arisen  while old problems are still unresolved. My delegation finds it difficult to identify any political problems or situations where there are prospects for an early settlement  or even a glimmer of hope that there will be early willingness to enter into negotiations.233.	In the Middle East  the situation remains serious. A resolution of the Palestinian issue is still far off  and the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of a homeland of their own. Lebanon continues to be occupied by foreign forces  and all diplomatic efforts to persuade them to withdraw have proved unsuccessful. The war between Iran and Iraq continues to fester  with no end in sight.234.	The armed forces of the Soviet Union and Viet Nam are still in illegal occupation of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. The nationalist resistance forces  however  have taken a heavy toll of the invaders and  by their vigorous and determined opposition  are ensuring that the occupation forces continue to suffer heavy casualties. We urge the Soviet Union and Viet Nam to heed the calls of the international community to withdraw their occupation forces.235.	The Namibian question is stalemated  owing to the intransigence of South Africa  which continues its illegal occupation of Namibia  in defiance of numerous United Nations resolutions. My Government believes that the Namibian question should be solved within the framework of United Nations resolutionsâin particular  Security Council resolution 435 (1978).236.	In South Africa  the recent elections to fill the mixed race and Indian chambers of the three-chamber Parliament have  as predicted  attracted little support. Only 20 per cent of those eligible to vote for both groups cast their ballots. This attempt by South Africa to dress up a token political voice in the Parliament as progress towards equality has been a resounding failure. South Africa's 20 million black majority are continuing to be deprived of their legitimate rights to be included in the political process and to determine their own future.237.	In addition to these political problems  the African continent is experiencing a serious economic and social crisis. As a result of widespread and prolonged drought  accelerated desertification and the effects of the world recession of the past three years  these problems have threatened the very survival of millions of Africans. The situation re-quires a concerted effort by the entire international community  working with relevant international organizations  to reverse a potentially catastrophic situation. The Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis '"" adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa  meeting at Addis Ababa in May of this year  clearly sets out the views and recommendations of the ministers responsible for economic development and planning. These views should be given due attention and proper support in working out programmes and prospects to alleviate the plight of those millions of Africans.238.	This year we welcome Brunei Darussalam into the United Nations. Brunei is the seventh new Member to be admitted in this decade. In the 1970s there were 26 new Members; in the 1960s  there were 43. As more and more States have become independent  the pace of admissions has clearly slowed. Independence for nations is almost universal. To be sure  there are anomalies. The peoples of Palestine and Namibia are still struggling for independence. Cambodia and Afghanistan have become new victims of imperialism. But independence for the majority is part of the new international reality.239.	The experience since independence of most of this majority has not been bright. The future looks no better. The gap between the rich and the poor nations has grown. To the traditional burdens of low technology  weak institutions  disunited peoples and huge populations have been added crippling levels of international debt. They have learned the harsh lesson that freedom from alien domination does not necessarily secure a better life. ""Independence"" is a misnomer in nations where ordinary people are forced to live on the precarious margin of subsistence  where fratricidal disputes have killed millions and where flood  famine and drought still take thousands of lives.240.	If we want to be honest  we must admit that man-made disasters have taken a greater toll than natural calamities. The withdrawal of colonial authority has opened a Pandora's box of ill-defined boundaries  floating populations  ideological differences  ancient rivalries and vaulting ambitions that have caused a welter of disputes and conflicts among the newly independent.241.	Since the end of the Second World War  there have been more than 100  armed conflicts  including about 40 major wars  which have killed more than 26 million people. Most of these conflicts have been in third-world countries. Such conflicts have been fuelled and complicated by the global contests of the great Powers as well as by the pretensions of smaller Powers.242.	Poverty has made independence a Pyrrhic victory. Without economic development  freedom for many has come to mean no more than having nothing left to lose  political independence reduced to the yearly exercise of the United Nations vote.243.	We are not foredoomed to poverty and conflicts. But the situation will not rectify itself. However justifiable the moral outrage over past wrongs  it is not a sufficient basis for us to build a better life for our peoples. The rich countries  the ex-colonial Powers  are no longer easily moved by our cries. Even the goodwill or guilt that led them to give assistance to the third world has diminished in the light of the recipient countries' failure to help themselves. With the rich countries facing their own economic problems  strong protectionist currents have been generated in those countries  threatening to stifle development in the third-world countries that have achieved some initial success in industrialization.244.	The adoption of thinly disguised protectionist measures  often to protect industries that are inefficient and unproductive by comparison with those in the third world  has exposed the hypocrisy of the rich. The rich seek to assuage their conscience by assurances of concern  but they are obviously not prepared to make any sacrifice in order to enable the third world to succeed. The third world can generate economic growth and development only by production and exports. But the rich are not prepared to trade with the third world on the basis of equity and fair play. They insist on consuming a disproportion-ate amount of the world's resources by keeping the terms of trade to the disadvantage of the poor.245.	Short-term economic and domestic political interests in the developed countries inevitably take precedence over the long-term interests of all who live in one interdependent world. A classic illustration is the unwillingness of rich countries to adopt policies to reduce rapidly their huge budget deficits which distort international capital flows. At the same time  the poor countries are urged to adopt policies that are tantamount to being asked to commit suicide in order to escape starvation.246.	We have also learned that even appeals to the self-interest of the rich countries is not a successful strategy. That we cannot be consumers of their products unless our production is purchased by them is self-evident. Unless we earn  we cannot buy. The prosperity of the North depends on the viability of the South. But while the poor are sometimes recognized as important consumers  the economic nexus between production and consumption is in itself not enough to ensure a flow of capital and technology from the rich countries.247.	Technological developments have also whittled down the importance of cheap and abundant labour in the competitiveness of production. Production know-how is poised on the brink of new breakthroughs in areas such as robotics and biotechnology of which only the more mature economies of the North can take full advantage. Products of the new technology also threaten to displace the primary products of third-world countries. The flow of investment from rich to poor is  for these reasons  now less attractive than it used to be. Changing patterns of trade and comparative advantage between the developed countries themselves have made it more expedient for the rich to invest in each other's markets in order to secure access. All these factors mean that the gap between the rich and the poor nations will widen rather than narrow.248.	In order  to do anything about this trend  we must face certain realities. The great economic Powers will continue to determine the direction of the international economy. Political independence has not changed the power relationship between big and small  rich and poor. This reality has to be accepted as the starting-point for any action. The world will not change simply because it is unfair. The dilemma which all of us face is how the weak and poor can muster the means of reshaping this international order.249.	There have been  in my opinion  two general approaches by the poorer countries for breaking out of this cycle of weakness and poverty. The first has been reliance on expanding the network of international organizations  a notion inspired by the big Powers themselves when they created the United Nations system after the Second World War. Since the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Geneva in 1964  we have had five sessions of the Conference  the most recent at Belgrade last year. Over the same period  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries also held their own meetings on economic issues at Dakar  Lima  New Delhi and elsewhere. We have made attempts at United Nations-sponsored global negotiations between North and South on a new international economic order. This year the General Assembly will again adopt resolutions on economic issues. The record of such attempts  with few exceptions  is a failure.250.	A second approach is ideological. There are those who contend that the root cause of the impoverished state of the majority is not merely the structure of the international system  but rather the fact that it is a neo-colonialist and capitalist international system with an exploitative centre sucking wealth from an exploited periphery. Revolution  according to this viewpoint  will set us free. This is a fallacy. The belief that the common interests of the working class would transcend national boundaries and that class struggle could replace the struggle between States and consequently lead to an era of harmony and co-operation has proved to be obviously false.251.	As the peoples of Cambodia and so many other countries have found to their cost  there is no superior virtue in one kind of ideological system or another. Starvation  misery and poverty do not discriminate on the basis of ideology or recognize the class principle. Socialists exploit each other too. The socialist international system is also divided into an exploited periphery and an exploitative centre. All third-world countries  regardless of social system or political belief  must recognize this fact. Not to do so is to invite exploitation by what is just another kind of imperialism. Ideology  no more than moral outrage or wishful thinking  cannot alter the political structure or exorcise economic realities.252.	This is not a philosophy of despair. Realism for the small and the weak does not only consist of accepting constraints but also of recognizing opportunities. We have to accept the existing structure of the international economic and political system. But that structure is a dynamic one in a state of constant evolution. Looking back  it is evident to me that the small and the weak have succeeded when they have had the will  ability and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities thrown up by the changing pattern of relations between the strong. We have to learn to use the existing structure of the international economic system and to change it in order to break the vicious cycle of poverty and to secure a better life for our peoples.253.	How can this be done? Large international organizations that mobilize third-world countries  such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77  can provide the political strength to achieve tangible results if skilfully guided. Together the third world can do what none of its members has the strength to do individually. But  for the most part  both the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77 encompass too many diverse and conflicting interests and irrelevant objectives to act decisively or be constructive. To overcome the weaknesses of such large groupings  we should first organize ourselves into smaller regional groups which share more similar characteristics and common interests. We must create many smaller areas of security and common action on the larger international scene. Such regional groupings can serve as building blocks that would provide a firm foundation for larger international organizations and thus enable those organizations to play a more effective role in furthering the interests of the third world.254.	Secondly  we should not allow the progress of our peoples to be hostage to the vanities of national-ism  the blindness of xenophobia or the seductions of ideology. We have to dare to plug into the international economic system  because that system is the only source of the capital  technology and management skills that we need to pull ourselves out of poverty. We must admit what we do not know  not in a spirit of submission or dependence  but in order to become independent and meet the challenges of a competitive and evolving international economic system. We must participate in that system  learn its rules and use its rules to our best advantage. We can do this without undue risk only if we are first united.255.	The approach I have described is not an academic one. I know this approach can work because it has already worked. The organization to which my country belongs  ASEAN  is in many ways a microcosm of the diversity of the third world. It would be difficult to find a more disparate group than Brunei Darussalam  Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailand. We are divided by religion  by system of government  by history  by culture  by ethnicity and by language. In the post-war period  all the present members of ASEAN have  at one time or another  been engaged in conflicts and disputes with each other. But we have been able to put the past behind us. Historical rivalries have been set aside. Instead  we have emphasized a positive vision of our common future. We have learned to accept each other as equals on the basis of our real differences as well as our common interests. We do not live in fear of one another. 256.	The largest member of ASEAN  Indonesia  has played a special role in this respect. Indonesia has not tried to impose its views on the organization  but has worked with all members on the basis of equality and mutual consultation. We have all adopted export- oriented economic policies essentially based on market forces. We have not been too proud to learn from others and to allow a relatively free inflow of private capital  know-how and personnel. We have not allowed destructive ambitions or sterile ideology to divert us from what we regard to be our common interests.257.	Perhaps most important of all  we have not allowed ASEAN to become a crutch for any of us. Ultimately we all recognize that it is national action that determines national well-being. The basis of collective resilience is national resilience. We do not look to ASEAN as the panacea for our individual problems. The unity and collective action of ASEAN provide a framework within which each member can determine its own future. The stability of relations among member countries of ASEAN provides an environment of confidence that is conducive to development.258.	The hard economic reality is that the way to get ahead is to be more efficient  more competitive and more productive  and thus to enhance the competitiveness of our products on the world market.259.	By combining and directing efforts towards trying to shape as open and as liberal an international economic order as possible  ASEAN's collective economic diplomacy has influenced the political and economic policy decisions in the industrial centres of the North which affect our interests. We would not have been able to do this if we had acted alone.260.	The self-confidence that we have created through collective and pragmatic action has enabled us to resist external pressures  to take our future into our own hands and actively try to influence the environment around us. We have changed the structure of international politics in South-East Asia. We have gained a measure of control over forces that will influence our future. This is the broader significance of the actions we have taken on the Cambodian issue  in our economic relations with the developed countries and the major Powers and on a host of other issues.261.	I have dwelt at some length on the experience of my country and our partners in ASEAN not in a spirit of arrogance or because I believe that our experience is unique. Indeed  I have used ASEAN as an example of what the third world could do  precisely because I do not believe our experience is unique. We have done what some have done and what the majority of the international community can also do  if only they can summon up the will to do it"
"123",6202,"SLB",39,1984,"ï»¿May I first of all congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. With your vast experience as a diplomat and as an outstanding representative of your good country  Zambia  I am sure you will guide the deliberations of the Assembly with success and distinction.2.	Also  I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge E. Illueca  of Panama  for his skilful leadership of the thirty-eighth session.3.	I join previous speakers in extending a warm welcome to the friendly country of Brunei Darussalam as it joins our family of nations. I congratulate the Government and people of Brunei Darussalam on the achievement of independence and offer them my Government's and my people's best wishes for the future. We look forward with pleasure to working closely with the delegation of Brunei Darussalam in the Organization  its related agencies and the Commonwealth.4.	Last year  my Prime Minister  in addressing this great assembly of nations  voiced the concerns of the Government of the Solomon Islands about certain international issues. Today  I shall make no apology if I again touch on some or all of those same issues. In my humble opinion  it is our duty not to lose sight of the major issues that come within the sphere of responsibility of the Organization: disarmament for peace and security; social and economic development for human betterment  including human rights; the eradication of the traces and remnants of colonialism; and the development of international law and justice.5.	Those are the noble aims and ideals for which this great Organization was founded; those are the issues that we must continue to address in our efforts to achieve those objectives  even if it takes us an eternity to achieve them hoping that meanwhile the world is not blown up by the pressing of a button.6.	It is timely  I believe  to remind ourselves that four decades ago a single nuclear bomb brought peace to the world and today only man can keep that peace. This is the crucial question that should be answered honestly by those concerned. For us  small peace-loving nations  the threat of imminent bombing brings the nightmarish realization that our planet will no longer be safe unless a genuine effort is made to bring about peace in all the corners of the world. Thus  my Government earnestly urges the superpowers to resume disarmament negotiations at the earliest possible opportunityânot for the attainment of superiority  but for the definition of civilized behaviour in arms control.7.	Twelve months ago  we were concerned about global peace and security  threatened as it was by the instability in certain regions. That same threat is still with us today  in spite of the noble resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the courageous and diplomatic efforts of the Secretary-General. My Government's position remains unchanged  in that the unstable situations in southern Africa  the Middle East  Asia  the Korean peninsula and Central America are still threats to global peace and security.8.	In southern Africa  the question of delaying Namibia independence is a cause for concern and my Government would like to see the early settlement of this question  in conformity with the principles of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Related to the question of Namibia is the evil system of apartheid. Solomon Islands has consistently condemned that system and will maintain and uphold its condemnation until that inhuman and uncivilized practice is totally eradicated.9.	The situation in the Middle East is also of concern to all of us. Peace in that region is an important objective of the United Nations. The principles of secure territorial integrity and sovereignty are involved here. The position of the Solomon Islands has always been that Israel's right to exist must be recognized and that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination. But the attainment of this depends on the search for peace by all the parties involved.10.	In the Asian region  the occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet forces and of Cambodia by Vietnamese forces perpetuates the threat to peace in the whole region and m the adjacent region of the South Pacific. Therefore  we call again for the withdrawal of those forces from those respective countries.11.	With regard to the Korean peninsula  Solomon Islands will support a negotiated reunification process  which should be pursued without outside interference. In the meantime  we would see merit in the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations as a necessary step towards the process of reunification.12.	I now turn to the danger we face in the South Pacific region  that is  the danger of nuclear pollution. We are convinced that our reefs and seas are endangered by the nuclear-testing activities that have been carried out in our region. Hence we have condemned and will continue to condemn the nuclear testing by France in Mururoa atoll. We are totally opposed to that and to the proposal by Japan to dump nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean. Japan has heeded our objections thus far and we are grateful.13.	France  on the other hand  has shown no sign of willingness even to listen to our protests. Instead  it has had the arrogance to invite a team of scientists and to show them what they should be shown by the authorities in Mururoa. To this sort of unfriendly gesture  all I can say is that we are not developed industrially but we are humanly mature enough to tell truths from lies and rights from wrongs. It is morally wrong to lay the foundations for killing the source of our livelihood  that is  the resources of our seas and reefs  and for endangering our lives. The team of scientists made it abundantly clear that they were not allowed the freedom to observe certain crucial aspects of the nuclear-testing activities on Mururoa atoll and their conclusion is equally clear that there is no guarantee that  either in the short term or in the long term  there will be no adverse effects on our region and on future generations.14.	In this connection  I should like to endorse the statements by my colleagues from the South Pacific who have already addressed this session with regard to our collective decision to work towards a nuclear- free zone in our region. We regard this as fundamental and important because that island States in this region depend very heavily on the resources of our seas. In fact  many of our people depend almost exclusively on marine resources.15.	This is why we attach such importance to keeping our seas free from nuclear pollutants; this is why we subscribe so strongly to the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which stipulates the 200-mile exclusive economic zone and the 200-mile fisheries zone; this is why we are concerned about the spirit of international cooperation and about the fact that certain countries are still creating a serious obstacle by their refusal to recognize this Convention in its entirety.16.	I have dealt with the issues that are a precondition of successful economic and social development. What will be the good of the development of our islandsâ economic and social infrastructures if they are to be destroyed by nuclear pollutants and bombs? Of course  with modem technology these can be repaired in a matter of days  but for whose benefit? For the benefit of those who destroy  certainly  for they will manufacture equipment and machinery for repairs and reconstruction.17.	Thus  in order to come to grips with the problems of economic and social development in small island nations such as mine  we have to appreciate and understand the fundamental and practical obstacles to development.18.	Today's global economic situation must surely be the reflection of our unstable world. While economic recovery seems to have taken place in some industrial countries  the developing countries are still struggling and in the process are becoming worse off.19.	There can be no universal economic recovery  in my view  unless there is a new international economic order which aims to bridge the development gap between industrial countries and the heavily populated developing countries; a new international economic order which allows for a fair and free flow of trade between countries and relaxed and investment-generating regulations for international and multilateral financial institutions. Unfortunately  the global negotiations on a new international economic order are still in limbo.20.	Herein lies the interdependence of peace and security on the one hand and social and economic development on the other. The stalling of the global negotiations on a new international economic order is a direct result of the breakdown in genuine disarmament negotiations. The arms build-up  which has given rise to economic recovery in certain quarters  is a drain on scarce resources that are needed for development in the developing third world countries  which are the hardest hit by the recession.21.	As I mentioned human rights in relation to social and economic development  I would like to assure the Assembly of the high regard for this principle in my country. All the fundamental human rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are provided for and safeguarded in our national Constitution. There are also various legislative frameworks within which are spelt out detailed provisions concerning certain constitutional obligations  such as our leadership code to govern the conduct of our leaders in the exercise of their powers and the fulfilment of their responsibilities when in public office  and the Ombudsman Act to protect and safeguard the rights of individuals in their dealings with Government and statutory institutions.22.	In this context and in line with our policies and laws to safeguard human rights  I am pleased to see continuing efforts to work towards some regional and sub-regional institutional arrangements for the protection and promotion of human rights in the region of Asia and the Pacific. The proposal that resulted from the Seminar on National  Local and Regional Arrangements for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Asian Regions  held at Colombo from 21 June to 2 July 1982  can be commended for further consideration. We welcome the objective of establishing an open-ended working group to continue the overall analysis with a view to further promotion and encouragement of human rights and fundamental freedoms  including questions relevant to the work of the Commission on Human Rights within the United Nations system.23.	These are noble goals  but here I sound a note of caution regarding regional institutional arrangements. Every care should be taken to avoid overlap and duplication  and  whatever we do  we should be mindful of the danger that such institutions  conceived in good faith  sometimes tend to lose sight of the purposes for which they were established and concentrate their efforts on self-promotion and self- perpetuation.24.	Turning now to decolonization  I remind the Assembly of the communique of the South Pacific Forum relating to the question of New Caledonia  issued after its fifteenth meeting  held in Tuvalu on 27 and 28 August 1984. The relevant parts for our purposes are as follows:""The Forum reaffirmed its support for the transition of New Caledonia to independence in accordance with the wishes of its people and in a manner which guarantees the innate and active rights of the Kanaka people and the rights  interests and aspirations of all its inhabitants. It urged the French Government and all political and community groups  including the IndependenceFront  to keep talking to ensure that this transition to an independent  multiracial New Caledonia is achieved speedily and peacefully within a shorter time scale than presently envisaged.""It was the Forum's view that the process of decolonization would he advanced by a public statement by the French Government that independence was the desirable  logical and acknowledged outcome of the Act of self-determination currently planned for 1989  and that this referendum should be brought forward by agreement between all parties involved.""The Forum believed that France should transfer additional political and administrative powers to the Territory to ensure that it is adequately prepared for independence and take the practical steps necessary to guarantee the full and active participation of the Melanesian community in the Territory's educational  vocational and administrative institutions.""25.	The persistent refusal by France to re-inscribe New Caledonia on the list of Territories to be decolonized reflects a fundamental breach of the principle of self-determination and independence. My Government condemns this.26.	The underlying fact is simply that the people who were actually colonizedâthe Melanesians  and not the settlers- -are the very people who are asking for self-determination and independence. It is these people who are asking for their disengagement from being a Department of the French Republic. There is a very genuine request and appeal to the United Nations  and we  their Melanesian brothers  very much appreciate their desire for independence. It is therefore my Government's obligation to put to the Organization the urgent proposal that New Caledonia be re-inscribed on the agenda for decolonization during this session.27.	The Melanesian people of New Caledonia are being indoctrinated with two basic negative considerations: first that they are not ready for independence and  secondly  that if France left their Territory  their peace and security and that of the South Pacific region would be endangered.28.	With regard to the first point  New Caledonia is the most developed Territory in the South Pacific. The city of Noumea is far more developed than the capitals of ail the independent island States in the region. What  then  is the basis for readiness? Is it political  social or economic development? If it is all of these  then  as the Melanesians themselves are saying  they are ready  and France should accept this. With regard to the second point  what threatens the peace and security of our region is the presence of colonial Powers.29.	Independence has brought about the establishment of cordial and happy relations between the countries of our region  including Australia  Fiji  New Zealand  Papua New Guinea  Western Samoa  Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. This augurs very well for the peace and security of our region. Therefore  I ask all members to think very seriously about the situation in New Caledonia  for the longer we postpone the consideration thereof  the more serious the threat to peace and security in our region will become.30.	Closely related to the question of global peace and security is the question of international cooperation. There is still much room for fairness. We have seen  and are seeing  injustice in the application of the new status of certain countries.31.	I now turn to the United Nations itself. Much has been said about its inadequacies and weaknesses. There have been comments from certain quarters that the Organization is heading in the wrong direction. While these might appear to give cause for concern  we believe that  under the able leadership of the Secretary-General  anything that needs to be improved will be attended to. Overall  however  one thing is certainly very clear: the Organization has the vital role of serving as the forum within which we can meet and try to resolve our problems through dialogue instead of confrontation. The United Nations holds humanity's last hope of maintaining peace and security. It has also done much  and is now doing more  for the development of the developing countries.32.	Solomon Islands is committed to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. That is why  in spite of our difficulties in the areas of manpower and finance  we are trying to participate as effectively as we can. Thus  I am obliged to conclude this brief statement by reaffirming our commitment to this great Organization."
"124",6249,"SLE",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of Sierra Leone  I congratulate you most warmly  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your country's philosophy of humanism and your considerable personal skills as a diplomat assure us that under your leadership the General Assembly will further the cause of peace and justice in the world.205.	Allow me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  now President of the Republic of Panama  who served as President of the thirty-eighth session with distinction and exemplary skill.206.	Let me also congratulate and welcome into our midst Brunei Darussalam  whose accession brings us closer to the ideal of universal membership.207.	Ten years ago  the General Assembly convened in a special session to examine the economic relations between developed and developing countries. After weeks of long and exhaustive debate  the Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the establishment of a new international economic order. That historic recommendation reverberated around the world and ignited the hopes of many poor  developing countries. A new optimism was born  as many countries were led to believe that the United Nations was on the march towards the indispensable goals of economic justice and fair play.208.	The flurry of activities which followed on the heels of this new optimism led many commentators to call the 1970s ""the decade of negotiations"". Although those negotiations must now seem like the beginning of a false dawn  title Assembly's sixth special session itself did provide a set of bold recommendations in its Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  which  fully implemented  might have saved the world from the present disastrous recession. To the dismay and bitter disappointment of the developing world  the Programme of Action has been rendered ineffectual by the refusal of certain Members of the Organization to allow any worthwhile action to be taken towards its implementation. The failure of the international community to rise to the challenges and the opportunities of the time seem to us to have led to the present dire economic consequences that undermine social order in rich countries and threaten the very survival of .much of the third world.209.	Today  the stark economic reality of the African condition is that millions of people are afflicted by hunger  malnutrition  illiteracy and abject poverty. Over the last few years  the economies of African countries have suffered severe declines in growth and output of goods and services. This trend  already apparent in the 1970s  has worsened over the last three years  leading to depressing growth rates or total stagnation. The result is a dangerous fall in already precarious living standards  mass starvation and widespread decay of the small  but vital  infrastructure and even the environment.210.	The reasons for this decline are many and varied. Foremost among them are the recent severe world recession  which has had such a damaging effect on the economies and productive capacity of many African countries  and the stubborn refusal of our trading partners to pay fair and remunerative prices for our commodities and raw materials.211.	Moreover  in an international trading system that requires developing countries to negotiate the prices they receive for their major raw materials and commodities  while they must pay the ever-increasing prices that are set by the manufacturers of those same raw materials and commodities  it is inevitable that the weakest members of the system should be driven into bankruptcy.212.	For Africa  these various factors have been further aggravated by the most severe drought the continent has suffered in this century  resulting in a catastrophic fall in food production and the consequent loss of human lives through famine and starvation.213.	The acute debt burden of third-world countries  particularly those in Latin America  has preoccupied the international community over the last two years. The harsh conditions attaching to those debts are today hampering economic recovery and development in many of the afflicted countries.214.	Given the magnitude and severity of the problems that I have just been describing  it is clear that the African people cannot on their own prevent the imminent economic collapse that threatens many of their impoverished nations. While we recognize that African Governments must continue to bear responsibility for the well-being of their people  we expect the international community  in a spirit of solidarity and a reaffirmation of our mutual interdependence  to help to avert the catastrophe that now threatens Africa.215.	What is required  therefore  is a bold  imaginative and generous response to this crisis so that together we can find lasting solutions to the continent's perennial problems.216.	Specifically  the international community would have to come to grips with the continuing adverse terms of trade which now plague the economies of much of the third world in general. In this connection  reform of existing financial institutions  a reduction in the present crippling rates of interest and liberalization of world trade must be considered imperative.217.	Furthermore  it is the view of the Sierra Leone delegation that  in seeking solutions to the manifold problems now facing the African continent  intensification of economic co-operation within the multilateral and specialized institutions  especially the World Bank  FAO and UNDP  cannot be overemphasized. These institutions must be given increased financial support and provided with the necessary resources to enable them to perform their tasks more effectively.218.	It was  therefore  a matter of deep regret to my Government that  giver  the gravity of the African economic situation  the Economic and Social Council was not able to take decisive action when this matter was considered at its second regular session  last July. We hope that when the General Assembly considers this matter it will see the necessity of recommending appropriate remedial measures.219.	The critical shortage of foreign exchange has halted industrial development  and existing capacity is either idle or only partially engaged. All these factors have combined to create instability in some of our countries. It is imperative  therefore  that the international community and the African Governments make joint efforts to reverse this dangerous trend.220.	While on the theme of international co-operation  I would like to make some brief remarks on two international conferences which have recently been concluded. I refer to the second International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City last August  and the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna  also in August. In doing so  may I once again express the gratitude of the Sierra Leone Government to Mexico and Austria for hosting these two important meetings.221.	Population issues are  today  assuming ever- greater importance. Almost every Government has become increasingly aware that its greatest resource is human.222.	For us in Africa  developmental problems have been identified as those of disturbingly low levels of literacy  low levels of technical skills  poor performance of middle-level manpower  little or no attention to research and development  weak infrastructure and a chronic shortage of capital.223.	It is evident  therefore  that if we are going to solve these problems urgent measures will have to be taken to improve and develop our human resources.224.	For its part  the Government of Sierra Leone continues to hold the view that the issue of population development cannot be divorced from that of general socio-economic development. My Government firmly believes that all economic activities should be geared towards the improvement of the individual so as to enable him to contribute meaningfully to national development. We therefore trust that the results of the Mexico City Conference will generate the necessary impetus and political will for accelerated and fruitful international co-operation in this all-important domain.225.	For this reason  I would like to say how highly my Government appreciates the role which UNDP and UNFPA are playing in assisting developing countries in implementing their policies and programmes. My delegation renews its appeal for greater resources to be made available to these agencies to enable them to achieve their objectives.226.	Industrialization  like population  is central to the economic and social development of every country. My delegation has taken note of the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization but regrets that the question of promoting industrialization in developing countries has continued to be clouded by political judgement on the part of the advanced countries. Thus  in spite of its modesty  the target of $50 million for the United Nations Industrial Development Fund has remained unattainable.227.	Furthermore  the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization was unable to agree on a common declaration because of resistance on the part of certain delegations. We trust  however  that what little progress was achieved at Vienna will be built upon through our common endeavours in order to achieve the targets set in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Cooperation.228.	My delegation notes with satisfaction the stress laid by a cross-section of delegations at the Vienna Conference on the subject of the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. It is clear that  since Africa has the greatest number of least developed countries  the international community must make special efforts towards the industrial development of Africa in order to lift that continent from the state of poverty in which it is currently trapped.229.	I now wish to reflect on the political state of our world.230.	Over the past few years  the United Nations has been confronted by a number of complex and menacing challenges  many of which threaten the very survival of mankind. The most dangerous of these challenges is the accumulation and accretion of nuclear weapons with the attendant danger of nuclear annihilation. Today we watch with growing concern as the arms race enters the sphere of outer space.231.	It is the considered view of the Sierra Leone delegation  guided by historical evidence  that an unbridled and perennial arms build-up  the perfecting of weapons of mass destruction and the acquisition of nuclear capability by many nations inexorably lead to war  either by design or through accident or miscalculation.232.	Like other members of the General Assembly  my country has a vested interest in the prevention of a nuclear catastrophe. This  more than anything else  explains our demand for a cessation of the present unprecedented and menacing arms build-up. We also renew our appeal  particularly to the Soviet Union and the United States  and to all those other nations which have accumulated nuclear weapons  to resume negotiations in an endeavour to contain and reduce the escalating tensions resulting from the arms build-up. We also urge them to resume negotiations to remove the threat of annihilation which the militarization of outer space entails. Therefore  we welcome the resumption of contacts between the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States and we hope those contacts will produce positive results.233.	The persistence of many regional but potentially dangerous conflicts in some parts of the world also threatens international peace and stability. This situation is continually aggravated by the use of armed force to solve international disputes  contrary to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.234.	One such conflict which has continued to cause great concern to the Government of Sierra Leone is the ongoing fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq. This war  which has now gone on for too long  has taken a severe toll in human lives and constitutes a serious drain on the economic and human resources of those countries. Its continuation is a threat to international peace and stability. The Sierra Leone Government  therefore  renews its appeal to both Iran and Iraq to heed the call of the international community to bring that conflict to a speedy end and resume constructive dialogue  so that mutual trust and confidence can be revived.235.	The occasional but persistent sound of fire in the Middle East is a brutal reminder that the whole area is liable to erupt into widespread violence. Our collective responsibility is to ensure that another eruption does not occur in that area. Our joint endeavours must seek to reconcile the understandable rage of the Palestinians who continue to be denied their just demand for a homeland and the need by Israel to live within secure and internationally recognized borders. The Sierra Leone delegation  therefore  supports the call for an international conference on the Middle East with the full and equal participation of all the parties to the dispute.236.	The problem of Cyprus  a nation divided against the will of its people  has continued to engage the attention of my Government. The United Nations  as the custodian of the security and integrity of all nations  particularly small nations  cannot remain silent and allow the present division of Cyprus to become permanent.237.	My country  therefore  renews its call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus and for the two communities to get together and find suitable solutions to their problems without violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent and non-aligned Cyprus. We note and welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General in using his good offices to bring together all the parties involved in the dispute.238.	While on the question of divided nations  it is a matter of regret and concern that the continuing division of the Korean peninsula has prevented its dynamic people from assuming their proper role in the international community. We are aware of the proposals which have been made for negotiations by both parties but regret the introduction of pre-conditions which serve only to pre-empt a solution to the problem. The Sierra Leone Government has the firm belief that the Korean problem  like those of other divided nations  should be peacefully resolved by the Korean peoples themselves through dialogue and negotiations.239.	While we seek a peaceful solution to the numerous challenges facing the United Nations today  it is a matter of grave concern and deep anxiety to my Government that the racist Pretoria regime  in total disregard of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and of world opinion  has continued to kill  maim and brutalize its own people and menace the peace and security of the whole of southern Africa. That is state terrorism  which the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  is committed to opposing and uprooting wherever it may occur.240.	Some six years ago  the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) as a basis for Namibia's attainment of independence and statehood. Regrettably  the injection of extraneous issues and preconditions has held up the independence of Namibia. As a result  the negotiating process over the past six years has been protracted and inconclusive.241.	Let me say that those who champion the cause of freedom at home but deny its extension to the Namibian people will not succeed  for freedom is indivisible. Therefore  the world is not wholly free if any of its parts is subjugated through the connivance or the indifference of some Member States. Nor is the defence of freedom a national task only. It is a global enterprise to which the United Nations is irrevocably and solemnly committed.242.	My delegation  therefore  calls upon all Governments and all men of goodwill vigorously to condemn the Government of South Africa for its oppressive policy and urges the Security Council to take all measures within the Charter of the United Nations to bring about the abandonment of the policies of apartheid in South Africa  for it is only in this way that we can reduce the endemic and pervasive tensions that so seriously endanger international peace and security in southern Africa.243.	A small country like Sierra Leone is particularly aware of the value of international co-operation. During the current economic crisis  my country has enjoyed the benefits of co-operation with the European Economic Community  the World Bank and UNDP  among others. Among the many friendly countries that have reacted to our current economic difficulties  the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Republic of China have responded to our needs with more than accustomed generosity. We thank these friendly nations most sincerely.244.	Let me  in conclusion  express my Government's profound gratitude to the Secretary-General for exhorting the entire membership of the United Nations to rededicate itself to the principles of the Charter and for alerting the international community to the social and economic catastrophe which now threatens the African continent. We have also noted with a great deal of satisfaction the eloquent pleas of other Members of the Organization from this rostrum. We hope that those pleas will be translated into concrete measures."
"125",6295,"SLV",39,1984,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is an honour for my delegation  and especially for me personally  to extend to you on this occasion the most sincere and cordial congratulations on your assumption of the duties of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.3.	This Assembly will deal with many of the major problems of international society  as well as the options and procedures which may enable us to solve them  thus consolidating understanding  peace and security among nations. I should also like to express the gratitude of the people and Government of El Salvador for the constant and tireless work conducted by the Secretary-General in his indefatigable efforts to achieve that peace  security and co-operation among all the peoples.4.	I came before the General Assembly in 1981  at its thirty-sixth session  as President of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador to explain to the world the crisis which was facing my country and to explain to you the process of democratization which we proposed to accomplish and which we have indeed fulfilled  in holding the first free elections in El Salvador to elect the National Constituent Assembly  which brought back a state of law and received  without any reluctance whatsoever  from the Revolutionary Junta  the full powers of a democratic and a republican nation.5.	That message was received with satisfaction by representatives at the United Nations  although scepticism led them to doubt the possibility of free elections proposed by a de facto Government which had committed itself to ensuring that its people would come in large numbers to vote  even under fire  to demonstrate its desire for democracy and its rejection of violence.6.	We fulfilled that commitment  but the Salvadorian people went further when it established the Provisional Government and held two rounds of presidential elections  which are an historic confirmation of the will of our people  who want to find the road to peace through the path of democracy.7.	I am very happy to state here before all the peoples of the world that El Salvador  despite having gone through one of the most difficult periods in its history  has given specific examples of what a people can do and obtain when it truly believes in democracy as the best possible way to solve the differences which are inherent in all organized societies.8.	That offering of my people to freedom entails great sacrifice. This process to democracy  peace and social justice culminated on 1 June 1984  a date which is indeed a milestone in the history of El Salvador because  for the first time in half a century  we have established a Government which is truly democratic and which has directly and freely emanated from the sovereign power of the Salvadorian people.9.	I now come  bearing the banner of my country as a symbolic gesture of the legitimacy of my Government  to appear before the nations of the world and to speak with the authority vested in me because of the support of my people  to speak of the peace so ardently desired by all Salvadorians  to speak of the benefits of that peace to which we are entitled and for which we are striving  to speak of our irreversible desire for democracy. I should like to speak about the peace of Nicaragua  of the guerrillas and Contadora  and to make an appeal to reason and fraternity which we deserve in Central America. I want us to be reasonable and to reconcile our differences.10.	For more than four years  El Salvador has suffered from the effects of a merciless war which has caused us bloodshed and impoverishment. More than 50 000 Salvadorians have been the innocent victims of a fratricidal confrontation. More than half a million persons have had to leave their homes and their property. Subversive forces have engaged in a campaign of terror and systematic destruction  and our people is tired of it. It must end.11.	One after another  the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum have referred to peace in the strongest of terms. Peace undoubtedly is the greatest yearning of all men  and its maintenance is the main function of the United Nations. I  too  come before the Assembly to speak of peace in the same strong terms.12.	But I shall not refer to the dangers confronting the world as the consequence of the unbridled arms race  nor to the threat of total destruction represented by the senseless accumulation of nuclear weapons  although  of course  I share the concerns of all of you  as well as your frustration in the face of the seeming inability of the community of nations to fulfil not only the letter but also the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.13.	I shall not speak of nuclear confrontation because others have done so here with great eloquence and profound knowledge of the problem.14.	May I therefore be permitted to depart from the usual procedure and  in greeting all the nations of the world  I should like to take this opportunity to describe and define the position of my Government in the face of the problems and the crisis which beset us  because in this manner I shall also establish the principles of the foreign policy of my country  which is based on peace and harmony among all human beings.15.	I am convinced that to provide this information is part of the responsibility which we have taken upon ourselves in the face of disinformation  stereotypes and commonplace statements. We must dispel uncertainties  clarify goals and purposes  state the course we intend to take and inform the world of the reality of life in El Salvador. This is a task which we must undertake so that the action of democratic countries may be carried out with confidence and in support of our struggle to achieve real democracy in our country; in support of our desire for the juridical equality of States  non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  and the self-determination of peoples; in support of our vigorous opposition to foreign interference and any kind of political  economic  juridical or ideological pressure exerted by one nation upon another.16.	The crisis is worsening because of the grave situation in Central America: the imbalances in the international economic system  trade imbalances  excessive protectionism in the terms of trade  unemployment  external indebtedness and a series of other negative factors which have an increasing effect on our weak economic structures and are leading us to a historic crossroads. Thus  El Salvador will always support the efforts of the Group of 77  which has been striving tirelessly to bring about a new international economic order more in keeping with the principles of justice.17.	Central America  which is involved in a political  social and economic crisis  is experiencing acute problems  but these are not irreversible. It is possible to find formulas for understanding and appropriate political and diplomatic solutions.18.	Confronted by this complex picture  El Salvador has always acted rationally because of our strong desire for a peaceful  democratic solution in Central America which would strengthen the security of the region by means of understanding  economic and social integration  and consistent respect for the norms and principles of international law.19.	El Salvador's conduct has always been based on its dedication to the principles and tenets which govern relations between States. We are convinced that adherence to those principles is an indispensable requirement for the harmonious coexistence of inter-national society. El Salvador thus fulfils its international commitments and regrets that some countries that speak half-truths and deliberately conceal their own violations appear before various bodies of the United Nations not in order to settle differences but rather to use those bodies as a mere platform for propaganda  regardless of the cost and the degree to which they undermine this body  whose protection they claim to seek.20.	El Salvador believes that the Contadora process is the only course open to us. In this context  we support an honest regional dialogue  so that we Central Americans may determine our destiny on the basis of a consensus. We must not become the tools in a struggle of the interests and ideologies of foreign Powers and certainly not the mere instruments of those Powers  thus denying our own nationalism and characteristics and frustrating the aspirations of our peoples and their right to live in peace and freedom.21.	Peace in Central America must be based on the establishment of a genuine democratic process in the political  economic and social fields  which will enable us to leave behind the contradictions  deprivation and backwardness which most of us have suffered in the past.22.	The international situation continues  regrettably  to show all the signs of the East-West confrontation  which is tending to spread  thus producing a negative effect on rational thinking and coexistence in various regions. Unfortunately  Central America has also suffered from such confrontation. However  diplomatic efforts are now being made with regard to our area. In this context  the use of the good offices of the Contadora Group has our support.23.	My Government is grateful for the constructive work done by the four countries that make up the Contadora Group: Venezuela  Colombia  Panama and Mexico. We appreciate the proposals and efforts undertaken by the Group  which have received the support of the General Assembly and offer the best way of achieving the peaceful solution of the conflict  which is so painful for all of Latin America. We have co-operated fully with those countries in trying to create understanding and unity among all the peoples of Central America.24.	We attach great value to those efforts for the preservation of peace. Thus  we shall  as we have agreed  present before 15 October our comments on the revised Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  which was submitted to us on 7 September last. We are trying to achieve peace by means of dialogue and on the basis of regional arrangements within the framework of the Contadora process.25.	I should like  on behalf of the democratic Government of El Salvador  to sign an agreement that will be in keeping with the efforts of the Contadora Group. But such an agreement must be right and just for El Salvador. It must strictly guarantee the application of the 21 points which have already been accepted by all the parties in the Document of Objectives adopted on 9 September 1983. The agreement must ensure appropriate measures for the verification and control of everything that is agreed. We must make sure that the obligations that we undertake to put an end to the presence of foreign military advisers and eliminate military aid from abroad must provide for the strictest controls and  at the same time  entail for all the commitment not to support or continue to give assistance to terrorist activity against our legitimate democratic Government.26.	The history of my country is similar to that of many of the underdeveloped countries in the world. If I describe it briefly  many representatives listening to me will find amazing similarities with the history of their own countries. It is the history of a common struggle  of anguish  of triumphs and of failures. It is a common history of idealsâit is our history.27.	El Salvador emerged from colonialism to become an independent State on 15 September 1821  as a member of the Federal Republic of Central America. The struggles between the conservatives and the liberals culminated at the end of the century in the absolute triumph of the latter. From that time on  a coffee oligarchy controlled the economic and political life of our country. The larger and better ranches  banking  and trade in the principal export products were in their hands. Controlled elections led to a succession of Presidents of the Republic who were the representatives of that oligarchy until 1931. Then  for the first time  a progressive party came to power  but a few months later it was defeated. The world crisis  the fall in coffee prices and the losses suffered by the peasants led in 1932 to a popular uprising  which was put down by force. After that  an alliance emerged between the armed forces and the oligarchy  which used it to keep political control and economic privileges. Following a dictatorship that lasted for 13 years  and after 1944  various military Governments  Government juntas and provisional Presidents came to power. In 1984 the first civilian Government in 50 years was elected by the free vote of the people.28.	That is the history of my country and my people. However  it is important to dwell briefly on the history of the last 20 years. In 1964 we began a more or less free electoral process  with elections for deputies and municipal councils. That led to a growth of opposition political parties. In 1968 they were on the verge of achieving power when their democratic aspirations were frustrated  and this led to fraud and the imposition of the party officially in power. In 1972 the opposition triumphed but the Government again frustrated the will of the people. From that time  all democratic leaders were persecuted and political parties opposed to the Government in power were eliminated. In 1977 a last effort was made to establish a democratic process and once again the people's aspirations were ferociously crushed.29.	Thus  frustrated by the lack of freedom  the people lost faith in the democratic process  and the situation of economic and social injustice drove them to despair. Armed opposition as a way to attain power began in 1972  broke out again in 1977 and led to widespread violence in 1978.30.	In the face of the blocking of the path to a democratic alternative and the impossibility of changing the economic structures  the thesis of violence gained strength as the sole means to free the Salvadorian people.31.	By the end of the 1970s  polarization between a rightist military dictatorship and its possible violent overthrow by Marxist sectors seeking power had almost completely eliminated a democratic solution.32.	In October 1979  a group of officers and officials acting on behalf of the armed forces overthrew the ruling authoritarian Government and issued a proclamation pointing out the corruption of the system of government and promising to open the path to democracy  as well as to undertake a series of structural reforms and  in particular  to lay the bases for thorough agrarian reform.33.	The Revolutionary Junta that was set up that year included  along with the armed forces  the political parties and the social  economic and religious forces that still believed in a democratic solution and that had harshly criticized those who had taken up arms. The Communist Party  the National Revolutionary Movementâof social democratic orientationâand the Christian Democrats took part. The armed subversives stepped up their attacks against the new regime. Many thought that the triumph of the guerrillas was imminent and  in the face of that possibility  the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party left the Government and its democratic position and joined the armed struggle.34.	At the same time  the leaders of the mass movements also withdrew and joined the guerrillas. In other words  they all burned their bridges and opt for armed struggle and violence as the sole solution. I believe that this attitude was their first historical error: to abandon the democratic political struggle and the struggle of the masses and opt exclusively for armed struggle.35.	In accordance with the historical analysis carried out by the subversives  in applying their ideological position to reality they never thought that the Salvadorian armed forces would break their traditional alliance with the oligarchy and that  therefore  the economic and social reforms could ever be achieved. They thought that the establishment of a pluralist democracy would continue to be a Utopian goal and out of the question.36.	The only political sector that did not lose faith was the Christian Democratic Partyâmy Partyâ and by means of an agreement with the armed forces it rebuilt the 1980 Government. Despite the negative forecasts of the extreme left  with the active participation of the armed forces the most profound agrarian reform in Latin America was carried out  the banking and finance system was reformed and foreign trade was nationalized. These reforms brought in hundreds of thousands of peasants as a major social and political force  henceforth organized in cooperatives and in owning the best and biggest ranches of the country.37.	Faced with the faulty analysis of the extreme left that structural changes were impossible  the subversive groups made a new and fatal mistake with the most serious consequences for their objectives: in acting in the same way as the extreme right they lent themselves to bringing about the failure of the reforms. Thousands of peasants were murdered  as were hundreds of Christian Democrats; crops were burnt  houses and machinery destroyed  and the publicity campaigns of both extremes denigrated  both nationally and internationally  the reforms that had been initiated. Their only success  however  was to distance the people from extreme positions and to begin to strengthen the democratic revolution.38.	In January 1981  when the subversives launched the first so-called final offensive  the people rejected them and the subversive  terrorist action jailed. We all know that nowhere in the world can guerrillas triumph without the support of the people.39.	The second step taken by the Revolutionary Junta was to call for truly free elections to draft a new constitution. On that occasion  I came before the General Assembly. The 1982 parliamentary elections  in which the rightist and other political parties participated  attest to the will of a people to accept the path to democracy to solve its problems and to repudiate the path of violence. Thousands of international observers verified the legitimacy of the electoral process and all were able to see how the Salvadorian people went out to vote in the midst of guerrilla attacks. This new mistake by the subversives with respect to the electoral process  in which more than 80 per cent of citizens of voting age took part  further distanced them from the people.40.	In 1984 the Salvadorian people again exercised its right to vote and elected the President of the Republic. Hence  I pride myself on being the first freely elected President of El Salvador in the last 50 years.41.	Many of those who took up arms did so out of rebellion and frustration: they wanted agrarian reform  they fought for a banking system that would serve the majority and they wanted respect for the will of the people through free elections. These justifications were valid in 1979; today they have lost all validity.42.	At that time it could be argued that the objective and subjective conditions were in keeping with the historical dialectics of the class struggle and that  in response to rightist totalitarianism  the concept of revolutionary violence should gain validity and force.43.	The Marxist strategy of a prolonged people's war against imperialism and the oligarchies  the oppressors of a people deprived of justice and freedom  was based on that concept  and thousands of young people joined a process that began with social confrontation and civil disobedience and went on to the use of arms in the various phases of the destruction of life and the destruction of services and firms  until it resulted in the greatest crisis in our country's history.44.	I am convinced that the historic path of mankind is not one of violence but of democratic revolution.45.	It is understandable that those compatriots who left El Salvador years ago cannot or refuse to understand that things have changed; however  I know that the great majority of Salvadorians  and even the guerrilla commanders and fighters roaming about in the mountains of our homeland  are aware of this new situation.46.	I wish at this point to address some observations to the nations that have committed themselves  in one way or another  to undermining my country  as well as to the guerrilla leadersânot to those who are living comfortably in and are giving orders from Managua or Havana  or from other nations that claim to be democratic but in fact export violence and murderâbut to the guerrilla leaders who are in the mountains of my country  those who withstand the elements  unsheltered  those who are aware of the real position of the Salvadorian people when they attack the villages and who are waitingâin vainâto be welcomed as liberators  when the truth is that their purpose is to oppress those people. I am addressing myself to the leaders who take their ideals for reality; to those who are mistaken about the people because they have a different view of truth; to the leaders who are now committing this historical error.47.	The guerrilla leaders in the mountains are aware of this dilemma  but they are egged on by subversive leaders from abroad who try to conceal this truth and distort this reality in order to justify their anti-historical position before the whole world.48.	The people of El Salvador now have no doubt that subversive violence has lost its mystique and its raison d'etre. Terrorist violence has become an end in itself  which proves that its objective is no longer liberation  and certainly not democracy.49.	In El Salvador the terrorists have committed excesses but they have failed  because the people do not support them and because we have the political will to build a united  pluralistic and democratic society. By persisting in their anti-historical obstinacy  they have dedicated themselves to the oppression of the simple peasants who are the victims of their reign of terror; they are robbing and killing people; they are leaving citizens without any means of communication because they are blowing up bridges  roads and railroads; they are destroying electrical power lines and water systems; they are setting fire to plantations producing coffee  cotton and food crops. That leaves the poorest element of our population without work or hope.50.	It is so easy to destroy what took years to be built for the people! Services which are needed by the people and which took so many years to build up  the infrastructure that is part of our national heritage and that was established by the efforts and sacrifice of our people  can be destroyed in an instant by the criminal hand of the terrorist  who uses dynamite and is financed by nations that have in mind only world domination and are perhaps labouring under a misunderstanding of history.51.	Unfortunately  the Revolutionary Democratic Front does not understand that we are experiencing a new reality  and therefore it is still trying to change things that no longer exist: a medieval agrarian structure  a financial structure at the service of the interests of a minority  an army at the service of a political system dominated by economic elite. All those things no longer exist. In 1979 a profound process of change began  and it has been consolidated. Today we have a new agrarian structure which has placed our best lands at the service of the peasant. We have a new financial structure which supports and strengthens the new agrarian structure. We have a new trade structure for the products that we traditionally have exported  and this makes available to the country the hard currency thereby generated. We now have an armed force that works for the people. And we have a people that have demonstrated its unshakeable faith in democracy and have elected a Government by its own free will; we have a people that is working  suffering and dying to achieve peace and justice.52.	From this rostrum I ask those who advocate the ideology of armed subversion in El Salvador to change their strategies because of the new reality in my country. The El Salvador that they left in 1978 and 1979 is not the El Salvador that exists in 1984. Today our country is breathing the air of freedom. Political parties are respected and encouraged. The people freely choose their leaders. Abuses of authority and violations of human rights have been reduced to the very minimum  and those who commit them are prosecuted and punished. Banks are lending large sums to peasants who are actively participating in the social and political struggles. There is a very different society in El Salvador today.53.	This new reality is misunderstood by the members of the Revolutionary Democratic Front  because they live outside our country; it is being experienced today by all the Salvadorians who have not abandoned their homeland. But it has penetrated the guerrilla forces. We know this from the testimony of the guerrillas who have abandoned their weapons and violence and have set out on the path to peace. We know it because the guerrillas are not getting so many volunteers and are obliged to fill their ranks with young people. We know it because they are becoming weaker each day.54.	For all those reasons  I address the Salvadorian guerrillas and ask them to accept the new reality  to stop killing our brothers  to stop destroying bridges  to stop destroying the infrastructure of the nation  the public transport services  the plantations and the railroads. In a word  I ask them to stop killing and destroying and  together with all the rest of our people  to engage in the building of a new country  a free and democratic country in which peace will be the basis for our development.55.	Ever since I became President by the freely expressed decision of the citizens of my country  I have been aware that the main task of my mandate is to achieve social harmony and internal peace in El Salvador  which has been convulsed by a conflict with both internal and external causes. The time has come to put an end to that conflict. I am more convinced today than ever before that the existence of this conflict not only affects the life of my compatriots but is an element of friction that threatens the peace and security of other nations of the world  and particularly of our brother nations in Central America.56.	Hence  there could be no more appropriate time than this  when I am at this rostrum  to make before the peoples of the world an offer of peace  which would ensure for all Salvadoriansâwithout any distinctions flowing from political or ideological positionâsocial harmony and security.57.	This offer is made within the framework of the Salvadorian Constitution  which has established the system of democracy and political pluralism  under which the most varied ideologies can coexist.58.	Of course  the acceptance of this proposal by all sectorsâthose that are in opposition to my Government  within the constitutional system  as well as those that are fighting by violent methodsâwill require a change of mental attitude  under which hatred will be replaced by understanding and tolerance. For  after all  the peace which is manifested by outward signs is but the result of an individual and social state of mind which rejects aggression and all forms of violence and promotes dialogue and the democratic political struggle whose results are seen at the ballot box.59.	Quite naturally  it is hard to convince those who up to now have viewed weapons and violence as the only way to ensure their political space that there can be a climate in which they can express their own thoughts without thereby suffering reprisals from their adversaries.60.	But I have come here to affirm that  as President of the Republic and Commander of the Armed Forces  I am in a position to maintain those measures which  within our constitutional process  make it possible for them to abandon an attitude that runs counter to the history of the political evolution of the people of El Salvador. Furthermore  in due course I shall propose to the Legislative Assembly general amnesty for political crimes. We are exercising control over abuse of authority and eliminating all the methods of repression that have existed in our country in the past and that have in part been at the root of a rebellion for which there is no longer a need.61.	This means that I am offering the security of a political place within a pluralistic  constitutional  democratic system which my Government is defending.62.	As part of those efforts  I invite the heads of the guerrilla movement now in our mountains to come without weapons to the village of La Palma  in the Department of Chalatenango  at 10 a.m. on 15 October  the anniversary of the insurrection movement of 1979  and in the presence of the representatives of the Churches and the world press  to discuss with us the details and scope of this proposal for their incorporation into the democratic process and the establishment of an atmosphere of freedom for the next election. I am convinced that our people  tired of so much violence  will take this proposal as a sign of hope emanating from its lawful Government."
"126",6367,"SOM",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  I should like first to extend our warm and sincere congratulations to Mr. Lusaka for his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at this thirty-ninth session. His predecessor  Mr. Illueca  of Panama  deserves high praise for the dedication and skill with which he directed the affairs of the thirty-eighth session and we also wish to express our appreciation to him for his achievements.297.	I also wish to extend my congratulations to the delegation of Brunei Darussalam on its admission as the 159th State Member of the United Nations.298.	The year that has passed has seen the Secretary-General once again employ his renowned diplomatic skills and his good offices to strengthen the role of the United Nations in international affairs. We pay a heartfelt tribute to him for his valuable efforts.299.	On the other hand  there must be grave concern over the lack of progress towards the solution of certain other political problems  whether they are of long-standing or of more recent origin. The continued increase in  and escalation of  regional conflicts is particularly troubling. The world community can ill afford the consequences of tension and conflict in the Horn of Africa  in Afghanistan  in Kampuchea  the Arabian Gulf and elsewhere  while it is still far from achieving a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East  the elimination of apartheid and all forms of colonialism in Africa  the peaceful resolution of the Cyprus and other issues and  above all  the halting of the suicidal nuclear-arms race.300. There should be wide recognition by all States and groups of States that new destabilizing political problems which increase human misery and threaten regional and international peace and security can be of benefit to no one in our interdependent world. Strong and renewed efforts should be made to resolve long-standing disputes and those of more recent origin before they  too  become fixtures on the international scene.301. It is our earnest hope that efforts at mediation will soon bring to an end the tragic conflict between Iraq and Iranâtwo non-aligned neighbouring States. That fratricidal war continues to exact a terrible toll in human lives and wasted material resources. Neither State can hope to profit from a continuation of the fighting. We appeal to Iraq and Iran alike to respond positively to proposals and appeals for negotiations which can lead to lasting peace in the region.302.	My Government also hopes that the world community will intensify its efforts to bring about the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and from Democratic Kampuchea. The military occupation of Afghanistan and of Democratic Kampuchea have had strikingly similar consequences. Large-scale armed interventions in the internal affairs of neighbouring States have inevitably given rise to protracted and bloody civil wars  to the disruption of development plans and national life  to disastrous refugee flows and to the heightening of regional and international tensions. Certainly  they have added greatly to the sum total of human misery in the modem world.303.	In our own region  the Horn of Africa  tension  conflict and human suffering remain endemic as a result of foreign militant intervention  military aggression  the violation of basic human rights and the harsh denial of the right to self-determination and independence for colonized peopleâall with the gravest consequences for Somalia.304.	The central destabilizing factor in our region's turmoil is the continued denial by the Ethiopian empire-State of the right to self-determination to colonized people still languishing under its rule. The territories in the Horn of Africa acquired by European colonizers during the nineteenth century have all long since gained their independence in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). Ironically  the people of territories acquired by Ethiopia at the same time or later and with the collusion of the European Powers are still struggling for their inalienable rights.305.	It was to suppress the liberation struggles waged by the peoples of Western Somalia  Eritrea  Tigre and other areas that the Ethiopian regime called in the forces of a super-Power and its surrogates  making the Horn of Africa once again a focus for super-Power rivalry. Policies of extreme repression  even genocide  are enforced  causing the mass exodus of refugees from the occupied territories into Somalia and other countries in the area.306.	As the world community is already well aware  Somalia continues to be gravely affected by the overwhelming burden occasioned by so many refugees. Thousands are in camps and settlements  and perhaps an equal number eke out a living in the countryside and towns. It has been truly stated that every family supports its refugees; nor does there seem to be any end to this human tragedy; substantial new flows have been reported this very month.307.	My Government is  of course  particularly grateful that the international community  at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  and bilaterally  has recognized the intolerable burden that massive refugee flows place on weak and fragile infrastructures in the least developed countries. The principle of burden-sharing is to be implemented to some extent through the support of specific projects  but periodic and often severe shortages of fuel and balanced foodstuffs still occur. The day-to-day sustenance of so vast a refugee population is an enormous problem. In truth  the whole situation has been allowed to go on far too long. As we concentrate  in line with our undoubted humanitarian duty  on the alleviation of the problems of today's refugees  we must never forget that those problems are but a symptom of the most  serious underlying issues: persistent colonialism  racism  genocide and drought. It is they that are the real problems: refugees flee from persecution and oppressive policies which a just world should declare unacceptable  and from deteriorating environmental conditions which are not invariably beyond the possibility of amelioration.308.	It is the hope of the Somali Government that the necessary political climate will be created which will encourage voluntary repatriation. This hope remains unfulfilled  since repressive policies continue to be enforced in Ethiopia. The continued arrival of refugees in Somalia attests to this fact. Furthermore  the claim of the Ethiopian regime that there have been substantial numbers of refugees returning for whose rehabilitation it needs international assistance is without substance. International workers in the field have seen at first hand the unwillingness of the vast majority of refugees to return to their homelands until their safety and their basic human rights can be guaranteed.309.	The refugee problem is not the only one suffered by Somalia as a result of Ethiopia's imperialist policies. Over the past two years  the Ethiopian Army  made bold by the support of surrogate forces  has repeatedly launched military aggression by land and air against our country. Somali territory has been invaded  townships captured and occupied and hundreds of innocent people killedâincluding recently 36 children whose school was destroyed in a wanton and barbarous air attack on the town of Borama and a nearby refugee camp on 30 January of this year.310.	Even today  Ethiopian forces are still occupying two portions of Somalia's territory  and an insidious policy of destabilization is being actively pursued in a vain attempt to undermine the sovereignty  integrity and national independence of my country. We call once again on all Member States to condemn the Ethiopian regime for its acts of aggression and to demand that it withdraw its forces from Somalia's territory and end its unwarranted attacks. Moreover  let me state clearly that no peace can be achieved in the region unless the Ethiopian regime totally and unconditionally withdraws its forces from Somali territory and also guarantees to the colonized people of Western Somalia and Eritrea their inalienable right to justice and self-determination. For its part  Somalia will continue to deploy all possible efforts to bring about the peaceful resolution of the problems in the region.311.	The persistence of southern African problems on the Assembly's agenda signifies one of the most serious failures of the United Nations. Although external details may change  the core of these problems continues to be South Africa's racist and colonial policies  which have given grave cause for concern since the earliest days of the United Nations.312.	In our view  the United Nations must continue to insist on the isolation of the South African regime until it puts an end to the crime of apartheid and truly represents the people. It must recognize the legitimacy of liberation struggles against and against the illegal occupation of Namibia. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only valid and legal basis for Namibia's independence  and its implementation should be vigorously pursued in the General Assembly and the Security Council.313.	The most recent flare-up of conflict in the Middle East has subsided for the moment  but  as elsewhere  unless the root causes of such conflicts are removed  the area will continue to suffer from violence and bloodshed. Nor can there be any permanent and just peace in the region while Israel remains in illegal occupation of Lebanese  Palestinian and other Arab territories  while it persists in illegal settlement and annexationist policies and while the Palestinian people are denied their inalienable right to self-determination.314.	We believe that the General Assembly must continue its support for recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people and must demand Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and from all other occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. The time has surely come for concrete global actions aimed at bringing about a comprehensive settlement of Middle East problems.315.	A new and balanced initiative is likewise urgently needed in the case of Cyprus  where differences of long standing are rapidly becoming irreconcilable.316.	I turn now to the international economic situation  which is as significant for peace and progress as any political question on the Assembly's agenda. Regrettably  the deadlock in the dialogue between countries of the North and the South remains unbroken. This situation represents the blunting of an important purpose of the United Nationsânamely  the solution through international co-operation of international problems of an economic  social  cultural and humanitarian nature.317.	While deadlock continues  developing countries are reeling under the impact of closely related economic forces which are beyond their control. High interest rates  increasing debt burdens  rising protectionism  declining export earnings and low levels of development assistance severely affect even the more prosperous developing countries  but they can reduce least developed nations to most desperate straits.318.	The adverse effects of the current international economic situation are most apparent in Africaâthe continent with the greatest number of least developed countries. The widespread return in recent years of catastrophic drought conditions and other factors  including the presence of large refugee populations  have dealt additional cruel blows to economies already weakened by external forces.319.	The Secretary-General has launched a most timely initiative in calling the attention of the world community to the critical economic situation in Africa. We congratulate him on this initiative and welcome the emphasis he has placed on Africa's special needs. Indeed  the extent and gravity of the crisis in Africa must not be underestimated. The problems of our continent  translated into human terms  could mean the disintegration of the social and economic fabric of many African societies. !t could spell hunger  malnutrition and untimely death for millions in the years ahead. Africa today stands in need of massive assistance to combat drought and desertification more widespread and devastating than in the two previous decades  when they took hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced mil-lions of people. Today  food aid for the starving is an immediate  primary need  but more fundamental approaches must also be set in motion. In many cases infrastructures must be strengthened before relief and development projects can be implemented.320.	The Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa makes it clear that African States are quite prepared to accept primary responsibility for their own development. We understand well the need for integrated national policies and for closer economic and technical co-operation with each other. We know that agriculture must be high on our list of priorities so that food sufficiency can be attained.321.	We appeal to the developed countries to recognize that the interdependence of North and South is an inescapable reality. The easing of debt burdens  the promotion of just and stable commodity prices and the roll-back of protectionism are fundamental remedies to restore the health of African and other third-world economies. Significant infusions of international economic assistance remain of vital importance for tiding African States over the present crisis and for giving us the boost we need to put us firmly on the road to economic recovery  stability and true independence.322.	Without doubt  there is no issue on the agenda of the General Assembly that is as pressing and as important as disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament.323.	If the world survives the nuclear age  future generations studying our history may well ask how we were able to plan  to build and to organize our affairs at local  national and international levels while living under the threatening shadow of opposing systems of nuclear weapons. They may well ponder the priorities of an age when unimaginable sums were spent on the production and refinement of weapons capable of global destruction while millions of human beings suffered the deprivation and indignities of abject poverty. The consequences of the nuclear-arms race and of the arms race in sophisticated conventional weapons are evident in every aspect of world affairs. We see their effects in world inflation  in the widening gap between rich and poor countries and in regional tensions  which have increased under the pressures of super-Power confrontations.324.	It is clear that a new resolve is needed on every frontâpolitical  humanitarian and technicalâto work for the attainment of the goal of disarmament. Sanity and common sense call for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and  as a further step  a freeze in the production  testing and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. Nor should a supposedly advanced civilization have any place for chemical weapons; they should be totally prohibited without further delay.325.	The difficulty of containing the quantity and destructive capacity of existing nuclear weapons points to the folly of extending the nuclear-arms race to space. We hope that negotiations for the banning of space weapons along with other weapons of mass destruction will soon be undertaken. My Government has always welcomed initiatives such as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  which can make a valuable contribution to general and complete disarmament. As an Indian Ocean State  for example  we strongly support the principles that underlie the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.326.	We appeal once more to the nuclear Powers to work with urgency to remove the nuclear threat and to allow the world's people to plan and build a future of hope  security and peace.327.	Finally  the annual session of the General Assembly provides both large and small Member States with an opportunity for renewed dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Clearly we must all find the political will to work for the solution of the many problems that confront us all and endanger world peace and security. We must all contribute to the search for peace and progress."
"127",6404,"STP",39,1984,"ï»¿The established practice in the United Nations of setting aside three weeks of the General Assembly session for the general debate is not in itself an objectionable method. The way in which it is used makes the practice less and less praiseworthy  not to say less and less credible.172.	The compilation of all the addresses given before the Assembly gives us an idea of the depth of the abyss which exists between the fundamental principles  the generous ideas and the constructive recommendations which are formally proclaimed and the increasingly powerful brakes used \q prevent their full implementation.173.	Where do we stand today in our repeated commitment to work for the building of a just  equitable and harmonious world in which every people may live in freedom  dignity and security?174.	The rights of peoples to self-determination and independence  recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity and by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  are flagrantly violated by certain Member States.175.	The unswerving support given by the international community to the determination of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  to turn Namibia into an independent nation does not prevent South Africa from continuing illegally to occupy that Territory.176.	The regime of apartheidâconsidered a crime against humanity  the shame of the twentieth centuryâstrengthened by its alliances  defies the international community through the brutality of its repressive methods  its disdain for the black population  its travesty of democracy steeped in the most primitive racism and its plan to destabilize the countries of the region.177.	Despite the relevant resolutions  the heroic peoples of Western Sahara  Palestine and East Timor continue to wage a war of liberation against Moroccan  Israeli and Indonesian forces.178.	The principles and rules governing relations among Statesâin particular  those of equal rights  the non-use of force in the settlement of disputes  the right to choose one's own path to development  non-interference in internal affairsâare sometimes disregarded by those who wish to become the masters of the universe or who harbour dreams of expansion and domination. The vast majority of the conflicts that rage in the various parts of the world have their origin in the non-observance of those cardinal principles.179.	Moreover  we are far from achieving a new international economic order. It is as though the wealthy countries extract from the poverty and misery of the peoples of the underdeveloped countries the life-blood they need to feed their affluence and strengthen their selfishness.180.	Although it is true that we all belong to the great family of the United Nations  we behave in our relations like members of a broken family  where might is right. The arms race is proof of this.181.	What credibility  then  can we attach to these three weeks of general debate and what is its real contribution to the solution of world problems? The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe thinks that it would be more constructive to use this period in the scheduled meetings to analyse the most important items on the agenda. That would have the advantage of making our meetings more lively and of giving Foreign Ministers the time they need to express their views in an atmosphere of dynamic and constructive dialogue.182.	One of the major tasks facing all Member States is that of strengthening the role of the Organization. We welcome the delegation of Brunei Darussalam and are convinced that its participation in that collective effort will be appreciated.183.	The observance in 1985 of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations will provide a suitable opportunity for thorough consideration of the role of the Organization and ways and means of strengthening its effectiveness and credibility in the quest for solutions to the disquieting issues of today's world.184.	In this connection  the excellent report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization constitutes an important contribution.185.	I know how difficult it is to change the rituals of the Organization  but  bearing in mind the purposes of the United Nations and the enormous hope it holds out for the safeguarding of peace and for the freedom and progress of nations and peoples  there is still time to try"
"128",6436,"SUR",39,1984,"ï»¿Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Suriname and on my own behalf I extend warm and hearty congratulations to you on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your professional qualities and the services you have rendered so successfully in the past to the international community uniquely qualify you for this high office. We are certain that this body will conduct and complete its work efficiently and successfully under your competent guidance.3.	At the same time  I wish to express my Government's gratitude for the balanced and effective way in which Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  presided over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We wish him well.4.	The Secretary-General should be commended for his tireless efforts on behalf of the suffering world community longing for development  peace and stability. Much progress in these areas can be attributed to his personal intervention in most delicate situations.5.	We welcome Brunei Darussalam to the family of nations and extend our best wishes to the Government and people of this new Member State.6.	Another year has passed since my delegation had the honour to address the General Assembly. Although it may be more appropriate to elaborate extensively on the significance of this lofty Organization at the commemoration of its fortieth anniversary next year  I am seizing this opportunity to reiterate the adherence of my country to the principles and the objectives of the United Nations.7.	In a world with growing antagonisms  the United Nations has an important role to play as a platform for dialogue  for reducing tension and solving conflicts between States  for reshaping the world into one of justice  peace  prosperity and dignity for mankind and for bringing hope where despair exists.8.	We realize how remote mankind is from realizing these noble principles and how much the very existence of States is threatened by repeated and disquieting manifestations of disrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. We realize to what extent political  military and economic power is still abused in many parts of the world  while large segments of humanity continue to suffer from deprivation and underdevelopment.9.	The Republic of Suriname consistently adheres to the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. We therefore urgently call on all States Members of the United Nations to uphold these principles  without which peace and prosperity will be mere illusions.10.	Our foreign policy continues to reflect the non- aligned spirit and is geared towards supporting the creation of a just international order based on the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for sovereignty and the right to self-determination.11.	Actions which take place throughout the world sometimes make us wonder if these universally accepted principles only guide the actions of the smaller States  since it appears that positions of strength do not accommodate these principles as easily as do positions of weakness.12.	It is time for a change. What we need is not a countless number of resolutions but  rather  firm determination to end the duplicity and double standards in international affairs.13.	In transforming Suriname from its colonial structure  we share the fate of many third-world countries that have to overcome various obstacles  both of an internal and of an external nature  in this legitimate process. Unifying a people divided by colonial interests in the past and promoting a consciousness of their own destiny are certainly not easy tasks.14.	The task of securing real and well-balanced development for our people and building a manageable economy naturally requires a sound infrastructure. To realize all this and to build an independent nation well integrated into the Latin American and Caribbean region were main objectives at the very outset of our revolution on 25 February 1980. But our efforts alone are not sufficient to accomplish this tremendous task.15.	When we concluded the Treaty on Co-operation for Development with the Netherlands on our independence  we were convinced that that settlement of our historical claims would provide the basis for economic development and for improving the well- being of our long-neglected people.16.	Perhaps this is not the time to elaborate extensively upon the fate of that solemn Treaty. You should be informed  however  Mr. President  that the execution of that Treaty  reached voluntarily between the Republic of Suriname and the Kingdom of the Netherlands  came to a unilateral and abrupt halt in 1982  as a consequence of which we have since been deprived of the funds provided for in that Treaty. We are convinced that this arbitrary action will not meet with the approval of the United Nations community.17.	Nations may develop differences of opinion over time on more or less basic issues. The Republic of Suriname  however  is of the opinion that no problem between two parties or sovereign States will ever be fairly solved if they are not discussed in an honest  frank and fair dialogue. After all  this is the founding principle of the United Nations. We should follow it in all circumstances. Therefore  we stand ready  and publicly state our willingness  to discuss  at any time  the issue of co-operation for development with any party genuinely interested in the well- being of the people of Suriname.18.	It was in this spirit that we recently approached the Netherlands to discuss the normalization of our relations. We express the hope that the dialogue  for which a basis has been established in the meantime  will lead to a new understanding with regard to the Treaty.19.	Notwithstanding the adverse effects of the unexpectedly reduced level of support for its economic development  Suriname has continued its efforts to establish a self-reliant economy  and we can happily report that our efforts to develop our nation have met with solid and encouraging support on our continent and beyond.20.	One of the most pressing problems in our hemisphere concerns the situation in Central America. The people of the region  like others  want the right freely to determine their own future in peace and security  free from any outside interference or intervention.21.	We are convinced that military solutions in Central America do not lead to lasting peace. The policy of some States in the region not only is at variance with the basic principles governing the conduct between States  but also violates the ruling given by the International Court of Justice on 10 May of this year.22.	My Government staunchly supports the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group. We express the hope that the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America will contribute to the achievement of co-operation  peace and stability throughout the Central American region.23.	My delegation also hopes that the Caribbean region will remain a zone of peace in which the peoples of that region can exercise their right to self- determination  free from any outside interference and intervention. It is our heartfelt wish that the people of Grenada will be able to determine their future in accordance with their own political  economic and social interests.24.	I wish to reiterate the view of the Government of the Republic of Suriname that non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is an essential condition for peace between nations  a principle which  unfortunately  is too often disregarded. In accordance with this principle  every State has the obligation to refrain from instigating  participating in  or organizing acts of civil strife or terrorism in another State and from promoting any activity which could lead to a threat or the actual use of force against another State.25.	Suriname therefore supports the drafting of an international convention against the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries. We call on all States to co-operate to enable the United Nations to conclude this fundamental convention.26.	The question of Namibia  that unfortunate example of inhuman treatment of blacks by white supremacists  confronts us once again on the agenda of the General Assembly. On 27 August this year  the United Nations Council for Namibia convened a solemn meeting commemorating Namibia Day  the anniversary of the day on which the people of Namibia launched their armed struggle against the racist regime of Pretoria  which has continued to occupy their land in defiance of the numerous resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  and in defiance of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.27.	Efforts to arrive at an internationally acceptable solution in accordance with the principles set out in Security Council resolution 385 (1976) culminated in the adoption of resolution 435 (1978)  in which the Council approved a detailed plan for the transfer of power to the people of Namibia  with United Nations assistance. We are well aware that six years have since elapsed. The fact that Namibia continues to be denied a peaceful and speedy transition to majority rule is due entirely to the intransigence of the racist and expansionist regime of South Africa.28.	In the discharge of its mandate relating to the situation in Namibia  the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has repeatedly called for measures under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations in order to bring about South Africa's compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions. The adoption of a comprehensive programme of sanctions would signify to South Africa that the world community will no longer tolerate its tactics and manoeuvres.29.	In this case  decisive steps by the international community are long overdue  for what is at stake here is the ability of the United Nations to respond adequately to the needs of millions who are suffering under the oppression of a provocative colonial regime. The Government of the Republic of Suriname denounces the establishment of any linkage or parallel between Namibian independence an' extraneous and irrelevant issues.30.	On behalf of my delegation  I wish to express our full solidarity with the heroic people of Namibia and to appeal to the international community to support their just struggle against colonial occupation and the plunder of the uranium and other natural resources of their country and for the right to self- determination  freedom and independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the national liberation movement of Namibia  which is the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.31.	As regards the situation in South Africa  my delegation strongly condemns the South African racist regime for continued violence and repression against its black population and expresses its support for  and solidarity with  all those struggling for the elimination of apartheid and racial discrimination.32.	My Government rejects South Africa's new mystifying constitution and the sham elections held in connection with it. I also wish to reaffirm our support for  solidarity with and commitment to the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC]  the representative of the majority of the people of South Africa  in its valiant struggle to eradicate apartheid and bring freedom  justice and independence to the South African people.33.	My delegation cannot but express concern with regard to the situation in the Middle East  and it deplores the increasing tension in this region. The invasion and illegal occupation of southern Lebanon are the bitter fruits of a policy pursued by Israel to deny the Palestinian people their right to self-determination and to establish their own independent and sovereign State.34.	My delegation reaffirms its conviction that a just solution and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territories. It would like to emphasize that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese territory is a prerequisite for that country to regain its independence.35.	The expansion of the Iran-Iraq war during the past seven months into the Persian Gulf is an indication of a further deterioration of the relations between these two non-aligned brother nations. My delegation regrets to note that this conflict is causing serious human and material losses to the countries concerned while posing a serious threat to international peace and security.36.	In this context  we would like to recall the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes  which remains central to the philosophy of peaceful coexistence. For this reason  we reaffirm the necessity of an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries as a preliminary step towards the peaceful settlement of this tragic war  which deplorably has even involved the use of chemical weapons.37.	My delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General for the peace initiatives he has recently undertaken between the parties concerned.38.	Concerning the situation in the Korean peninsula  my delegation would like to reiterate its support for the desire of the Korean people to reunify their divided homeland peacefully through a dialogue between the North and the South without any foreign interference.39.	The Government of the Republic of Suriname also maintains its position with regard to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and Afghanistan in order to allow the people of those countries the opportunity to reach a political settlement and determine their own destiny.40.	In this connection  we hail the recent peace initiatives taken on Afghanistan by the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General at Geneva.41.	Each year we hear the pleas of the majority of States for general and complete disarmament in order to avoid the growing threat which the international arms build-up poses to mankind. Nevertheless  we notice a steady increase in global military spending  as no one appears to be able to control the nervous feeling that accompanies the impression of falling behind in this deadly arms race. Indeed  this is a dangerous development which not only consumes the scarce financial  human and material resources available  but will ultimately lead to the total destruction of our planet. My Government therefore continues to support all serious proposals for general and complete disarmament and  consequently  we call on all parties concerned to negotiate arms reduction as a matter of urgency.42.	It is gratifying to note that the economic situation in some developed countries has recently shown an upward trend. For the majority of countries  and certainly for the developing countries  however  the nightmare of the longest and deepest recession of the last 50 years continues unabated.43.	The causes of this persistent crisis are to be found in the very structure of international economic relations  which are still based on inequality and domination. If trade  not aid  was to alleviate our problems  we must sadly note that the present depressed markets for raw materials and goods produced in developing countries have not brought the necessary relief  owing to the steep fall in commodity prices and the sharp price increase of industrial products  while at the same time protectionist measures in various developed countries hamper our exports.44.	Meanwhile  the foreign debts of many of these countries have reached astronomical proportions. There have been many urgent  even desperate calls for reform. All to no avail. The situation has now reached crisis proportions  as evidenced by the social unrest and political turmoil which have recently erupted in many countries.45.	In order to deal effectively with this crisis  global and comprehensive approaches are required  reflecting the interdependence of developing and developed countries and the interrelated character of problems affecting the international economic system.46.	The global negotiations initiated at the thirty- fifth session of the General Assembly should be reviewed with an early solution to these problems in mind.47.	In this regard  my Government holds the view that South-South co-operation must be encouraged and promoted as a valuable mechanism for restructuring the economic system  while fostering sub regional  regional and interregional co-operation.48.	My delegation fervently hopes that the Caracas Programme of Action will still prove to be an important framework for creating instruments and developing necessary devices to strengthen this form of co-operation.49.	In our own region  constructive efforts have been made which in January of this year resulted in the adoption of the Quito Declaration and Plan of Action. In the opinion of my Government  the ideas elaborated and proposals put forward deserve the special attention of the industrialized countries  since they reflect the economic reality of Latin America and the Caribbean. In conformity with this Declaration  specific measures must be adopted to bring about transformation in the existing international financial and trade policies in order to enhance the accessibility of products from developing countries to the markers of the developed countries. This would relieve their debt burden and restore the financial flow for development.50.	The Committee for Development Planning could not have chosen a better title for the main section of its report  which reads ""Crisis or reform: breaking the barriers to development"". There are no alternatives. Reform in international economic relations  especially of the international monetary and financial system  is an absolute necessity. Once again  we appeal to the international community to examine the general demands for a policy change in this crisis situation  and we pledge our support for measures of high and immediate priority in the interest of global recovery.51.	My delegation is deeply concerned over the acute problem of drought in the sub-Saharan countries of Africa  where tens of millions of people are threatened by malnutrition  hunger and famine. The three-year drought  on top of the international recession  has severely affected those countries.52.	We attach great importance to and fully endorse the special action programme for Africa  which should be an impetus to the joint efforts of the international community to provide assistance.53.	As a signatory State to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Suriname became a member of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. We are therefore committed to the completion of their task. In our view  the decisions adopted at the first session of the Preparatory Commission in 1983 met the standards of equal and equitable international cooperation in the exploitation of the mineral resources of the international sea-bed area.54.	The Government of Suriname regrets that these positive results of the Commission's work are being hampered by the activities of some major industrialized countries. They have initiated negotiations between various consortia in their respective countries and are preparing bilateral or plurilateral agreements outside the scope of the Convention  thus undermining the work of the International Sea-Bed Authority. Because of these activities  the Preparatory Commission was unable to complete its task during its second session  held this year  in particular with regard to the question whether or not the Preparatory Commission should also act as a dispute-settlement authority. We condemn these activities. The resources of the sea-bed must be developed in an orderly manner for the benefit of mankind and must contribute to a more equitable and fair global economic system. We therefore reject any separate agreements in which the major industrialized countries would share the sea-bed among themselves  and we urgently appeal to all industrialized States  whether or not they have signed the Convention  to refrain from undertaking any activities outside the scope of the Convention  as we consider the sea-bed mining legislation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea a major breakthrough in the global economic stalemate between the developed and the developing countries.55.	My Government wishes to express its satisfaction with the Economic Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  in which it was emphasized that Antarctica had considerable environmental  climatic  scientific and potential economic significance to the world. It was also stated that exploration of the area and exploitation of its resources should be carried out for the benefit of mankind and in a manner consistent with the protection of the environment of Antarctica. For these reasons  my Government deems the establishment of a new regime for the continent of Antarctica necessary in order to enable all States Members of the United Nations to benefit from its resources. Both reason and justice would be well served if the principles of ""common heritage"" and ""common benefit""  enunciated in the United Nations treaties on outer space and in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  were to find application in a new regime for Antarctica.56.	The United Nations was conceived in a spirit of good will and optimism. The global problems which have accumulated for almost 40 years and threaten to undermine our world community have been described eloquently and accurately on innumerable occasions. The Organization has  with resounding rhetoric  depicted and condemned racism  the arms race between the super-Powers  the plight of the needy  exploited and oppressed of the earth  the armed conflicts between brother nations  the disrespect for national sovereignty  the violations of territorial integrity  the debt crisis and the disturbing imbalance of economic relations. However  we have to note with sadness that the rhetoric used in this forum often seems to replace rather than generate the effective measures called for. My delegation therefore hopes that the United Nations will soon take more concrete steps that may be recognized throughout the world as recordable successes  in keeping with its noble principles."
"129",6530,"SWE",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like first of all to congratulate Mr. Paul Lusaka  of Zambia  on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I also wish to take this opportunity of warmly welcoming Brunei Darussalam as a new Member of the United Nations and to extend to it my country's sincere wishes for a peaceful and prosperous future.278.	Among the items raised at the first session of the General Assembly in 1946 were two issues that merit our special attention today. One was the elimination of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The other was South Africa's claims to what was then known as South West Africa  that is  Namibia. Now  when we are approaching the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  these issues are still with us. On the agenda of the General Assembly we find the questions of the accelerating nuclear arms race and the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. These sad facts should be a cause for deep reflection.279.	There has been no improvement in the international situation over the past year. Relations between the superpowers are marked by deep distrust and there has been little dialogue between them. At the same time  the economic gap between industrialized and developing countries is growing. The debt crisis continues to be a serious development problem. No region can escape being affected by the tensions created by this negative climate.280.	For almost a year  no negotiations have been going on with regard to the reduction of nuclear weapons. Despite the insights presented by scientists about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war  as a result not only of the immediate destruction but also of the nuclear winter  both superpowers are investing in more and more advanced systems. Warning times become shorter and the risks of a conflict breaking out by accident are increasing.281.	The current climate of confrontation must be replaced by increased dialogue. This dialogue should embrace both the armaments situation and the many regional conflicts which  under the influence of the great Power rivalry  tend to become increasingly difficult to solve.282.	It is a deeply regrettable fact that almost 40 years after the founding of the United Nations we are still far from living up to the basic principles laid down in the Charter of the Organization. The United Nations has all too frequently had to play the part of a passive onlooker. Its interventions m conflicts  when at all possible  have often come late and have been directed towards the external symptoms of the conflicts rather than their causes.283.	In spite of their obligations under the Charter  States still to a great extent resort to force to resolve problems. The international community has been unable to rid itself of the scourge that the violations of human rights constitute. The programmes of the United Nations for the promotion of economic and social development have not been assured sufficient resources.284. The authority of the United Nations can be maintained only if Member States fulfil the obligations they have assumed under the Charter. The basic provisions of the Charter are and must remain the foremost principles of the international community. They must be our common guidelines for peaceful relations and cooperation between States. Disputes must be solved by peaceful means. The threat or use of force must not be tolerated. States must respect each other's territorial integrity and political independence. They must recognize each other's right to security. Every State chooses  in its own way  how to achieve security  but this must not be done at the expense of another State. At a time of increased interdependence  security must ultimately be ensured in common.283. In no circumstances can violations of the fundamental principles of the Charter be tolerated. No country should have to be subjected to such acts. In pursuing its traditional policy of neutrality  Sweden has upheld and is determined to uphold its territorial integrity and national sovereignty. Only by respecting the fundamental rules of international law and through international cooperation can a lasting peace be ensured. A special responsibility rests on the permanent members of the Security Council. If they themselves  in contravention of international law  disregard the principles of the Charter  a dangerous breeding ground is created for international anarchy.286.	For Sweden  membership of the United Nations and the obligations this involves remain a comer stone of our foreign policy. For the Swedish Government  it is of the greatest importance that the United Nations be given the opportunity to fulfil as intended its primary purposeâthe maintenance of international peace and security.287.	The debate ensuing from the Secretary Generalâs clear-sighted analyses during the past two years has resulted in a number of practical suggestions to strengthen the United Nations. Last year  the Nordic countries made a concrete contribution to this discussion in a joint report to the Secretary General.288.	The Security Council should find working methods to make it easier to deal with conflicts at an early stage and to prevent the resort to violence. With this objective in view  there is room for improving the cooperation between the Council and the Secretary General. Better methods must be found to ensure that the Council's decisions are implemented. The Council should consider meeting at ministerial level on some occasion in order to consider the dangers threatening peace and to discuss methods of containing them at an early stage.289.	The principle of collective responsibility for the financing of the expenditures of the Organization  including all peacekeeping operations  must be upheld.290.	As Member States  we must all be responsible for ensuring that we utilize the Organization in the proper manner. In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary General draws our attention to several tendencies with respect to working methods and resolutions which are contrary to this aim.291.	It is of vital importance that the universal character of the United Nations be maintained. Differences of opinion will not be brought any closer to a solution if States are excluded from the Organization. 292.	It is also important that States do not turn away from the work of the United Nations but instead participate in efforts to carry out from within the reforms of the United Nations system that may be called for.293.	The United Nations offers a well formulated code of conduct  well tested negotiation machinery and an indispensable meeting place.294.	The concern of peoples and Governments at the accelerating arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race between two superpowers  is reflected in the widening involvement of the United Nations in the area of disarmament. Initiatives  proposals and recommendations for confidence-building measures in the military field  arms control and disarmament have increased in number. Studies are carried out on questions of fundamental importance for the disarmament efforts. The nonnuclear weapon Statesâ that is  the great majority of the United Nations Member Statesâtry in different ways to find methods to break the deadlock in negotiations between the two major nuclear weapon States and to halt the arms race. Sweden continues to attach great importance to this work within the United Nations and at the Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva.295.	On 22 May of this year  six Presidents and Prime Ministers from five continents  including the Prime Minister of Sweden  made an appeal for the nuclear arms race to be stopped. They urged the nuclear weapon States to proclaim a nuclear arms freeze. Also  a broad section of public opinion in many countries increasingly demands of the nuclear weapon States a nuclear arms freeze. This is reflected in the work of the United Nations by the resolution on a nuclear arms freeze initiated by Mexico and Sweden in 1982 and approved by the General Assembly by an overwhelming majority [resolution 37/100 B]296.	However  it has been possible to implement United Nations disarmament resolutions to a limited extent only. This cannot fail to weaken the authority of the United Nations. A great responsibility for this situation rests on the two leading nuclear weapon States.297.	Those with the power to decide on the use of nuclear weapons are not only gambling with the survival of their own countries but also putting our lives in jeopardy. For this reason  we who do not possess nuclear weapons must do our utmost to assert our interests and to persuade the nuclear weapon States to realize that they also have a responsibility to us.298.	Today  less than one year before the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  there are no ongoing negotiations  either bilateral or multilateral  on nuclear disarmament. At the Conference on Disarmament  meeting at Geneva  it has proved impossible even to establish a committee on the question of a nuclear weapon test ban. This failure of the nuclear weapon States to fulfil their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons gives rise to serious misgivings for the future of that Treaty. Against this background  it is of particular importance that a comprehensive test ban treaty be negotiated and that negotiations in the nuclear arms field are resumed.299.	A decision to observe a moratorium on the deployment of additional nuclear weapons would be a valuable contribution in this connection. It is also urgently necessary to initiate multilateral negotiations in order to prevent an arms race in outer space. The major space Powers can lay the foundation for progress on this question bilaterally.300.	In our work at the United Nations  at a time marked by tension and mistrust between the two superpowers  we must seek practical ways to contribute to building up the minimum of mutual confidence required for progress in the field of disarmament. Progress in the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament indicates that this is not impossible.301.	Since the beginning of 1984  Stockholm has hosted the Conference on Confidence and Security building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. It is a positive and significant fact that practically all the States in Europe  as well as the United States and Canada  are now negotiating confidence and security building measures to promote detente in Europe and prepare the ground for negotiations on disarmament.302.	Respect for human rights must be an indivisible part of the international legal system and of the work for peace. Violations of human rights are not the internal affairs of individual countries and must be condemned wherever they may occur. An alarming discrepancy remains between the real situation in many parts of the world and the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights. Sweden welcomes the increasing attention now being paid to this serious problem by the United Nations. We appreciate the involvement of the secretary General and support his efforts.303.	An important step forward is that a draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment^ has been submitted to the General Assembly for consideration at this session. Reliable information indicates that this shocking violation of the integrity of the individual is being committed systematically in a large number of United Nations Member States. In the view of the Swedish Government  it is of great importance that the Assembly accord this draft the highest priority. We hope that it can be adopted  if possible this year  in such a form that its implementation can be monitored in an effective way.304.	The urgent question of abolishing the death penalty is now being dealt with by the Commission on Human Rights. It is the Swedish Government's hope that the work can be carried out with the greatest dispatch.305.	Outside the United Nations system as well  significant work is being carried out for the promotion of human rights. It is of great importance that the commitments in this field which were made in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  should be given substantive content.306.	We share the Secretary Generalâs view that increased and better coordinated multilateral efforts are required to deal with the serious drug problem.307.	We must also strengthen the role of the United Nations in the management of the earth's common resources. Ever since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment took place at Stockholm 12 years ago  we have gradually realized that it is a matter of survival for the human race to find international solutions to the central problems of the environment. However  at the international level this realization has so far led to rhetoric rather than to concrete action. It is our hope that the World Commission on Environment and Development  recently established by the United Nations and chaired by Mrs. Brundtland  of Norway  will prove successful and strengthen the work of UNEP.308.	The United Nations has a particular responsibility to contribute to a settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. T le absence of positive steps in a peace process is disturbing.309.	The parties concerned must meet in direct negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Also the PLO must take part in these negotiations on an equal basis. A peace settlement must meet the legitimate demands of the Palestinian people for self-determination  including the right to establish a State of their own in the West Bank and Gaza. The same applies to Israel's right to exist in peace within secure and recognized borders. A possible way to speed up a settlement of the question would be to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  as proposed by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. Israel's policy of establishing illegal settlements in the occupied territories must cease; it constitutes a serious impediment to a solution of the conflict.310.	The Israeli occupation forces must leave Lebanon without delay. The Swedish Government supports the Lebanese Government in its efforts to create peace for the Lebanese people and restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.311.	The Iran Iraq conflict has now entered its fifth year. My Government expresses its appreciation of the Secretary Generalâs initiative with a view to terminating attacks on civilian population centres and the use of chemical weapons in the war. The effect of the war with regard to free shipping in the region is also a source of concern. It is the earnest desire of the Swedish Government that it will be possible to bring this tragic conflict to an early end by peaceful means.312.	As was noted at the meeting at Stockholm in June of this year between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Nordic countries and of the frontline States in southern Africa  the apartheid policy remains unchanged. South Africa continues its endeavours to weaken and dominate the neighbouring States in order to maintain and strengthen the system. In its indiscriminate killings and its imprisonment of members of the political opposition  in particular the United Democratic Front  the regime has shown its true face.313.	Against this background  we must againâand with renewed vigourâurge the Security Council to decide upon binding economic sanctions against South Africa.314.	Six years after adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978)  the United Nations plan for Namibia remains unimplemented  as a result of continued delaying tactics on the part of South Africa. We find this unacceptable. Extraneous issues  such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola  must not be used as an excuse to obstruct Namibia's independence. The Security Council should now enforce its plan for Namibia and finally bring about a solution to this question.315.	The Soviet troops still remain in Afghanistan. In violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law  the people of Afghanistan are still denied the right to independence and the opportunity to determine their own future. A similar situation exists in Kampuchea  where the Vietnamese occupation continues. Although the years pass  we must not accept these conditions. We support the efforts to resolve the conflicts. The foreign occupation troops must be withdrawn. The suffering of the civilian populations in both countries must be brought to an end.316.	The situation in Central America is still tense. The conflicts in the region have their origin in economic and social injustice. Sweden fully supports the efforts initiated by the Contadora Group to prevent further spreading of the conflicts and to find peaceful solutions. Only through respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the countries in the region can foundations be laid for political solutions and the danger to international peace and security be eliminated. Progress in the entire region towards democracy and respect for human rights is of decisive importance. The peoples of Central America must be given a chance to build up their societies in peace and freedom without external intervention. The United States has a great and undeniable influence in the region. The Swedish Government is of the view that the United States should act with restraint and use its influence to promote negotiations.317.	The people of Chile are still deprived of their civil rights and liberties. The United Nations must untiringly continue to press its demands for the restoration of democracy and respect for human rights in Chile.318.	My earlier remarks on the importance of strengthening the United Nations also apply to a very high degree to international economic cooperation and to North South relations. We must seize every opportunity to strengthen the multilateral dialogue in the economic field.319.	Unfortunately  the discussions in the United Nations on the problems of development have made practically progress lately. The International Conference on Population  held at Mexico City from 6 to 14 August 1984  constitutes a noteworthy exception. It is our hope that it will lead to concrete results.320.	If the recovery of the world economy is to be sustained  the developing countries must become more actively involved in the process. Among other things  this requires increased access for those countries to the markets of the industrialized countries. This is necessary  not least in order to cope with the debt problems. At present  the developing countries make interest payments at the rate of approximately $60 billion a year to the industrialized countries. They receive only approximately $30 billion in grants from the industrialized world.321.	In spite of the economic upturn  however  protectionist tendencies appear to be on the increase. This development must be countered. All countries should work to strengthen and expand free trade. A new round of multilateral trade negotiations  carefully prepared  can contribute to that end. It is also extremely important that the decisions taken at the Sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  be followed up.322.	The developing countries' own struggle against economic and social crises must be supported by increased aid  not least through multilateral channels. UNDP must be strengthened  and the coordination between the various aid organizations within the United Nations system must be improved. The largest multilateral development body  IDA  whose undisputed competence has been of decisive importance to the poorest countries  must be ensured sufficient resources. We therefore regret that some of the largest donor countries have not shown willingness to contribute to the reinforcement of IDA.323.	The critical situation in sub-Saharan Africa  which is characterized by drought and starvation  must be met with prompt and decisive action. Meanwhile  it is encouraging that the African States themselves are attempting to reverse the development through regional cooperation. Sweden has supported  and intends in the future to increase its support for cooperation within the Southern African Development Coordination Conference.324.	UNICEF's work for the survival of children is also of the greatest significance we welcome the Fund's initiative in taking up the question of support for children in especially difficult circumstances  such as children living in situations of war. In this connection  attention should also be drawn to the draft convention on the rights of the child  which is under consideration in the Commission on Human Rights.325.	The countries of the world need the United Nations. We need the United Nations in order to eliminate the risk of armed conflicts and to achieve international disarmament.326.	We need the United Nations in order to be able to deal with the pressing common problems of environment and resources  which no one country can tackle alone.327.	We need the United Nations in order to follow through our efforts to improve the economic and social conditions of the third world.328.	The United Nations must not be allowed to degenerate into a forum for confrontation. The United Nations must be a forum for constructive deliberation and cooperation."
"130",6568,"SWZ",39,1984,"ï»¿1.	It is with pride and a sense of profound gratitude  Sir  that I have the honour  on behalf of the delegation of Swaziland  to address the Assembly during the presidency of a man who not only hails from our part of the world but is a true son of Africa. Your beloved country  Zambia  and the Kingdom of Swaziland share the best of relations in harmony with our common historic and cultural heritage. As Members of the United Nations  members of the OAU  of the Commonwealth and of non-aligned organizations  our sister nation States continue to share identical views and aspirations in the international arena. We are both founding member nations of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference  a united group of southern African States that seek to widen the scope of their economic development.2.	Congratulations  Sir. Your election to the high post of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly is clear testimony to your outstanding ability  pleasant personality and diplomatic skills. The delegation of Swaziland is convinced that under your stewardship the proceedings of the General Assembly will be conducted in a constructive manner  and wishes to assure you of its wholehearted co-operation.3.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express our warm appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who presided over the deliberations of the thirty-eighth session with skill and competence.4.	Let me also convey my delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General and the entire staff of the United Nations for the excellent work they continue to render the international community through the United Nations system in the maintenance of global peace and security.5.	My delegation is pleased to welcome into this great family of nations the newly independent State of Brunei Darussalam. We look forward to its contributing to the success of the Organization.6.	Today we live in an unstable world  a world threatened by all kinds of conflicts  whether interstate or global. It is therefore incumbent upon us as Member States of the United Nations to uphold the Charter and to implement its provisions with utmost care. Peace and security seem to be illusive nowadays. Many nations tend to be indifferent to General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Should such a trend persist  the world will soon find itself in Armageddon  and peaceful co-existence and good- neighbourliness will be things of the past.7.	The world is in dire need of complete disarmament. The accumulation of dangerous weapons for mass destruction by both large and small nations threatens the very existence of humanity. While many people are concerned more about a ""nuclear holocaust of some sort  let us remember that many of the wars fought in the past  and those that are being waged today  have resulted in the loss of millions of lives by the use of conventional weapons.8.	It is common to hear complaints about the inability of the United Nations to deal with armed conflicts around the world. Indeed  such criticism is disquieting  and it is the duty of all Member States of this Organization to abide by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and to implement the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions without fail. The United Nations is not a world parliament. It does not enact laws but recommends appropriate action by means of resolutions. Thus  peace and security can be upheld only if Member States respect such recommendations.9.	Over the years  we have witnessed gross violations of the Charter  particularly of Article 2  paragraph 4. Interference in the internal affairs of others runs counter to civilized conduct and is a direct cause of tension around the world. My delegation hopes that those nations that have fallen into the temptation of not respecting the Charter will reconsider  for the sake of international peace and security.10.	Article 1  paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations states:""To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character  and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion"".11.	Respect for human rights is of cardinal importance in the world. It is unfortunate that we still learn of torture  disappearances and wanton killings in some parts of the world. The international community has a fundamental duty to encourage respect for human rights and freedoms. Practices such as racism and racial discrimination  apartheid  exploitation of child labour and the like are all violations of human rights which are to be condemned and discouraged.12.	Efforts to restructure the international economic order continue to be thwarted by theories tending to favour the haves and not the have-nots. Many of the industrialized countries continue to hide behind economic theories and monetary policies which place very little or no value on the lives of other people.13.	My delegation views with intense shock the fact that in our present world many millions of people in Asia  Africa and Latin America continue to live in abject poverty  with unemployment and mass starvation. The problem of economic subservience is not the only humiliating constraint which faces the developing nations.14.	As a member of the OAU and of the United Nations  my delegation strongly believes that the harmonious development of the African continent and its bargaining power would be greatly enhanced by closer economic co-operation and development between African States and the rest of the third world countries  particularly in the fields of trade  industry  agriculture and natural resources. My country therefore welcomed the Treaty establishing the Preferential Trade Area for eastern and southern African countries  negotiated under the auspices of ECA.15.	Allow my delegation to place on record the mention of one of our vital contemporary economic institutions in Africa  the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference. The international community should not lose sight of its importance. It is an expression  in practical terms  of the political will of the Governments and peoples of the nine member States to improve their development and eventually assert their economic independence. It is through the Conference that we shall be able to dictate the course of our socio-economic development on the basis of the profound knowledge of our needs and actual conditions and inspired by our own ethics of development.16.	It may well be said that over the past three years our country has suffered the worst economic set-backs in history as a result of the years of severe drought and a catastrophic cyclone  Domoina  evidence of which is well documented in a recent United Nations study dated 17 August 1984. In that report  the Secretary-General observed that:""The total losses to the Swazi economy represent an amount equivalent to 45 per cent of total annual government expenditure or 12 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. This is a major set-back to Swaziland after many years of substantial developmental progress and represents a burden that in proportional terms would jeopardize the growth of even the most developed country.""17.	These two calamities left an indelible mark of devastation on our fragile economy  to say nothing of all the great works of post-independence Swaziland that were completely washed away in less than three days of heavy rainfallâour modern  technologically constructed roads and bridges  houses  schools  offices and intensive agriculture networks  and to say nothing of the loss of precious human lives and of livestock. Economic experts have also stated that over $100 million will be needed for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of our roads and bridges that were badly damaged by cyclone Domoina.18.	On the other hand  the disastrous situation of my country's economy was compounded when Swaziland was inundated with an unprecedented influx of refugees early this year. It is a fact that maintenance of the refugees places a heavy burden on the country's resources  already exhausted by years of severe drought and by cyclone Domoina.19.	However  these multiple problems have not deterred the Kingdom of Swaziland from honouring its international obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  for we are still committed to offering all possible humanitarian assistance to all genuine refugees. We are also grateful to the United Nations and other organs that continue rendering assistance to the fragile economy of Swaziland.20.	It is now a known fact that it was not only Swaziland that sustained drought conditions recently  but 23 countries of Africa. This has led to acute shortages of food and medicines  which have resulted in the deaths of millions of people  more especially children and the elderly. A good number of countries have come to the aid of Africa  and we thank them for their efforts. However  the problem is far from being solved. My delegation urges those that have food and money to lend a helping hand. The countries affected are trying their best to improve their economies  difficult as that is. As time goes on  we hope to be in a position to stand on our own feet and to feed our people.21.	Permit my delegation to reaffirm my Government's policy  the modern foundations of which were laid down by our late beloved King Sobhuza II. Our policy is based on concrete factors of pragmatism rather than narrow political and ideological expediency. The Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland remains committed to the sacred principles enshrined in the charter of the OAU and the Charter of the United Nations respected by the non-aligned countries  particularly the principles concerning the self-determination and independence of peoples under colonial rule and all other forms of oppression. We wish to reiterate Swaziland's commitment to the settlement of disputes by peaceful negotiation and non-use of force as wisely advocated by our late King. Thus  we salute the salient features of Chapter VI  in particular Article 33  of the Charter of the United Nations which advocate the pacific settlement of disputes.22.	Therefore  my Government is inspired by the noble principles of peace  democracy  freedom and justice. It is my Government's objective to enhance the economic and social welfare of our people  in unity  freedom and love for one another. Our people are resolved to ensure that our generation enjoys the fruits of peace  unity and stability while respecting the dignity and freedom of the individual.23.	My delegation wishes to state that  as a peace- loving nation  the Kingdom of Swaziland is greatly perturbed by the major conflicts that characterize the contemporary international political scene.24.	My country views with great alarm the continued conflicts in the Middle East. We recognize the difficulties in attaining international peace and security  and wish to appeal to the conflicting parties to exercise both moral and political constraint.25.	My delegation is very much concerned about Lebanon. We commend the people of Lebanon for their untiring efforts towards the continuation of their socio-economic and political development. My delegation remains firmly convinced that peace in Lebanon can be brought about only through the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory. Only then will the Lebanese be in control of their own destiny.26.	The ongoing war in the Persian Gulf is also a cause of great concern to the international community. My delegation humbly urges Iran and Iraq to exercise moral restraint and resolve their differences through peaceful contacts. My country calls upon Member States of that region to adhere to Article 2  paragraph 3  of the Charter of the United Nations  in order to safeguard international peace  security and justice.27.	In pursuance of world peace and security  it is important that we refer to the sensitive political situation that continues to divide North and South Korea. My delegation submits that the reunification of Korea is a matter to be decided by the Koreans themselves  in direct inter-Korean negotiations. It remains for the United Nations to continue to encourage the resumption of those talks without preconditions or external interference.28.	With regard to the conflicts in South-East Asia and South-West Asia  the Kingdom of Swaziland firmly supports the urgent call for all States concerned to exercise both political and moral restraint to avoid any further endangerment of peace and security in that troubled region. We call for respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity and for non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Above all  we are convinced of the urgent need to bring about a relaxation of tensions through a solution providing for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that region.29.	My delegation fully shares the grave concern over the unresolved problems and continuing conflicts in Latin America and the Caribbean. Further  we make an appeal to the parties involved to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Above all  it should be clearly noted that history shows that violence  apart from being a true exercise in self-destruction  has never profited anybody. We welcome the efforts of the Contadora Group in seeking a permanent solution to these problems.30.	The situation prevailing in Africa  particularly in those areas which are of major concern to the OAU  continues to disturb us profoundly. My Government is deeply perturbed by the conflicts in Chad and Western Sahara. We share the agony of our brothers and sisters who continue to suffer the terrible scourge of the bitter conflict. Above all  the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to commend the good efforts of the OAU and the international community in their endeavours to find a genuine and permanent solution. We also wish to add our voice to those that have requested all the conflicting parties to exercise both moral and political restraint  for violence has never served as a basis for the peace and security of nations.31.	Regarding the thorny problem of the serious contention prevailing in southern Africa  my delegation wishes to reaffirm its known policy based on the Kingdom of Swaziland's commitment to the noble principles and objectives of self-determination  national independence and majority rule for all peoples.32.	My delegation wishes to thank and congratulate the Secretary-General  the front-line States and all ethers concerned for their relentless efforts in seeking a peaceful solution of the Namibian question. We stand committed to urgent implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the independence of Namibia.33.	The position of my country regarding the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa remains unchanged. My delegation has stated our stand in previous years  and we continue to reiterate our Government's position that the Kingdom of Swaziland is unswervingly committed to the noble principles of non-racial democracy  non-alignment and complete respect for human dignity  justice and peaceful coexistence with all.34.	Once again  it is my country's humble submission to the Assembly that the problem in South Africa can be solved only if all concerned  irrespective of the colour of their skins  their creeds or their ideological affiliations  will come to the negotiating table. Indeed  my country has deep-rooted faith in and commitment to the mission of peace  and adheres firmly to Article 1  paragraphs 2 and 3  of the Charter of the United Nations.35.	We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the international community  the concern they show with regard to the problems of southern Africa and their clear understanding of the major handicaps facing the independent States which are neighbours of South Africa.36.	The Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the expression of the need to relax the tension between the two super-Powers and we support the call to resume these vital negotiations.37.	In conclusion  my delegation wishes to reaffirm the Kingdom of Swaziland's trust and uncompromising faith in the United Nations. It is our sincerest belief that the United Nations remains the only apposite and appropriate international forum for finding solutions to major problems that beset contemporary international relations. It is therefore incumbent upon all of us as Member States to renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
"131",6643,"SYR",39,1984,"ï»¿I take pleasure in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  to which the world looks with considerable anticipation and attention. We are all the more pleased in that you represent a country that is linked to mine  Syria  by a common struggle against two racist regimes and against all forms of racial discrimination and colonialism  both old and new. Your election to this high office is recognition by the world community of the important and unique status enjoyed by the African continent in general and by your country  Zambia  in particular in contemporary international life.81.	At the same time  we wish to salute Mr. Jorge Illueca  the President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  who conducted our work with wisdom  dynamism and ability. We congratulate him on the achievements recorded under his presidency.82.	We commend the wisdom and effectiveness of the Secretary-General and his firm interest in the cause of peace and justice. We wish to reaffirm our full confidence in him and pledge our continued sincere readiness to co-operate with him in his brave efforts aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of the United Nations role in international contemporary relations and in solving international conflicts.83.	We wish warmly to congratulate Brunei Darussalam on its independence and its admission to membership of the United Nations.84.	The General Assembly is holding its thirty- ninth session in complicated and difficult international circumstances. The international situation continues to deteriorate. Political  economic and social tensions in the world are being aggravated as a result of the disequilibrium in international relations  the widening gap between the industrialized and developing nations  the alarming escalation of the arms race and the increasing tension in various parts of the world. All these developments make it essential for us to examine seriously and responsibly the various problems from which the peoples of the world are suffering  as well as the causes of the dangerous international tension  and to seek appropriate solutions thereto within the framework of the United Nations and in accordance with the principles and purposes of its Charter. All the countries of the world are aware of the difficulties facing the Organization and preventing it from assuming its basic role in the various fields of international relations. We all know the sources  causes and results of those difficulties. The enhancement of the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security is an indispensable factor in building an international community in which justice and peace prevail and which is free from the evils of colonialism and from all forms of racism  aggression and hegemony.85.	While the world is afflicted by many hotbeds of tension and confrontation  the Middle East region remains the most dangerous and most explosive  the most threatening to international peace and security. It is no secret that this region  by virtue of its vital strategic location  its vast economic potential and its ancient spiritual and cultural heritage  is one of the most sensitive and complex regions of the world. It lies at the heart of the ancient world  at the point of contact between the Orient and the Occident. It overlooks the three most important waterways of the world: the Mediterranean Sea  the Gulf and the Red Sea. Its reserves of energy exceed those of the rest of the world by more than half. In addition  the area is the cradle of the three monotheist religions.86.	Throughout the phases of its long history  this region has witnessed various waves of invaders and conquerors. Until recent times  it was a base for colonialists  and most recently  part of its territory  namely Palestine  has become a foothold for racist settlers.87.	This region is regarded today more than ever as a unique strategic target by the forces of imperialism and world monopolies; in order to reach and dominate it  the most modem types of warships  aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons are being amassed. It is clear that these brute forces have not heeded the lessons of ancient and recent history. They are trying to repeat the same historical mistakes as their old and new colonialist predecessors  for which they paid a very dear price  indeed.88.	It is reprehensible to see a racist colonialist spirit reappearing in our era  the era of decolonization  in an attempt to forge the history of the region  focusing on the marginal and non-essential issues  while obscuring all things constant and essential. The aim is to cast doubt on the history of this region  to dismember its national structure and to obliterate its true identity in order to facilitate the fulfilment of two extremely dangerous objectives: first  the consolidation and legitimization of the interests of imperialism in the Arab regionâthis is what world imperialism is seeking to achieve; and secondly  the uprooting of the Arabs and their replacement by settlersâthis is the quintessence of the Zionist movement  which utilizes both the Torah and the Nazi doctrine of security. It is evident that these two objectives move in full co-ordination at all times irrespective of who leads the imperialist forces and the Zionist movement.89.	An in-depth review of the main events of the region and the concurrent Israeli aggressions backed by the forces of imperialism in 1956  1967 and 1982 confirms these facts. It also confirms that the imperialists and the racist Zionists would take account of everything except the rights of the peoples of the region and their national interests. They attempt to exploit everything available in this region: human beings  lands  oil  history and even religion for the sake of fulfilling their colonialist objectives. They do not hesitate to declare publicly that they have vital interests in our region which they cannot give up even if this were to lead to a nuclear confrontation. They act in our region as if our interests are less important than theirs. They demand that we make peace with our enemies at any cost because they are their allies  and that we antagonize our friends unjustifiably because they are their enemies. They consider our defensive weapons as offensive ones. They regard our territorial waters as international waters. They view our resistance to occupation as terrorism. They collude with some Arab leaders in order to undermine the unity of the Arab ranks and to make them shirk their commitments. Then they pretend to be worried over the present divisions within the Arab fold  and they appeal to us to close ranks  but only under the Israeli umbrella.90.	This is the substance of the plan of the Camp David agreements and this is the quintessence of the Israeli concept of security to which the United States totally adheres. This is the core of the strategic alliance between the United States and Israel.91.	There is countless proof of what I have said. The United Nations  which  since its inception  has been witness to the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question  and which has adopted hundreds of resolutions to deal with these questions  is fully cognizant of the party that is mainly responsible for the non-implementation of these resolutions  and those who hinder the achievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region based on Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to repatriation  self-determination and the creation of an independent state on their native soil in Palestine  under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative.92.	The rejection by Israel and the United States of the call for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East within the framework of the United Nations  and the recent use by the United States of its veto against a draft resolution in the Security Council' condemning the Israeli practices in southern Lebanon are but new proof of their wish to abolish the role of the United Nations and of their contempt for the will of the international community.93.	The inability of the United Nations  more particularly the Security Council  to curb Israel's expansion and to bring about peace in the Middle East cannot be attributed to any shortcoming in the Charter of the United Nations or to a weakness in its provisions. On the contrary  the Charter provides for the imposition of sanctions against the aggressor State  including the formation of armed forces from all or most of the countries of the world in order to suppress the aggressor by force and end the aggression. However  the United States  which  under the Charter  has particular responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security  as a permanent member of the Security Council  prevents the United Nations from assuming its role in this regard. It obstructs the Charter and prevents justice from prevailing by using its veto whenever the matter is related to Israel's aggressions and violations  to the extent that it has become evident to the international community that the United States power of veto has been mortgaged to Israel in all that concerns United States policy in the Middle East. In other words  Israel is the only country in the world that enjoys a special immunity.94.	United States support to Israel is not limited to that dangerous political weapon; it goes further and arms Israel with the most advanced types of weapons  thus transforming Israel's arsenal into the fifth most modem in the world. The United States is not content with the limitless political and military aid it extends to Israel  but provides it also with economic and financial assistance amounting to more than $3 billion a yearâin other words  at a rate of $ 1 000 per Israeli per year  an amount which exceeds the average per capita income in more than 100 of the world's countries.95.	There is no need for further proof of the responsibility of the United States for Israel's acts of aggression  or its violations of the principles and norms of international law  for its contempt for the Charter of the United Nations  and for its pursuit of policies of expansionism  racism  occupation  injustice  terrorism  Judaization  colonization  expulsion and annexation.96.	In the face of all these facts and figures  the United States still talks about its eagerness to bring about peace in the Middle East. In this context  we cannot but pose a number of questions.97.	Does the United States  by supplying Israel with all these advanced weapons  help Israel to accept peace  or is the opposite true?98.	Does the United States  by rescuing the Israeli economy and by providing' Israel with massive financial aid after each of its acts of aggression  encourage Israel to seek peace or to persist in its occupation and colonization and to perpetrate further aggression?99.	Does the United States  by mortgaging its veto to the Israelis  enhance Israel's confidence in peace or its confidence in its ability to wage war and carry out aggression with impunity?100.	Do the attempts to humiliate the Arabs  to belittle their intelligence  to deny their rights and to disregard their national interests help to build good United States-Arab relations  or is the opposite true?101.	Would the Suez Canal have been closed to international navigation for several years and would the price of oil have soared as it has if it had not been for Israeli occupation and expansion?102.	Finally  does the direct military involvement of the United States on Israel's side  which endangers the lives of hundreds of Americans  serve the cause of peace in the region?103.	United States insistence on settling the Middle East problem and the Palestine question on the basis of the Camp David agreements or through partial and separate solutions has heightened tension in the region and multiplied the explosive factors. It has enabled Israel to intensify its installation of settlements in the occupied Arab territories and to strike out in every direction. Thus  Israel annexed Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  and it invaded Lebanon and continues to occupy important parts of it. We know that the United States is a super-Power that can threaten  strike at  destroy and wipe out thousands  even millions  of people. But we also know that it can never conquer the will of peoples.104.	The Syrian Arab Republic  on the other hand  reaffirms that a just peace in the Middle East must be based on the provisions of the Charter and of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Accordingly  we have supported the call to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East and welcomed the proposals by the Soviet Union on a Middle East settlement  of 29 July 1984.105.	The world still remembers the tragedies and horrors of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. We do not wish to describe again the crimes and atrocities committed in Lebanon by Israel  with United States support. Suffice it to say that the abrogation of the accord imposed on Lebanon by the United States and Israel  and aimed at turning Lebanon into an Israeli protectorate  represents a significant turning-point and a victory of the will of the oppressed peoples and the determination of the international community  which condemned the Israeli invasion  its barbarity and its evil objectives.106.	Since the abrogation of that sinister accord  the guns have been silent in most of Lebanon. National dialogue has started among the conflicting Lebanese factions for the first time in 10 years. A Government of National Unity has been formed. Political and social tensions have subsided. Barricades between East and West Beirut have been dismantled. Tripoli  in the north  has resumed normal life. Agreement has been reached on security plans and political reforms that would bring about security in the remaining parts of Lebanon and guarantee political participation to all Lebanese factions without exception.107.	However  it is worrying indeed to witness the continuing Israeli occupation of many parts of Lebanon and Israel's oppressive and brutal practices against the civilian population. None the less  Lebanese national resistance  which rose from the rubble of the Israeli invasion  will not subside until the whole of Lebanon is freed from Israeli occupation.108.	No words can express the Syrian position better than those spoken by President Hafez Al Assad at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983âa time when Syria was in the midst of one of the most difficult situations as a result of the Israeli invasion:""Israel and the United States are chasing a mirage. The aspirations  homeland and just rights of peoples cannot be buried through the use of guns.""The Palestinian people will remain strong and will continue to defend its rights. The cause of Palestine will remain our own cause  which we shall honourably defend and which we shall not forsake; nor shall we allow it to be liquidated and forsaken.""As for brotherly Lebanon  we shall remain faithful to our fraternal commitment towards it. We shall stand strongly at its side and do all in our power for the liberation of its territory and the safeguarding of its unity and independence.""Syria will remain the fortress on whose walls shall be crushed all attempts by United States imperialism and by zionism to expand  impose hegemony and vanquish the Arabs.""In spite of all that has happened  I am fully confident of a bright future and of achieving victory over the aggressors.""109.	The severe economic crises confronting the world in recent years should prompt the Western industrialized countries to realize that the continuation of progress and development as a one-directional path no longer meets the requirements of our time  in which all peoples of the world look forward to the establishment of a new international economic order and the building of equitable international economic relations. Only in those conditions can the developing countries catch up with technological progress  acquire the resources needed for their development  meet their basic requirements  and thus reduce the gap between the industrialized and the developing countries.110.	The international community must also face up to other contradictions and disequilibrium owing  on the one hand  to the enormous expenditures on the production and development of nuclear arms  and  on the other  to the ever-increasing resort to economic pressures by the imperialists against developing nations as a means of political blackmail. The prohibition of the use of such means and the establishment of the foundations of international economic security are indispensable in building and enhancing confidence in international economic relations.111.	The world is confronting a dangerous escalation in the arms race  particularly nuclear arms. This is contrary to the aspirations of the peoples of the world  who pinned their hopes on the implementation of the provisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament. Today  the arms race represents a serious obstacle to the establishment of balanced international relations based on mutual confidence. International peace and security cannot be maintained through the arms race  but only through right and justice  through the elimination of all forms of aggression  and by the exercise by the peoples of their right to self-determination and to benefit from their wealth and national resources.112.	The deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in some countries of Western Europe has contributed to aggravating international tension  the result of which can only be further escalation of the nuclear-arms race.113.	We support the efforts aimed at cessation of the production of nuclear arms and destruction of the stockpiles of such weapons. We stand against the militarization of outer space. We demand the full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the dismantling of military bases and nuclear installations in the Mediterranean region  the elimination of all forms of aggression from the region and its transformation into a nuclear-free zone of peace.114.	The link between European security and security in the Mediterranean region is a historical geographical fact that cannot be ignored. Any security arrangements that may be made in some European countries must be accompanied simultaneously by similar security arrangements in the Mediterranean region  together with international guarantees not to use the nuclear installations existing on the territories of some European countries against the countries of the Mediterranean.115.	The Syrian Arab Republic once more draws the attention of the international community to the fact that Israel's nuclear capabilities and its persistent refusal to ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear installations under international control constitute a real threat to the security of the Mediterranean countries and the Middle East as a whole and obstruct the establishment of a nuclear-free zone. The Syrian Arab Republic supports the idea of making the Middle East region a nuclear-free zone in order to lessen tensions in the region  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions.116.	The tense political situation resulting from the escalation of aggression and the inability to deter it places the world on the brink of an abyss. In southern Africa  the racist minority regime of Pretoria is still pursuing its evil racial policy of apartheid and its illegitimate occupation of Namibia  in defiance of the international community and its will  as embodied in the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations. The racist regime continues to enjoy persistent and increasing support by some Western European countries and the United States  contrary to their obligations under the provisions of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.117.	Furthermore  the alliance between that regime and the racist regime in Tel Aviv and their collaboration in various fieldsâin particular  the military and nuclear fieldsâas well as the co-ordination of their aggressive policies and plans further exacerbate the situation in the region and represent a threat to the peace  security and stability of both Africa and the Middle East.118.	The rejection of the ""new constitution"" in South Africa by the Security Council in its important resolution 554 (1984) of 17 August 1984  which declares it to be contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and hence null and void  renders the racist regime in South Africa illegal and transforms it from a regime already condemned by the overwhelming majority of the international community into an illegitimate entity which must be brought down by whatever means.119.	The Syrian Arab Republic stands firmly by its African brothers in South Africa and Namibia struggling against the racist Pretoria entity  just as it firmly supports the struggle against the racist Zionist entity in occupied Palestine. We reiterate our total support of the right of the peoples of Azania and Namibia and their liberation movements to struggle by all meansâincluding armed struggleâand to confront the racist minority regime in order to free their countries from colonialism  occupation  racism and120.	We also firmly support the struggle of the African front-line States against the policies of occupation  aggression  subversion and blackmail practised by the Pretoria regime in order to keep them in submission and to create new conditions aimed at consolidating its racist  colonialist policy.121.	The question of Cyprus has become one of the major problems preoccupying the international community in general  and the Mediterranean States members of the non-aligned movement in particular  because of its implications for the security and stability of the region. A just solution of this question can be achieved only through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions  in a manner that would preserve for the Republic of Cyprus its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status through negotiations between the two communities. We hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General will be crowned with success.122.	With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  we reaffirm the need to recognize the right of the legitimate Afghan Government to defend its county's independence and sovereignty against any foreign interference. We are very keen on keeping that country  which is linked to us by ancient historical ties  a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We hope that the countries neighbouring Afghanistan  with which we enjoy the same close historical links  will be able to settle the differences among them. We are closely following the negotiations currently taking place at Geneva through the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General  and we wish them success.123.	The reunification of the two parts of Korea has become an urgent necessity dictated by the interests of international peace and of the Korean people. Transforming the territory of South Korea into a United States nuclear base is extremely dangerous not only for the security  peace and achievements of the Korean people but also for the security and future of the Far East. In our view  the implementation of the United Nations resolution related to the Korean problem  which calls upon the United States to withdraw its forces from South Korea  is the right course for solving the problem.124.	The world has for years been following with concern the developments in Central America and the Caribbean  developments that have now acquired serious dimensions and constitutes a direct threat to international peace and security. Such developments have been evident in the aggressive acts and military manoeuvres of the United States in the region that have increased tension and undermined the right of the people to self-determination and to choosing the regime they deem fit. Examples of such United States acts of aggression against the progressive regimes in the region are the occupation of Grenada last fall  the mining of the territorial waters of Nicaragua this year  the use or threat of use of force  the recourse to pressure  political blackmail  economic blockade  and the financing  supplying and use of mercenaries. One of the most sacred rights proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations for the peoples of the world is the right to freedom and self-determination without any external interference.125.	In conclusion  we reiterate our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations  which was born of the tragedies of the Second World War during which millions perished. We reaffirm the need to remove all obstacles in the way of the United Nations assuming its full role as prescribed in the principles and purposes of the Charter  so as to fulfil the hopes of PEOPLES in this world Organization."
"132",6688,"TCD",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like first  on behalf of the Chadian delegation  to congratulate the President of the General Assembly most warmly on his unanimous election to guide the work of the thirty-ninth session. The confidence which the international community has placed in him is recognition of the role that his country  Zambia  plays in the maintenance of international peace and security. Similarly  it is a recognition of his own qualities as a statesman with great experience in international relations. I am convinced that under his wise and enlightened guidance the proceedings at this session will be crowned with success.212.	It is also my pleasant duty to pay a well-deserved tribute to his illustrious predecessor  the head of State of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  who guided the proceedings of the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session with wisdom and dignity.213.	We wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Perez de Cuellar  our dynamic Secretary General  for having spared no effort in the service of peace in this troubled world. We thank him  too  for having made international public opinion aware of the economic and social crisis buffeting the countries of Africa  most of which are among the poorest in the world.214.	Finally  I extend my delegation's congratulations to the delegation of Brunei Darussalam on its admission as a Member of the Organization. The admission of that young State is a proof of the vitality and universality of the great family of the United Nations.215.	As everyone knows  the fundamental objectives of the Organization are the maintenance of peace  the development of friendly relations among States and international cooperation. Unfortunately there are Member States of the Organization which  far from contributing to the achievement of those aims  are  on the contrary  deliberately violating the rules to which they have freely agreed.216.	It is well known that Chad is one of the major victims of the flagrant violation of the rules and principles of the Organization. Libya  flying in the face of those noble standards  has been occupying a large part of Chadian territory since 1973. In August 1983  it extended that occupation to the entire northern section of Chad. This area of 550 000 square kilometres has fallen under Libyan administration as a result of land based and air offensives by the Libyan regular army and the so-called ""Islamic"" legion  which is composed of mercenaries of all nationalities. Libya  which had always denied its military presence in Chad  has finally acknowledged it  because it has said that it intends to withdraw its troops from Chad in accordance with the arrangement it has just concluded with France.217.	The Chadian people and its Government are pleased by that Libyan intention and keenly hope it will be translated into reality. However  past experience has shown us that when their backs are to the wall the Libyans use subterfuge to mislead international opinion. Since we are accustomed to the delaying tactics of the Libyan Government  we cannot but remain sceptical about the withdrawal of Libyan forces from our territory.218.	There is a Chadian proverb that says  ""He who has been bitten by a snake is frightened at the sight of a mere rope"". The Chadian people has not just been bitten  it has lost a limb.219.	At the same time that Libya is announcing its intention to withdraw militarily from Chad  in the south of the country it is continuing to arm rebel factions so as to sow subversion  death and desolation among the peace-loving inhabitants and cause the country's destruction. That is why the international community must not be duped by dissociating what is occurring in the south of the country from the war of aggression that Libya is waging in the north of Chad. That leads us to believe that the Libyan announcement to withdraw its troops is nothing more than a tactic to recoil the better to strike.220.	Despite Libya's warlike and expansionist attitude  Chad has always wished to settle its dispute with that country by peaceful means. That is why my country has frequently had recourse to international bodies  in particular the OAU and the Security Council. Each time we encountered Libyan evasions. Each time Libya answered our peaceful steps with the language of force.221.	If the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya respects its commitments the Chadian Government for its part will  as always  be ready to abide by the resolution adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983  and the statement by the Security Council8 inviting the two parties to settle their dispute by peaceful means.222.	I should like to emphasize the fact that the people of Chad feels no animosity towards the fraternal Libyan people. The sufferings  atrocities and bereavement caused us by the regime of the Jamahiriya can be ascribed only to that regime  not to the Libyan people which is itself tyrannized by that terrorist regime. The people of Chad has known the anguish of war all too well. It aspires to peace and hopes to live in friendship with its neighbours  including Libya  so as to be able to devote all its resources and energy to the reconstruction and development of the country. That is why  once the Government of the Third Republic was established  it deliberately opted for negotiation in the hope of finding reconciliation among all the citizens of Chad. It was within that context that the Government multiplied its initiatives to meet with its opponents. It was also within that context that it gave full support to the current Chairman of the OAU in organizing a round table between the opponents and the Government. We endorsed that initiative  because we were aware of the need to bring peace to Chad  reinforce its unity and preserve its independence and territorial integrity in order to devote ourselves to its reconstruction and development.223.	Unfortunately  we must note that the efforts of the pan African organization were impeded by the manoeuvres of some countries which prevented the holding of a frank and direct meeting between the opponents and the Government. If the round table at Addis Ababa scheduled to be held last January did not take place  it was the enemies of peace in Chadâ and they aloneâwho were responsible for that. An attempt has been made to place a Government and its opposition on an equal footing. That is inadmissible  for it is tantamount to asking the Government of Chad to relinquish its attributes of sovereignty.224.	The Government did not fall into that trap. None the less  it remains devoted to its objective of peace and national reconciliation  with respect for Chad's independence  dignity  unity and territorial integrity. That is why the Government of Chad is grateful to the Congolese Government and encourages it to continue and step up its efforts to organize a conference on national reconciliation.225.	The Government of Chad trusts in the course it has laid out for itself to achieve national reconciliation. Our confidence has been increased by the recent positions taken by some citizens of Chad who have distanced themselves from their Libyan protector. They have unambiguously denounced Libya's expansionism and manoeuvres to divide the citizens of Chad so as to conquer them. Indeed  those persons now know that they have been used by Libya to sow trouble in their own country with a view to Libya's annexing it. We are pleased that our compatriots have come to realize that  although belatedly. Those among them who are still in Libya are  in fact  prisoners of the Libyan regime and its war machine. The least inclination towards independence by them endangers their security. This is the appropriate place to request the international community's assistance to exert pressure on the Libyan regime to allow our brothers to leave Libya freely.226.	Our desire for reconciliation with our brothers and to live in peace with our neighbours is sincere. We want that to be clearly understood and would appreciate all efforts directed to that end.227.	The particularly difficult economic and social situation in Chad owing to the war imposed upon us by Libya is another subject of great concern to us.228.	Indeed  in addition to the already serious problems confronting it because of its status as a less developed and landlocked country  Chad is confronting other problems caused by natural disasters  such as drought and desertification. The magnitude of the destruction caused by those phenomena is considerable. It is a situation the dimensions of which are not entirely appreciated but certainly constitute a mortgage on our country's future development. Indeed  the drought which at the outset afflicted only parts of Chad steadily spreads each year over vast areas that had previously been spared.The constant deterioration of the environment and the spread of desertification have caused a mass exodus of population and livestock from the north  east and centre of the country to regions considered to be better. The persistence of drought has caused a chronic food crisis which will become aggravated this year and in coming years owing to an almost total lack of rainfall. Recent cases of famine in the southern regions of the country are a striking example of the consequences of population exodus and the effects of drought.229.	Faced with that tragedy  the Government  with the help of friendly countries and international organizations  has tried everything to take corrective measures  but they have been in vain  given the immensity of the task.230.	I should like to reiterate my Government's successive appeals to the international community not only to render emergency aid to Chad but also to support our efforts to eliminate this scourge.231.	Chad also joins in the appeals of the Sahelian countries to the international community to define a strategy for the countries of the Sudano Sahelian region and other regions stricken by drought and desertification and to mobilize the resources needed to implement it.232.	Although the military aggression of which my country is a victim has blurred the renewed solidarity that was manifested after the International Conference on Assistance to Chad  held at Geneva in November 1982  Chad's economy has recorded rather encouraging signs of recovery. However  my Government is aware that the needs and problems are enormous; that is why it is looking to the international community to help it promote economic and social activities.233.	In this connection  the Government and people of Chad express their thanks to States and international organizations for the aid they have been so kind as to grant to Chad.234.	I should like to remind the Assembly that  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/214  my country intends to organize a pledging conference  with the technical assistance of UNDP  during the last quarter of 1985. That conference will consider a general programme of reconstruction and development and the financing of detailed projects in priority areas. A development plan will be before the conference for its consideration. It will cover the main priorities  namely: development  agricultural production and stock raising  the diversification and processing of primary products  the opening up of the country both internally and to the outside world  and the promotion of harmonious regional development. We call upon all countries and all bodies to take part in this pledging conference  of which Chad has great expectations.235.	The Government and the people of Chad wish to express their deep gratitude to the countries and bodies that are good enough to provide them with invaluable assistance.236.	If the economic situation in Chad is catastrophic it is because it also suffers from the side effects of the world economy  which are very disquieting.237.	Even though we see certain signs of economic recovery in the industrialized countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  the shortcomings of the current economic order result in an ever-growing burden for the developing countries  which have been severely affected by the repercussions of the prolonged structural crisis in the world economy.238.	The reduction of external resources and capital flows from the developed countries  which is due essentially to the increase in protectionism and the fall in commodity prices  has placed the economies of the developing countries in a precarious situation.239.	In particular  the African continent continues to fail to meet its targets.240.	The Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  adopted by the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa and submitted by the African Ministers responsible for Economic Development and Planning at the last session of the Economic and Social Council gives an eloquent description of the economic and social crisis which is being experienced by Africa  and puts forward emergency  as well as short  medium and long-term  measures.241.	The African countries are in a critical situation which deserves the special attention of the international community. The specific nature of the problems facing the African continent today demand this  because this is a question of the survival of many millions of human beings. That is why my delegation believes that it is imperative to put into effect immediately a programme of measures in matters of vital importance for African countries in order to alleviate their tragic plight.242.	The Economic and Social Council  at its second regular session  discussed as a matter of priority the serious economic and social crisis in Africa but was unable to arrive at a consensus text on the ways in which this should be remedied.243.	Turning now to the world economic situation  we believe that it is high time for the developed countries to act on the commitment made with regard to the implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries   adopted at the Paris Conference  and to agree to the launching of global negotiations. We believe that this would be at least the beginning of the solution of the present crisis.244.	The interdependence of developed and developing countries should not result simply in intermittent international aid  while such fundamental problems as the restructuring of international economic relations to ensure more equitable cooperation are ignored. In fact  in such an unfavourable international climate  it would be an illusion to envisage  even in the short term  economic development that would take full account of the interests of the third world. Selfishness must give way to solidarity so that together we can endeavour to establish a new international economic order that is more just and more equitable.245.	The world economic crisis has been further compounded by the political tensions which continue to buffet our planet  thus posing a dangerous threat to the future of mankind as a whole. Although it must be acknowledged that the United Nations has been able to prevent certain situations from getting out of hand  it nevertheless remains true that frequent violations of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations continue to threaten the already precarious equilibrium of the world.246.	As in the case of Chad  which we have already emphasized  Lebanon  Palestine  Cambodia  Afghanistan and Namibia continue to suffer humiliating foreign occupation  and the rest of the world remains impotent in the face of the shameful policy of apartheid practised by the white minority in South Africa.247.	Such upheavals  which are a feature of the present day  demand that we react in a way that is devoid of any partisan spirit and aimed solely at preserving and strengthening world peace.248.	With its long history of uneasy coexistence with its neighbour to the north  the people of Chad is aware that no force  however powerful  can occupy a country for long without clear and disastrous consequences. It is for that reason that we consider that dialogue and concerted action offer the only possible means of solving all the major international issues.249.	Let us take  for example  the question of disarmament. Our greatest anxiety is that if a nuclear war were to break out there would be neither victor nor vanquished since there would be no survivor. The most heartfelt desire of countries such as mine is that negotiations on strategic and medium range weapons be resumed as quickly as possible in order to bring about first a freeze and then a quantitative reduction of nuclear weapons.250.	Adoption of this peaceful initiative  as we have emphasized previously  is the only way to prevent encroachments on the sovereignty of other States  invasions and even continuing occupation of foreign territories  intervention and all other types of aggression.251.	On the African continent  there are many tensions which are the result  as elsewhere  of deliberately ignoring the fundamental principles of the United Nations and of the OAU  namely  those concerning the self-determination of peoples  independence  respect for human rights  human dignity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and nonaggression  to cite but a few.252.	In North Africa  the tensions engendered by the botched decolonization of Western Sahara are still smouldering. The refusal of one of the parties to the conflict to abide by the relevant resolutions of the OAU is not calculated to promote a final settlement of this conflict.253.	Chad  which has always supported self-determination for the Saharan people  will give full support to any initiative that will help to facilitate the full implementation of the provisions of the resolutions adopted at the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  particularly that which advocates direct negotiations between the two parties.254.	In southern Africa  the racist minority regime of Pretoria continues to keep Namibia under the colonial yoke and to exclude the black South African majority from power. Recent developments in this part of the world show more clearly than ever the implacable  cynical nature of apartheid.255.	In order to perpetuate their oppressive regime  the South African racists have even tried to use coloured people and Indians in their efforts to perpetuate their domination. The glaring failure of that attempt  caused by a general boycott of the so called elections by the communities concerned  is clear proof that in matters of domination and exploitation it is pointless to rely on dividing people  particularly if the oppressed people has no option but to resort to force.256.	The delegation of Chad  which upholds the just cause of the South African majority  strongly condemns this inadmissible denial of elementary human rights.257.	With regard to Namibia  we must recall that the people of Chad consider the full  unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to be the only suitable path to decolonization. South Africa should unconditionally accept the decolonization of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole  authentic representative.258.	In the Middle East  Israel's intransigence and its expansionist policy continue to foster tension and war. The right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State  under the leadership of the PLO  and Israel's right to exist are no longer open to discussion. In the light of this  it is important for the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel  through an international conference on Palestine  to agree that the Palestinian people has the right to recover its plundered lands.259.	Furthermore  it is undeniable that the foreign occupation of Lebanon is impeding the national unity of that country. As long as the uninvited foreign armies remain in Lebanon  peace and harmony among the people of Lebanon can be only pious hopes.260.	Still in the Middle East  for many years an unrelenting war has continued to rack two neighbouring Islamic countries. I refer to the conflict between Iran and Iraq. My delegation once again appeals to those two countries to settle their differences by peaceful means. In this connection  we welcome Iraq's readiness to resolve the problem through negotiations.261.	The Afghans cannot begin to settle the problems between them  in a brotherly spirit  until the occupying Soviet troops have been withdrawn from their country. However  despite the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the appeals of peace loving countries  those occupation forces show not the slightest intention of withdrawing. That is a cynical way to delay the solving of the Afghan problem.262.	Another subject causing anxiety and concern  because it results from the use of armed force  is the continuing foreign occupation of Kampuchea. It is encouraging to note that the people of Kampuchea has not stood idly by  as is shown by the military and diplomatic successes achieved under the leadership of the Coalition Government headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.263.	As is the case with Afghanistan  the problem of Kampuchea can be resolved only through the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nationsâthat is  through the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of its inalienable right to decide its own future.264.	The partition of Korea into two States remains the main subject of concern to the Korean people. The delegation of Chad hopes that the country will be reunified through the initiation of direct negotiations between the two Governments  without any outside interference.265.	With regard to the question of Cyprus  we call upon the Greek and Turkish communities to take part in brotherly talks in order to preserve the unity and integrity of an independent and nonaligned Republic of Cyprus.266.	I turn now to Central America  where my delegation earnestly hopes that the process of dialogue within the framework of the Contadora Group will shortly bear fruit  so that the States and peoples of the region may enjoy peace and stability.267.	Next year  we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. That will be a fitting occasion to consider ways and means to use all the resources of the Charter to enable the Organization to carry out its mission effectively. That will involve the full shouldering by the Security Council of its responsibilities  rising above ideological and partisan squabbles and selfish interests. It will also involve strengthening international cooperation  in the higher interests of all nations.268.	The failure to apply sanctions over violations of United Nations principles and resolutions has contributed to reducing the Organization's ability to resolve the many problems that the international community faces. It is therefore imperative to devise ways to restore the credibility of the United Nations  which remains the hope of peace-loving and justice loving countriesâin particular  the small  defenceless countries.269.	Chad remains faithful to the rules and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and appeals to the world conscience for scrupulous observance of them.270.	Aggression and repeated acts of interference  of which my country is a victim  are results of the flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter.271.	Therefore  we call upon the international community to do everything it can to support Chad in its efforts to regain tranquillity and recover its territorial integrity  as inherited from colonialism  by persuading the Tripoli regime to end its aggression and its continual interference in my country's internal affairs."
"133",6734,"TGO",39,1984,"ï»¿156. This is the first time I have taken part in the general debate of the Assembly since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Co-operation by General Gnassingbe Eyadema  President and founder of the - Rassemblement du peuple togolaise (Togolese People's Rally) and President of the Togolese Republic. I therefore feel all the more the weight of our common responsibility to rebuild our world  which is collapsing under the chaotic convulsions of the repeated crises brought about by our antagonisms  contradictions and dissatisfactions. We must reconstruct our world  not necessarily by applying new concepts  as is advocated by some  but by applying the existing concepts which comprise the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations to which we all subscribe.157.	You must be aware  Mr. President  that my delegation is full of admiration for your impressive opening statement [1st meeting]  in which you analysed  one by one and in an objective manner  the root causes of these crises and their solutions. That statement alone would have been enough to justify your election to guide the debate at this thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It bears witness to the philosophy that has always served as the basis for your efforts as a representative of your country  Zambia  which shares my own country's faith in the United Nations.158.	Situated at the heart of the African continent  in a region which is tormented as a result of the culpable arrogance and unjustifiable intransigence of a racist State  the country which it is your honour to represent in this great forum of discussion and dialogue is well known for its dedication to the freedom of peoples  the independence of States and international peace and security. In addition  Zambia is among those African countries which most firmly support the liberation struggle in southern Africa.159.	I am sure that these assets  combined with your unquestionable intellectual qualities  predispose you  Sir  to discharge with competence  skill and zest the weighty and noble responsibilities with which you are entrusted as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Having warmly congratulated you on your impressive election  I offer you my best wishes for success in your delicate but exalted task.160.	Imbued with the ideals of peace  justice and freedomânourished by and nourishing the principles of the Charterâyou have acquired a proven competence which  allied with a most engaging personality  commands both respect and esteem. For many years  you have placed that competence at the service of the United Nations  particularly in your role as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia  where your tireless efforts have helped to blaze a trail towards the independence of Namibia.161. I followed with great attention the skill  lucidity and rectitude with which your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session  and I wish to convey to him my great appreciation and sincere congratulations.162. it is my pleasant duty also to pay a well- deserved tribute to the courage  perspicacity and pragmatism which have characterized the work of the Secretary-General since the thirty-eighth session. He has spared no effort  and has sometimes risked his life  going to crisis zones in order to experience in the field the problems which the United Nations must resolve  whether they be political or economic.163.	Since 1 come from a country that knows how to appreciate a real friend  I wish particularly to reiterate the sincere thanks of the Government of Togo for the special attention the Secretary-General devoted to our problems during the visit to New York of General Gnassingbe Eyadema  President of the Togolese Republic  and during his own journey to Togo last January.164.	Welcoming a new Member to the United Nations has always been a time of emotion  emotion which I can hardly restrain as 1 welcome the brother state of Brunei Darussalam  which  we are certain  will fan the flame of the Organization's grand design for universality.165.	For the thirty-ninth timeâabove and beyond the political and ideological differences which divide States  notwithstanding the tensions which are rending asunder a perpetually changing world  and despite the imperfections  failures and disappointments which have characterized certain actions taken in conformity with the purposes of the United Nationsâthe General Assembly is taking up the challenge facing the Organization.166.	For the thirty-ninth time we are assembled in this forum of discussion and dialogue to seek solutions in keeping with the many problems of our age. That search will be meaningful and effective only if our approach to the burning questions of our time leaves aside all complacency and demagogy  as well as all self-seeking partisan doctrines  in order to result in courageous  realistic conclusions reflecting a spirit of synthesis and compromise.167.	Because of their urgency and persistence and the variety of their repercussions  the challenges now facing mankind cry out to the universal conscience. Friendship among peoples and co-operation among nations no longer seem to derive from the indisputable interdependence which governs relations among States. Solidarityâthe corollary of complementarityâhas been cast adrift. The boldest and most generous declarations of intent no longer suffice to mask a steadily worsening ill.168.	The international economic crisis is the major challenge of our time  because it is a challenge to the progress and well-being of mankind  and it is heightening the selfishness of the wealthy countries and thereby complicating and multiplying the financial difficulties of the developing countries.169.	As a challenge to world stability and equilibrium  the pursuit of the unrestrained arms race is becoming a substitute for the dialogue of the deaf which persists between the super-Powers.170.	As a challenge to the flourishing of the noble ideals of the United Nations and particularly to human rights  the abject policy of apartheid is now further refining its devious manoeuvres by conferring upon itself a bogus democratic aura.171.	By both their duration and their state of deadlock  the many local conflicts which are a threat to international peace and security are tending to become established as necessary evils  whereas in fact they are the gangrenous parts of the international community.172.	One might be inclined to regard all this as a new alarmist refrain. This recital of risks  dangers and challenges may be written off by some as an example of anachronistic fatalism  of excessive pessimism.173.	Consistently guided by its profound faith in the virtues of peace and solidarity among peoples  Togo  my country  could not fail to draw the attention of this Assembly to the upheavals which now contribute to the weakening of the international community and the stifling of its conscience.174.	The tensions which are shaking the African continent continue to give rise to serious concern in the international community. In southern Africa  the white racist regime of Pretoria continues stubbornly to press the imposition of its alleged prerogatives: the policy of apartheid and the blocking of the process of genuine decolonization in Namibia.175.	The South African leaders  seeking to adapt themselves to the upsurge of the heroic struggle of the Coloured people against racial discrimination  have seen fit to confer a democratic veneer on the regime by electing a three-chamber Parliament  associating whites  Coloureds and Indians but excluding the blacks  who make up 73 per cent of the population.176.	The impressive success of the boycott by the Coloured and Indian communities of this parody of an election and the recent riots organized by the blacks have set in motion a mechanism of savage repression which reveals the failure and panic of white power.177.	This admission of failure and this panic is clearly indicated by the promise made by the South African Head of State concerning the subsequent improvement of the fate of the blacks and of their future representation in Parliament  accompanied by reservations as to the difference to be established between this type of representation ' representation of the Coloureds and Indiana178.	Togo  for its part  regards these expedient modifications as new manoeuvres by South Africa to mislead international public opinion about the development of	In fact  the system has not been fundamentally modified at all by these bogus reforms  which  ironically  are rejected by the great majority of those for whom they were devised.179.	The internal policies of South Africa are thus characteristic of the will of the	regime to maintain the pre-eminence of white power. This will manifest itself externally by continued nuclear cooperation with Israel  co-operation which the Togolese Government vigorously condemns in the light of the grave threat which it poses to peace and security in Africa.180.	In regard to Namibia  by demanding as a precondition of self-determination for the Territory the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  South Africa is trying desperately to delay the inevitable and avoid decolonization  which would not have the blessing of the	regime.181.	However  the implacable struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization [.SW^FO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  is an essential parameter which makes the accession of Namibia to true independence quite inevitable. 182.	In this regard  the position of the Togolese Government has always been clear. SWAPO enjoys the unswerving support of Togo  and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) cannot be linked to the withdrawal of Cuban troops  whose presence is legally justified by the existence of an agreement entered into by Angola and Cuba as sovereign nations.183.	Moreover  the Togolese Government appreciates the underlying motives which led Angola and Mozambique to conclude the Lusaka and Nkomati agreements. While not calling into question the continuance and the successful conclusion of the liberation struggle of SWAPO and the African National Congress of South Africa  those agreements have the advantage of keeping the peace in the region.184.	The crisis in Chad  another Gordian knot in the African continent  could move towards a settlement if the decision arrived at recently between France and Libya were to be effectively implemented and if all troops were to be simultaneously with drawn from Chadian territory after 27 September.185.	With regard to Western Sahara  the hope generated by the resolution adopted by a broad consensus at the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983  seems to have been dashed as a result of the refusal of one of the parties to the conflict to sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of the Frente POLISARIO to make possible the exercise of the right of self-determination by the Saharan people.186.	My country  which respects the principles which govern inter-State relations and particularly the right of self-determination of peoples  was one of the first States to recognize the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. However  when it became necessary  in the interest of moderation and conciliation  the Togolese Government did not hesitate to attempt  with other African countries  to persuade the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic to freeze temporarily its participation in the work of the pan-African organization in order to avoid the paralysis of that organization.187.	Togo  which is faithful to its commitments  continues to be open to any new initiatives designed to secure common understanding among the parties to the conflict and self-determination for the Saharan people.188. The Middle East  which has been a turbulent region for more than 30 years  this year again witnessed dramatic upheavals. The intransigence of the expansionist policy of Israel is the prime obstacle to peace and security in that region. In the view of the Togolese Government  the right of Israel to its identity as a State within secure and internationally recognized borders does not exclude the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination within the framework of an independent and sovereign State. As long as Israel persists in its determination to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  peace in the Middle East will continue to be an absolute myth.189.	The voice of reason and wisdom therefore recommends that all the parties involved in the Middle East conflict as well as all the parties interested and concerned work for a peaceful  comprehensive settlement of the crisis within the frame work of an international conference on Palestine.190.	The latest developments in Israeli politics seem to suggest that Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Lebanon. Togo therefore appeals to the new Government of national unity to put into effect its planned withdrawal as soon as possible. Such a venture would greatly contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and the restoration of political stability to Lebanon.191.	In Asia  foreign interference continues to sabotage the search for solutions to the grave crises in the region  while a most devastating armed conflict continues.192.	Because it was clearly seen to be a new form of interventionism  the occupation of Afghanistan by foreign troops was condemned almost unanimously by the members of the international community. Persistence in the occupation of Afghanistan constitutes defiance of international law and of General Assembly decisions. It is therefore necessary that political and strategic calculations yield to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops in order to enable the Afghan people freely to determine their own destiny without any foreign interference.193.	By turning a deaf ear to the appeals made to them by the international community for the implementation of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session [resolution 35/6]  as well as the decisions of the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York in July 1981  the States involved in the occupation of that country have rendered themselves guilty of a permanent violation of an essential provision of the Charter of the United Nations.194.	Faithful to its traditional position  Togo cannot be stinting in its support for the heroic liberation efforts of Kampuchea to rid itself of the foreign yoke and to maintain its seat in the United Nations.195.	The Togolese Government also appeals to the Government of Viet Nam to recognize the legitimacy of the tripartite coalition directed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.196.	The persistence of the division of Korea into two States continues to be a source of frustration for the Korean people  who rightly call for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country. In this regard  the Togolese Government views the eradication of harmful foreign influences and the determination to overcome political and ideological divergencies as prerequisites of direct negotiations between the two Governments on the basis of the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.197.	It is essential that the international community  which has always viewed the consequences of the continuing armed conflict between Iran and Iraq as one of its crucial concerns  bring the two parties to the conflict to consider as binding the decisions and resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly.198.	Because of our powerlessness or our indifference  we are now witnessing as spectators but also as accomplices an intolerable tragedy: that of two countries which have poured their human resources  their national wealth  their creative genius and patriotism  their human  economic  military  intellectual and psychological potential  into a ruthless war  a war which continues to cause a distressing haemorrhage in terms of violations of humanitarian law and which sometimes .-minds us of the worst moments of the Second World War.199.	As the Head of the Togolese State has said about the horrors of war: ""One always knows when and where it will start  but one never knows when and where it will finish.""200.	To the thousands of men  women and children who have already fallen on the battlefields of Iran and Iraqâthe victims of the intransigencies of their countriesâthere will unfailingly be added many others. Hundreds of thousands of people will fall unless the international community reacts vigorouslyâin other words  if the international community does not take an immediate  concrete and realistic initiative to bring the two parties to respect a truce capable of leading to peaceful negotiations.201.	As the safety of navigation of oil tankers is seriously threatened in the Persian Gulf because of this situation  there is a grave danger that in due course this armed conflict will come to our very doors and even lead to a cataclysm of frightful scope and intensity.202.	My delegation is therefore determined to lend its support to any effort to stop the human and material blood-letting caused by the Iran-Iraq war.203.	My delegation continues also to be concerned about the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). It is high time this question found a peaceful solution. Togo reiterates its appeal to the Governments of the United Kingdom and Argentina to resolve by negotiation this question  which has caused immense material damage and loss of life.204.	The international crisis which is disorganizing and threatening to shake the economic and social structures of the nations is now joined for the developing countries  particularly some countries of Africa  by another scourge  the scourge of drought  which afflicts more and more widespread regions and is causing an apocalyptic prospect for the future.205.	No one can remain insensitive to this unspeakable misery that is afflicting these underprivileged areas. It is for the international community to mobilize itself and show active solidarity to provide urgent solutions for the acute problem of drought.206.	This is certainly the proper place to pay a well- deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  who made a personal visit to the drought-stricken countries in order to see for himself the real state of affairs and in order to be better equipped to seek  with the countries concerned and the international community  ways and means of putting an end to this calamity  which is intimately connected with the problem of hunger.207.	It is also fitting to pay a tribute to the developed countries which have generously and of their own accord responded to the Secretary-General's appeal by taking concrete  effective action to relieve the hunger and the sufferings of the victims of this disaster.208.	Just as the problem of drought is intimately linked with the painful problem of hunger  this latter problem m tum brings to mind another notion  that of solidarityâin other words  that of international economic co-operation. No one now can seriously question the necessary complementarity between States and peoples. ""Necessary"" is a word I use advisedly in its prime sense  meaning that it is required of us all. Because we cannot deny the complementary nature of the problem  which is evident from the facts  it is essential for us to become aware of this reality and to move from the phase of pious wishes to a rational reorganization of the world economy. Of course  this requires courageâthe courage to rid oneself of national self-seeking. It means that the Governments must persuade their peoples of this truth  namely  that no nation  however powerful  could develop and defend its own interests indefinitely and in an isolated manner without consideration for the interests of other nations  and in a manner detrimental to them.209.	How  in this context  when the world is stricken with hunger and drought  can one understand the political blindness of the Powers that are investing fabulous amounts of money in the arms raceâan arms race which is a constant danger to the human species  hanging over it  like the sword of Damocles  with its spectre of death and destruction; an arms race which is diverting from the sphere of development vast amounts of money which it is unnecessarily absorbing?210.	As a corollary to the quest for peace  security and economic co-operation  one must therefore raise the struggle to the level of men's minds in order to bring about full-scale disarmament. Togo reiterates its appeal to the super-Powers to continue the negotiations which will gradually lead to that final phase.211.	It is well known that dedication to international al peace and security is one of the sacred values underlying Togo's foreign policy. That is why  in order to help promote an increased awareness of the problems of disarmament  my country at the beginning of August this year organized at Lome a National Seminar on Peace and Disarmament with the effective participation of the Secretary-General.212.	The Lome Peace Message  which was the final document of that important Seminar recommends  as a way of promoting research on peace and of intensifying the information campaign on disarmament throughout Africa  the establishment at Lome of a regional institute for research on peace and disarmament. It also recommends the organization in Togo early in 1985âthe fortieth anniversary of the United Nationsâof a regional seminar on peace and disarmament involving the States members of the Economic Community of West African States and the Economic Community of Central African States  with the assistance of the United Nations. Lastly  the message appeals urgently to the super-Powers to ensure that their ideological differences do not prevail over the real problemsâ those of peace and security and of economic and social development.213.	It is distressing to see the number and magnitude of the conflicts which are shaking our planet and the ills that man has brought upon himself. It is distressing to see that the world has learned no lesson from the horrors and desolation which it has suffered and which led  indeed  to the establishment of the United Nations 214.	However naive our efforts might seem to cynics  Togo  my country  considers it its duty to refer to the threat of total destruction that hangs over mankind and to the noble ideals of international peace and security which the United Nations has sworn to uphold as the most precious possession of ail. That threat still hovers over us. Togo also feels it to be its duty to appeal for a rapid awakening of consciences  for the establishment of active solidarity and international co-operation. Moreover  that is what the Secretary-General called for in his report on the work of the Organization submitted to the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. May the conscience of mankind awake before it is too late."
"134",6780,"THA",39,1984,"ï»¿40.	I am pleased to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Thailand  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You are recognized as the person most eminently qualified for this high office during a crucial period in the life of the United Nations. Your undoubted dedication and wisdom  together with your proved diplomatic skill and sense of fairness  are bound to have a beneficial impact on the Assembly's deliberations. It is fitting  therefore  that in these challenging times  the international community has chosen wise and prudent leadership and is grateful to Zambia and to Africa for providing the services of one of its most distinguished sons.41.	In the same manner  I should like to pay a warm tribute  on behalf of my delegation  to Mr. Jorge Illueca  an illustrious son of Panama and of Latin America  and President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The United Nations is indebted to him for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the Assembly and for his invaluable contribution to international peace and co-operation.42.	My delegation wishes also to congratulate all the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly  who represent the different regions of the world  reflecting thereby the universality of the United Nations.43.	The admission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations is a historic milestone in its inevitable progress towards complete universality. I am indeed most gratified to extend  on behalf of the Thai delegation  our sincere congratulations to the Government and people of Brunei Darussalam and to its delegation on this momentous occasion. Brunei Darussalam and Thailand are fellow members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and are thus committed to the cause of regional peace  harmony and co-operation.44.	The past year has been marked by contrasting developments which portend both promising and ominous prospects for the future.45.	On the one hand  the industrial nations have overcome one of the most serious recessions since the Second World War; on the other hand  the developing countries are saddled with a crushing debt burden with little relief in sight. While recovery is proceeding  albeit at an uneven pace  in the developed economies  the poorer nations can only look forward to a continued stalemate in the North-South dialogue and various interrelated multilateral agenda.46.	While the world has escaped a major conflagration for another year  armed conflicts continue in many parts of the globe  with increasing risks of escalation. While mutual restraints prevail  there is a virtual deadlock in all super-Power negotiations relating to arms control  with grave implications for all mankind. Not only the fearsome spectre of nuclear holocaust but also the ghosts of famine and mass starvation  indiscriminate violence and terrorism continue to stalk and haunt us  and the basic requirements for exorcising them are too often neglected or ignored. The root causes of these and other problems are too frequently a matter of controversy  and as long as they are not dealt with the problems will persist and may indeed worsen.47.	In all these developments the United Nations has an abiding interest and an important stake. Its membership represents the variegated world in which we live. Its difficulty is derived from the varied interests and preoccupations of our troubled and divided world. Its opportunity can arise from the growing sense of interdependence which the Organization itself has helped to foster over the years.48.	On the eve of its fortieth anniversary  gnawing self-doubt and external criticisms are threatening to cause a severe malaise towards and within the United Nations. Although this institutional crisis is not the first  or even the worst in United Nations annals  it can lead to paralysis  to the discredit of multilateralism at the very time when international co-operation is imperative to reduce world tension and to strengthen international peace and security.49.	Since collective security and peace-keeping were the main concerns of the founding fathers of the Organization  and these areas are the primary functions of the Security Council  much thought-provoking discussion has been focused on the role of the Council.50.	It is to the credit of the Security Council and the United Nations system in general that  despite recent criticisms of its performance  there is never a lack of candidates for the vacant seats in the Council. Another interesting point is that  on most issues where no veto power is exercised  the votes in the Council tend to reflect the sense of the international community as expressed on the same or related issues in the General Assembly. This point highlights the need to maintain a proportional balance in the Council's membership.51.	Another significant aspect of the Council's composition is that  while there is a need to maintain a balance in proportion to considerations of geography or group  there is also a need for objectivity and moderation  especially in the face of explosive situations. Above all  adherence to principles and a just and reasoned approach to issues are prerequisites for improving the Council's performance.52.	Among the serious issues faced by the United Nations there are two which would seem to many observers to be less difficult to resolve  partly because they do not appear directly to involve the vital interests of the super-Powers or to indicate any prospect of immediate super-Power confrontation. Moreover  failure or further delay in resolving them will in the long run injure certain important interests of the respective super-Powers. These two issues are the question of Namibia and the situation in Kampuchea.53.	In both instances it is clear that the respective occupying Powers are acting illegally as well as in an inhumane manner. Any country or individual professing love of freedom  independence  human decency and dignity must find the ongoing situations in those two countriesâNamibia and Kampucheaâ abhorrent and unjustifiable. Thailand's positions on both issues are identical. We continue to support the legitimate rights of the Namibian and Kampuchean peoples. We continue to support the demands for withdrawal of the occupying forces without delay. As the front-line State in the Kampuchean situation  Thailand suffers similar attacks and acts of aggression  as well as a similar refugee problem  to those experienced by the front-line African States. We continue to support the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] in the same way that we continue to support the just struggle of the Kampuchean people under the leadership of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea with Prince Sihanouk as its President. At the same time  we continue to support the role of the United Nations in trying to achieve a peaceful solution in accordance with its relevant resolutions and the principles of the Charter.54.	Despite the efforts of the United Nations for many years  especially in the case of Namibia  the Namibian and Kampuchean peoples remain deprived of their legitimate rights and dignity. It is not difficult to see why. Both South Africa and Viet Nam have used similar tactics to deceive the world while determinedly maintaining their ruthless objectives. Both South Africa and Viet Nam have relied on their superior military capabilities to subjugate the occupied countries as well as to intimidate neighbouring countries.55.	However  a cogent argument is that the super-Powers also have a vital interest in maintaining peace and stability in the regions of southern Africa and South-East Asia  which are undoubtedly important parts of the world. Moreover  their interests can be severely damaged by strained relations with the majority of countries in those regions. Since their immediate interests are not involved in supporting South Africa and Viet Nam  respectively  but only their fears of the other's intentions  their interests would be better served by ensuring the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978)  and the framework for a settlement of the Kampuchean problem adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York from 13 to 17 July 1981.56.	Thailand had the honour of hosting the extraordinary plenary meetings of the United Nations Council for Namibia  held at Bangkok  from 21 to 25 May 1984  at which the Bangkok Declaration and Programme of Action on Namibia were successfully adopted. My Government will continue to maintain its support for the Namibian people until they achieve sovereignty and independence in a united Namibia.57.	By the same token  Thailand will maintain its support for self-determination by the people of Kampuchea. Recently  the Foreign Ministers of the member countries of ASEAN issued a joint appeal calling for the restoration of full independence and sovereignty to Kampuchea through withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country  national reconciliation among all Kampuchean parties and the exercise of self-determination free from outside interference.58.	It is important to note that in the ASEAN appeal there is a factual cognisance of the existence of Kampuchean factions whose reconciliation is necessaryâindeed  essentialâfor the survival and well-being of the nation  and that an independent  neutral and non-aligned and united Kampuchea will best serve the interests of the Kampuchean nation. On the other hand  foreign occupation  under whatever pretext  will never conform to the legitimate aspirations of the Kampuchean people. Moreover  it will only lead to more bloodshed  regional tension and external intervention. For these reasons  therefore  the ASEAN States hope that their joint appeal will find increasing support among the States Members of the United Nations.59.	With reference to the incidents near the Thai- Lao border  my Government regards them as minor border incidents which can unfortunately occur in any part of the world. The issue itself concerns only three small  remote villages covering an area of 19 square kilometres and with a population of 1 100 people. The matter arose when Lao troops began harassing a Thai work crew building a road some distance from those villages and well inside our border. Once military actions had taken place  it became difficult for either side to yield for fear of giving the advantage to the other side.60.	This bilateral issue was further complicated by an undue interference from a third country  which has seized upon the opportunity to divert world attention from its military occupation of Kampuchea and to introduce an extraneous factor in the form of linkage to the Kampuchean problem.61.	It has long been the policy of the Royal Thai Government to maintain good-neighbourly relations with Laos. The issue of the three villages should not be permitted to stand in the way of improved relations between the two peoples  who speak the same language and have relatives on both sides of the border. Therefore  despite efforts of the other side to impede progress towards a peaceful settlement  the Royal Thai Government has decided to remove the Thai military presence from the three villages in order to defuse the situation and bring about a peaceful solution to the problem.62.	The situation in Afghanistan involves one of the super-Powers as a combatant against the Afghan patriots  who only wish to see the restoration of sovereignty and independence to their country. Having undergone some internal dissension  Afghanistan fell prey to foreign intervention and naked armed aggression. Five years of foreign occupation have resulted in nearly a quarter of its population being displaced and in their hapless existence in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. My delegation wishes to pay a fitting tribute to Iran and Pakistan for providing these unfortunate refugees with temporal^ refuge  which imposes a serious burden on their economies.63.	The Thai delegation reaffirms its full support for the repeated calls by the C nation of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the General Assembly for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan  in order to allow the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination  free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind. My delegation also reaffirms its full support for the effort of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative to bring about a negotiated settlement in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.64.	The Middle East continues to be embroiled in conflicts which are of the greatest concern to us all.65.	The war in the Gulf area between Iran and Iraq constitutes a worrisome source of instability in the region  with grave implications for international peace and security  as well as tragic human consequences.66.	The Government of Thailand enjoys friendly relations with both conflicting parties and earnestly wishes to see the two parties engage in a cease-fire and peaceful settlement of their dispute. We watched with deep concern the start of the present conflict by Iraq and continue to watch with equal concern the determined persistence of Iran in proceeding with the war until certain conditions are met. Does this mean that the hostilities and the accompanying agonies and risks will be prolonged? The world has already witnessed ""qualitative"" escalation in the use of arms both on land and sea  including chemical weapons. It bodes ill for the patriotic youths of both great nations having to lay down their lives in a war that may never be won.67.	The core of the Middle East problem remains the question of Palestine. Thailand deplores the fact that the Palestinian people are still denied their inalienable rights  including self-determination. While we are asked to ensure the right of all States in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  the rights of the Palestinians to national independence and statehood are ignored. While we were rightly horrified by Nazi persecution of the Jews and are deeply moved by the plight of dissident Jews  the right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and properties has never been adequately addressed. Nor has the plight of the Palestinians in the occupied territories.68.	The Arabs in the occupied territories  too  share a similar plight  having to live under foreign occupation while Israeli authorities adamantly refuse to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions and to withdraw their forces from the Arab territories occupied since the 1967 war. Thailand's consistent policy is to demand the prompt withdrawal of all Israeli forces from those territories and the full implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions without further delay.69.	Since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  the Middle East has been fraught with heightened dangers. Lebanon is today wracked by civil strife and outside interventions  posing a grave threat to Lebanese sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. It is with genuine sadness that we observe Lebanon  with its dynamic people and ancient heritage  being ravaged by destruction and incalculable suffering. It has been the consistent policy of Thailand to recognize the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon. The ongoing crisis in its southern part  which is under Israeli occupation  has recently deepened  owing to illegal actions by the occupying authorities. It seems only just that the position of the Lebanese Government be scrupulously respected  since it constitutes the Administration recognized by all  including Israel  which had indeed concluded an agreement with the same Administration.70.	Above all  Thailand calls for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 509 (1982) and urges all United Nations Members to respect the sovereignty  political independence  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon  as well as its inalienable rights to its resources  and to support the efforts of the Lebanese Government to restore the legitimate authority of the Lebanese State throughout its territory within the internationally recognized boundaries.71.	The situation in Central America continues to be a cause of concern for the international community. My delegation is of the view that the Contadora Group's proposal for negotiations among all parties concerned  in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement with viable guarantees  is constructive and conforms to the aspirations of the peoples of the region. We wish  therefore  to express Thailand's support for the efforts of the Contadora Group  which apparently enjoys increasing acceptance not only by the regional countries  but also by the international community.72.	One of the tragic human consequences of conflict is the refugee problem. While we have not successfully dealt with its root causes  we must continue to perform our humanitarian task  within the limits of our capabilities  in taking care of uprooted and displaced persons. There is nothing more symptomatic of our troubled times than the existence of millions of refugees all over the globe. The fact that poorer countries have had to bear a disproportionately heavy burden also indicates the state of the world's conscience.73.	The refugee population in Africa alone numbers 5 million. It is gratifying to note the successful convening at Geneva  from 9 to 11 July 1984  of the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  and the fact that other countries with a similar problem  including Thailand  participated in that Conference and made their pledges to assist their African brothers.74.	In numbers  Asian refugees follow closely behind those in Africa. There are 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan  for instance. The magnitude of the problem in Asia is often compounded by the circumstances and duration of their plight  as in the case of the uprooted Palestinians. In Thailand  some Indo-Chinese refugees have languished for over nine years. Following the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnamese forces  the number of Kampuchean refugees reached its peak a few years ago. Continued Vietnamese occupation has brought about widespread famine and food shortages and has driven a quarter of a million more Kampucheans to the Thai border  a fact that is a matter of concern to the international community.75.	The refugee influx has  in turn  displaced the local population. However  their predicament is less well appreciated by the world at large and should be given due sympathy and assistance.76.	On the other hand  international concern is more clearly perceived with regard to the Vietnamese boat people. Since 1975  Thailand has given temporary refuge and protection to approximately 80 000 Vietnamese boat refugees. It continues to be Thailandâs policy  as in other refugee cases  to assist these hapless boat people in ways that are commensurate with Thailand's limited resources and capabilities. The fact is that  long before their plight had become an issue of international concern  Thai authorities had provided them with relief and assistance. As long as the root causes are not dealt with  there will continue to be people who are willing to flee their country in rickety boats and to risk dangers on the open sea. Unfortunately  there will also be ruthless individuals who will prey on them. In 1981 the Royal Thai Navy set up an anti-piracy unit of its own. In 1982 the Government commenced an anti-piracy programme in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. However  owing to financial and territorial constraints  it was possible for the programme to cover a sea area of only 15 per cent of the total area envisaged. In this connection  it should be noted that the so-called Gulf of Thailand comprises sea areas belonging to several coastal States  as well as parts of the high seas. Even then  according to UNHCR statistics  the incidents of piratical attacks on the boat people as well as on fishermen have decreased significantly. In July of this year  the programme was extended for another year  thereby indicating the confidence of the participants in the continued usefulness of the programme.77.	The principle of burden-sharing must remain the cardinal tenet in dealing with the aftermath of a refugee influx  so as to enable the countries of first refuge to continue with their humane policies. Not only must the international community do its part in alleviating their burden  but it must also try to deal with the root causes in order to alleviate the refugee problem itself.78.	There are many important aspects of the humanitarian problem of concern to mankind  but among the most serious and appalling must be the deprivation of the basic and fundamental human rights of the black majority in South Africa. The policy of apartheid and its practice by the Pretoria regime are roundly condemned by the international community. Thailand's consistent policy is well known to all  and my delegation will continue to demand the abrogation of apartheid by the Pretoria regime and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the black people in South Africa in accordance with the principle of majority rule and with respect for human dignity and equality.79.	By the same token  the international community has a stake  and an important role to play  in dealing with another humanitarian issue  namely  drug abuse. The Royal Thai Government intends to remain in the forefront  in co-operation with the international community  in its efforts to suppress opium cultivation and to interdict trafficking in illegal narcotics in the areas under its jurisdiction. While it is true that not all our efforts have been completely successful  we remain no less committed and determined. The task is made more difficult by the inability to curb demand  which is often the responsibility of another sovereign Government  and by the rugged terrain and the limited equipment in the hands of enforcement officers. Moreover  in the case of opium cultivation by hill tribesmen  any ill- considered actions in contravention of their age-old custom and belief should be avoided. Indeed  one can safely predict that if such precipitate actions were taken  they would be condemned by many people from the same country which now demands such actions.80.	The problem of drug abuse  if permitted to continue unabated  would become a time bomb that might ultimately lead to the debasement  and even the destruction  of man. Death would not be as rapid as in a nuclear war  but man would lose his reason for being long before death overtook him.81.	The world is still confronted with the unprecedented threat arising from a massive build-up of arms and competition in the qualitative refinement of weapons of all kinds. Furthermore  rapid advances in science and technology have made the extension of the arms race into the new dimension of outer space a very real possibility.82.	Negotiations  both within and outside the framework of the United Nations  to halt the spiralling arms race and reduce the risks of nuclear confrontation have not thus far made any significant progress. To this paralysis of multilateral negotiations is added the recent suspension of the bilateral talks between the two super-Powers on intermediate- range nuclear forces and strategic arms reduction issues. Moreover  the deterioration of the international situation provides added impetus to the arms race  thereby bringing the world closer to the brink of doom.83.	In view of the unabated escalation of the arms race and the dangers that confront the world today  disarmament has become more urgent and imperative than ever before. The Thai delegation fully shares the views expressed in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  the first special session devoted to disarmament  that  while the final objective should be general and complete disarmament under effective international control  the immediate goal must be the elimination of the dangers of nuclear war and the implementation of measures to halt and reverse the arms race. My delegation urges that all States  particularly the nuclear-weapon States  pursue as a matter of urgency negotiations on the implementation of the Programme of Action contained in the Final Document  taking into account the legitimate security interests of nuclear-weapon and non- nuclear-weapon States alike.84.	As a further step to advance the cause of disarmament  measures to halt and reverse the arms race should be complemented by other initiatives  such as the establishment of zones of peace. Such zones could strengthen the fabric of regional peace and stability and prevent extra regional interference  thereby creating conditions conducive to regional cooperation in economic and social development. In the light of this fact  Thailand and the other countries members of ASEAN will exert every effort to bring about the early establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.85.	In the same manner  Thailand supports an early convening at Colombo of the Conference on the Indian Ocean. My delegation urges that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean continue to make determined efforts to overcome the outstanding problems and finalize all preparations for the Conference in a timely manner.86.	Recent reports of the use of chemical and biological weapons in certain parts of the world  including South-East Asia  are an appalling reminder of the urgent need to control and eliminate this type of armament. In view of their inhumane and indiscriminate effects  my delegation is strongly opposed to the development  manufacture  stockpiling and use of these weapons in any circumstances. A comprehensive treaty banning such weapons  with adequate mechanism for verification  should be a matter of the highest priority in the ongoing work of the Conference on Disarmament.87.	On the eve of this session of the General Assembly  my delegation was encouraged to see some signs that the two super-Powers were more inclined towards a resumption of their bilateral arms talks. While it may be too optimistic to hope for a meaningful dialogue between them before the end of this year  it should be realized that time passes and with each passing day the risks of confrontation increase. In this connection  the tone set by President Reagan in his statement before the Assembly should further encourage us to renew our collective efforts in the quest for a world free from weapons of mass destruction. Such a step would indeed be a giant step for mankind.88.	If the world can be spared the immense costs of the arms race  then enormous amounts of resources can be released for such constructive uses as the economic and social development of the poorer countries.89.	The Thai delegation is conscious of the crisis at present affecting the global economy. While the underlying problems are structural in nature  interna-tional efforts to revitalize the development process in the developing countries are indispensable for sustained global recovery. In this regard  my delegation is convinced that such recovery and continued economic development are inseparable. My delegation therefore wishes to express its disappointment at the lack of progress towards the launching of global negotiations and to reiterate its call for their early inauguration. At the same time  we endorse the proposal for an international conference to re-examine the functioning and rules of the present international monetary  financial and trading systems and to bring them within the framework of global negotiations.90.	Since Thailand is a developing country heavily dependent on export earnings from food products  agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials for the financing of its development programme  it is concerned that in the past year commodity prices have dropped to their lowest levels in more than 30 years. Increasing recourse to protectionist measures  including export subsidies  quantitative restrictions and the use of other non-tariff barriers by the industrialized countries continues to accentuate the economic plight of the developing countries  to the detriment of trade growth and global economic recovery. The Thai delegation believes that verbal commitments to honour an open trade system must be followed by concrete actions to reduce trade barriers.91.	Protectionism in developed countries has imposed severe constraints on our food production and marketing  and too little attention has been paid to the impact of trade barriers on the problem of famine and malnutrition in the world at large.92.	Thailand is deeply sympathetic regarding the economic difficulties of the least developed and land-locked developing countries  which are the world's poorest and most disadvantaged. These countries include Thailand's neighbour  the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Many such countries  in Africa in particular  have to face serious famine and deprivation. Despite its limited resources as a developing country and despite its various commitments  Thailand has been able to provide modest assistance in the form of food aid and financial contributions  as well as technical assistance  to those nations most severely affected. Recognizing the seriousness of food shortages  particularly in Africa  my Government will look further into possibilities for bilateral co-operation with African countries in food production in order to promote self-sufficiency.93.	Regarding the question of energy  recent adjustments in fuel prices should not be regarded as diminishing the need for lasting and effective solutions to energy problems  including those of energy conservation and the utilization of alternative sources of energy. Investment  development and growth of production in the energy fields in the developing countries should also be encouraged. The Thai delegation supports the need for a sustained mobilization of international financial resources as a means of assisting the national efforts of developing countries in using domestic energy resources. My delegation also renews its call for the early establishment of the proposed energy affiliate of the World Bank and for an early implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of Mew and Renewable Sources of Energy.94.	With regard to the debt problem  Thailand feels that it not only imposes a burden on debtor nations but also constitutes a far-reaching constraint to world trade and recovery and contributes to the weakening of the international financial system. We were therefore disappointed at the failure of the London Economic Summit of the seven major industrialized countries  held from 7 to 9 June 1984  to address adequately the problem of debt and the whole range of problems besetting the majority of countries in the world  including trade liberalization  commodities and financial flows.95.	On science and technology  Thailand welcomed the agreement reached on 20 June 1983 on the establishment of the long-term financial and institutional arrangements for the United Nations Financing System tor Science and Technology for Development. Although the agreement falls short of world-wide expectations  it is hoped that successful collective efforts will be made to mobilize adequate resources for the system  to enable the long-term arrangements to take effect as soon as possible. The Thai Government stands ready to make a financial contribution to the arrangements.96.	As a founding member of the Group of 77  Thailand attaches high priority to the goals of collective self-reliance through economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  both within its own sub region and at the global level  under the aegis of the Caracas Programme of Action4 and the Buenos Aires Platform  respectively. In this connection  Thailand has recently played host to two technical meetings under the sponsorship of the Group of 77 and at the Group's request. One of the important outcomes was the establishment of an action committee on co-operation in fossil fuels  which is the first of its kind under the Caracas Programme of Action.97.	This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Group of 77. It is indeed a significant milestone in international co-operation. My delegation joins the other Members in extending its best wishes to the Group  as well as in thanking its chairmen  past and present  and their able staffs for their dedicated work on behalf of the Group  to which Thailand is proud to belong.98.	It is perhaps through lending one another a helping hand that we can best learn to experience the multilateral approach. The value of multilateralism cannot be gainsaid in a forum such as this  where leaders of so many countries have taken the trouble to be present.99.	This is an opportune moment to pay a well- deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  who has courageously appraised the role of the United Nations  noted its accomplishments and shortcomings  and added stature to his position during his relatively short tenure thus far.100.	In the conclusion to his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has reiterated his call for a multilateral and rational approach to the problems of international peace and development  and he states that:""It is widely understood that without such a system we shall run unacceptable risks and that it is therefore irresponsible to weaken the multilateral approach. Without the safety net which multilateral organization provides  the world would certainly be a much more dangerous and disorderly place.""101.	My delegation fully subscribes to his views. On the eve of the Organization's fortieth anniversary  the Thai delegation pledges its continued co-operation to you  Mr. President  and to the Secretary-General in the furtherance of the noble aims and objectives of the United Nations. Let the cry in this Hall be: ""Forty more years!"""
"135",6896,"TTO",39,1984,"ï»¿The delegation of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago extends its heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. The historical and cultural ties which have for so long existed between the Caribbean region and the great continent of Africa make your election to that high office a source of particular pride  delight and satisfaction to the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago. Your presidency over this world body is yet another manifestation of the contribution that small States and developing countries can and do make to the direction of the work of the United Nations. We are confident that your boundless diplomatic skill  wisdom and experience will contribute immensely to the success of the work that lies before this session of the Assembly.292.	My delegation pays tribute to the previous President of the General Assembly  Mr. Jorge illueca  of Panama  for his capable leadership throughout the thirty-eighth session  which has been successfully concluded.293.	The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago takes pleasure in congratulating Brunei Darussalam upon its admission as the 159th member of the United Nations. It is very gratifying to welcome to this family of nations yet another sovereign country  which marks an important step towards the universality of this body. We are confident that Brunei Darussalam  a sister island developing country  will make a significant contribution towards the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Organization.294.	It is already 22 years since the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago was welcomed into the United Nations. As a small and fledgling State emerging into an international environment of such complexity and beset by many conflicts  Trinidad and Tobago drew then  even as it draws now  great comfort from the system of collective security that is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Collective security was one of the main considerations which impelled us to seek entry into the Organization immediately upon our attainment of independence.295.	Trinidad and Tobago is guided by the conviction that resort to massive military expenditure  even where the financial and other means permit  is no guarantee of national security. By logical extension  such activity cannot promote international security. Security  national and international  in our view must derive from active co-operation by members of this world body. It must also be sustained by respect for the sovereignty of its individual Members  freedom and opportunity for members of the world community to pursue their socio-economic and political paths without external interference  and full respect by all States for the fundamental rights of their citizenry. It follows  therefore  that each State  large or small  has a role to play in the overall question of security  from which these stated principles derive.296.	The Charter of the United Nations explicitly and implicitly asserts these principles and promotes these objectives. For us  these objectives resolve into three essential elements: first  the maintenance of international peace and security; secondly  the achievement of international co-operation; and  thirdly  the resolution of international economic and social problems.297.	The attainment of these objectives constitutes for us fundamental imperatives and can be realized only by the full involvement and meaningful participation of all States as they bring to bear the particularities of their individual systems on the general thrust towards world stability. The role of small States in pursuit of this goal is particularly crucial. For too long  the rights and interests of small States have occupied a secondary position in the determination of international problems which at times involve their very existence. Small States must be heard; small States must be encouraged to make themselves heard; and small States must be allowed full opportunity to contribute to the resolution of all questions that affect their vital interests and to the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations.298.	In the field of international peace and security  the United Nations has avoided global conflagration  but has not achieved world peace; we have limited the spread of nuclear weaponry  but have not eliminated it. Through our continued efforts  we have sensitized the international community to the lethal consequences of more sophisticated armaments and mobilized world consciousness against their use. Developing countries  dwarfed in the power struggle of sophisticated weaponry  have raised their voices against the development of destructive arms  including chemical weapons  and condemned their use because of the dangers they pose to mankind. The voices of developing countries and small States have sustained a moral force against the use and proliferation of nuclear and other armaments. Without the cooperation and commitment of developed countries  however  we cannot succeed.299.	The achievements of the Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security in other areas appear more encouraging. The process of decolonization is almost complete  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV); the rights of the people of Palestine have been recognized; the choice of a means for settlement of the outstanding border question between Guyana and Venezuela has been referred to the Secretary-General in recognition of the central role of the ""United Nations in the peaceful settlement of disputes among nations; apartheid has been unequivocally condemned and must now be eradicated and excised from human memory; Namibia's right to independence and sovereignty has been recognized in spite of the ill-founded refusal of South Africa to abandon its illegal occupation of that Territory. The adoption in 1982 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea13 has been described as the most significant achievement in treaty-making by the United Nations since its inception. The Convention provides for peace and order in the management of the ""Ocean Commons"".300.	The origins of many of these achievements can be attributed to the initiatives by developing countries and small States. In the case of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  a single small State evoked the awareness of the international community concerning the need for order  collective security and co-operation in the global commons of the ocean. The recent history of the United Nations reveals that small States and developing countries have contributed importantly in shaping the perspectives of the Organization in the continuous process of its dynamic evolution.301.	However  a more careful scrutiny of the inter-national scene reveals that peace and security as global objectives continue to elude us.302.	Trinidad and Tobago has witnessed with grave concern the developments which have taken place in southern Africa over the last year  for they represent a new stage in Pretoria's entrenchment of apartheid within its borders and the extension of its sinister influence beyond them. We emphatically reject Pretoria's attempt to hoodwink the international community into believing that the tricameral constitution introduced last month represents a reform and relaxation of apartheid. The new constitution is clearly an attempt to divide the dispossessed non- white majority and refine and entrench the apartheid system. My delegation reiterates that apartheid cannot be reformed; it must be entirely dismantled.303.	The situation in occupied and exploited Namibia remains another source of deep concern. The Territory's formerly abundant natural resources are being rapidly dissipated  in contravention of Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia 14 enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia on 27 September 1974; and the United Nations plan for Namibian independence  endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978)  remains unimplemented. Indeed  my delegation has taken note of Pretoria's latest moves to bypass the plan and impose its own independence plan on Namibia by means of its protÃ©gÃ©  the Multi-Party Conference.304.	It is time for the Organization to put an end to the ceaseless machinations and prevarications of that repugnant regime and determine to deal with it in an effective and unequivocal manner in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.305.	The international scene continues to be strewn with obstacles  and certain enigmatic events challenge the very fabric of established and accepted Charter principles. Profligate expenditure by some States on armaments continues. The Middle East is in turmoil  and a potentially explosive war persists in Central America in spite of the worthy efforts of the Contadora Group; the situation in Afghanistan is still not resolved; the efforts of several groups to achieve a political settlement in Kampuchea have yet to bear success; and the problem of Cyprus remains unsettled. My Government is of the view that a just and lasting settlement of this question can come only through meaningful talks between the representatives of the two Cypriot communities  under the auspices of the Secretary-General and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions. More recently  the sanctity of sovereignty has again been violated.306.	The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago continues to reject unequivocally the threat or use of force as a means of settling disputes among States. The right to security  which  in our understanding subsumes the logical implication of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and inalienable rights of States to self-determination  has always and indeed remains the corner-stone of our foreign policy.307.	The refusal of some Member States to renounce and denounce recourse to war as the ""ultimate arbitration""  the related infringement of the territorial integrity and independence of States in defiance of Charter principles  and the all too frequent disregard for mechanisms aimed at the pacific settlement of disputes continue to give rise to an increasing number of events of crisis proportions. Moreover  the limited progress made in disarmament and the seemingly applied proposition that negotiation can proceed only from a position of strength is a zero-sum approach which guarantees only instability and increased political tension.308.	It is essential that a means be found to strengthen international peace and security and reduce international tension and great-Power rivalry so as to create a climate conducive to the birth of new international trust and confidence. Trinidad and Tobago calls on all States of this international community to assist in creating such a climate.309.	Concomitant with the political obstacles to the achievement of international peace are the systematic dysfunctional economic forces which pervade the international environment and frustrate the objective of international co-operation. We identify these forces as follows: the stagnation in the global negotiations; the inconclusive outcome of the North-South dialogue; the increasing protectionist measures adopted by States; the debt burden of the developing countries; the constraints encountered by small States and developing countries to participate more fully in the determination of necessary monetary and international economic reforms; and the adverse effects of these constraints on the efforts by developing countries towards economic and technical cooperation.310.	The age of high technology has brought new threats to the sovereignty of nations  not solely by means of weapons of war  but through technology that can be diverted from peaceful uses. The development of space technology is undoubtedly a manifestation of the genius of mankind. However  while there are clear benefits for the development of nations in so far as natural resources are concerned  the technological gap between developed nations  as well as between developed and developing nations  can not only lead to dissatisfaction and conflict but can also undermine the sovereignty and security of developing nations. This is an area in which the international community must remain vigilant.311.	It is not that the world's resources are not adequate to support the needs of its peoples  but rather that these are unjustly distributed. It is not that independent developing countries themselves are not endowed with considerable natural resources and potential wealth  but rather that their utilization of these resources is manipulated by external influences over which they have no control.312.	There is dire need for the international com-munity to eschew the new arrogance and indifference that has emerged and to seize the opportunity to rededicate itself to the principles and objectives which gave rise to the noble experiments in international co-operation that followed the tragedy of the Second World War. International co-operation in our view is a sine qua non for the resolution of national and international economic and social problems. International peace cannot be achieved or sustained without socio-economic development. No Member State can deny  therefore  that any measure or combination of measures which erodes the well-being of citizens of the international community presents a threat to the achievement and maintenance of peace  inherently diminishes the role of co-operation and stultifies efforts at economic and social development.313.	The world economy  which has been in the grip of recession for the last few years  has shown some signs of recovery in some of the major Western industrialized countries. However  the recovery has not yet affected a wide-ranging influence on the world economy  and especially in the developing countries taken as a group. While some regions have been able to sustain growth  others  in particular Latin America and Africa  have found that conflicting influences at work within the system retard their attempts to achieve meaningful growth and development. In essence  the recovery has not succeeded in eliminating for developing countries the legacy of difficulties which has its genesis in the recession and in the outmoded structure of the international financial and trading systems.314.	The international economic history of the last decade has seen the emergence of a heightened appreciation of the relationship of interdependence which characterizes all inter-State behaviour. Whether or not we continue to argue about the precise dynamics of this relationship  the fact is that the world economy constitutes an ' entity. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago are therefore challenges and rejects the new mercantilism of increased protectionism and urges all States to abandon any search for economic national security that leads exclusively in that direction. We hold the view that the resolution of the economic difficulties with which international society is at present confronted requiresânay  demandsâa resort to co-operative and complementary measures and mechanisms.315.	During the last decade  the General Assembly called for the establishment of a new international economic order. That decision by the Assembly emanated from the limited successes of policies based on trade versus aid  import substitution  the establishment of regional integration movements and development decadesâall designed to resolve the development problems facing the international community. The call for a new international economic order is even more urgent today.316.	Among the central proposals for the creation of this new international economic order is the need to reformulate both the activities and the management structure of IMF and the World Bank. The fact is that the relative order and predictability that characterize the operation of an international system based on fixed exchange rates have fallen prey to the dynamics of the system itself. In addition  balance- of-payments disequilibria no longer typify only the temporary or deviant cases but have assumed a more permanent and entrenched aspect of today's economy. In a word  the structural dynamics of the international financial system have changed. We believe  therefore  that it is essential that the responses of those institutions which are the effective managers of that system accord with current realities. It is in this context that appeals for a new international economic order become more readily understood; and it is in this context also that the need for new management techniques and criteria should be developed and implemented.317.	My delegation would like at this time to present three observations with respect to IMF and its operations. We refer first of all to the apparent retreat by that body from the position of lender of early recourse to that of lender almost of last resort; secondly  to the burdens imposed by the demands of conditionality in return for assistance; and  thirdly  to the need to emphasize and ensure a strong developmental role for that institution  on whose functioning the prosperity of the international economy as a whole depends.318.	Implicit in the danger of what I term the retreat by the Fund to the position of lender of last resort is the additional stress that is placed on would- be debtor countriesâtypically  though not exclusively  the developing countries. Invariably  interest rates charged by the private international capital market are anything but concessional  and there is the danger in this practice of having the economies of debtor developing countries mortgaged to private financial institutionsâand that is only one of the dangers we see.319.	The burdens of conditionality imposed by IMF  in the form of required currency devaluations  the decrease or removal of welfare payments and subsidies  or whatever forms they assume  constitute sources of additional economic  social and political stresses which further inhibit the capacity of individual States to pursue their development objectives.320.	With respect to the World Bankâthe other pillar of the international financial establishmentâ my delegation notes that that institution  as a result of the prevailing favourable interest rate structure  has amassed an excess of income over expenditure mounting to some $600 million in the course of its 1983 operations. Does that signal both quantitative and qualitative increases in the assistance to be granted in future to developing countries by that agency? We look forward to a more flexible and diversified pattern of assistance to developing countries on terms which are effectively concessional  which take into account the low level of prices for their primary products and which will reduce the volume of the net capital flows away from less endowed countries to the World Bank and the already developed countries.321.	It is in the context of this severe picture of international co-operation and socio-economic development that the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago fully supports the attempts made by countries members of the Group of 77 to establish a ""South Bank"" in the nature of a development bank to be responsive to the particular needs of developing countries.322.	The proposed establishment of a ""South Bank"" draws attention to the capital-deficient status of the countries of the third world. In our time  the problem of the international indebtedness of developing countries imposes a burden and an immense constraint on the pursuit of objectives aimed at economic and social development. The plight of some members of our region in terms of the amortization of their accumulated international financial obligations gives rise to the gravest concern. The combination of this factor with the effects of protectionism  the ravages of  for the most part  imported inflation and the fluctuation and essential deterioration of international commodity prices threatens to condemn those countries to a state of penury and to a degrading and burdensome subjection within the international community. Such a situation still supports the aims and purposes of the United Nations. My delegation therefore expresses the hope that appropriate measures will be adopted by the community of nations to eliminate this obvious danger to international peace  co-operation and development.323.	The search for a new international economic order has led to initiatives in the areas of food  population  trade and a host of other concerns which have plagued the international community for decades. Almost invariably the quest for solutions to these problems or problem areas took the form of an international conference generally sponsored by the United Nations.324.	Today  with members' permission  I should like to confine my remarks in this general area to a clear and unmistakable trend which has emerged in the management of global resources in the context of a new international economic order. The signing by the overwhelming majority of States of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seaâthe Montego Bay Convention  as it is more generally knownâis evidence of the general endorsement by the community of nations of a new international economic order.325.	Part XI of the Montego Bay Convention deals with the ""Area""  which is the term applied to the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  and  in article 136 of the Convention  the Area and its resources are stated to be ""the common heritage of mankind"". In article 157  the Convention vests the organization and control of activities in the Area in an International Sea-Bed Authority  particularly with a view to administering the resources of the Area. My delegation considers the consolidation of the common heritage as enshrined in the Convention a matter of absolute necessity. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago would condemn any action which was calculated to subvert or in any way frustrate the spirit or the letter of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.326.	This overview of the international scenario brings into relief three major issues. The first points to the need to renew  redouble or redesign international initiatives aimed at the resolution of the problems related to the achievement of peace  cooperation and development. The secondânecessarily related to the firstâis the need to revitalize  if not refurbish  the machinery at our disposal for the attainment of these tasks. The third has as its main thrust the need to incorporate more fully the participation of developing States and of small developing countries in particular  for which the activities of the United Nations have the greatest relevance  in the decision-making process and in the general management of the pursuit of peace  security and development.327.	This is particularly relevant to us as members of a world body which has proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. Peace for us implies more than a cessation of conflict and a dismantling of armament. Peace for us involves respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the equality of States  large and small. Above all  peace for us means removal and eradication of structural violence  the causes of which are rooted in the social ills of discrimination and the developmental ills of poverty  misery  ill health  hunger and frustrated socio-economic aspirations. Let us target these essential goals in a combined effort towards the achievement of true peace through international co-operation.328.	In this combined effort towards the achievement of peace  my country aspires to make a more effective contribution. My delegation is of the view that there is an important role to be played by small States in the revitalization of the United Nations and in the securing of peace and economic prosperity and welfare through co-operation. Small States cannot harbour pretensions to power and military might  even if these were desirable goals. Thus  in our interaction with other members of the international community  we rely on the force of international law and of international morality.329.	For Trinidad and Tobago  non-alignment is a cardinal principle of our foreign policy. We have pursued its tenets in our actions in the regional bodies to which we belongâthe Caribbean Community  the Commonwealth  the Organization of American Statesâand in the wider international forums. Trinidad and Tobago holds firmly to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and sees as one of its major objectives the strengthening and enhancing of the role of the Organization the better to serve the interests of Member States. The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago seeks to be allowed to participate more fully in efforts to establish and maintain international peace and security and a general climate in which international development can flourish.330.	We appeal to all other Members of the United Nations to work together in this quest for peace and  in so doing  bequeath to succeeding generations a legacy that is worthy of the dignity of man. Trinidad and Tobago stands ready to serve."
"136",6942,"TUN",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me  Sir  to add my congratulations to all those already extended to you on the occasion of your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. By unanimously entrusting that responsibility to you  the Assembly is paying a tribute to your great qualities and honouring your country  with which Tunisia maintains friendly  trusting and harmonious relations.77.	We are sure that your authority  your competence and your vast experience of international relations will be of invaluable assistance in guiding our debates and our decisions and will thus ensure a positive outcome for our deliberations. The Tunisian delegation pledges you its full co-operation as you perform this noble mission.78.	Allow me to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for his out-standing work throughout his term of office  and particularly in its most difficult moments.79.	I should like also to extend our warm congratulations to the Secretary-General for the tireless efforts he has been making to put an end to the conflicts which are raging in various parts of the world and for the report on the work of the Organization  a remarkably lucid and realistic report  which he recently submitted to this Assembly.80.	Finally  I should like to welcome into our midst Brunei Darussalam  which has just become a Member of the United Nations. We rejoice at the admission of this new Member at a time when this international body particularly needs the contribution of all the nations of the world in order to take up the many challenges that face it.81.	It is not succumbing to discouragement and to despair to emphasize the steady deterioration of the environment in which we live and the virtual inability of the international community to alter the dangerous course of events in any way. It is also disturbing to note the paralysis which is steadily gripping the United Nations in the vital sphere of the maintenance of international peace and security  for which the Organization is responsible under its Charter. Of course  we are all aware of the extent of the problems we face and of their complexity  but is this any reason for giving up hope and taking no action?82.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  monologue has followed monologue. Tension in East- West relations  far from abating  is still dangerously present. We are caught up in a crisis. Almost everywhere we look  there is deadlock.83.	The Soviet-United States Strategic Arms Reduction Talks  which have been suspended for months  seem unlikely to resume soon. In Europe  deployment of missiles is met with counter-deployment. The ""super"" arms race is resuming its diabolical course  extending to space itself. In fact  the militarization of space  which yesterday was something out of science fiction  is today a reality which adds a new dimension to the arms race and to the risks of global conflagration.84.	Rather than being resolved  the regional conflicts besetting the countries of the third world are growing worse  becoming entrenched over the years and thereby creating intolerable situations for the peoples who have to bear them. These local conflicts are indeed running sores which threaten the peace and security of the regions in question  thus opening the way for foreign intervention and super-Power rivalry.85.	At a time when the two super-Powers seem disposed to consult one another about these conflicts  let us hope that they will remember that the parties to a conflict are those most concerned and that any solution which does not take their interests into account  or which is achieved at their expense or without their participation  is bound to fail in the long run. Past and present history abounds in lessons to this effect.86.	The situation in two non-aligned countries  Afghanistan and Kampuchea  has for several years now  unfortunately  provided us with a graphic illustration of this state of affairs. In this connection  Tunisia reaffirms its support for the search for any solution which would guarantee the independence  neutrality and freedom of choice of those two countries  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  which call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and an end to all interference in their internal affairs.87.	The Palestinian people  whether living under Israeli tyranny in the occupied territories or in their Diaspora  are distressed to see the chances of peace receding daily. The hope of some Palestinians for a change of Government in Israel that would bring about a more flexible policy has yet to materialize. In fact  we have seen the legalization of Fascist and racist movements known for their excessive demands on the populations of the occupied territories. Those extremist movements today proclaim openly their intention of expelling the Arab inhabitants from the territories where their ancestors dwelt for centuries.88.	Is it conceivable that a State Member of the United Nations should be able  through the oppression and exclusion of a section of its population which it regards as second-class citizens  to appropriate their land and their property?89.	If every peace initiative has come up against Israel's implacable intransigence  this is because over the years that country has been able to count on substantial economic and military aid  as well as unreserved diplomatic support  from its alliesâfactors which have reinforced it in its attitude.90.	If Tel Aviv is opposed to any just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question  based on the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to create their own State  in accordance with United Nations resolutions  it is because such a solution is incompatible with the expansionist concept of ""Greater Israel""  which Israeli leaders are implementing by rapidly building settlements in order to create an irreversible situation.91.	Rejection of a Palestinian State  refusal to negotiate with the PLO  refusal to return to the borders of 1967  refusal to put a freeze on settlements  refusal to accept any initiative for a peaceful settlement no matter whence it comes  including the plan proposed by President Reagan of the United States-âthis is neither more nor less than the programme of the Israeli Government.92.	Since 1967  more than a third of the land in the West Bank has come under the control of the occupying authorities  to which must be added the seizure of water resources  the population's use of which is subject to Draconian restrictions.93.	This is the face of Israeli expansionism  which is today the main obstacle to the advent of genuine peace in the region. Is it conceivable that a State Member of the United Nations should be able to continue to flout international legality with complete impunity? What we have here is a paradoxical situation which is contrary to ethics  international law and the very principles of the Charter of the United Nations and which undermines the credibility of the Organization.94.	Since the signing of the Camp David accords  the prospect of settling the Palestinian problem has become increasingly remote  despite the various attempts made to secure a just and lasting peace in the region.95.	Tunisia  for its part  while reaffirming its support for the Arab peace plan contained in the Final Declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  adopted at Fez on 9 September 1982 believes that any effort in favour of a just and lasting peace in that region warrants consideration by the international community. It makes an urgent appeal to the United Nations  and in particular the permanent members of the Security Council  which have the right of veto and occasionally abuse it  to shoulder their responsibility to end the violence which continues to buffet this region and to contribute to a rapid resumption of the peace process  based on right and justice.96.	In Lebanon  Israel's leaders have learned from their past mistakes no lessons for their present behaviour. The so-called ""Peace in Galilee"" operation having failed  they are now trying their best to isolate southern Lebanon  where the Lebanese resistance is carrying on a bitter struggle against them. This area  which represents approximately a third of Lebanese territory  has been cut off from the rest of the country  with the help of control installations  and left to the tyranny of the Israeli military administration. What is more  Israel is now putting into effect a plan to divert the waters of Lebanon's rivers for its own use  in defiance of the rules of international law.97.	The international community must do all it can to put an end to Israeli interference in Lebanon's affairs; it must call on Israel to withdraw its army immediately from southern Lebanon  in conformity with Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982).98.	In solidarity with that fraternal country  Tunisia reaffirms its full support for Lebanon's territorial integrity and independence. It pledges its support for all the efforts that country is making to bring about the indispensable national reconciliation which is the best guarantee of its security and stability.99.	The armed conflict between Iraq and Iran  two neighbouring countries  has been raging for four years now  causing the loss of countless lives and the destruction of the economic potential of both countries. It is high time that this fratricidal war was ended  especially since Iraq has agreed to an immediate cease-fire  under United Nations supervision  and to embark on the path to a peaceful settlement of the dispute in accordance with the principles of international law and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and other organizations.100.	The continuance of this war  which threatens to envelop the whole of the troubled region  brings the threat of internationalization of the conflict closer. Hence the urgent need to halt this dangerous process and to resume efforts to make the parties to the conflict commit themselves to solving their dispute around the table  either directly within the framework of the United Nations or through mediation.101.	Africa  which is beset by development problems compounded by climatic phenomena such as drought and desertification and where broad sectors of the population still suffer from malnutrition and disease despite the continent's tremendous potential wealth  aspires to a climate of peace and stability in order to be able to devote all its energies to developing its resources and promoting the well-being of its peoples. Conflicts persist  however  sometimes fuelled by East-West rivalry.102.	The recent developments in southern Africa raise questions and arouse certain misgivings. Although we understand their motivation  this should not be a reason for relaxing the constant  vigilant efforts undertaken at the international and regional levels by the United Nations and the OAU to bring about the liberation of Namibia and the eradication of apartheid. Nor should it be a reason for undermining the just struggle of the national liberation movements  for which Tunisia reaffirms its full support.103.	In the case of Namibia  Tunisia reaffirms its support for the efforts being made within the United Nations to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which remains the corner-stone of any just and lasting settlement of this question. The delaying tactics used and the arbitrary pre-conditions set by Pretoria to impede that country's accession to independence cannot deceive anyone or prevent the inevitable liberation of the Namibian people.104.	We believe it is necessary  therefore  that a final date be set for Namibia's independence. As for the sham elections to which Pretoria resorted  the people concerned reserved for them the fate they deserved  despite the bloody repression to which they continue to be subjected.105.	Nearer to us  there has been no progress in the situation in Western Sahara  which constitutes a source of uncertainty and instability in the region. Tunisia  which has repeatedly expressed its concern at the stalemate on this question  urgently appeals for a peaceful and lasting solution  in accordance with the resolutions of the OAU.106.	Tunisia would like to see a lasting solution to this question. It remains convinced that such a solution would make a positive contribution towards bringing peace and stability to our region and  above all  opening the way for the building of the Greater Maghreb  which is a historic aspiration of our peoples.107.	It might be useful to recall here what I stated before the Assembly last year  at the thirty-eighth session  regarding the essential principles on which Tunisia has based its policy for joint action by the Maghreb countries. Those principles are none other than mutual trust  good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  mutual consultation on questions of common interest and the promotion of our co-operation on a sound and careful basis far removed from the politics of axes and alliances. This is the spirit of the treaty of concord and brotherhood concluded between Tunisia  Algeria and Mauritania  which we see as a basis for firm ties governing relations among all the countries of the Maghreb without exception. Tunisia welcomes the positive results achieved by this judicious approach and is optimistic as to its future prospects. It remains convinced that concord  harmony and a communion of effort to ensure progress  development and prosperity will in the long run surmount short-term obstacles and divisions; such is the wish of our peoples; such is the course of history.108.	As for the recent developments in the situation in Chad  Tunisia  which has always advocated a peaceful solution of the problems of that sister country  free from all outside interference and in accordance with the principles of international law and the Charter of the Organization of African Unity  welcomes the agreement reached between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and France on the withdrawal of their respective forces from the territory of Chad. We hope that this initiative will contribute to the national reconciliation of the Chadian people and to the rebuilding of their country in unity  brotherhood and peace.109.	The economic situation of the countries of the third world remains uncertain and continues to cause us grave concern. Some  however  seem to be more concerned at the admittedly excessive indebtedness of the countries of the South than at the tremendous difficulties which most of those countries are now facing. It is obvious that the external debt problem would not have reached such proportions if the debt- servicing ratios had not increased dramatically as a result of the steady deterioration in terms of trade  the contraction of export marketsâcaused  it must be said  by protectionist measuresâand the upward spiral of interest rates  which is due particularly to the fact that this debt is expressed mainly in terms of United States dollars.110.	While the developing countries grapple with insoluble financial problems as a result of this debt foreign assistance levels have not risen since 1980. We are prompted to fear a breakdown in the process of international co-operation  which would threaten the financing of the long-term growth of many third- world countries. In fact  the IDA is facing serious financing difficulties. The North-South dialogue is becoming more and more like a plea by the industrialized countries in their own defence than a constructive exchange of views among partners concerned at trends in the world economy. The third-world countries feel very strongly that relations of power continue to impose their law on the international economy. There is no easy solutionâthat is clearâ but calls for realism and patience must not serve as an alibi to cover up the dangerous disparities in international economic relations.111.	Although there has been a slight resumption of growth in some industrialized countries  a development that we welcome  we believe that a lasting recovery in the world economy depends on a bold policy of development assistance.112.	It is encouraging to note that some Western European industrialized countries  notably Norway  the Netherlands  Sweden and Denmark  devote more than 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to development assistance.113.	At a time when annual development assistance has remained unchanged since the beginning of this decade at a total volume of $33.6 billion  the military budgets of the main industrial Powers are growing significantly. When one knows that a million dollars a minute is spent on weapons throughout the world  one realizes the extent of this financial haemorrhage in the name of a security which still remains precarious. We might wonder what the point of such sacrifices is if they do not bring increased security for those who bear their weight  especially since the increase in the number of nuclear weapons poses a threat of unprecedented seriousness to the survival of mankind. The security of our planet is not limited to the search for a strategic arms balance; it also has an economic and social dimension which is vitally important to all peoples.114.	Thus  concerted action consistently to reduce military spending and the allocation of the resources transferred to development assistance would do more to ensure security in the world than the most sophisticated weapons. Finally  this revival of the arms race is the detriment of development today places the third world in a kind of ""armed peace"" which is prejudicial to understanding and international co-operation.115.	The African countries  which are facing considerable economic difficulties  are suffering more than others from this dramatic state of affairs in our world. The initiative taken recently by the Secretary- General to provide assistance to the worst affected African countries is proof of the gravity of the economic problems affecting our continent and has also helped to make world public opinion aware of the grave situation in the African countries and the sufferings of millions of African men  women and children.116.	We hope that the efforts made and the measures taken will not be limited to the immediate and urgent problems but will extend to the solving of structural and future problems obstructing the development of the African continent.117.	As long as the problems of the third world continue to be viewed through the distorting lens of East-West rivalry or understood in terms of strategy  there is absolutely no likelihood of a satisfactory settlement. Quite the opposite is likely. These problems must be dealt with through an increase in international co-operation  which presupposes a global political vision based on solidarity and the need for interdependence which nations would genuinely have to assume. That is why we need to see an improvement in the international climate.118.	We do not believe in the inevitability of permanent confrontation. If detente is on the wane  that is because it was confined to Europe  whereas zones of tension and conflict persist in other regions of the world.119.	For all its imperfections  the United Nations remains the best framework for resuming the dialogue with a view to reconciling points of view and injecting the necessary minimum of understanding into international relations. Peace is an irresistible aspiration of all peoples. However  it can be established on a lasting basis only if there is the broadest possible consensus implying justice and the freedom of choice of peoples."
"137",6989,"TUR",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your well-known qualities as an eminent statesman of Africa and your dedication as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia to its independence and the eradication of the abhorrent practice of apartheid will contribute to the success of our work. I also wish to express our thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama.133.	It gives me particular pleasure to reiterate on behalf of my Government our full confidence in the Secretary-General. His exceptional leadership  impartiality  foresight and dedication are a source of admiration and respect all over the world.134.	I also wish to extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam  as the newest Member of the United Nations.135.	The agenda of this session contains important items which reflect not only the concerns but also the expectations of the international community. My Government pledges its full support for every effort aimed at improving the international climate and promoting the search for the peaceful settlement of existing problems.136.	The principles of Turkish foreign policy are strongly opposed to oppression  colonialism and racial discrimination. Consequently  we remain deeply concerned about the intolerable and dangerous situation in southern Africa.137.	In Namibia  we are still confronted with one of the last  but most important  vestiges of colonialism  illegal occupation and repression. The process of independence for Namibia is at present passing through a critical stage. Further delay in implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will aggravate the political situation and the troubles in and around Namibia. In this regard  we commend the valuable and untiring efforts of the Secretary- General to make possible the full implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Turkey resolutely supports the legitimate and just struggle of the people of Namibia for their independence  under the leadership of SWAPO.138.	Turkey also strongly condemns the policy of apartheid pursued in South Africa  a policy which constitutes the most abominable form of racial discrimination  and it appeals to all Member States to unify their efforts against this inhuman practice.139.	I should also like to mention a positive development in Africa. My Government welcomes the recent agreement on military disengagement in Chad and hopes for its early implementation.140.	The situation in the Middle East continues to cause grave concern. Tension and conflict persist  and unfortunately there is still not much room for optimism about a negotiated settlement. The plight of the Arab Palestinian people continues unabated; while Lebanon is still searching for the opportunity to reassert its sovereignty over its territory and is trying further to pursue the process of national reconciliation and reconstruction.141.	Turkey is naturally concerned about the tense situation in the region. We see Turkey's role as one of stability  peaceful change and progress. Its historical and cultural heritage  its geographic location and the Western values it has adopted put it in a unique position to play this role.142.	The question of Palestine occupies centre stage in the Middle East political arena and is today  as it has been for more than three decades  among the high-priority items on the agenda of the United Nations. The Organization  through numerous resolutions  has firmly supported the right of self-determination of Arab Palestinians and the creation of an independent Palestinian State  without which no settlement can be just and enduring. It is therefore important that Israel should withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. Israel should comply with its obligations under the relevant international conventions as the occupying Power and respect the human rights of the people in the occupied territories. Israel must not be allowed further to modify the demographic character and institutional structure of these territories. To put it simply  unless their homeland remains intact  Arab Palestinians will not have the territory upon which to establish their State.143.	The Government of Turkey is of the view that the opportunities created by the Fez plan contained in the Final Declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  adopted on 9 September 1982  and by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  should now be judiciously pursued. In this connection  we support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  as endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 38/58 C. There is considerable support for such a conference. We hope that the Secretary-General can make progress in assisting its preparation through appropriate initiatives. Needless to say  the PLO must participate in the conference on an equal footing with the other parties.144.	In the context of the grave problems of the Middle East region  we wish to underline once again our deep concern over the precarious situation in Lebanon. Israel has repeatedly been called upon to put an end to its violations of the human rights of the population in southern Lebanon. Israel must promptly withdraw from Lebanon as a first and essential step in the process of Lebanese reconciliation and rehabilitation. We are encouraged by the recent moves for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. The Lebanese people have already endured untold suffering and losses. They should be left alone  free from foreign interference. A united  sovereign and territorially integral Lebanon is indispensable for the overall stability of the region. We are all under an obligation to help the Lebanese people achieve that goal.145.	The war between Iran and Iraq is yet another major source of tension and danger in the region. Turkey  a neighbour of the two countries  with equally close ties with both  is very much distressed by the loss of human lives and material devastation inflicted by the war. The potential in the conflict for unpredictable developments remains high  and there is always the danger of escalation. We again call on both sides to end the war. Turkey is prepared to assist and to contribute to a settlement under conditions mutually acceptable to Iraq and Iran. We also support other initiatives that enjoy the confidence of the two parties  and  in particular  express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts.146.	We continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. The determination of the Afghan people to live in freedom is praiseworthy. We applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General to obtain a negotiated political settlement. The Afghan people must be able to exercise its right to self-determination  and the Afghan refugees must be allowed to return to their country in safety. Such a settlement should restore Afghanistan's independence and non- aligned status by ensuring the withdrawal of foreign military forces. We also express our appreciation to the Government of Pakistan  which  despite its limited means  provides shelter and humanitarian assistance to the Afghan refugees  and our satisfaction over its positive and co-operative approach to a peaceful settlement.147.	The situation in Kampuchea is another matter which deserves the constant attention of the international community. An early political settlement involving the withdrawal of all foreign troops from that country  the cessation of all foreign influence in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and the restoration of independence based on the right of self-determination  is imperative. Turkey highly appreciates the efforts of the members of the Association of South- East Asian Nations towards a peaceful solution of this important problem  which endangers peace and stability in the region.148.	I should also like to touch upon the situation in the Korean peninsula  which remains unchanged. We are convinced of the need for a speedy resumption of the dialogue between the parties concerned in order to settle the Korean Question by peaceful means. In this context  we greatly value the initiatives of the Government of the Republic of Korea designed to bring about a dialogue. There is also an important role to be played by the United Nations  which has long been directly involved in the issue. In this connection  we are convinced that a better atmosphere of peace  reconciliation and understanding would be fostered by admitting the parties directly concerned to this universal body.149.	In spite of the most welcome signs of the development of the democratic process in Latin America  the present situation in Central America remains tense. The aggravation of the political atmosphere and the acute economic and social difficulties in the region have a negative impact on international relations. In this respect  we fully support the efforts of the Contadora Group in the search for a peaceful  negotiated solution to the conflicts in the region.150.	We believe that law and order must be established and that the aspirations of these nations to live and develop under democratic pluralistic regimes respectful of basic human rights must be fulfilled.151.	We should like to commend the Secretary- General for his recent efforts concerning Cyprus. My government is pleased with the reactivation of the search for a negotiated settlement. We consider the high-level proximity talks which began on 10 September within the framework defined at Vienna to be a constructive step forward. We sincerely hope that the current initiative of the Secretary-General will lead to the resumption of the direct negotiating process between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides on the existing  mutually agreed basis  we are encouraged by the information from the Secretary-General that in their first round the proximity talks have been thorough  serious  business-like and conducted in a constructive spirit. I take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring and skilful efforts to bring about a lasting solution to the Cyprus question.152.	Today there is an absolute need for careful but imaginative action to exploit the opportunity that has been created for a compromise in Cyprus with the introduction by the Secretary-General  at Vienna  of the ""working points"". Whatever reasons may still divide the two communities  there is no excuse for delaying the resumption of the direct negotiating process. Both sides stand to gain much more from negotiations than from rhetorical exchanges and propaganda activities. The time has come for the two Cypriot sides to make renewed efforts in their challenging task of reshaping their relations as equal partners in a bi-communal  bi-zonal  federal framework. We welcome the fact that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  for its part  has declared its readiness to make every effort to this end. Its positive approach to the Secretary-General's initiative  both in procedure and in substance  has been a step in the right direction. However  this constructive attitude of the Turkish Cypriot side has yet to be reciprocated. This  in our view  is the key to progress.153.	My Government will continue to encourage the negotiating process and lend its support to the Secretary-General's mission of good offices entrusted to him by the Security Council in paragraph 6 of its resolution 367 (1975) of 12 March 1975.154.	International terrorism threatens mankind and the normal conduct of international relations. Its well-established links with international arms and drug smuggling indicate the extent of this threat. Therefore  it is not enough to take appropriate measures individually at the national level  which Turkey has successfully done  to eliminate this problem. It is also necessary for States to assume international obligations to prevent the use of their territory for acts of terrorism against other States. The perpetrators of such crimes should not be allowed to find shelter in other countries. In this regard  Turkey strongly believes that terrorism in all its forms can only be eliminated through close and effective international co-operation.155.	Consequently  as an important aspect of this global problem  we find the item in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly entitled ""Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection  security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives"" most appropriate for the affirmation of this commitment.156.	Turkey notes with satisfaction the resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives  who have increasingly been subjected to terrorist attacks  and the decision taken to alert world opinion to the Organization's important role and activities in this area. We look forward to the implementation and further elaboration of these resolutions and decisions.157.	The reversal of the recessionary trend in the world economy since the end of 1982  the resumption of growth in the industrial countries  the further slowing of inflation in the developed market economies and a notable reduction in the current account deficit of the non-oil-producing developing countries compared with the preceding several years have been favourable developments for the recovery of the world economy in 1984.158.	Despite these significant positive signs  difficult economic problems faced by the developing countries remain unsolved. Developing countries  and especially the least developed one  are unable to resume their growth process  which has been severely affected by the prolonged global recession. Already weakened by serious structural problems  such as rapid population growth  unemployment  high rates of inflation  declining per capita income and low levels of production and exports  developing countries are faced with decreasing demand in the developed world  weak terms of trade for their primary commodities  restricted access to world markets  and a heavy burden of external debts and high interest rates. This trend has forced many developing countries to adopt restrictive policies and austerity programmes  reducing budget deficits  slowing the growth of the money supply  restraining wage increases and scaling back subsidies to combat inflation. But the continued decrease of their net total savings and of their imports hampers their growth. Sustained growth of the world economy is the only viable long-term solution for most of the current problems.159.	It is difficult for any country  whether rich or poor  large or small  to isolate itself from the rest of the world. It is against this background that intensified co-operative efforts among nations and institutions  both public and private  are needed to overcome our common problems. We must seek short- and long-term measures to reduce protectionist barriers and expand international trade  support and strengthen the multilateral mechanisms for the transfer of financial and technical assistance to developing countries and give due consideration to enhancing the quality and level of their human and natural resources.160.	In this connection  we highly appreciate the London Economic Declaration  issued at the London Economic Summit  held from 7 to 9 June 1984  and the intention of the seven major industrialized countries to spread the benefits of the world recovery widely to developing countries  especially to the least developed ones  which stand to gain more from a sustained growth of world economy.161.	Turkey  on the basis of mutual benefit  participates actively in enhancing economic relations with developing countries. We are convinced that tangible and realistic results of the economic co-operation among the developing countries  in particular on a regional level  can establish reliable bases for a genuine and comprehensive dialogue on a much larger scale. Likewise  Turkey supports all constructive and practical proposals initiated by developing countries for adjusting similar structural difficulties with a view to providing effective solutions.162.	Finally  a certain convergence of views between the North and the South has emerged in a number of international forums. What is needed now is the political will to translate ideas into action. Such political will is especially needed to resolve the debt problems of the developing countries  which constitute a tangible major threat to the stability of international economic relations.163.	Many speakers here have urged global initiatives rather than interim measures to avert a collapse of the international financial system and to buy time for the developing countries.164.	Turkey believes that the principal responsibility for development lies first with the developing countries themselves. They must realize that sound economic policies are a sine qua non for their steady and healthy progress in this field. Turkey is one county which has had experience in successfully adjusting its economy during the global recession and in servicing its debt payments. It has expanded its exports  benefiting also from the possibilities of South-South trade  and it has adopted policies aimed at restoring the balance of the main economic aggregates. Turkey's success in implementing these policies can well be taken as a good example.165.	Turkey's efforts  like those of other developing countries  to continue its expansion of exports are hampered by the protectionist trends in the developed countries. These trends  we believe  could be reversed not only through the early resumption of new comprehensive  multilateral trade negotiationsâwhich should cover all items  such as agricultural commodities  manufactured goods and servicesâbut also through the implementation of the already existing commitments.166.	We believe that adopting an objective approach in all economic fields would pave the way for a comprehensive and constructive exchange of views on world economic issues. We hope  in this context  that a realistic consensus will emerge for the launching of global negotiations within the framework of the United Nations.167.	One of the overriding concerns of mankind is arms control and disarmament efforts. The arms race drains the scarce resources of nations and brings about instability and insecurity in international relations. The developing countries especially are in need of these resources for their economic and social development  which can only be accomplished in a safer and more stable international environment.168.	Turkey's objective is and remains to have an adequate defence capability  as well as balanced and verifiable arms control and arms reduction steps  in conjunction with a policy of dialogue and confidence-building.169.	We are of the opinion that a commitment to rebuilding confidence among States is the most important prerequisite for the success of disarmament initiatives. The successful conclusion of the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the convening at Stockholm of the Conference on Confidence' and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe have yet to bring about the desired results.170.	We welcome the recent proposals made by President Reagan in his speech from this rostrum and also the recent contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union as a sign of hope for the future. The super-Powers bear a special responsibility in the field of arms control. They should resume  as early as possible  negotiations on nuclear armaments with a view to paving the way to progress in all other related areas. It is our earnest wish that this session of the General Assembly will mark the beginning of a turning-point in East-West relations  as well as of a better understanding between North and South."
"138",7051,"TZA",39,1984,"ï»¿72.	It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to see you  an illustrious son of Africa  occupying the post of President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. I congratulate you most sincerely. Your election is well deserved recognition of the vast diplomatic experience and stature which you have acquired in the course of many years of association with the United Nations. Your election is  at the same time  deserving recognition of your country  Zambia. Our two countries are linked  not only by territory  people and history  but also by a common resolve to struggle against oppression  colonialism and racism and to promote justice and the economic wellbeing of the deprived part of humanity  which is the greater part. This oneness of purpose and complementarity of efforts has joined us in the group of frontline States  the Southern African Development Coordination Conference  the OAU and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. In welcoming your leadership of this session  my delegation pledges its fullest cooperation.73.	I wish also to record the deep appreciation of my Government to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  who with dedication and competence so effectively conducted the proceedings of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly.74.	Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary General. It takes hard work  dedication and perseverance to ensure the smooth operation of the United Nations  especially at a time when the Organization is undergoing financial problems and facing crises of political confidence even vis-Ã -vis some of its own Members. We are pleased to note that he has shouldered his responsibility with commitment and resourcefulness.75.	My delegation is happy to join other delegations in extending a warm welcome to the new nation of Brunei Darussalam. Its admission brings us a step closer to the total eradication of the scourge of colonialism and towards the ultimate goal of universality of membership of the United Nations. We look forward to friendly relations with the Government of76.	Since the last session  the political and economic problems facing the international community have increased in complexity  critical initiatives have stagnated  and our capacity to provide hope to a weary world has diminished. Indeed  the enemies and critics of the United Nations have been reinforced by its apparent helplessness in the face of continuing conflict  insecurity and poverty in the world.77.	Perhaps our resolve is needed nowhere more than in southern Africa. Since the last session  there have been significant developments in the regionâ significant not because we have as a result of them come any closer to the elimination of apartheid or colonialism but because those developments have  in fact  been seized upon by the detractors of African freedom to retard the liberation struggle. The countries directly involved have put the present situation in its proper context and their statements before this Assembly stand for the record.78.	The history of South African oppression and aggression against the black people inside and outside South Africa is well known. In fighting the war in Mozambique and Angola  South Africa has wanted to create a buffer zone for apartheid. The triumph of the MPLA and FRELIMO in Angola and Mozambique  respectively  has obviously been a great blow to the sinister desire of the apartheid regime to surround itself either with economically dependent and totally submissive African States or with puppet governments.79.	Today  South Africa has not ceased to react to internal and external opposition to apartheid by seeking to control its neighbours through a variety of methods  including a combination of false promises  destabilization and outright military attacks and occupation.80.	The choice facing the countries of southern Africa is clear. Either they bow to the evil of apartheid or they must be prepared to become its victims. They have paid dearly for their commitment to the struggle against apartheid.81.	In this regard  Tanzania is deeply distressed that  out of the so-called concern for strategic  economic and security requirements  which in fact is a front for long held political misconceptions  a policy of acceptance of or accommodation with apartheid is now being assiduously fostered. The invitation to Prime Minister Botha to visit some Western European countries  as well as some of the statements we have already heard from this rostrum  is but another aspect of that policy.82.	The situation in southern Africa admits of no neutrality. In essence  apartheid represents a negation of our common humanity  which we seek to safeguard and foster by our commitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. The struggle against apartheid is  therefore  the responsibility of the international community as a whole and. not the burden of the countries of southern Africa alone.83.	That the apartheid regime is supposedly now ready to talk to the Governments of the countries of southern Africa which it thought it could obliterate at the time of independence is in itself a measure of the failure of the regime to subdue them. Yet  we reject the premise that these overtures by apartheid South Africa mean that it is now freedom loving or peace loving  for apartheid cm offer no peace to its victims  and neither can they. The victims of apartheid are primarily the black people of South Africa. If the racist regime is willing to talk peace  it is addressing the request for dialogue to the wrong people. Angola  Botswana  Swaziland  Lesotho  Mozambique or Zimbabwe do not threaten the South African regime. It is the black people inside South Africa that the regime has to settle with. South Africa has to talk with the people of South Africa through their national liberation movement. For its part  Tanzania reaffirms its total support for the South African liberation movement.84.	The events in southern Africa must continue to be seen in their true context of South African aggression and not with an assumed image of South Africa as a peacemaker. There can be no peace or accommodation with apartheid  and those who now echo the empty propagandistic pronouncements of the racist regime should know that they are in fact contributing to the undoing of all that has been achieved in the global campaign to isolate apartheid. To preach accommodation or neutrality with regard to racism is immoral and politically unacceptable. My President  Julius K. Nyerere  said in an address to the Fifth Summit of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference  held at Gaborone on 6 July 1984:""It is irrelevant that apartheid South Africa has strong allies and that the economic and military muscle of apartheid is sustained to a very great extent by Western States through trade and other forms of cooperation; apartheid remains immoral and any support given to South Africa is immoral. It is rejected by public opinion even in the very States which give support to South Africa  as well as the vast majority of the South Africans. Immorality is immoralityâeven when it has powerful supportersâand apartheid is immoral.""85.	For Namibia  we have a plan which has been accepted by the parties concerned and upon which there exists an international consensus. SWAPO  the frontline States  Africa and  indeed  the international community as a whole have invested a great deal of work  patience  hope and time in the evolution of the plan for the independence of Namibia. That plan would have been implemented several years ago but for the extraneous linkages and conditionalities mooted to thwart the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Let me reiterate my country's stand. We reject the use of the withdrawal of Cuban troops from the sovereign State of Angola as a bargaining chip in the implementation of the United Nations independence plan for Namibia. We also reject as illegal and unacceptable the continued occupation of southern Angola by South African troops  and we consider entirely reprehensible the attempt to tie the withdrawal of these aggressor troops to a ceasefire between the patriotic troops of SWAPO and the South African occupation forces in Namibia. We vigorously denounce the support given to the counterrevolutionary movement of UNlTA. We reaffirm our unremitting support for SWAPO  the sole and authentic representative of the struggling people of Namibia. If the patience of the colonized and oppressed people of Namibia is not to run out  if their faith  trust and confidence in the United Nations and in the solidarity of the international community are to be sustained  the United Nations plan should be implemented without further delay. In it is  the responsibility of the Western Five.  and particularly the United States  to see to it that the plan for the independence of Namibia is not further obstructed cannot be overemphasized.86.	The Saharan people continue to be denied their independence. We regret that  despite the existence of United Nations and OAU formulas for the self-determination and independence of the Saharan people  one party to the conflictâMoroccoâcontinues its obstructionist policies. We renew our appeal to the parties concerned  and in particular Morocco  to facilitate the work of the OAU Implementation Committee.87.	We are equally concerned about the future of the Comoros island of Mayotte. While we welcome the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and France  we urge the parties in question to expedite the negotiations for the eventual restoration of the national unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros.88.	In Chad  the fratricidal conflict persists with the regrettable de facto partitioning of that country. My Government has followed with keen interest the efforts of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to bring the warring parties to the conference table. We commend him for his tireless efforts. We appeal to the leaders of the contending Chadian groups to put patriotism first  to come together and to agree on a future for their country which preserves unity and territorial integrity and militarily excludes foreign interference and involvement.89.	In the Middle East  we believe that a comprehensive and lasting peace can be achieved only if Israel unconditionally withdraws from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and recognizes the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to establish an independent State of their own. Israel must end its illegal settlement policy in the occupied territories. The need for all States in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recognized borders should be acknowledged. Meanwhile  we reiterate our support for the PLO as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.90.	The war between Iran and Iraq  two nonaligned and developing States  has already caused tremendous devastation of human life and property. My Government has all along encouraged the mediation efforts of the United Nations  the Movement of Nonaligned Countries  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the individual countries which have offered their services in the search for an amicable resolution of the conflict. While we continue to encourage these efforts  we renew our earnest appeal to both Iran and Iraq to agree to a peaceful settlement. At the same time  we hope that all countries  particularly the major Powers  will desist from actions which might exacerbate the tensions in the region and widen the conflict.91.	Although the situation in the Middle East remains unsettled  my delegation is encouraged by the new spirit of reconciliation and national unity among the Lebanese people. This new spirit offers new hope for the future stability  national unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country. Therefore  we call upon the international community as a whole to give wholehearted encouragement and support to the Lebanese people as they embark on the arduous road of national reconstruction. That process should be facilitated by the immediate cessation of the Israeli military occupation of southern Lebanon.92.	In Cyprus  intercommunal differences  exacerbated by foreign involvement  have led to the current unfortunate state of division. In a statement issued at the time of the unilateral action on the part of the Turkish Cypriots  my Government regretted their unilateral declaration of independence. We hope that the Cypriot communities will continue negotiations within the framework of the good offices of the Secretary General with a view to finding a viable and lasting solution which will preserve the ethnic diversity  territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Cyprus. In this endeavour  however  those foreign countries most directly concerned  namely  Turkey and Greece  and the international community as a whole  should give the Cypriot people a genuine chance for dialogue and compromise. We hope the Secretary General will continue to offer his good offices for that objective.93.	Tanzania supports the efforts of the Korean people towards peaceful reunification of their homeland. We are encouraged by the steadily growing willingness of the two parts of Korea to initiate constructive dialogue.94.	Central America remains engulfed in war or the threat of war. The civil war in El Salvador continues  and the threats of foreign intervention in Nicaragua and the unprecedented arms build-up around its borders and along its shores continue to be a source of serious concern. Over the years  the Movement of Nonaligned Countries and the United Nations have reaffirmed the right of Nicaragua and all other countries of the region to live in peace  free from outside interference. We continue to see the persistent threat to the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of a Nicaragua as ensuing from the deliberate refusal of some countries outside the region to accept the existence of ideological pluralism in the region. It is in this context that Tanzania will continue to reject any attempts to infringe on the sovereignty of Nicaragua or to undermine the independence of that country. The right of each State to choose its social  economic and political system without outside interference must be respected.95.	The Government of Tanzania has supported the initiatives of the Contadora Group and  in particular  the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America  which the group has issued. The countries of the Contadora Group recognize that ideological pluralism is a reality in the region which must be accepted. These countries realize that respect for the right of peoples of the region to self-determination and political as well as economic independence are the firm basis for any successful negotiations among the countries involved for genuine and permanent arrangements for peace.96.	In Africa  as in many parts of the developing world  the refugee problem continues to preoccupy the Governments affected by the forced human migrations. More could have been achieved in terms of offering hope to the long-term needs of the refugees. We appreciate  none the less  the spirit of cooperation and generosity demonstrated at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva from 9 to 11 July 1984  by the Governments which responded readily and generously to the appeal of the Conference.97.	At the same time  we regard the Mexico City Declaration on Population and Development  adopted by the International Conference on Population  held from 6 to 14 August 1984 as providing a workable guideline for the future elaboration by countries of appropriate population policies  taking into account the particular circumstances of each country.98.	This session marks the tenth anniversary of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. This is also the tenth anniversary of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. The first review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade will be carried out at this session. These are all important policy instruments aimed primarily at the acceleration of the development of the developing countries and the promotion of cooperation among all members of the international community on the basis of sovereign equality  justice and interdependence.99.	Unfortunately  the international community has failed to turn these policy instruments into effective action. What we have witnessed over the last 10 years is a disappointing record of inconclusive negotiations and persistent inaction. This failure to take appropriate and timely action has plunged the world economy into a deeper crisis and severely strained North South relations. The deterioration in the economies of most developing countries has reached grave proportions. Severe balance of payments difficulties and unbearable debt burdens have become some of the most common features in most developing countries. And  while many developing countries  particularly in Africa  are suffering from an acute shortage of food  the preoccupation in Europe and North America is with reduction of supplies of foodstuffs in order to maintain farmers' incomes.100.	These are some of the realities of the present international order. But there are those who would wish to dismiss these lightly as third world problems. Their relationship to  and impact on  the economies of the developed countries are often ignored as if the North and the South lived in two isolated planets. Thus  for example  although developing countries take over one third of the exports from the European Economic Community  the relationship between high levels of unemployment in these industrialized countries and the diminishing import capacity of third world countries  caused by the collapse of the prices of the commodities they export  is hardly talked about! In his address to the Assembly last year  at the thirty-eighth session  my President stated: ""Economically  an impoverished customer is no good to a shopkeeper  a destitute man is no use to a farmer and a bankrupt creditor is a disaster for a bank."" These  too  are the realities of economic interdependence.101.	In order to achieve true interdependence  however  structural changes in the existing international economic system are imperative. This system has proved to be inappropriate not only for the development needs of the developing countries of the postcolonial era  but also to its own architects. A frank exchange on how to restructure relations between developed and developing countries is therefore needed as a key element in the revival of the world economy.102.	But  at a time when such a dialogue is urgently needed  we witness deliberate manoeuvres by a few developed countries to disrupt the very process of negotiation. Surprisingly  these are the same countries which 10 years ago made strong pleas for accommodation and cooperation and the need to avoid confrontation. Some of them even talked about ""global consensus for economic development"". Their actions today reveal the hollowness of such pleas. We know now that consensus and accommodation to them means acceptance of the policies of domination and exploitation of the majority by a few developed countries. When such policies have been overwhelmingly rejected by the international community  then the whole process of dialogue is regarded as ideological politicization of technical discussions. Their immediate reaction to the aspirations of the rest of the international community is to try to put an end to any kind of dialogue unless such dialogue is conducted in accordance with the wishes and the rules of the few wealthy nations. The wave of notices of withdrawal from this or that organization and the threats to withdraw financial support for certain organizations do not help to improve the climate of international cooperation either.103.	In short  we are faced with a conflict between a call by the majority of mankind for structural change towards justice and true interdependence and a desire by a few developed countries to protect the existing inequitable system of international division of labour. But change is inevitable. The question is whether it will be such as to advance the wellbeing of mankind in a shrinking world or to risk catastrophe  whether nations will share in and guide such change or have it forced upon them in a manner they may find much less manageable. There is la essential international character to the struggle for human equality and human dignity and to the search for lasting solutions to the world economic crisis and the war against poverty. Let us agree at this session to launch the global negotiations and pledge our resolve to work tirelessly for their successful conclusion.104.	While the political and economic problems cast a gloomy shadow on the future of the world  nothing puts its survival in greater jeopardy than the spiralling arms race. Since the last session  the world has seen the further deterioration of relations between the superpowers and the attendant resurgence of the politics of the cold war. New and more sophisticated weapons are being manufactured at an unprecedented rate  and concepts of limited nuclear war find expression in equally unprecedented military expenditures as the international situation unfolds the possibility of nuclear confrontation.105.	The politics of power are compounding the perceived sense of insecurity of countries and this  in turn  is fuelling the race for more weapons  including conventional weapons. The time has come to realize that the safety of the world depends on a courageous approach to the problems of arms control and disarmament  getting out of this vicious cycle of fear. In that approach  priority should be placed on nuclear disarmament  for it is nuclear weapons which pose the most immediate threat to the survival of mankind.â106.	Any stability  however  must necessarily include the nonnuclear weapon States  in particular third world countries. Their role in the scheme of global stability cannot be ignored because they also have an interest in self-preservation. Their participation in the decision-making is a prerequisite for the solution of the security and economic problems which beset the world today. It was in this context of both involvement and breaking the impasse in the nuclear arms negotiations brought about by the psychological barrier of mutual suspicion that my President  together with the leaders of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico and Sweden  issued a Joint Declaration on 22 May 1984  in which they called upon the five nuclear weapon States to halt all testing  production and development of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems and to agree to negotiate substantial reductions in their nuclear forces  with adequate verification measures. This measure towards general and complete disarmament should be complemented by measures to strengthen the United Nations system and to transfer the resources thus saved from the arms race to social and economic development. Today  I wish to repeat that call to the nuclear weapon States  and I hope that  in the interest of world peace  other countries will join us in petitioning those countries to negotiate.107.	The Indian Ocean continues to hold potential for big Power conflict. We call on the big Powers to respond positively to the desire of the littoral and hinterland States for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.108.	Present here at the United Nations are nations big and small  rich and poor  strong and weak. We are bound together by our common desire and resolve to nurture and preserve our collective freedom  independence and security. We all speak of peace  security and independence  and the Organization was established for the precise purpose of establishing these common ideals. We have heard a great deal about the diminishing moral authority of the United Nations. The influence of the United Nations has been questioned and its effectiveness is sometimes cynically dismissed. Admittedly  39 years after the United Nations was founded  the greater part of the world has seen little peace and little relief from the oppression of poverty. Yet  the world would be poorer without the United Nations  for there is no denying that it provides an essential instrument for pursuing the objectives of world peace  security and development. Nothing can diminish the nobility of the goals of the United Nations. Separately and together  we must work to strengthen it as an organization for the regulation and promotion of beneficial international relations. The Tanzanian delegation pledges its full cooperation in this worthy endeavour."
"139",7096,"UGA",39,1984,"ï»¿It is a source of pride and pleasure for my delegation that a distinguished son of Zambia  a fraternal African country  presides over the work of the Organization. We warmly congratulate Mr. Lusaka on his election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His personal qualities  vast experience in public life and skills as a diplomat make him eminently qualified to guide our deliberations. Zambia  and Mr. Lusaka personally  have been at the forefront of Africa's struggle for freedom  independence and human dignity. We wish him great success in the discharge of his heavy responsibilities.207.	We take this opportunity also to pay a well- deserved tribute to his predecessor  the President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  for his dynamic and wise leadership during the course of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.208.	We would also like to express our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations. In the past year he once again played an active role in the search for solutions to numerous world problems.209.	My delegation also takes great pleasure in welcoming the new State of Brunei Darussalam into the community of free and independent nations. Its presence in the General Assembly signifies once again the continued realization of one of the prime objectives for which the United Nations was created  namely  the elimination of colonialism. It also brings the United Nations closer to the goal of universality.210.	Namibia  for a century  has had and still continues to endure colonial domination  first by imperial Germany and now by apartheid South Africa. The situation prevailing in Namibia is well known to us all  It is a situation arising from South Africa's colonialism and illegal occupation. It is painful to the Namibian people who endure it and are fighting for their independence under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative. It is also painful to the front-line States which  because of their support for the liberation struggle  are victims of South Africa's aggression and destabilization.211.	The Security Council  by its resolution 435 (1978)  endorsed the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. It was hoped then that Namibia would be independent within a year. For the last six years  the fulfilment of that hope has eluded us. Since the adoption of the plan  the hopes of the international community have been raised time and again  only to be dashed by the premeditated obstruction of Pretoria and its allies.212.	The latest example of that obstruction is the injection of the extraneous issue of linkage between Namibian independence and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in the negotiations by South Africa  supported by the United States. We cannot accept that the future of Namibians should be sacrificed on account of East-West confrontation. The trading of a people's freedom and national independence is not only reprehensible  but immoral. I wish to reiterate Uganda's position of total rejection of that linkage.213.	The racist regime has embarked on a fresh diplomatic offensive whose immediate aim is to disarm SWAPO and to deny it external support. Ultimately  they think they can make it impossible for the people of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  to win power. That manoeuvre is also directed at winning international legitimacy and recognition for Pretoria's stoogesâthe so-called Multi-Party Conference in Namibia.214.	Another clear objective of that design is to delay Namibian independence by imposing so-called regional or internal solutions to what are otherwise the concerns of the international community. There are now efforts aimed at distancing the United Nations as far as possible from the negotiation process. In furtherance of that strategy  South Africa is trying every trick to wriggle out of the decisions of the United Nations  particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Organization has an obligation to ensure that this does not happen.215.	Meanwhile  under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative  the Namibian people are waging an heroic struggle to rid themselves of the colonial yoke. History is on their side. I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm my country's unequivocal support for Namibia's struggle for freedom and national independence.216.	The situation in South Africa remains very explosive. Each passing day brings the sad news of fresh acts of repression  imprisonment of trade union leaders  brutal torture or death in detention  and death sentences imposed on the patriots opposing apartheid. The policy of ""bantustanization"" is being vigorously and mercilessly implemented.217.	Recently  one racist South African minister was reported as having advocated measures to reduce the black population in South Africa. The call was made by the racist Minister of Environmental Affairs and Fisheries  Mr. Sarel Hayward  on 22 May of this year  when he stated that ""If we do not achieve a reduction in the population growth of blacks in this country  we are heading for catastrophe. The statistics show that we must drastically cut the population growthâotherwise we are all going to die of thirst.""218.	The people of South Africa  faced with this type of barbaric policy  have been waging a relentless struggle to dismantle the apartheid system. The progress they have registered in mobilizing their people to support the struggle and the dent they have made in the South African war machine has sent shock waves and fear among the oppressors. Unable to cow them and to force them to submit to injustice  the Pretoria regime has unleashed a campaign to undermine the network of solidarity and support which the liberation movements enjoy beyond the frontiers of South Africa. The front-line States became victims of constant acts of aggression  destabilization and interference in their internal affairs at the hands of the racist regime.219. There have been attempts to portray the recent fraudulent constitutional changes implemented last July as positive developments that give cause for optimism. Those so-called changes should be exposed for what they are. They are clearly designed to divide the ranks of the oppressed communities and to get them to join the racists in their criminal enterprise of perpetuating the apartheid power structure. Rather than addressing the central issue of enfranchising the vast majority of the people  the so-called changes have compounded their problem by entrenching provisions which deny them citizenship in their own country.220. With the clear purpose of extricating South Africa from international isolation  the racist Prime Minister earlier this year visited several Western countries during which he posed as a statesman and peace-broker. It is a matter of deep regret that the visit was allowed to take place  in spite of protests by African and other peace-loving countries. No amount of sophistry on the part of anyone can disguise the true nature and intent of the racist regime. We categorically reject any efforts aimed at rehabilitating it.221.	Neither the destabilization of neighbouring States nor the introduction of fraudulent constitutional schemes will save South Africa from the time of reckoning  which is fast approaching. The only way to prevent that otherwise inevitable eventuality is to dismantle the apartheid structures.222.	The liberation struggle is being waged and led by the people of South Africa themselves and in their own country. It is incumbent upon Africa and the international community to continue to render them both moral and material support until victory. In this connection  we express our appreciation to the frontline States  which  despite enormous odds  have made supreme sacrifices for the cause of the liberation of southern Africa.223.	Uganda is concerned that the international situation continues to deteriorate  giving rise to pessimism and despair. The old hotbeds of tension remain  while new crisis points emerge.224.	In the Middle East  Israel has intensified its aggressive policies against its neighbours  the indigenous inhabitants of the occupied Arab lands and the Palestinians everywhere. The question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East problem. The crisis in the Middle East stems from Israel's persistent and flagrant denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. There can be no lasting settlement unless the Palestinians can exercise their legitimate rights. These include the right to return to their homeland and the right to self-determination in a State of their own  under the leadership of the PLO. We support the convening of an International Peace Conference on the Middle East in which the Soviet Union  the United States and all the parties concerned  including the PLO  would participate  as called for by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva last year. We appeal to all concerned to co-operate and assist the Secretary-General in his efforts in this regard.225.	We are concerned at the tensions  instability and acts of destabilization in Central America. We believe that the people of the region should be left to solve their problems and determine their own destinies freely  without any outside interference. In this regard  Uganda supports the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful solution to the problems of Central America. We especially welcome the conclusion of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  of 7 September 1984  as a positive avenue for peace.226.	The Korean peninsula is another focal point of tension. Uganda will continue to support the aspirations of the Korean people to the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. We welcome the positive efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to this end. We believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area would create a positive atmosphere for negotiations.227.	With regard to Cyprus  I reaffirm Uganda's support for its territorial integrity  unity and non- aligned character  as expressed in the Political Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983. The fate of the two communities is linked. They should  therefore  through the medium of international talks  be assisted to find a solution within the framework of a united Cyprus.228.	We continue to be gravely concerned about the war between Iran and Iraq. Once again  we appeal to the two non-aligned countries to bring to an end this tragic and wasteful war.229.	I take this opportunity to reaffirm Uganda's support for the struggle of the Saharan people for self-determination  in accordance with the framework formulated by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983.230.	The current crisis in international relations derives to a large extent from the prevailing state of relations between the two super-Powers. Disarmament talks have been paralysed and the arms race has been stepped up. There is an urgent need today  more than ever  for a constructive dialogue between the two super-Powers.231.	The international arms race involves a colossal misappropriation of human and material resources for destructive purposes  thus consuming enormous resources badly needed to meet the economic and social challenges of our timeâin particular  the urgent need to narrow the gap between developed and developing countries.232.	The vast stockpiles and tremendous build-up of arms and armed forces and the competition for the qualitative refinement of weapons of all kinds  to which scientific resources and technological advances are diverted  pose an incalculable threat to peace. Disarmament is an imperative and most urgent task facing the international community. We cannot but be disheartened by the total absence of concrete negotiated results in that direction. My delegation therefore calls for the resumption of the intermediate-range and strategic weapons talks between the Soviet Union and the United States  a total ban on the development  production  stockpiling and deployment of chemical weapons  the urgent conclusion of a treaty prohibiting an arms race in outer space and speedy progress towards general and complete disarmament.233.	The continuing deterioration of the world economic situation remains a matter of grave concern to my delegation. Since the beginning of the decade  the world economy has been afflicted by acute recession and unsteady monetary and financial conditions. International trade and economic growth  particularly in the developing world  continue to experience sharp declines. Primary-commodity prices have declined  and the terms of trade for developing countries  like my own  have deteriorated drastically. High interest rates  soaring inflation and unemployment  compounded by heavy debt-service obligations  have mounted. This has precipitated acute difficulties in our countries.234.	We remain convinced that the only viable solution that can deliver the impoverished nations from this economic situation lies in the qualitative restructuring of the unequal economic relations between the developed and developing countries.235.	Uganda remains committed to the legitimate demand of the Group of 77 for a new international economic order based on equality and justice. Global negotiations that envisage just  equitable economic relations based on mutual respect among nations must be launched without any further delay. It is our earnest hope that  given the political will and the realization that there is no cordiality between affluence and poverty  the next year will bring nations to the negotiating table in order to find durable solutions.236.	The alarming and significant deterioration in the economic and social conditions of most African countries has produced a crisis of development in Africa. The immediate causes of the crisis are widespread  severe and persistent drought and the rapidly deteriorating global economic environment. These have combined to generate a crisis of unprecedented dimensions whose solution is beyond the capability of many African countries.237.	The current drought  which has now spread to 34 countries  is the most severe in this century. Prolonged drought has created serious food shortages  which in turn have triggered famine  malnutrition and related diseases and loss of human lives and livestock. The food situation in Africa has deteriorated so drastically that most African countries are today in the tragic position of being unable to feed their peoples. Africa is today relying on food imports and food aid to feed a large percentage of its population. The present crisis is further undermining the weak economies of African countries and poses a serious threat to the well-being of the people of Africa.238.	Africa recognizes that the primary responsibility for the development of African economies rests with the Governments and peoples of African States. We have taken the necessary measures to grapple with the crisis. It is for this reason that African Ministers responsible for economic development and planning made an urgent appeal for massive assistance from the international community  in a Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis  addressed to the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council in 1984  to complement and supplement the individual and collective efforts of African States.239.	The initiative and interest which the Secretary-General took in this matter early this year were very timely and deeply appreciated by the Governments and people of Africa. The response of the international community  particularly the developed countries  has  however  been very disappointing. The failure of the Economic and Social Council to reach a consensus on measures to assist Africa to avert the impending catastrophe is a source of deep concern to my delegation. It is our earnest hope that at this session the General Assembly will adopt the necessary measures to assist Africa in its current economic difficulties.240.	Within its lifespan  the United Nations has achieved much. Notwithstanding this  many problems remain. Colonialism  racism  foreign occupation and domination still persist in southern Africa  the Middle East and elsewhere. Poverty and attendant injustice are still prevalent in the world. In its constant search for solutions to the problems of world peace and the well-being of peoples  the United Nations must have the support of all its Member States.241.	In conclusion  I wish  on behalf of the Government and people of Uganda  to reaffirm our faith in and commitment to the United Nations."
"140",7141,"UKR",39,1984,"ï»¿The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic would like to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session and would like to wish you every success in carrying out your responsible duties.59.	We highly appreciate the skilful guidance of the General Assembly during its thirty-eighth session by Mr. Illueca  the present President of the Republic of Panama.60.	My delegation would like also to congratulate Brunei Darussalam on its admission to membership of the United Nations.61.	In the present international situation  which has been greatly aggravated by imperialist circles  the peoples of the world expect the United Nations to concentrate its efforts on solving the central problem of the present day: the prevention of nuclear war. We are deeply convinced that this problem is the one on which attention should be focused at this session of the General Assembly. The solution of other urgent problems facing mankind will depend directly on the world's ability to avoid a nuclear holocaust.62.	The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have submitted to the General Assembly at this session a series of specific initiatives and proposals. They represent a realistic and well-founded programme of action aimed at curbing the arms race  removing the threat of nuclear war  eliminating conflicts and hotbeds of tension  introducing the fundamental principle of the non-use of force into international relations  returning to detente and maintaining normal relations among States with different social systems.63.	The implementation of this programme would not only make it possible to eliminate the threat of war  but also help to channel immense material resources into resolving the problems of social and economic development  including the provision of assistance to developing countries.64.	A number of initiatives by other peace-loving  non-aligned countries have the same thrust.65.	Unfortunately  we must state that the path towards reaching these vital goals is blocked by grave obstacles  the main one of which is the militaristic foreign policy openly proclaimed and persistently pursued by the United States.66.	The United States bid for military superiority  the deployment of new United States first-strike nuclear missiles in Western Europe  the stockpiling of enormous nuclear arsenals  and attempts to turn outer space into an arena of the arms race have highly charged the international situation.67.	Flouting the will of countries and peoples  the United States has made terrorism a State policy and is trying to turn practically the entire planet into a ""sphere of its vital interests""  as evidenced by events in Lebanon and in Grenada  by what amounts to intervention in El Salvador and the undeclared war against Nicaragua  by the support given to the racist regime of South Africa  by threats against Cuba and Syria  by the escalation of tension in the Persian Gulf  by gross interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  and by a growing military presence and the establishment of military bases in many regions of the world.68.	Having deployed its new nuclear missiles in Western Europe  the United States has disrupted the process of negotiations on the limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons. It has sharply exacerbated nuclear confrontation on the continent and has created a serious new threat to world peace.69.	United States medium-range nuclear weapons not only pose a threat to East European countries  but also have in their sights dozens of countries in the Middle and Near East and in northern Africa.70.	Indeed  no verbal subterfuge can conceal the fact that  as new United States missiles are deployed in Europe  the possibility of negotiations has increasingly been blocked and additional barriers are being erected in the way of lowering the level of nuclear armament.71.	The situation is compounded also by the fact that revanchist sentiments in some Western countries have been on the rise of late. It is true that attempts have been made to convince us that we are supposedly exaggerating this danger. But the Ukrainian people  having experienced all the horrors of the Second World War and having suffered an enormous toll in human lives  cannot remain indifferent to the fact that in some quarters demands are openly voiced to change the borders which now exist in Europe and to revise the treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany. Delirious ideas of ""reviving the Reich"" within its 1937 borders are being hatched. It should also be noted that cabinet members and other Government officials are participating in revanchist gatherings. Revanchism  combined with United States nuclear missiles  poses a very serious threat to international peace and security.72.	Recently we have heard in certain Western capitals professions of peaceful intentions and of the need to renew political dialogue. Why  then  the delay? The countries of the socialist community have always strongly favoured  and continue to favour  agreements and an improvement in the political climate. What is needed today is not talk about the usefulness of negotiations  but rather a willingness to conduct negotiations on substantive issues and to reach agreements on the basis of the principle of equality and equal security. What is needed are concrete deeds  not words.73.	Konstantin U. Chernenko  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  has said in this connection:""We make an unequivocal appeal to the United States and its allies: it is time for them to reaffirm by concrete deeds their share of responsibility for the fate of the world  to realize the futility of a policy based on a position of strength and on reliance on the arms race  and to demonstrate real  rather than a mere ostensible  readiness to engage in dialogue and negotiations in order to find mutually acceptable solutions to problems on which the future of mankind depends.""74.	The assumption by all nuclear Powers-âfollowing the example of the Soviet Union and in accordance with the will of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nationsâof the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons would constitute a decisive contribution to saving mankind from the nuclear threat. As suggested by some countries  such an obligation could be embodied in an international legal instrument. There is no doubt that the implementation in practice of the Soviet Union's well-known initiative for observing certain rules of conduct in relations between nuclear- weapon States would be of great significance.75.	The international situation would also be greatly improved by the adoption of such measures as a nuclear-weapon freeze by all nuclear Powersâor  initially  by the United States and the Soviet Union on a bilateral basis by way of setting an example for other nuclear Powers and as a major step towards a subsequent reduction and complete prohibition of nuclear weapons.76.	The Ukrainian SSR supports the Joint Declaration issued on 22 May 1984 by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  which  in essence  constitutes an appeal to freeze nuclear arsenals.77.	The Soviet Union has proposed an immediate agreement to cease the quantitative build-up of all components of nuclear weapons  to renounce deployment of all new kinds and types of nuclear weapons and to establish a moratorium on all nuclear-weapon tests. The conclusion of a treaty on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests would be the logical corollary of that moratorium. Basic provisions of that treaty were proposed by the Soviet Union as long ago as the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  which  as is known  supported the elaboration of such a treaty and recommended that the Conference on Disarmament take appropriate action. We believe that it is the direct responsibility of the Conference on Disarmament to make maximum effort to resolve this question  the solution of which is long overdue.78.	The Ukrainian SSR supports the initiative for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world  including the European continent.79.	The question of excluding outer space from the sphere of the arms race is organically linked to the problem of preventing nuclear war. In accordance with a resolution of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which was adopted by an overwhelming majority of Member States  the Conference on Disarmament should work out a relevant agreement. However  owing to the position of the United States  which is seeking to use outer space as a springboard from which to deliver with impunity a first nuclear strike  negotiations on this important and urgent question have not yet started.80.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that the General Assembly should vigorously oppose any plans to militarize outer space and should demand that negotiations be started immediately on that urgent problem  on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis.81.	The inexhaustible possibilities of the uses of outer space should be utilized in the interests of all mankind and not to its detriment. It is precisely this desire that motivated the new Soviet proposal to include on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly an item entitled ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"".82.	The peaceful exploration of outer space  which has become a symbol of the spectacular achievements of science and technology  is destined to be an effective means of solving many global problems  including that of economic development. The Ukrainian SSR is making a substantial contribution to the peaceful exploration of outer space  and we therefore whole-heartedly endorse the Soviet proposal concerning a radical solution to the problem of how to prevent the militarization of outer space and ensure that it can be used for creative  rather than destructive  purposes.83.	If there were reliable guarantees that outer space would be free of any weapons  the way would be opened to fruitful co-operation among States in this domain and eventually to the establishment of a world organization for the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes.84.	The question of prohibiting the development  production  and stockpiling of chemical weapons calls for an immediate solution. The Soviet draft basic provisions of a convention on the subject  which have recently been supplemented  taking into consideration the wishes of a number of countries  with provisions regarding verification of the entire process of destroying chemical weapons  are on the negotiating table at the Conference on Disarmament.85.	We believe that the draft represents a constructive basis for the prohibition of this particularly barbaric type of weapon of mass destruction. The recent proposal of the Warsaw Treaty States to rid Europe of chemical weapons is also prompted by a desire to achieve that goal. Its implementation would make it possible to diminish considerably the risk of chemical warfare on the continent and  consequently  in the world at large and to begin the reduction of chemical weapons arsenals.86.	The adoption of such partial regional measures would promote global efforts to expedite the conclusion of a convention banning chemical weapons  which remains the ultimate goal of the Warsaw Treaty States. This would stimulate the adoption of similar measures on other continents as well.87.	At the same time  it must be noted with regret that the much-touted United States draft treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons8 is distinctly negative in its approach to this extremely important problem and contains provisions which are unacceptable to many States even at this stage. We have the impression that the United States draft treaty has been submitted with a single purpose in mind and that is to cover up the ongoing accelerated preparations in the United States for the implementation of a $10 billion chemical rearmament programme.88.	I should also like to recall other proposals put forward by socialist countries. They include a programme of nuclear disarmament in stages aiming at a gradual reduction of nuclear weapons until they are completely eliminated. This programme retains its urgency to this day.89.	The implementation of a proposal recently submitted by the Warsaw Treaty States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] countries to begin talks on the question of mutual agreement not to increase military expenditures and subsequently to reduce them could be an important step in containing all areas of the arms race. This proposal is taking on particular urgency owing to the unchecked growth of military' appropriations in the budgets of the United States and its NATO partners.90.	Of great significance in the current situation is the proposal of the socialist countries to conclude a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of relations of peace between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and those of NATO.91.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that agreement to the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic for the adoption of a declaration on the right of peoples to peace would be an important moral and political act that would impede the actions of those that entertain the demented idea that it is possible to win a nuclear war. It is a basic duty of each State to exercise this right. The fulfilment of this duty requires that the policies of States  above all nuclear-weapon States  be directed towards eliminating any threat to human survival. The adoption of this proposal by the General Assembly would contribute to the mobilization of the world public's efforts to prevent a nuclear catastrophe and to preserve life on earth.92.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that  in the present dangerous international situation  the United Nations has an important task to accomplish  namely  the adoption of other specific measures also aimed at strengthening international security and  above all  eliminating pockets of tension and military conflicts and stopping acts of aggression in different parts of the world.93.	In this context  the Soviet initiative concerning the inclusion in the agenda of the present session of an important and urgent item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system in other sovereign States"" is particularly relevant and timely. We think that  by strongly condemning the policy and practice of State terrorism as a method of dealing with other States and peoples  the General Assembly would make a tangible contribution to establishing political guarantees of peace  strengthening the security of individual States and consolidating international security as a whole.94.	For almost 40 years now  acute tensions have persisted in the Middle East  where the Israeli aggressor  enjoying the direct support and protection of the United States  continues its policy of occupation and annexation of the Arab lands is engaged in punitive operations against the Palestinian and Lebanese patriots and is threatening Syria. This international terrorism and banditry elevated to the level of a State policy has transformed the Middle East region into a focal point of constant military conflicts which pose a serious threat to world peace.95.	The vital interests of the peoples of the Middle East  as well as the interests of international security as a whole  demand the earliest achievement of a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement in this region.96.	The basic principles for and concrete ways and means of solving this problem are embodied in the ""Proposals by the Soviet Union on a Middle East settlement"". Most important of all  they involve recognition of the inadmissibility of acquiring other peoples' land by means of aggression. Consequently  the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 must be returned to the Arabs. The inalienable right of the Palestinian peopleâwhose sole legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]âto self-determination and to establish their own State must be ensured in practice. Finally  the state of war between the Arab States and Israel must be terminated and all States of the region must be guaranteed the right to a safe and independent existence and development.97.	A comprehensive  truly just and genuinely lasting Middle East settlement can be reached only through collective efforts in which all the parties concerned participate. An international conference on the Middle East could accomplish this major task. However  the United States and Israel are known to be staunchly opposed to the convening of such a conference.98.	The continuing exacerbation of the situation in Central America and the escalating armed interference by the United States in the affairs of the sovereign States of that region is a matter of grave concern. The piratical invasion of independent Grenada by the United States and its continuing occupation can only be qualified as terrorism.99.	The undeclared war being waged by the United States against Nicaragua through forming  arming and infiltrating that country with gangs of mercenaries is an act of State terrorism.100.	The same is true of United States policy in El Salvador  where reactionary factions  assisted and supported by Washington  are committing genocide against their own people in the hope of quenching the flames of their liberation struggle.101.	The Ukrainian SSR is strongly opposed to United States interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign States in Central America. We advocate a just political solution to the problems of this region through negotiation. We support the constructive proposals by Nicaragua and commend the efforts of the Contadora Group to prevent a large-scale conflict in that region. The Security Council and the General Assembly at its current session can and should play an important role in easing tensions and bringing about a political settlement in that area.102.	A dangerous hotbed of tension persists in southern Africa. Bolstered by the United States and some other Western countries  the racist regime in Pretoria is pursuing a policy of aggression and destabilization vis-a-vis the neighbouring African States. It is intensifying its reign of terror and repression against the indigenous populations of South Africa and illegally occupied Namibia and continues to block a settlement in Namibia.103.	The Ukrainian SSR supports the demand that the Security Council invoke comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa  in conformity with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  in order to make the racists immediately withdraw their forces from Namibia  cease their aggressive actions against neighbouring Statesâ above all  Angolaâand abolish the shameful system of apartheid.104.	We are resolutely opposed to the policy of the United States and other NATO countries and Israel aimed at expanding military  political and economic co-operation with the racist regime of Pretoria.105.	The Ukrainian SSR condemns illegal actions by the United States to dismember the Trust Territory of the Pacific IslandsâMicronesiaâand virtually to annex it and turn it into yet another strategic military springboard. Preventing the colonial enslavement of Micronesia and finalizing the process of decolonization in all other colonial and dependent Territories is an imperative need of our time  and the United Nations undoubtedly has an important role to play in attaining that goal.106.	The threat to the existence of the Republic of Cyprus as an independent  territorially integral and non-aligned State has grown considerably as a result of the actions of imperialist forces to foment hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world  including the eastern Mediterranean. In this context  we attach great importance to the mission of the Secretary- General  entrusted to him by the Security Council  to reach a political settlement of the Cyprus problem.107.	The tasks of improving the situation on the Asian continent are well served by the Soviet proposal dealing with confidence-building measures in the Far East  including measures in the military field  and by the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic"" on concluding a convention on mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific.108.	The Ukrainian SSR has always supported the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their homeland after United States troops have been withdrawn from South Korea. We support the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at substantially improving the situation in Korea and creating favourable conditions for a fruitful dialogue between the North and the South.109.	We are whole-heartedly in favour of a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan and oppose attempts to use the United Nations in order to interfere in the internal affairs of that country. We fully support the realistic and constructive programme of political settlement put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR would like to stress the importance of creating a favourable atmosphere for the continuation of talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan  conducted through the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General.110.	We fully support the well-known initiatives of Viet Nam  Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea regarding the normalization of the situation in South-East Asia. The countries of Indo-China have reaffirmed their constant readiness to promote dialogue with their neighbours in the interests of easing tensions and developing co-operation.111.	I should like also to express some thoughts of my delegation regarding the problem of current international economic relations. Imperialist States  and above all the United States  are openly pursuing a policy of undermining the peaceful foundations of trade and economic relations between States and blocking the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. In defiance of the generally accepted norms of relations between States  the ruling circles of those countries are tearing up agreements reached  setting up a trade  credit and technology blockade  and employing methods of strong-arm pressure  embargo and sanctions against those States which reject their dictates.112.	By making use of their predominant position in the world capitalist economy  they are seeking to shift onto the developing countries the deleterious consequences of economic crises  inflation and other upheavals that have become constant and characteristic features of the capitalist system today.113.	Last June  the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance adopted a declaration entitled ""Maintenance of peace and international economic co-operation""  which constitutes an elaborate programme of action to improve international relations. This programme envisages the implementation of recommendations and agreements  including those adopted within the United Nations which have been worked out through the collective efforts of States and are aimed at developing mutually beneficial  fruitful economic co-operation and establishing a new international economic order.114.	The adoption of effective decisions and actions to implement the proposals contained in the declaration would undoubtedly promote the successful development of international economic co-operation and constitute major contribution to consolidating international  peace and security.115.	Recently  the Ukrainian people have been celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the liberation of the Ukraine from the Fascist aggressor. Next yearâ1985âwe will solemnly  together with all peace-loving nations  mark the fortieth anniversary of the great victory in the Second World War. All the peoples who fought against fascism and militarism contributed to that victory. The Soviet Union's decisive role in it is indisputable.116.	The enormous sacrifices offered on the altar of that victory demand that we do everything that we can to avert and eliminate the threat of a new world war. This is the thrust of all efforts by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet State. Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky  Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR  has noted in this connection:""The Soviet people realize that the objective of the clear and consistent peace-loving policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to build confidence among nations and to return to detente and co-operation. Our party and Government and our friends are taking all possible measures to preserve peace for the present and succeeding generations.""117.	The Ukrainian SSR will continue actively to support the efforts of the United Nations aimed at averting the threat of nuclear war  curbing the arms race  eliminating pockets of tension and expanding and deepening mutually beneficial co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations."
"141",7188,"URY",39,1984,"ï»¿1.	I should like first to congratulate Mr. Paul Lusaka  of Zambia  on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that under his leadership the work of the thirty-ninth session will produce positive results. His election constitutes  to our great satisfaction  a further reflection of the outstanding role played by the Group of African States in the United Nations and its active contribution to the international community.2.	At this session we have taken another step towards the universality of the United Nations with the admission of the 159th Member  Brunei Darussalam  to which Uruguay extends a most cordial and friendly welcome and offers its full co-operation.3.	In the annual consideration of our agenda  we are faced with a full range of serious problems arising as a consequence of the world economic crisis and the continued existence of a large number of situations brought about by political tension and even by open conflict.4.	In recent years  our world has not become safer  more peaceful or more just: quite the contrary.151. I should like to refer specifically to some of the questions that are particularly important to my Government.152. On the occasion of the opening of the twenty- fifth annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank  at Punta del Este in March of this year  President Alvarez underlined the fact that the opening of the session coincided with ""the most painful crisis of the world economic system"". He said:""Latin America is undergoing the deepest crisis of the last half century. Growth has stagnated. The standard of living of every citizen has worsened in the whole region  thus bringing about the inevitable social and political consequences. This situation of unforeseen regional and world-wide consequences is reflected in an unprecedented debt  the servicing and repayment of which constitutes a very high percentage of the export revenue  if not all of it.""In these conditionsâand we emphasize thisâ the problem cannot be solved. Even if we recognize that the work of reconstruction is a responsibility falling on all the members of the community who wish to make progress  it becomes essential that credit institutions and developed countries accept their responsibilities  taking into account their own capabilities and political and financial interests. Their own growth and stability depend in the end on the economic and social well-being of our countries.""He continued:""The time has come to abandon sterile diagnoses and to undertake co-ordinated action. The terms of payment of our debt must be rescheduled; reducing interest rates in such a way that the debt may be serviced while we keep a level of revenue-producing exports that can safeguard the social conditions of our peoples. In order for Latin America to continue its development and generate wealthâ and this seems to be everyone's goalâwe should be able to draw on sufficient external financing while at the same time increasing our exports.""153.	Nevertheless  it must be said that  in assuming the responsibility of meeting our obligations and carrying out the relevant negotiations in a sovereign manner  the Latin American countries have found in their adverse situation a source of unity and co-operation.154.	In meetings at Quito  Lima  Cartagena and Mar del Plata  we have produced important documents which clearly articulate our strong and responsible common position  on the basis of which we are ready for a constructive dialogue. We have firmly put forward just and realistic guidelines for the repayment of the debt  taking into account the unavoidable and equitable sacrifices that such adjustment entails for all parties concerned.155.	In this context  we once again strongly support the provisions of paragraph 23 of the Cartagena Consensus  signed on 22 June 1984. On that occasion  the majority of the Latin American countries expressed their readiness ""to hold a meeting with the Governments of industrialized countries in order to examine jointly the many aspects  and the economic  social and political implications  of the indebtedness of Latin America"".156.	The present situation  in all its gravity  confirms once more the wisdom of our long-standing position concerning the need to eliminate restrictions to trade which seriously affect the developing countries. As exemplified by the present situation  one can claim the validity of the equation encompassing external debt and trade  but one must also accept  as has always been the case  the relationship between trade and development.157.	In this perspective  the protectionism of the industrialized countries and their intervention in international markets with subsidized products constitute a very serious development  which adversely affects the developing countries not only at the economic level but also in the social context.158.	It must be clearly stated that those countries which practise such conduct in matters so vital for the life of peoples and the regulation of their relationships have no moral legitimacy in passing judgement on other aspects of relationships among men  nor do they have the authority to question the political  social and economic consequences brought about by their actions.159.	The crisis produced by the external debt has also underlined the weaknesses of the international financial system  which are greatly increased by the relationship among all the factors.160.	It is obvious that these problems affect not only Latin America in varying degrees  they affect all the developing countries and are added to the critical food situation  especially in Africa. We have not reached the goal of food security. We must continue our efforts to that end.161.	It is sad to observe that the various multilateral mechanisms have not been able to deal with these issuesâas they have not been able to deal with financial and monetary questionsâin the depth that the situation requires or with the practical efficiency required. We have not made any progress in the global negotiations  in the revision of the development strategy or in the adoption of immediate remedies. We are facing an acute crisis in international co-operation to a degree which threatens not only the vitality of the multilateral mechanisms themselves but their very existence. We are witnessing an acute crisis in international co-operation to such an extent that we note that it has become impossible to discuss and implement overall long- term policies such as would encompass a comprehensive solution to global problems.162.	We think it is necessary to initiate immediate and concerted practical action to find solutions to the most pressing basic problems  such as those of trade  finance and the establishment of appropriate conditions of food security. That would improve the standard of living of the developing countries in the immediate future.163.	The delegation of Uruguay is ready to cooperate actively in the search for multilateral remedies which could help to solve these problems. We must  however  insist on our offer of honest cooperation  even though this might elicit a response only in terms of an echo of the words themselves. Beyond rhetoric  it is necessary to enter into a genuine dialogue  to embark upon practical negotiations to solve pressing questions  and we must show the necessary political will. The paralysis pervading the international scene on questions so vital and urgent for the daily life of peoples could become the factor triggering greater evils with unpredictable consequences.164.	For 20 years  Uruguay has been advocating a legal and peaceful solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands  through dialogue and negotiation within the framework of the United Nations. That has become more necessary than ever in the light of the tragic events of 1982 and in view of the continued tension and risk which this unresolved question entails. Our Government welcomes the statements expressing the will to find a solution. They should be translated into the immediate resumption of negotiations. Uruguay's well-known solidarity with the aspirations of the Argentine Republic does not preclude us  together with other Latin American nations  from formulating the sincere desire for the reopening of negotiations.165.	Our Government has been following with great concern the development of the crisis in Central America. Without wishing to enter into discussions or into ideological confrontations  I must say that it is very moving to see so many people who have suffered for such a long time. The human dimension of the conflict engulfs everything and everyone. This makes it imperative to have solidarity and effective action. The efforts of the countries members of the Contadora Group in this respect deserve our strong support. The Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America is a document inspired by the rich juridical and political traditions of Latin America. The various instances of dialogue in the recent past are encouraging signs.166.	We trust that the positive action of the Group will continueâUruguay will offer its firm support to that endâin order that the remaining obstacles may be overcome. It is necessary for us to engage in joint efforts  within the framework of international law  to ensure that the peoples of Central America are guaranteed the free exercise of self-determination  as a viable means for achieving and consolidating peace.167.	With an issue so momentous as the one before us  the contribution of all the countries of the region affected by the crisis is essential. We therefore appeal to them to exert their best efforts and to display the political will necessary to promote negotiation  and at the same time we appeal to them to refrain from any action contrary to that aim.168.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be a source of serious tension  not only for the region but also for international security.169.	Ever since the founding of the United Nations  our country has supported the adoption of solutions that equitably take into account the rights and interests of all the parties in the region. Consequently  Uruguay is in favour of the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to the full exercise of self-determination and the right of all the States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.170.	The path leading to true and lasting peace requires solutions negotiated among all the parties concerned  with no one excluded  solutions that take the various elements of the question into account in a balanced and equitable manner and thus provide assurances to all the States in the region.171.	The United Nations can  when the time comes  play r significant role in promoting negotiations  by pre ding an appropriate framework or supplementing their further development or implementation. We support in particular the efforts of the Secretary-General and we encourage him to continue them.172.	With deep emotion we express our solidarity with Lebanon  and  at the same time  we make a very strong political statement of support for its sovereignty  integrity and independence. Our country hopes that the Lebanese Government  with the support and respect of the international community  will begin to exercise its functions and powers effectively throughout its territory and that  in a climate of national concord  peace will be consolidated with the withdrawal of foreign forces.173.	The attention of the international community should also be focused on other serious issues which affect various areas and which  taken together  bear witness to the precarious state of peace in the world. I am referring to  among other things  the prolonged conflict between Iraq and Iran and to the situations in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Cyprus  as well as to the division and tension in the Korean peninsula.174.	It is appropriate for me to recall the importance my country attaches to the question of the unification of Korea by means of an independent  peaceful solution. This solution must be attained through dialogue and direct negotiation  without foreign interference  which would make possible the creation of conditions favourable to understanding between the parties as well as to the stability of the region. Within that context  the good offices of the Secretary-General  between North and South Korea  should be supported and encouraged. The United Nations must not and cannot be indifferent to  or allow itself to be kept on the sidelines of this problem. In addition  notwithstanding these efforts and in this spirit  membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations could constitute a very positive occurrence.175.	The persistence of tension in southern Africa gives rise to particular concern. There can be no doubt that the independence of Namibia and the exercise by its people of the right to self-determination have been postponed for far too long. It is necessary to adopt collective measures designed to secure  in that area  the application of international law  as recognized by the International Court of Justice  the Security Council and the General Assembly. Our Government actively supports the Secretariat's efforts to ensure implementation of internationally agreed norms in this respect. The Security Council can make a decisive contribution  taking into account its own powers.176.	The situation with respect to apartheid is one about which Uruguay has particularly strong feelings. We totally reject this policy as well as its doctrine  its constitutional enshrinement and its practical application. We fully endorse the recent Security Council resolution which declares that the new constitution of South Africa is contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that its implementation would aggravate an already explosive situation in regard to apartheid.177. Within the framework of international law  our country firmly supports all actions aimed at putting an end to the policy of apartheid  the continued practice of which  moreover  is a danger to peace and security.178. Our reference to these questions makes it imperative for us to reaffirm our commitment to the defence of the principles of self-determination and non-discrimination on the basis of sex or religion or on any other basis  as well as to the application of both principles everywhere. It is thus appropriate for us to express regret at the persistence of colonial situations  the continued implementation of discriminatory policies and the non-exercise of the right to self-determination.179.	Uruguay  in accordance with a tradition by which it has always abided  considers that multilateral legal instruments are the most effective means for safeguarding and promoting human rights. That is why it is desirable for these instruments to be made universal and for existing machinery to be put into effect. It would be appropriateâalways bearing in mind the sovereign decision of each Stateâto encourage  on the part of all Governments  greater accession to and ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  as well as the International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocol. With regard to draft texts  we support the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  designed to abolish the death penalty  and the draft convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.180.	Since those instruments constitute a system for the protection of human rights  in keeping with the principles of impartiality and non-selectivity  and since they cover equally the weak and the powerful and every ideology and regime  their adoption would ensure genuine protection of fundamental rights. If they are not adopted  in many instances it will continue to be only those who are more powerful that will benefit and only their political and economic interests will be protected  to the detriment of the interests of those who are weaker and the interests of certain parts of the world. It will indeed run counter to the aims for which these instruments were drafted and  what is worse  they will benefit those who energetically uphold particular philosophical positions that claim to be universal and who will become apostles of discrimination.181.	The strengthening  through the Secretariat  of the procedures of the Centre for Human Rights and the establishment of a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights could contribute to ensuring the enjoyment of human rights without distortion and in a truly constructive manner.182.	The increasing number of conflicts and the various areas of tension arising from great-Power confrontation explain why ground has been lost in the international efforts aimed at disarmament. That is why Uruguay considers that the most important factor for the attainment of real progress in this area would be the creation of an environment of greater confidence through systematic respect for international law  the foundation of coexistence among States.183.	In particular  it is necessary that we abide strictly by the principles of non-intervention  self- determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We wish to emphasize most strongly the need for strict observance of the principle of non-intervention. In view of the present state of international relations  it is deplorable that intervention in the internal affairs of other States not only has assumed a variety of more or less sophisticated forms but also occurs with such frequency that it has become the hallmark of our times  to the detriment of those countries which are most vulnerable  with destabilizing consequences of serious proportions.184.	It is more than ever necessary for us to heed the call for reflection and a responsible approach. The gravity and intensity of the economic  social and political crisis affecting the vast majority of the peoples of the world has encouraged those who are stepping up their acts of intervention. This generates unnecessary conflicts which enable them to disguise their own ineffectiveness or incompetence. This situation has a particularly adverse impact on the economically weak countries. Every countryâwith rare exceptionsâknows that there are other countries that are more powerful  and this conditions what it does. Thus  the revitalization of the principles of international law would allow everyone to take its proper place in a context of mutual respect.185.	With each instance of direct or indirect violation of these principles  there is not only an attack on international law but also a threat to international peace and security.186.	It is necessary to strengthen the rule of law. We should address ourselves to the biggest problems of our age. I would mention here by way of example the adoption of a convention making it mandatory for all States to resolve disputes by peaceful means before such disputes become uncontrollable and the application of the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations therefore a mere illusion.187.	The powers of the International Court of Justice should be increased  making its intervention mandatory in certain cases.188.	Uruguay  which was responsible for the earliest declaration under the terms of Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice  appeals to all those States which are not yet doing so to do everything they can to ensure that the Court is given mandatory power in all disputes covered by that Article.189.	The Security Council can undertake preventive action  which can lead to early solutions  particularly in the more critical cases. Peace-keeping operations should be supported and strengthened.190.	The international community must increase its support for the Secretary-General and for the development of the duties that are implicit in his office  and in the provisions of the Charter.191.	Finally  the General Assembly should adopt precise decisions strengthening the role of the Organization in general and of the General Assembly in particular  taking into account the work in the relevant Committees and the views of Member States.192.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  as in previous years  provides us with an objective assessment of steps that could be undertaken to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations.193.	The great Powers  particularly the nuclear Powers  have a responsibility to make a substantial contribution to disarmament and peace. Nevertheless  the magnitude of what is at stakeâthe principles of international law  the legal structure of the Organization and  in the final analysis  the indivisibility of peaceâgive each and every one of the Member States the right and the duty to act in this field.194.	It is fitting that we reaffirm  first  the validity of the objective of general and complete disarmament under international control. However  this should not stand in the way of our trying to promote  wherever and whenever possible  all other efforts undertaken in this area. In our view  the following collateral measures are called for: in the nuclear field  political support for halting and reversing the arms race; the initiation of negotiations between the superpowers; the extension of the ban on nuclear testing to cover underground tests; the creation and expansion of denuclearized zones and zones of peace; the negotiation of instruments guaranteeing the non-use of nuclear weapons against States which do not possess them; and the universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In the field of conventional weapons  we believe that agreements aimed at stopping the arms race and banning the production and use of especially destructive weapons  in particular chemical weapons  are also necessary.195.	The political  institutional and legal measures necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security are closely linked to any process of disarmament  as well as with the indispensable confidence-building measures.196.	The international community can and must use its political influence and call with one voice for new efforts to ensure peace and progress through negotiations specifically aimed at disarmament in all forums.197.	The Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament and was held in 1978  was fully endorsed in the Concluding Document of the Assembly's Twelfth Special Session  which was also devoted to disarmament  and continues to provide a firm basis for serious efforts in this area. The comprehensive programme for disarmament  on which negotiations are now taking place  could become the necessary framework; it could mark the successful conclusion of the work undertaken and be a forerunner of the conclusion of that yet to be carried out steadily and without respite.198.	When considering the present situation throughout the world it is easy to grow disheartened  but that situation makes it imperative for the Organization to overcome the crisis. For this there are precedents.199.	The Charter of the United Nations enshrines a system of principles that constitute a new landmark in international law  allowing us to make significant strides in regulating important  areas of human endeavour. The Organization has promoted vast decolonization enterprises and has formulated the most modern concepts of economic  social and political development. The Organization  indeed  has become a forum for dialogue and discussion without precedent and with a unique universal character. It has become the forum where all States  large and small  participate in the search for solutions and policies. Increasingly  all opinions can be heard in an irreversible process of democratization.200.	On the main issues of concern to the international community  the United Nations has made substantially correct decisions. One must admit this  even if one disagrees in certain instances or is not satisfied with the implementation in others.201.	If we do not muster the necessary political will to find solutions through dialogue  if we cannot recover the sense of commitment to universal peace that created the Organization  we shall have nothing left but confrontation through which to solve our disputes. This in turn will breed intolerance and radicalism in those who claim to possess the truthâ their truth.202.	Here  among the Members of the United Nations  there is a binding political force that spurs negotiation forward  that demands peace and security that demands justice and fairness.203.	It is a pleasure for me to express these thoughts on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations and at a moment of particularly historic importance for my country. In the course of a long and trying political process  we Uruguayans have faced terrorist attacks with a sense of sacrifice and dignity  and  as we stated at the thirty-eighth session  we are now ready for the culmination of this stage with the holding of general elections next month that will be carried out on the basis of all the traditional guarantees of my country.204.	Allow me here to reaffirm Uruguay's support for the United Nations  support that has been unswerving from the time of the signing of the Charter to the present. This attitude is not based on any transitory political interest or the position of any given administration. It is a profound conviction held by my people  a people ready to contribute to peace with justice and under law  and thus to live in harmony with all the peoples of the world  in a united effort aimed at co-operation and development.205.	We are still far from making a reality of the dreams and ideals of the founders  but time has confirmed the validity of those dreams and ideals."
"142",7235,"USA",39,1984,"ï»¿First of all  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. Lusaka  on your election as President of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in carrying out the responsibilities of that high international office.3.	It is an honour to be here  and I thank you all for your gracious invitation. I would speak in support of the two great goals that led to the formation of the United Nationsâthe cause of peace and the cause of human dignity.4.	The responsibility of the General Assemblyâthe peaceful resolution of disputes between peoples and nationsâcan be discharged successfully only if we recognize the great common ground upon which we all stand: our fellowship as members of the human race  our oneness as inhabitants of this planet  our place as representatives of billions of our countrymen whose fondest hope remains the end to war and to the repression of the human spirit. These are the important  central realities that bind us  that per-us to dream of a future without the antagonisms of the past. And  just as shadows can be seen only where there is light  so  too  can we overcome what is wrong only if we remember how much is right; and we will resolve what divides us only if we remember how much more unites us. This chamber has heard enough about the problems and dangers ahead; today let us dare to speak of a future that is bright and hopeful and can be ours only if we seek it. I believe that future is far nearer than most of us would dare to hope.5.	At the start of this decade one scholar at the Hudson Institute noted that mankind also had undergone enormous changes for the better in the past two centuries  changes which are not always readily noticed or written about.6.	""Up until 200 years ago  there were relatively few people in the world "" he wrote. ""All human societies were poor. Disease and early death dominated most people's lives. People were ignorant  and largely at the mercy of forces of nature.""7.	""Now "" he said  ""we are somewhere near the middle of a process of economic development ... At the end of that process  almost no one will live in a country as poor as the richest country of the past. There will be many more people .. . living long  healthy lives  with immense knowledge and more to learn than anybody has time for."" They will be ""able to cope with the forces of nature  and almost indifferent to distance.""8.	We do live today  as that scholar suggested  in the middle of one of the most important and dramatic periods in human historyâone in which all of us can serve as catalysts for an era of world peace and unimagined human freedom and dignity.9.	Today I would like to report to you  as distinguished and influential members of the world community  on what the United States has been attempting to do to help move the world closer to this new era. On many fronts enormous progress has been made  and I think our efforts are complemented by the trend of history.10.	If we look closely enough  I believe we can see all the world moving towards a deeper appreciation of the value of human freedom in both its political and its economic manifestations. This is partially motivated by a world-wide desire for economic growth and higher standards of living. And there is an increasing realization that economic freedom is a prelude to economic progress and growth and is intricately and inseparably linked to political freedom.11.	Everywhere  people and Governments are beginning to recognize that the secret of a progressive new world is to take advantage of the creativity of the human spirit; to encourage innovation and individual enterprise; to reward hard work; and to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and information.12.	Our opposition to economic restrictions and trade barriers is consistent with our view of economic freedom and human progress. We believe such barriers pose a particularly dangerous threat to the developing nations and their chance to share in world prosperity through expanded export markets. Tomorrow  at the International Monetary Fund  I will address this question more fully  including America's desire for more open trading markets throughout the world.13.	This desire to cut down trade barriers and our open advocacy of freedom as the engine of human progress are two of the important ways the United States and the American people hope to assist in bringing about a world where prosperity is commonplace  conflict an aberration  and human dignity and freedom a way of life.14.	Let me place these steps more in context by briefly outlining the major goals of American foreignA/39/PV.4 policy and then exploring with you the practical ways we are attempting to further freedom and prevent war. By that I mean  first  how we have moved to strengthen ties with old allies and new friends; secondly  what we are doing to help avoid the regional conflicts that could contain the seeds of world conflagration; and thirdly  the status of our efforts with the Soviet Union to reduce the levels of arms.15.	Let me begin with a word about the objectives of American foreign policy  which have been consistent since the post-war era and which fuelled the formation of the United Nations and were incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations itself.16.	The Charter states two overriding goals: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"" and ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".17.	The founders of the United Nations understood full well the relationship between these two goals. And I want you to know that the Government of the United States will continue to view this concern for human rights as the moral centre of our foreign policy. We can never look at anyone's freedom as a bargaining chip in world politics. Our hope is for a time when all the people of the world can enjoy the blessings of personal liberty.18.	But I would like also to emphasize that our concern for protecting human rights is part of our concern for protecting the peace.19.	The answer is for all nations to fulfil the obligations they freely assumed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration states that: ""The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections"". The Declaration also includes the right of everyone: ""to form and to join trade unions "" ""to own property alone as well as in association with others "" ""to leave any country  including his own  and to return to his country "" and to enjoy ""freedom of opinion and expression"". Perhaps the most graphic example of the relationship between human rights and peace is the right of peace groups to exist and to promote their views. In fact  the treatment of peace groups may be a litmus test of a Government's true desire for peace.20.	In addition to emphasizing this tie between the advocacy of human rights and the prevention of war  the United States has taken important steps  as I mentioned earlier  to prevent world conflict. The starting-point and comer-stone of our foreign policy is our alliance and partnership with our fellow democracies. For 35 years  the North Atlantic alliance has guaranteed the peace in Europe. In both Europe and Asia  our alliances have been the vehicle for a great reconciliation among nations that had fought bitter wars in decades and centuries past. And here in the western hemisphere  North and South are being lifted on the tide of freedom and are joined in a common effort to foster peaceful economic development.21.	We are proud of our association with all those countries that share our commitment to freedom  human rights  the rule of lawâand international peace. Indeed  the bulwark of security that the democratic alliance provides is essential  and remains essential  to the maintenance of world peace. Every alliance involves burdens and obligations  but these are far less than the risks and sacrifices that would result if the peace-loving nations were divided and neglectful of their common security. The people of the United States will remain faithful to their commitments.22.	But the United States is also faithful to its alliances and friendships with scores of nations in the developed and developing worlds with differing political systems  cultures and traditions. The development of ties between the United States and Chinaâa significant global event of the last dozen yearsâshows our willingness to improve relations with countries ideologically very different from ours.23.	We are ready to be the friend of any country that is a friend to us and a friend of peace. And we respect genuine non-alignment. Our own nation was born in revolution; we helped promote the process of decolonization that brought about the independence of so many members of this body  and we are proud of that history.24.	We are proud  too  of our role in the formation of the United Nations and our support of the Organization over the years. And let me again emphasize our unwavering commitment to a central principle of the United Nations system  the principle of universality  both here and in the United Nations technical agencies around the world. If universality is ignored  if nations are expelled illegally  then the United Nations itself cannot be expected to succeed.25.	The United States welcomes diversity and peaceful competition; we do not fear the trends of history. We are not ideologically rigid; we do have principles and we will stand by them  but we will also seek the friendship and goodwill of all  both old friends and new.26.	We have always sought to lend a hand to help othersâfrom our relief efforts in Europe after the First World War to the Marshall Plan and massive foreign assistance programmes after the Second World War. Since 1946  the United States has provided over $115 billion in economic aid to developing countries  and today it provides about one third of the nearly $90 billion in financial resources  public and private  that flows to the developing world. And the United States imports about one third of the manufactured exports of the developing world.27.	But any economic progress  as well as any movement in the direction of greater understanding between the nations of the world  is  of course  endangered by the prospect of conflict at both the global and the regional levels. In a few minutes I will turn to the menace of conflict on a world-wide scale and discuss the status of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. But permit me first to address the critical problem of regional conflicts  for history displays tragic evidence that it is these conflicts which can set off the sparks leading to world-wide conflagration.28.	In a glass display case across the hall from the Oval Office at the White House there is a gold medalâthe Nobel Peace Prize won by Theodore Roosevelt for his contribution in mediating the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It was the first such prize won by an American  and it is part of a tradition of which the American people are very proud  a tradition that is being continued today in many regions of the globe.29.	We are engaged  for example  in diplomacy to resolve conflicts in southern Africa  working with the front-line States and our partners in the Contact Group. Mozambique and South Africa have reached a historic accord on non-aggression and co-operation; South Africa and Angola have agreed on a disengagement of forces from Angola  and the groundwork has been laid for the independence of Namibia  with virtually all aspects of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) agreed upon. Let me add that the United States considers it a moral imperative that South Africa's racial policies evolve peacefully but decisively towards a system compatible with basic norms of justice  liberty and human dignity. I am pleased that American companies in South Africa  by providing equal employment opportunities  are contributing to the economic advancement of the black population. But clearly  much more must be done.30.	In Central America  the United States has lent support to a diplomatic process to restore regional peace and security. We have committed substantial resources to promote economic development and social progress.31.	The growing success of democracy in El Salvador is the best proof that the key to peace lies in a political solution. Free elections brought into office a government dedicated to democracy  reform  economic progress and regional peace. Regrettably  there are forces in the region eager to thwart democratic change  but these forces are now on the defensive. The tide is turning in the direction of freedom. We call upon Nicaragua  in particular  to abandon its policies of subversion and militarism  and to carry out the promises it made to the Organization of American States to establish democracy at home.32.	The Middle East has known more than its share of tragedy and conflict for decades  and the United States has been actively involved in peace diplomacy for just as long. We consider ourselves a full partner in the quest for peace. The record of the 11 years since the October war shows that much can be achieved through negotiations; it also shows that the road is long and hard.33.	Two years ago  I proposed a fresh start toward a negotiated solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. My initiative of 1 September 1982 contains a set of positions that can serve as a basis for a just and lasting peace.' That initiative remains a realistic and workable approach  and I am committed to it as firmly as on the day I announced it. And the foundation-stone of this effort remains Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which  in turn  was incorporated in all its parts in the Camp David accords.34.	The tragedy of Lebanon has not ended. Only last week  a despicable act of barbarism by some who are unfit to associate with humankind reminded us once again that Lebanon continues to suffer. In 1983 we helped Israel and Lebanon reach an agreement that  if implemented  could have led to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces in the context of the withdrawal of all foreign forces. This agreement was blocked  and the long agony of the Lebanese continues. Thousands of people are still kept from their homes by continued violence and are refugees in their own country. The once-flourishing economy ofLebanon is near collapse. All of Lebanon's friends should work together to help end this nightmare.35.	In the Gulf  the United States has supported a series of Security Council resolutions that call for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq that has meant so much death and destruction and has put the world's economic well-being at risk. Our hope is that hostilities will soon end  leaving each side with its political and territorial integrity intact  so that both may devote their energies to addressing the needs of their people and a return to relationships with other States.36.	The lesson of experience is that negotiations work. The peace treaty between Israel and Egypt brought about the peaceful return of the Sinai  clearly showing that the negotiating process brings results when the parties commit themselves to it. The time is bound to come when the same wisdom and courage will be applied  with success  to reach peace between Israel and all of its Arab neighbours in a manner that assures security for all in the region  the recognition of Israel  and a solution to the Palestinian problem.37.	In every part of the world  the United States is similarly engaged in peace diplomacy as an active player or a strong supporter.38.	In South-East Asia  we have backed the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nationsto mobilize international support for a peaceful resolution of the Cambodian problem  which must include the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the election of a representative government. ASEAN's success in promoting economic and political development has made a major contribution to the peace and stability of the region.39.	In Afghanistan  the dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General and his representatives to find a diplomatic settlement have our strong support. I assure the General Assembly that the United States will continue to do everything possible to find a negotiated outcome which provides the Afghan people with the right to determine their own destiny  allows the Afghan refugees to return to *heir own country in dignity  and protects the legitimate security interests of all neighbouring countries.40.	On the divided and tense Korean peninsula  we have strongly backed the confidence-building measures proposed by the Republic of Korea and by the United Nations Command at Panmunjom. These are an important first step towards peaceful reunification in the long term.41.	We take heart from progress by others in lessening tensions  notably the efforts by the Federal Republic of Germany to reduce barriers between the two German States.42.	And the United States strongly supports the Secretary-General's efforts to assist the Cypriot parties in achieving a peaceful and reunited Cyprus.43.	The United States has been and will always be a friend of peaceful solutions.44.	This is no less true with respect to my country's relations with the Soviet Union.45.	When I appeared before the General Assembly  at its thirty-eighth session. I noted that we cannot count on the instinct for survival alone to protect us against war. Deterrence is necessary but not sufficient. America has repaired its strength. We have invigorated our alliances and friendships. We are ready for constructive negotiations with the Soviet Union.46.	We recognize that there is no sane alternative to negotiations on arms control and other issues between our two nations  which have the capacity to destroy civilization as we know it. I believe this is a view shared by virtually every country in the world and by the Soviet Union itself.47.	I want to speak to the General Assembly today on what the United States and the Soviet Union can accomplish together in the coming years  and the concrete steps that we need to take.48.	As I stand here and look out from this podium  there in front of me I can see the seat of the representative of the Soviet Union  and not far from that seat  just over to the side  is the seat of the representative of the United States. In this historic assembly hall it is clear there is not a great distance between us. Outside this room  while there will still be clear differences  there is every reason why we should do all that is possible to shorten that distance. That is why we are here. Is that not what the United Nations is all about?49.	On 16 January last  I set out three objectives for United States-Soviet relations that can provide an agenda for our work over the months ahead.50.	First  I said  we need to find ways to reduce  and eventually to eliminate  the threat and use of force in solving international disputes. Our concern over the potential for nuclear war cannot deflect us from the terrible human tragedies occurring every day in the regional conflicts I have just discussed. Together we have a particular responsibility to contribute to political solutions to these problems  rather than to exacerbate them through the provision of even more weapons.51.	I propose that our two countries agree to embark on periodic consultations at policy level about regional problems. We will be prepared  if the Soviets agree  to make senior experts available at regular intervals for in-depth exchanges of views. I have asked Secretary of State Shultz to explore this with Foreign Minister Gromyko. Spheres of influence are a thing of the past. Differences between American and Soviet interests are not. The objectives of this political dialogue will be to help avoid miscalculation  reduce the potential risk of United States-Soviet confrontation and help the people in areas of conflict to find peaceful solutions.52.	The United States and the Soviet Union have achieved agreements of historic importance on some regional issues. The Austrian State Treaty and the Berlin accords are notable and lasting examples. Let us resolve to achieve similar agreements in the future.53.	Our second task must be to find ways to reduce the vast stockpiles of armaments in the world. I am committed to redoubling our negotiating efforts to achieve real results: in Geneva  a complete ban on chemical weapons; in Vienna  real reductionsâto lower and equal levelsâin Soviet and American  Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty Organization conventional forces; in Stockholm  concrete practical measures to enhance mutual confidence  to reduce the risk of war and to reaffirm commitments concerning non-use of force; in the field of nuclear testing  improvements in verification essential to ensure compliance with the threshold test-ban and peaceful nuclear explosions agreements; and in the field of non-proliferation  close co-operation to strengthen the international institutions and practices aimed at halting the Spread of nuclear weapons  together with redoubled efforts to meet the legitimate expectation of all nations that the Soviet Union and the United States will substantially reduce their own nuclear arsenals. We and the Soviets have agreed to upgrade our hotline communications facility  and our discussions of nuclear non-proliferation in recent years have been useful to both sides. We think there are other possibilities for improving communications in this area that deserve serious exploration.54.	I believe the proposal of the Soviet Union for opening United States-Soviet talks at Vienna provides an important opportunity to advance these objectives. We have been prepared to discuss a wide range of issues of concern to both sides  such as the relationship between defensive and offensive forces and what has been called the militarization of space. During the talks we would consider what measures of restraint both sides might take while negotiations proceeded. However  any agreement must logically depend upon our ability to get the competition in offensive arms under control and to achieve genuine stability at substantially lower levels of nuclear arms.55.	Our approach in all these areas will be designed to take into account concerns the Soviet Union has voiced. It will attempt to provide a basis for a historic breakthrough in arms control. I am disappointed that we were not able to open our meeting at Vienna earlier this month on the date originally proposed by the Soviet Union. I hope we can begin these talks by the end of the year or shortly thereafter.56.	The third task I set in January was to establish a better working relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States  one marked by greater co-operation and understanding.57.	We have made some modest progress. We have reached agreements to improve our hotline  extend our 10-year economic agreement  enhance consular co-operation and explore co-ordination of search and rescue efforts at sea.58.	We have also offered to increase significantly the amount of United States grain for purchase by the Soviets and to provide the Soviets with a direct fishing allocation off United States coasts. But there is much more we could do together. I feel particularly strongly about breaking down the barriers between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union and between our political  military and other leaders.59.	AH of these steps that I have mentioned  and especially the arms control negotiations  are extremely important to a step-by-step process towards peace. But let me also say that we need to extend the arms control process  to build a bigger umbrella under which it can operateâa road-map  as it were  showing where during the next 20 years or so these individual efforts can lead. This can greatly assist step-by-step negotiations and enable us to avoid having all our hopes or expectations ride on any single set or series of negotiations. If progress is temporarily halted at one set of talks  this newly established framework for arms control could help us take up the slack at other negotiations.60.	Today  to the great end of lifting the dread of nuclear war from the peoples of the Earth  I invite the leaders of the world to join in a new beginning. We need a fresh approach to reducing international tensions. History demonstrates beyond controversy that  just as the arms competition has its roots in political suspicions and anxieties  so it can be channelled in more stabilizing directions and eventually be eliminated  if those political suspicions and anxieties are addressed as well.61.	Towards this end I will suggest to the Soviet Union that we institutionalize regular ministerial or cabinet-level meetings between our two countries on the whole agenda of issues before us  including the problem of needless obstacles to understanding. To take but one idea for discussion  in such talks we could consider the exchange of outlines of five-year military plans for weapons development and our schedules of intended procurement. We would also welcome the exchange of observers at military exercises and locations. And I propose that we find a way for Soviet experts to come to the United States nuclear-test site  and for ours to go to theirs  to measure directly the yields of tests of nuclear weapons. We should work towards having such arrangements in place by next spring. I hope that the Soviet Union will co-operate in this undertaking and reciprocate in a manner that will enable the two countries to establish the basis for verification for effective limits on underground nuclear testing.62.	I believe such talks could work rapidly towards developing a new climate of policy understanding  one that is essential if crises are to be avoided and real arms control is to be negotiated. Of course  summit meetings have a useful role to play. But they need to be carefully prepared  and the benefit here is that meetings at the ministerial level would provide the kind of progress that is the best preparation for higher-level talks between ourselves and the Soviet leaders.63.	How much progress we will make  and at what pace  I cannot say  but we have a moral obligation to try and try again.64.	Some may dismiss such proposals and my own optimism as simplistic American idealism. And they will point to the burdens of the modem world and to history. Well  yes  if we sit down and catalogue year by year  generation by generation  the famines  the plagues  the wars  the invasions mankind has endured  the list will grow so long and the assault on humanity so terrifying that it seems too much for the human spirit ^o bear.65.	But is that not narrow and short-sighted and not at all how we think of history? Yes  the deeds of infamy or injustice are all recorded  but what shines out from the pages of history is the daring of the dreamers and the deeds of the builders and the doers. These things make up the stories we tell and pass on to our children. They comprise the most enduring and striking fact about human history: that through the heart-break and tragedy man has always dared to perceive the outline of human progress  the steady growth in not just the material well-being but the spiritual insight of mankind.""There have been tyrants and murderers  and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end  they always fall. Think on itâalways. All through history the way of truth and love has always won.""That ""as the belief and the vision of Mahatma Gandhi  and it remains today a vision that is good and true.66.	""All is gift"" is said to have been the favourite expression of another great spiritualist  a Spanish soldier who gave up the ways of war for that of love and peace. And if we are to make realities of the two great goals of the Charter of the United Nationsâthe dreams of peace and human dignityâwe must take to heart these words of Ignatius Loyola: ""We must pause long enough to contemplate the gifts received from Him who made usâthe gift of life  the gift of this world  the gift of each other.""67.	And the gift of the present  for it is this present  this time  that now we must seize. I leave you with a reflection from Mahatma Gandhi spoken with those in mind who said that the disputes and conflicts of the modem world are too great to overcome. It was spoken shortly after Gandhi's quest for independence had taken him to Britain.""I am not conscious of a single experience throughout my three months' stay in England and Europe that made me feel that after all East is East and West is West. On the contrary  I have been convinced more than ever that human nature is much the same no matter under what clime it flourishes and that  if you approach people with trust and affection  you would have tenfold trust and thousand-fold affection returned to you.""68.	For the sake of a peaceful world  a world where human dignity and freedom are respected and enshrined  let us approach each other with tenfold trust and thousand fold affection. A new future awaits us. The time is here  the moment is now.69.	One of the founding fathers of our nation  Thomas Paine  spoke words that apply to all of us gathered here today. They apply directly to all sitting here in this Hall. He said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again."""
"143",7352,"VEN",39,1984,"ï»¿It is my pleasure to extend to you  Sir  in the name of the people and the Government of Venezuela  my sincere congratulations upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. Your personal qualifications and your broad experience in the United Nations serve as a firm guarantee that important and fruitful results will be achieved during the deliberations of this Assembly.3.	We have intimate knowledge of your vigorous efforts as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and of your tireless labours on behalf of the freedom and independence of peoples. Zambia and Venezuela have worked together in the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination  and this has certainly helped strengthen relations between our two countries.4.	I should also like to pay a tribute to that distinguished Latin American who preceded you  Sir  in this important office and who represented his country in the United Nations for many years. I refer  of course  to the President of the sister Republic of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca.5.	It is also a special pleasure for me to greet most respectfully the Secretary-General  my old friend and the former Ambassador of Peru to Venezuela  and to congratulate him for the efficient and outstanding way in which he has shouldered his responsibilities in the promotion of peace and understanding among all peoples.6.	I come from a Latin American country whose people enjoy fully the inalienable rights of an open  pluralistic and democratic society which  in the daily exercise of freedom  seeks unceasingly to perfect its institutions. We have chosen such a system because of its great potential and because we are convinced that no other system can guarantee with so much integrity the aspirations and development of the human person.7.	I have come here today to voice the views and feelings of Venezuela before this great world forum that is the United Nations and to set forth and share with the General Assembly some thoughts that we deem essential on the international situation. I shall also outline broadly the fundamental elements of my Government's foreign policy  which is that of the Venezuelan people.8.	My presence here in the General Assembly is unequivocal testimony to Venezuela's firm commitment to the United Nations and of our appreciation of its vital achievements in international affairs. Moreover  I have come here with the conviction that dialogue and an exchange of ideas are truly indispensable elements when we have our common interests at heart. I have made it a point to follow this approach in my own country  as it is without doubt the most useful means of nurturing understanding and promoting a convergence of views.9.	We Venezuelans are a people with democracy in our blood  possessed of broad vision and a deep- rooted vocation for peace  who believe that under-standing among States and international co-operation are possible. We are  in sum  a small nation convinced that only in this manner will form and content be given to human solidarity and encouragement and meaning to the concerted efforts of all peoples.10.	Thus  I echo the unanimous opinion of Venezuelans when I state squarely that Venezuela has faith in the United Nations  in the reasons for its establishment and in the relevance of its principles  which are more valid and necessary today than ever before. That is why we stand firmly with those who support its strengthening  to prevent it from becoming a purely symbolic institution of frustrated hopes and dreams crushed by selfishness  in many ways an impotent institution  incapable of properly facing up to the challenges and demands of today's reality.11.	We cannot conceive of a world without the United Nations. However  serious obstacles weaken its effectiveness and credibility. If we interpret current events correctly  those obstacles serve to highlight the risks facing the international community when an organization such as this is under-mined  neutralized and  as a result  immobilized. This situation tests the will of the States Members and their capacity for the settlement of conflicts in a civilized manner. A change in course is therefore necessary because it is easy to see that while the problems are getting worse  the mechanisms for resolving them are weakening. States should not relinquish their prerogatives nor should countries give up their vital interests  but in the final analysis the overriding goals of the international community as a whole should prevail.12.	The objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  adopted at San Francisco  have tended to fade away as the military Powers have increased their antagonistic policies  with the result that we now live in a system of political supremacy and nuclear intimidation  and of economic privileges in the hands of a limited number of States.13.	Smaller countries like mine  Venezuela  have legitimate reasons to express our disappointment  to call for proper compliance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations  and to demand the correction of a process which  in our view  has been the object of a historic distortion by those Powers which played a major role in the creation of the Organization  steering it away from its original course and promoting  paradoxically  an international pattern of unilateral advantages and faits accomplis14.	Since 1945  history has been warning us persistently of the risks confronting the world community. The nuclear arms race  which makes us all increasingly vulnerable  seems uncontrollable  while consuming huge resources and absorbing a great deal of sophisticated scientific research. The world is evolving towards a modus Vivendi which curtails the possibilities for international peace  security and confidence  condemning the relations between States to a simplification of the East-West dialectic  in the search for mutual expediency between the interested parties which  naturally  resist change.15.	At the same time  the lack of understanding and the resistance of the industrialized countries conspire against any effective progress towards global economic relations grounded in equity and mutual benefit. More serious yet  attempts are often made to accentuate the already existing disparities between the North and the South through renewed pressure mechanisms  all in a climate of intransigence and unilateralism.16.	We are  thus  in the midst of a rarefied international environment  of constraints and established positions resistant to change because they are kept in place by strong interests and by dogmas of one stripe or another.17.	In times of crisis and tension one must speak unambiguously  in a dispassionate and objective manner. An inescapable conclusion then stands out: things cannot continue the way they are. Bold and constructive attitudes are required of the community of nations to chart a new course for international affairs  giving rise to political evolution  social and economic development  and equality of opportunity. We demand such a change of course in international life and in relations between States  which would resolve the great paradox of the world in which we liveâan era of contradictions and ambivalence  of amazing scientific and technological advances  and yet a time of lack of imagination and of declining resolve to use those resources for the good of mankind in a way consistent with the most elementary aspirations for peace and justice and worthy of the essential yearnings of the human condition.18.	We are aware of our possibilities and our limitations  of what we can and cannot do. We know what our aspirations are  and in order to attain our goals countries like Venezuela are accepting challenges unprecedented in history. We are also aware of our faults and of our mistakes.19.	We have the moral strength to recognize our weaknesses as well as the honesty to assign clear and b-sic responsibilities to those whose duty it is to assume them. The General Assembly reflects in its resolutions and decisions a ground swell of opinion that cannot be ignored  for that would be to ignore the real concerns of our peoples.20.	In the general context of international relations  Venezuela has spared no effort to contribute to a rapprochement and reconciliation of positions and to the search for solutions to various regional problems in the geographic area of our direct interest. This we shall continue to do  conscious that indifference is incompatible with our ideas and convictions.21.	We shall increase our participation in international affairs because we are convinced that interdependence is an irreversible phenomenon and that decisions are made on a global scale which affect the internal affairs of our countries  particularly the smaller ones  which are more vulnerable to external factors. In this context  we believe that a multilateral approach which takes into account the interests of all is the right course to follow.22.	We can only hope that the economic co-operation taking place between developing countries will be complemented by increasing co-operation between them and the developed countries with a view to promoting the new international economic order. The collective self-confidence of developing countries  while promoting a more efficient use of our own resources  may also help to counteract our vulnerability and ensure a more harmonious development process.23.	After 25 years of vigorous democracy  we Venezuelans know what our priorities are in the international sphere. Our foreign policy is therefore a reflection and an expression of the values and aspirations which drive us to uphold and defend our democratic way of life as set forth in our Constitutionânamely  respect for human rights and repudiation of colonialism and racial discrimination  both of which run counter to Venezuelan convictions and our historical legacy. The aim of my Government is to intensify our involvement in all these matters. To this end we shall sponsor at Caracas in 1985 an international forum on human rights in recognition of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. This will serve as an opportunity to take stock of all that has been achieved to date and to shed light wherever darkness still persists as an impediment to human progress and the rights of mankind every-where.24.	Everything related to the fundamental rights of the individual takes on greater importance day by day and arouses the strongest interest. In the broadest sense we are referring not only to the rights of the individual as such but also to the rights of the individual in society  to the rights of peoples to a more just and equitable distribution of wealth. In our opinion  it is not possible to lose sight of these implications when discussing such issues.25.	We attach special importance to democratic processes throughout the world and in particular to those in our own region. I wish to emphasize the special gratification of Venezuelans as they observe the strengthening of democratic processes in Latin America. Let there be no doubt about it: the process of democratization enables nations to reach firm understandings  to agree upon common struggles and to achieve consensus in the search for a common voice.26.	Venezuela is above all a country whose vocation is essentially Latin American. Sim6n Bolivar's writings are very revealing of this attitude. We feel that we are linked fraternally with the peoples and countries of the region  a region whose boundaries bind rather than divide. Unquestionably  we have sometimes stumbled on the road to integration; some of the obstacles were of our own making  others were foreign. It would seem that the time has now come for us to conduct a self-examination  to explore with greater determination our own possibilities for mutual exchange and balanced well-being. The great challenge of Latin America continues to be that of shaping a community of nations capable of resolving our ancient and complex problems without intervention by outside elements that seek to involve us in strategic confrontations.27.	In fact  however  our part of the worldâLatin America and the Caribbean  the Utopian Arcadia of modern timesâhas not been able to avoid confrontation  and we look with dismay at what is happening in Central America. It is no longer a matter of minor differences between our countries but rather an obvious attempt by one Power or another to use those differences to further its own position in the world.28.	Latin Americans cannot accept the fact that their misfortunes should be multiplied to benefit schemes for foreign domination. We must ensure that this danger is averted  but in so doing we must not allow Latin America to become an area of confrontation in this difficult period of history.29.	We have shown what we can and must do in our region. The experience of the Contadora Group has been useful  and it has been accepted generally both within and outside the region as a suitable mechanism for assisting in the settlement of these complex Central American conflicts on the basis of the consolidation of peace  freedom  democratic plural-ism and economic and social development of a region which has suffered unceasingly from within and without throughout history. Four Latin American countries have worked together with the countries involved in an unprecedented effort to help solve a potentially dangerous situation. Those efforts came to fruition with the formulation of the revised Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America	and the outcome is now in the hands of the Governments of the countries of the region.30.	To be frank  I believe that there are those who are interested in peace and those who are interested in war. Time will tell soon enough who these are. In any event  the Venezuelan Government is convinced that only through a process of political development based on democracy can lasting peace and just economic and social development for Central America be assured.31.	I am concerned lest we may be on the verge of exceeding the limits of political and social tolerance among the developing countries  which are suffering from the high unemployment rates and foreign imbalances that affect all of us to one degree or another. At the same time  there is a deterioration of international economic relations. We  the Members of the United Nations  have been unable to meet on common ground and  incredible as it may seem  we have forgotten the lessons of a not-too-distant past. I refer  of course  to the great depression of the 1930s.32.	The seriousness of the crisis we are experiencing makes it necessary for us to rethink the role theUnited Nations system plays in the area of international economic co-operation and  more specifically  the negotiation strategies which have been followed to resolve world economic problems. In addition to the economic crisis  we are witnessing a breakdown in communications  intransigence and an uncompromising defence of anachronistic attitudes.33.	We are witnessing a process wherein certain powerful countries are continually postponing dialogue  which is tantamount to refusing to negotiate. This situation  in the global dimension as well as in a problem-by-problem approach  can result in some-thing we all wish to avoid: confrontation. It is clear that at this critical time the responsibility falls upon all of us  and we wish to share it in order to lay the foundations for a better future for all. We have no choice but to live up to the challenges of the hour.34.	The peoples of the third world demand just changes  without delay. They demand efforts and results  of benefit to all.35.	As an additional factor in the historical problems of injustice in international economic relations  we are faced today with an extremely serious situation  perhaps the most serious in recent history. The amount of foreign debt of the developing nations is so overwhelming that its consequences affect their very political and social stability; the dimensions of the debt problems alone require the most far-reaching understanding. We are dealing here with issues which  because of their intimate links to the price collapses in the export market for raw materials  the increasing protectionism of the industrialized countries  the irrational rise in interest ratesâwhose slight variations  a result of manipulations by the world financial market  undermine our social programmesâall contribute to the weakening of recovery efforts  denying work to millions of Latin Americans and condemning them to a marginal existence. And that is only one example.36.	It is inexcusable that the economies of Latin America  which  to a greater or lesser degree  have been under tremendous pressure  in the lean year of1983	alone transferred $30 billion to the industrialized countries. Plainly and simply  this is a disaster for our economies. We therefore must consider new and unprecedented approaches. The responsibility for this situation is not that of the debtor countries alone  but also of the international banking system  the lender countries and the international financial organizations. No one should nor can escape this responsibility. No one can feign indifference and stand aside when it comes to seeking solutions to a problem of such magnitude.37.	These concepts and opinions form the basis for the action agreed to recently by Latin American countries in the Cartagena Consensus of 22 June 1984 which refers to the problem of the foreign debt.38.	To sum up  the foreign debt of the developing countries is a reflection of specific shortcomings in the area of global financial and monetary relations  and generally in the economic system prevailing since the Second World War.39.	That is how we Venezuelans see the foreign debt problem. It is part of a gradual breakdown in the world economic system over more than a decade  a process of decay whose most vivid expression is the debt situation in Latin America today. The problem has ramifications which extend beyond the countries of Latin America and other developing regions. If  therefore  we do not address ourselves to this issue in a timely manner  with political sensitivity to the problems of the affected countries  the whole world economy could founder in a crisis of incalculable proportions. Let us not forget the dangers which could be triggered by these phenomena  among which interdependence is also an undeniable fact.40.	I have stated that the problem of our inappropriately incurred debt cannot be divorced from the process of our development  because our development must continue. Otherwise  it will run down and stagnate  creating conditions that are in contradiction with our vision of society and the role of democratic government. Development is a vital necessity for our peoples. Without it there is no justice  no security  no peace  no prospects for a well-integrated nation.41.	In order to attain these goals  Venezuela has embarked upon a process of readjustment  and this has meant enacting stem measures. Nevertheless  we have taken special pains to ensure that the burden of this readjustment is carried equally by all  so that the poor do not shoulder the greatest portion of that burden for the nation's economic recovery programme. These decisions have been made within the context of national dialogue and consultation  a process which has ensured that all Venezuelans understand the nature of the problems at hand and work to overcome them. This we shall all pursue with conviction and determination.42.	I find it appropriate to state here in this international forum that the sacrifices required to overcome this pervasive crisis must be assumed both by the developing countries  as we have seen  and by the industrialized countries. In one way or another  the developing countries are financing the deficits of the industrialized countries  or a good part of them  while  as a consequence  our peoples continue to go through crisis after crisis. It is obvious that there is a paradox here  which is irrational and without explanation or justification43.	The reordering of the world economy must be governed by the principle of fairness. The industrialized countries cannot escape the need to correct their own external imbalances and budgetary deficits. It is obvious that the industrialized countries  in a crisis that they themselves have created  are in a better position than the developing countries to carry out a process of readjustment. The capacities of the developing nations are so limited that whatever measures they take in this respect could unleash political and social traumas that could seriously undermine their stability.44.	That is why there is an urgent need to ensure understanding and to substantially alleviate the situation of the third world's foreign debt. Otherwise  the economic recovery of the economically most powerful countries  which to a large extent takes place at the expense of the economically weaker countries  would be seriously compromised and might have a much higher future cost for those countries  because  inevitably  even more serious measures would be required  with world-wide implications that could affect collective security and stability.43. Venezuela has been renegotiating its external debt within the framework of its intention to fulfil its national contractual obligations. We intend to develop an economic programme that is truly Venezuelan  a programme that will permit us to fulfil our commitments abroad without impairing our capacity )for economic and social development and our sovereign decision-making ability. I have made clear on various occasions that in no circumstances  nor as a result of any sort of pressure  will we accept conditions that could jeopardize the potential for development and well-being to which my countrymen are entitled. That is my commitment to the Venezuelan people  and especially to the poor and least fortunate among them.46.	Having established the bases for refinancing our external debt  we deem it appropriate to make the following comments.47.	The instability of interest rates creates an extremely risky situation for the developing countries. Whenever the rates are high  it is virtually impossible for a country to make payments servicing its external public debt without imposing on the general population unacceptable sacrifices with regard to their standard of living.48.	Today the principal creditors of the developing countries are large  private  multinational banks. This has had enormous implications for their respective domestic financial markets. Therefore  today  more than ever before  it is necessary for the monetary authorities of the industrialized countries to involve themselves actively in the problem.49.	It is important to avoid the long-term incapacitation of debtor countries that are trying to live up to their commitments. Such incapacitation would en-danger the continuity of financial loans  which are fundamental to world banking.50.	For a solution to be viable and successful  the individual viewpoints and needs of everyone involved must be taken into consideration. For that reason  the solution should be the result of a concert-ed effort.51.	The various mechanisms proposed have a common denominator: they all require the indispensable participation of Governments and international monetary organizations. It is impossible to imagine the achievement of a solution with only the debtor countries and creditor banks negotiating.52.	Along with many Latin Americans  we Venezuelans are deeply concerned about the problems of drug trafficking and the illegal use of drugs  which have reached alarming proportions in many countries during recent years. The increasing scope of this problem has turned drug trafficking into a social calamity which must be fought with determination and courage at all levels and with every tool available to usâpublic and private  national and international.53.	Drug trafficking goes so far as to attempt to destabilize Governments through corruption  making use of all kinds of criminal elements  tying them into an intricate network of operations  conspiracies and complicities which involve all levels of society  from subversives of the left and right to the most affluent and most impoverished of our citizenry  striking at the very heart of public life. Its penetration is limitless and has reached such a magnitude that  as we stated recently at Quito  drug trafficking not only represents a threat to the national security and sovereignty of several countries but is also turning into a dangerous agent of international conflicts.54.	It is our firm belief that in order effectively to combat the scourge of drug trafficking and the illegal use of drugs  it is necessary to go directly to the source  to the places where the raw materials are cultivated and where they are transformed into narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  and thus to strengthen even more decisive action at the main consumer centres.55.	Governments can no longer consider this as simply a political issue or a public-health problem limited to each State. It is time that we recognize it for what it isâan international problem  with wide- ranging social  economic and political implications.56.	Since becoming President of Venezuela  I have devoted particular attention to this issue  because in my capacities as a physician and a political leader I understand its devastating implications  its social consequences and its effects on youth  our most valuable resource. I recently promulgated in my country the Organic Law of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  which fully reflects the firm intentions of my Government and all sectors of the country to combat this dangerous phenomenon.57.	The domestic measures that we are adopting will  of course  be insufficient if we cannot count on suitable international mechanisms to facilitate the co-operation necessary to combat efficiently and globally this tremendous problem which repudiates the most fundamental rights of man. That is why Venezuela  at both national and international levels  is committing its resources so forcefully in this direction. In this respect  we have proposed for consideration by the United Nations and other appropriate international organizations the creation of a special fund to provide assistance in an efficient and flexible way to developing countries affected by drug trafficking. This proposal is embodied in the Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs  of 11 August 1984. That Declaration reflects the decision of the international community to classify as an international crime against humanity all activities related to the illegal trafficking in drugs.58.	I cherish the hope that this session of the General Assembly will provide the appropriate opportunity to look deeply into this serious problem. It is a problem that requires a decisive response  and it is one that can be eradicated only through an unequivocal commitment to multilateral action. Venezuela is prepared to make its contribution in all fields of necessary action. Day after day  drug traffickers cross borders. There is no nation in this world that working alone can eliminate the serious political and social problem that drug trafficking constitutes.59.	We Venezuelans are not immune to the effects of the crisis currently afflicting our worldâand I am not referring solely to the economic upheavals and political conflicts; they are only some of the consequences of the breakdown of moral values in the world today.60.	There is no doubt in my mindâand others have said this before meâthat during these last few decades when man has triumphed technologically and scientifically he has experienced a concomitant weakening of the metaphysical roots which anchor him and give meaning to both his joy and sorrow  his life and death.61.	While this feeling of helplessness has engendered among those in the developed world a sense of bewilderment and alienation from life's most basic pleasures  it has brought about even more dramatic results in our countries. Material remuneration  with which others compensate for the relative emptiness of their lives  serves but to highlight the glaring social differences which persist in our societies and the lack of understanding that already exists between the emerging nations  which are persistently trying to be understood  and those countries which still have a preponderant influence in world affairs. How do we integrate  without causing suffering  the countries of the third world into the mainstream of contemporary life or at least minimize the spiritual anguish that accompanies such change? That is the great problem which faces the leaders of the nations that form the majority in today's world. We can and must contribute to the building of a civilization that is more human and more positive.62.	Progress in all fields of human endeavour has always fallen short of the great Utopias which  from time immemorial  have fed humanity's hopes and dreams. If it were possible to probe the opinions of men and women all over the world  we would undoubtedly find that the great majority would condemn the confrontation dividing the world com-munity today. The two poles of power which are attempting to divide up the world for themselves are but a manifestation of the moral bankruptcy of our times. Once again  the lust for powerâthe oldest and strongest passion of mankindâclothed as always in doctrine  returns with its eternal message of misery and uncertainty.63.	A nineteenth-century philosopher once postulated that the happiest periods for mankind have been blank pages in the book of lifeâin other words  periods in which neither creative activity nor intense searching occurred. But we are not living in such a happy period today and  consequently  our passage on earth cannot be another blank page. The great questions of the future are beckoning us with their immense risks  their possibilities and their promises. We have but to choose those paths that open up the imagination and lead us to bold decision-making and the search for the right answers for this time  a time which is in no way one of mankind's happier periods of history."
"144",7391,"VNM",39,1984,"ï»¿I should like first of all to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I hope that with your talents and extensive experience your leadership of this session will result in many fine accomplishments.34.	I also warmly congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca  President of the Republic of Panama  for the diligent and excellent contributions he made to the thirty eighth session of the General Assembly.35.	My heartfelt congratulations also go to the Secretary General of this important international Organization  who has worked tirelessly to promote greater understanding among peoples. His dynamic contributions deserve our profound appreciation.36.	I extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam on its admission to the United Nations as its 159th Member.37.	We are all greatly concerned about the present frenzied arms race and the danger of a nuclear war which  scientists unanimously agree  would completely destroy life on this planet. Who then is responsible for this situation? Some put the blame on the Soviet Union; others  on the United States; and still others point an accusing finger at both. What  in fact  is the truth?38.	It is well known that immediately after the Second World War  while still maintaining a nuclear monopoly the United States had already proclaimed loudly the so-called danger of aggression from communism and the Soviet Union as a pretext for accelerating the arms race. Then  in 1957  when the Soviet Union successfully launched the first satellite into outer space  the United States kicked up a row about the so-called missile gap so as further to speed up the arms race. And  ever since 1978  the United States has continued to raise a hue and cry about so called Soviet superiority in nuclear weapons in order to extend the arms race to an extremely dangerous level.39.	In fact  ever since it came into existence  more than 200 years ago  the United States has never been invaded by anyone. On the contrary  it has acted as an international policeman  engaging in intervention and aggression everywhere  culminating in its war of aggression against Viet Nam. Since it was founded  more than 60 years ago  the Soviet Union has twice been the victim of imperialist intervention and aggression. During the Second World War  it suffered the worst destruction at the hands of German Nazism. Soviet troops have never invaded the United States  but  in the early days of Soviet power  the United States sent its troops to intervene in the Soviet Union  and since then it has posed a constant threat to the Soviet Union's security and territorial integrity. Over the past four decades  the United States has forged various military alliances and established overseas military bases in an attempt to encircle and threaten the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union  for its part  has undertaken no such activities aimed at encircling and threatening United States territory.40.	Since the beginning of the Second World War  the United States  with its absolute military and economic superiority  has never concealed its ambition to impose on the world a United States orderâa ""pax americanaââand to make this century the United States century. To this end  the United States has used two familiar instruments: the carrot and the stick aimed at ensuring lasting military and economic superiority so as to threaten and subjugate other countries and compel the Soviet Union to engage in an arms race which would result in its economic collapse. That is why  even in the 1950s when the United States enjoyed absolute military and economic superiority over all the other Powers combined  it still accelerated the arms race and adopted a policy of massive retaliation and brinksmanship. Even though the United States has to this day remained the number one Power in terms of strategic forces  ever since the early 1960s it has continued to clamour against the so-called missile gap.41.	The past 40 years have witnessed a struggle that changed the military and economic balance of forces between the big Powers of the world. In order to deal with the United States threat  the Soviet Union has endeavoured to narrow the economic gap between itself and the United States and  at the same time  to catch up with the United States in terms of strategic weapons. Because it was bogged down in and weakened by the Viet Nam war  since the early 1970s the United States has not enjoyed the same military and economic strength it had in the 1950s. But there is still no country stronger than the United States in military and economic terms. From the early 1970s to date  the world has witnessed the emergence of a rough balance in strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. This rough balance led to a period of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States  and improved East West relations and detente in Europe. But  since the late 1970s  the United States has considered detente and improved East West relations as not conducive to its ambition for world hegemony. That is why it concocted the so-called Soviet military threat  thus provoking international tension  undermining East West relations  accelerating the arms race  and pushing mankind to the brink of a world nuclear disaster  with the intention of intimidating and subjugating the peoples of the world and  through the arms race  exhausting the Soviet Union economically.42.	The realities of the last four decades raise the following question for people of conscience: if the United States had continued to maintain its monopoly of nuclear weapons  what would be the fate of other nations today? It will be recalled that the United States used the atomic bomb while it had a nuclear monopoly  and that it has still refused to commit itself not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. It is obvious that the Soviet Union's attainment of parity with the United States in strategic forces constitutes the firmest guarantee of world peace and the independence of all nations.43.	Like all peace-loving peoples  the Vietnamese people favour the elimination of all types of weapons  which alone can ensure a peaceful life for all people. That is why we support the efforts of the Soviet Union and other forces for peace to maintain the present strategic balance between East and West  as well as the initiatives aimed at the gradual slowing down of the arms race and at eventual disarmament.44.	Another burning issue that must be solved is the economic situation of the developing countries. The serious economic difficulties that Asian  African and Latin American countries are facing are due  first of all  to the consequences of prolonged colonial domination and imperialism's onerous exploitation. These difficulties have been aggravated by the arms race and the heavy burden of the economic crisis of the past 10 years  which the imperialist countries have placed on the backs of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America. The gap between the Western and the developing countries grows wider every day. That is why it is imperative to struggle to establish the new international economic order and gradually to improve the economic situation of the developing countries  as called for at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983. The struggle of the developing countries to acquire an independent economy and establish the new international economic order is long and arduous.45.	The global negotiations and the North South dialogue of the last few years show that we cannot count on the goodwill of some Western countries. This is natural  for  after being forced to grant political independence to the Asian  African and Latin American countries  they intend to use the economic weapon to maintain their hold on those countries and keep them in their sphere of influence and domination.46.	In Viet Nam  having failed to subjugate our people by force of arms  the forces of imperialism and international reaction have tried by hook or by crook to destabilize Viet Nam through an economic blockade and have carried out acts of sabotage in order to bleed Viet Nam white. They want to destroy Viet Nam economically so that they can teach the Asian  African and Latin American countries the lesson that the peoples of the world may win a war of national liberation but will be beaten on the economic front.47.	Despite this  we have  step by step  achieved some success. In spite of numerous difficulties  Viet Nam's economy has not collapsed  as some had hoped. It has survived the most difficult years and is now gradually and steadily improving. We have some balance of payments problems  but our external debt is small and almost negligible. We must do all we can ourselves and also rely on the assistance and cooperation of the socialist and nonaligned countries and other countries.48.	The friendly cooperation between Viet Nam and India in the last few years has brought some positive results. In particular  the visit by the General Secretary of the Party to India has opened up new possibilities for cooperation between the two countries in many fields. India is a great country  with rich experience in building an independent economy and a national culture and raising its people's standard of living. The friendly cooperation between Viet Nam and India  based on a spirit of equality and mutual interest  is a good example of economic cooperation between two nonaligned countries as well as of South South cooperation.49.	Since the Second World War  the United States has assumed the role of international policeman  and in playing that role it has intervened and committed acts of aggression throughout the world. In so doing  the United States has always used the anti-communist  anti-Soviet argument  slandering the victims of its aggression as agents of communism and the Soviet Union  and declaring one part of the world after another to be a sphere of interest vital to its security.50.	What is the truth? The 100 or so acts of intervention and aggression by the United States in the last four decades have been directed against independent countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America. As a pretext for its aggression against Viet Nam  the United States slandered Viet Nam as the agent of the Soviet Union  China and international communism and declared Southeast Asia to be an area vital to its national interest. But the whole world knows that the struggle of the Vietnamese people was a struggle for national independence against United States aggression. Now similar slanders are being used against Cuba  Nicaragua  Grenada  Lebanon  Syria and other countries to justify United States intervention and aggression in Central America  the Middle East and other parts of the world.51.	The present anti-communist and anti-Soviet policies of the United States cannot fail to remind us of the Monroe Doctrine advocated by United States expansionist elements in the nineteenth century. The difference is that the United States previously applied the Monroe Doctrine only to Latin America  while it is now imposing it on the entire world  under the anti-communist banner  regarding the entire world as a zone of interest vital to the security of the United States. Just as the Latin American peoples frustrated the Monroe Doctrine by their united struggle  today the peoples of the world will certainly defeat neo-Monroeism. The peoples of the world united with the Vietnamese people to defeat the United States in its war of aggression against VietNam; they must now unite with the peoples of Central America  the Middle East and other parts of the world to stop the United States policy of intervention and aggression.52.	The Vietnamese people has consistently sided with the fraternal peoples of Cuba and Nicaragua in their just struggle against United States intervention  aggression and threats of aggression. We strongly condemn the United States invasion of Grenada. We fully support the peoples of El Salvador  Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries in their struggle for peace  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.53.	We wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Arab peoples  especially that of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  its authentic and legitimate representative  against the Israeli aggressors and for the establishment of its own State on Palestinian soil. We express our complete support for the important initiative of the Soviet Union to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East. We fully support the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic in its struggle to exercise its right to self-determination. We resolutely support the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in its struggle against any threat of aggression by the United States.54.	We resolutely demand that South Africa immediately restore independence to Namibia. We express our full solidarity with the struggles of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  of the South African people  under the leadership of the ANC and of the other peoples of southern Africa for national independence and social progress. We attach the greatest importance to strengthening solidarity and mutual assistance among the African countries.55.	We unreservedly support the struggle of the Afghan people to defend and consolidate the fruits of their April revolution. We support the position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding tripartite talks on the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of that country. We support the struggle of the Cypriot people to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We support the right of the peoples of East Timor and of Micronesia to self-determination.56.	Although Europe was the battleground of two world wars and is currently the site of the world's* most formidable arsenal  for the past 40 years it has been the only region not to experience a local war. In sharp contrast  Asia and the Pacific are the only places in the world where  during the same period  three massive and lengthy local wars have taken place: the Korean War and the two IndoChinese wars. That does not take into account the wars unleashed by China against many of its neighbours. After having established in Europe the biggest military alliance everâthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]âthe United States went on to set up an enormous number of military alliances in the Asian and Pacific region  including the Central Treaty Organization  the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Australia New Zealand United States  United States Japan  United States Taiwan and United States South Korea alliances. However  the manoeuvres of the forces of imperialism and reaction have met with one setback after another  and Asia is the continent which has experienced the most fundamental upheavals in the world in the course of the past four decades.57.	Despite repeated failure  the forces of imperialism and reaction have still not abandoned their aggressive hegemonistic designs concerning the peoples of Asia. The United States is at present working towards the creation of a military alliance with Japan and South Korea. Japan is on its way to becoming the unsinkable aircraft carrier of the United States in Asia. Today the peoples of Asia and the Pacific are gravely concerned at the increasing collusion between the United States and China and between China and Japan  which is directed against the peace and independence of the nations of the region. Washington has never concealed its intention of forming a NATO type military bloc in Asia.58.	This situation demands that the peoples of Asia increase their vigilance and unite in the struggle for lasting peace on that continent. We welcome all efforts to that end. In this context  we greatly appreciate the initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic regarding signature of a treaty of mutual nonaggression and non-use of force in relations between the countries of Asia and the Pacific.59.	The fierce struggles and profound changes in Asia find their fullest expression in the three countries of IndoChina. The so-called question of Kampuchea is nothing but a continuation of the evolution of the situation in IndoChina over the last 40 years. In order to find a just solution to this so-called problem  the true nature of the situation in IndoChina and Asia must be considered. That situation may be summed up as follows.60.	First of all  Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea are the only countries in the world to have been ravaged by 40 years of uninterrupted war and to have been the target of a quantity of bombs and explosives five times greater than that used during the Second World War.61.	Secondly  the three countries of IndoChina have been the main victims of aggression at the hands of the United States  China  Great Britain and Franceâall four of them permanent members of the Security Council  a body with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and the preservation of the sovereignty and independence of peoples. To ensure the success of their aggression against the three countries of IndoChina  the imperialist and reactionary forces have used the ploy of the thief who cries ""Stop thief'  accusing the three Indo Chinese countries of being tools of communist expansion and a threat to neighbouring States.62.	Thirdly  the countries of IndoChina are the victims of a common enemy: imperialism and reaction. The aggressors have invaded the territories of these three countries simultaneously  with the aim of imposing their domination on all of them. Therefore  solidarity in the fight against the common enemy is a necessity for the countries of IndoChina. Their armed forces have always fought side by side for the independence of each and all of them. They have never gone beyond the borders of IndoChina  and the solidarity among the three countries has never threatened the interests of neighbouring States. Common solidarity is of vital importance for the three countries of IndoChina  as it is for the Arab countries  the African countries  the frontline States in southern Africa  and so forth. Imperialist and reactionary forces from outside have collaborated in making use of the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]âexcept for Indonesiaâand their territories to oppose the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. These forces have tried to divide those countries  using the false concept of the so-called IndoChinese Federation  which was abandoned by the three countries following the dissolution by France in 1950 of French IndoChina.63.	Fourthly  the aspiration of the three IndoChinese peoples to independence has crystallized into an invincible force. For the past 40 years  neither the successive long and brutal wars nor the sustained economic blockades and attempts at political isolation have been able to subjugate the three countries. The aggressors have finally had to agree to participate in international conferences ending the war and recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the three countries. Ours has been the only region of the world regarding which three international conferences have been held with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council. They resulted in the only international agreements recognizing the national rights of the countries of IndoChina.64.	Fifthly  the struggle in Southeast Asia over the past four decades has resulted in the formation of two groups of countries  with differing political and social systems: the ASEAN countries and the countries of IndoChina. In pursuance of their policy of ""divide and rule""  the imperialist and reactionary countries have pitted the ASEAN States against the States of IndoChina. Peace and stability in Southeast Asia require both the peaceful coexistence of these two groups of countries and the end of all outside intervention in the region.65.	Sixthly  during the past 40 years the majority of Members of the United Nations have remained silent in the face of the prolonged and most brutal wars of aggression waged against the countries of IndoChina. And today  again  the majority are siding with the expansionist forces by recognizing the Pol Pot clique  which is guilty of the genocide of 3 million Kampucheans and is now trying to impede the rebirth of the Kampuchean people. That is precisely why the settlement of the IndoChinese warsâthe longest and bloodiest in the worldâhas taken place outside the United Nations framework.66.	If the so-called problem of Kampuchea has dragged on for six years without being resolved it is because of an unwillingness to address the crux of the problem: the struggle of the three peoples of IndoChina to defend their independence and sovereignty against the hegemonism and expansionism of their neighbour to the north. Some have deliberately supported the aggressors against their victims. Similarly  there has been support for the Pol Pot clique  which massacred 3 million Kampucheans  launched wars of aggression against neighbouring countries  and is now trying to impede the rebirth of the Kampuchean people.67.	During the past six years  the People's Republic of Kampuchea has become an undeniable reality. From the mass graves of the Pol Pot regime  the Kampuchean people have returned to life and regained their national unity and harmony. They have exercised  and are exercising  their right to self-determination  which  for them  is first and foremost the right to live free from the Pol Pot criminals. But  under the pretext of defending the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination  the imperialists and the reactionaries are trying to bring the Pol Pot clique back to power.68.	Vietnamese volunteer forces have on three occasions gone to Kampuchea to fight alongside the Kampuchean people against their common enemy. Twice they have withdrawn from Kampuchea: the first time was in 1954  at the end of the French colonialists' war  and the second time was in 1975  at the end of the United States war. They will withdraw for the third time when China has ended its threat.69.	The People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam categorically reject the demand for a unilateral withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteers  a demand designed to bring Pol Potâ either openly or in disguiseâback to Kampuchea. The Kampuchean people's recovery has made possible a gradual withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteers from Kampuchea each year  starting in 1982. This has frustrated the design of those who would like either to demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteers  opening the way for the Pol Pot clique to return to power in Kampuchea  or to keep these forces bogged down in Kampuchea unable to withdraw.70.	All the military  economic  political and diplomatic measures that China and the countries of ASEAN have taken against the three IndoChinese peoples during the last six years have failed. All attempts to impose a unilateral solution on Kampuchea have come to naught. Now there is only one alternative: to engage in a dialogue  to consider jointly the proposals of both parties and to start negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect for each other's interests. We are of the view that if the parties concerned sincerely wish to settle their differences  the opportunity for doing so has presented itself. Such a development will conform to the interests of all parties in Southeast Asia and to the resolutions on Southeast Asia adopted by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  resolutions which were accepted by the countries of both ASEAN and IndoChina.71.	We welcome all initiatives by other countries to facilitate negotiations between the two groups of Southeast Asian countries to find a solution that ensures respect for each other's independence and sovereignty and guarantees peace and security in Southeast Asia.72.	Attempts to impose a solution aimed at thwarting the rebirth of Kampuchea  which would result in the return of the genocidal Pol Pot clique and which would threaten Laos and Viet Nam  should be abandoned; otherwise peace and stability in Southeast Asia will continue to be undermined. In this context  with the growing strength of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  Vietnamese volunteers will continue their annual withdrawals from Kampuchea. Within 5 to 10 years  when most of the Vietnamese volunteers will have been withdrawn from Kampuchea  the People's Republic of Kampuchea will be able to shoulder its own defence  and the question of Kampuchea will thus resolve itself.73.	As a people who have endured centuries of foreign domination and half a century of wartime destruction  the Vietnamese people long for a life of peace more ardently than any other people. We wish to entertain friendly relations with all countries and especially with neighbouring States. We are ready to let bygones be bygones and to look to the future in our relations with those countries which have caused and are still causing so much suffering to our peoples.74.	A stable situation in Southeast Asia depends first and foremost on the relations between the two main groups of countries  those of ASEAN and those of IndoChina. There is no alternative to these groups settling their differences through negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect  free from outside interference. The peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea always respect the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Thailand and wish to develop neighbourly relations with its people. However  it should be pointed out that the main obstacles are the hostile policies pursued by the Thai authorities in collusion with the foreign reactionaries  using the Pol Pot clique to oppose the rebirth of the Kampuchean people  supporting acts of subversion against the Lao People's Democratic Republic  continuing their occupation of the three Lao villages as well as their hostile policies towards Viet Nam. We hope that the Thai authorities will soon realize this  for the sake of their national interest and for the sake of peace  stability and peaceful coexistence in Southeast Asia. We demand that the Thai authorities put an end to their interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea. Thailand must immediately withdraw its troops from the three Lao villages it has illegally occupied since 6 June 1984  return the villagers it kidnapped  compensate the people for the loss of life and property it inflicted and allow the three villages to return to their normal way of life.75.	The occupation by Thailand of the three Lao villagesâat a time when the differences between ASEAN and the IndoChinese countries  having dragged on for six years  have not yet been settled and may or may not soon be settledâfurther points to the urgent need to reach some agreement on peaceful coexistence between ASEAN and IndoChina in order to defuse the explosive tensions which threaten to get out of control.76.	While constantly consolidating and strengthening our relations with the Soviet Union and fraternal socialist countries  we always wish to restore traditional friendly relations with the Chinese people. It is our view that the normalization of Sino Vietnamese relations and the restoration of mutual friendship are in the interest of both peoples and at the same time constitute a very important factor Tor peace and security in Southeast Asia.77.	Even though it will take us a long time to overcome the consequences of the war of aggression conducted by Johnson and Nixon against our people  the people of Viet Nam always consider the American people as their friends  the peoples of the two countries both being victims of that war. If the United States Government really wishes to contribute to peace and security in Southeast Asia  its efforts will be welcome. We once again reaffirm our willingness to settle with the United States all problems that concern our two countries including the questions of the Americans reported missing in action  the Amerasian children and criminals in re-education camps  and so on.78.	The relationship between Viet Nam and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is one of enduring fraternal trust that has stood the test of time. The Soviet Union is the only permanent member of the Security Council that has shown respect for Viet Nam's independence and wholeheartedly supported its struggle for independence. Thanks to the valuable assistance of the Soviet Union  Viet Nam has been able to overcome the most serious obstacles in defending and building its country.79.	The United States  China  Japan and the ASEAN countries are now raising a din about the so called Soviet military base at Cam Ranh. I should make it clear that  at present  there is no such Soviet military base in Viet Nam but our country has the right to let Soviet aircraft and vessels call at its ports in Viet Nam. Soviet aircraft and vessels calling at Vietnamese ports do not pose a threat to any country. The only real threat to all Asian countries is posed by China with the largest armed forces of the world  as well as by the colossal United States military bases in the Philippines  in Thailand and in Okinawa and particularly by Japan's position as the United States' ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"". This fact can be underscored by the use of these territories and bases in the United States war of aggression against Viet Nam and the other IndoChinese countries. The outcry by China  the United States and the ASEAN countries about the purported Soviet military base in Viet Nam is simply aimed at obscuring the grave threat posed by China's gigantic military machine and by the colossal United States military' bases in Asia. If these countries are really worried about Soviet aircraft and vessels in Viet Nam  why then do they reject the resolution adopted in 1983 by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Southeast Asian region? Why then do they refuse to accept the concept of a zone of peace and neutrality in Asia  proposed since 1971 by the ASEAN countries themselves? Viet Nam favours the idea of turning Southeast Asia into a zone of peace and neutrality  as called for in the Seventh Conference resolution and as proposed by the ASEAN countries."
"145",7425,"VUT",39,1984,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and the people of Vanuatu  I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute to you and to your outstanding work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia. It is also a most fitting tribute to the country you represent. Zambia and the other front-line States continue to set examples of patience  perseverance and strict adherence to high principles in the face of extreme and severe provocations. For this  the international community is grateful.36.	I also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  of Panama  for the excellent manner in which he discharged his very difficult duties.37.	I extend warm congratulations to Brunei Darussalam  the newest Member of the United Nations. We are particularly proud to greet a neighbouring State as the Organization's 159th Member. We wish its people and its Government well and assure them of our continuing friendship  respect and cooperation.38.	As this is the first time I have had the privilege of representing my country here at the United Nations  I wish to add my voice to those who have already spoken in praise of the Secretary-General. In the days to come  all of us will need to draw even further on his experience and considerable diplomatic skills. I only hope that we will all heed the words of his report on the work of the Organization  which is very thorough  and exhibit the same devotion to duty and candour for which he is so well-known.39.	As we stand poised to enter the fifth decade since the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the Organization  we  the nations of the world  face new and unique challenges. In a sense  the problems we discuss here today are fundamentally the same problems which confronted earlier generations.40.	How will our children be educated  and with what values? How will all of the people of this globe be fed  clothed and housed  and at what cost? How will our elderly be cared for  and their knowledge and experience preserved for succeeding generations? How will the resources of our planet be gathered and distributed? How shall we view our neighbours and how shall we relate to themâthose who are near as well as those who are far? How will we ensure that all men and women shall in their lifetimes enjoy justice  equality of opportunity  and the right to think and worship as they wish? How shall we assure all children from every corner of this earth that they have the right to dream the dreams of childhoodâ the dreams of happiness and of life? Finally  how shall we ensure the survival of this and succeeding generations?41.	These are rather simple  straightforward  time-less and universal questions. Far less simple  straightforward  timeless or universal are the answers or the various equations different nations utilize to arrive at their own answers.42.	The dramatic growth of the world's population  the increasing scarcity of some resources and the imperfect allocation of others  the short-sighted view of history that some people have  and the advent of modern technology have now complicated our search for solutions to mankind's ageless problems.43.	Some feel that they know all the answers and  in their arrogance  arrogate to themselves the role of purveyors of absolute truths. ""Do as we say""  they admonish usâbut they certainly do not wish us to do as they do. Others believe that most of us do not even know what the questions are  let alone have the faintest idea of how to answer them. One arrogance is as bad as the other. Perhaps  of mankind's many shortcomings  arrogance and lack of humility are at once the worst and most obvious.44.	If arrogance is not such a prevalent flaw in international relations today  then why is it that the threat or use of force is still the corner-stone of the foreign policies of so many States? Large and medium-sized Powers  developed and developing countries  aligned and non-aligned States  east and west  north and southâwith far too much frequencyâsee their respective military establishments as the ultimate instruments of their foreign and domestic policies.45.	The arts of peaceful advocacy and persuasion are too often forgotten or ignored. This is r I a new problem  but  given our current level of knowledge and the current as well as the future technology of destruction  are these the values we wish to bestow upon our children? Have we not yet arrived at a higher level of civilization?46.	If arrogance is not such a prevalent flaw in international relations today  then why is it that the sincere and legitimate strivings of so many people are consistently cast in  and confused by  east-west contradictions and the power politics of the world's two super-Powers? Some who should know better even continue to insist that smaller nations must choose in which ""bed to lie""  as if there were no other choice but to belong in spirit  if not in fact  to one of the world's two great military and economic camps.47.	We  in Vanuatu  know better. Our political independence  our membership in the United Nations  and our membership in the Movement of Non- Aligned Countriesâall manifest our desire to belong to no one but ourselves. Having had the unique experience of having two colonial rulers with equal powers at the same time  our people are well versed in the perils of being anyone's proxy.48.	Our unusual colonial history as a condominium left us with a great appreciation for genuine non- alignment and considerable experience in its practice. Asking us to choose between our two colonial rulers would have been a useless exercise. How can one choose between waves in the ocean?49.	We did  however  develop at the same time an understanding of how vital it is to communicate  particularly when we speak different languages. How else are misunderstandings to be avoided and misconceptions corrected?50.	Today  more than ever before  the ability to communicate is vital to our survival as a species. It is unfortunate that we do not devote more of our energy to the communication of ideasâreal ideas  and not just empty rhetoric.51.	Why cannot the world's two foremost military Powers set an example and speak to each other all the time and not just for the benefit of the television cameras? Why cannot these two Powers listen to each other as well? Why cannot they listen to the rest of us even some of the time? Are they so frightened by what we say? Are our ideas so dangerous that their military might  their wealth and their power cannot protect them? Is what we  the nations of the world  have to say so unworthy that it does not even deserve a hearing?52.	If both behave in the same manner towards the rest of us  then does it really matter which of them rules the world? Is ruling the world what each super-Power really wants? We think not. Each says publicly that this is what the other wants. But is that the truth? Is it a wilful distortion  or is it simply a major miscalculation? Who in his or her right mind would even want to rule this imperfect and complicated world? Who would want to assume that responsibility or bear that burden?53.	We believe that there are major contradictions between the world's two super-Powers  but that neither realistically harbours any illusions of ruling this entire planet. Each  of course  wishes to expand its sphere of influence and gain adherents to its way of life. In part  they see the world differently. We remember  however  that monarchists and republicans saw the world differently as recently as the last century.54.	Although today's super-Powers have some different values  they also have many similar values. Unfortunately  they seldom discuss the latter. They seem to prefer focusing on the former. Also unfortunate is the fact that each seeks national security through devices which actually help create international insecurity. Their competition is indeed frightening  but at times it has actually aided the process of human development. The post-Second-World-War decolonization process is a case in point. Their co-operation could  on balance  benefit us all  although there are also circumstances in which that co-operation can work to our collective detriment. Thus we have the paradox of the rivalry between these two giants and the paradox of the impact of that rivalry on the rest of the world. Let them compete if they must  but let the competition be peaceful and full of more sound and less fury.55.	Naturally  no sane person wants to see a military contest between these two giants. We would hope that each will pursue far gentler methods to demonstrate the professed superiority of its own social system. However  who among us can guarantee that this will be the case? Not even they can give us such assurances.56.	Anger  stress  frustration  paranoia  runaway technology  or just a plain and simple mistake could easily trigger a disaster for mankind and end everything. There would be no future. Our children  all children  would cease to exist. Is that not a sufficiently chilling thought to cause us all to pause and think?57.	We believe that it is impossible for either of these great Powers to dominate the other. History  particularly the history of each of these nations  teaches us that this is just not possible.58.	An even crueller and more insidious illusion is that one of these great Powers can achieve lasting military superiority over the other. The history of the post-Second-World-War arms race instructs us that neither side can stay ahead of the other.59.	One was first to develop nuclear weapons  but the other caught up. One was first in developing long- range intercontinental ballistic bombers  but the other caught up. One was first in deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles  but the other caught up. One was even first in space  but the other caught up. Now whatever new weapons system is deployed by one  the other soon catches up with and surpasses in destructive capabilities.60.	For the entire world  and not just the people of those two societies  the real questions are: How much longer can we continue this madness? How many more billions of dollars and other wasted resources will be poured down the drain in pursuit of these false notions of national security?61.	Must we sit by idly while these two Powers try to outspend each other and one tries to bankrupt the other? They both know  just as we know  that there is no such thing as a realistic defence against the horrible weapons of destruction that already exist.62.	The only thing that makes any sense at all is an undertaking of mutual restraint. Why cannot the road to peace begin in one capital and lead to another? Why cannot the obstacles to trust and peace be seen as common obstacles to be overcome by all of us together? Whatever happened to that old saying  ""Live and let live""?63.	Why should the citizens of one society be taught to hate the citizens of the other? Why should the children of one society be taught to fear the children of the other? Do we not  as rational  thinking human beings  have the capacity to recognize the greatness of both societies? Do they not as great societies have the capacity to think and act rationally?64.	The threat of a nuclear holocaust unleashed by one or both of the world's super-Powers is indeed a frightening prospect. Unfortunately  it is not the only frightening prospect mankind is confronted with.65.	Medium-size Powers and other small States also have their fingers on nuclear  chemical and bacteriological timers. Far too often  nations attach more importance to what they can destroy than to what they can create. More prestige seems to flow from the ability to instil fear than from the ability to educate  clothe  house or feed.66.	Drought and famine plague Africa. Tropical storms lash Asia  the Pacific and the Caribbean. Earthquakes destroy South American cities. Floods ravage the lands of developed and developing countries. Sickness and disease cross all of our borders and frontiers and touch all of our citizens. All of us have our own share of natural disasters. Yet  we seem intent on searching for and creating new disasters.67.	As if the forces of nature do not take enough lives and cause enough damage  some of us look for new man-made ways to take lives and destroy resources. Some spend excessively obscene sums of money on new weapons. Some institutionalize and expand the parameters of corruption  inefficiency and inequality  destroying  in the process  every possible avenue of escape from the cycle of poverty to which so many people are condemned. Some  through no more than their studied indifference to the plight of their fellow human beings  practise their own form of violence.68.	Each year  the agenda of vital human concerns seems to grow and grow to almost unmanageable proportions. Few things are resolved  and few sincere efforts are made by those in whose power it lies to mobilize the international community. There seems to be greater faith placed in crisis management than in crisis avoidance.69.	When will the few remaining States that have not yet done so finally sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea? When will there be universal participation in the vital tasks of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea?70.	When will there be a final commitment to abide by the international community's standards of equity with respect to the exploitation of the mineral resources of the international sea-bed? After so many years of painstaking negotiations and such careful drafting  is it not reasonable to expect nations to refrain from separate undertakings which will undermine the Convention? We urge all States to think again before acting in such a manner as to subvert this very lofty breakthrough in global economic relations.71.	The pressing need for major economic reform is well known and has been well articulated in this and other forums time and time again. How long must the world wait for concrete measures to be taken? What calamity must occur before realism replaces myopia?72.	The growing menace of organized crime and the international traffic in drugs threaten to engulf and destroy us all. Again we ask  what are we waiting for? Must personal crisis strike before we open our eyes to this clear and present danger?73.	The war between Iran and Iraq drags on at a terrible cost in human life and material destruction. Why can no solution be found? How do the parties to this tragic conflict manage to replenish their respective instruments of destruction? Whose interests are served by the continuation of this senseless carnage?74.	In the Middle East  we must ask again  why cannot the Palestinian people return to their homes and live in peace? Why must they be displaced and disenfranchised? What was their sin? How much more suffering must the people of Lebanon endure? Are there no limits?75.	How long must the people of Cyprus be divided and their land occupied? How much longer must civil war rage in Afghanistan and external forces intervene  both overtly and covertly? How much longer must the peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula endure warfare  economic deprivation and the Machiavellian intrigues of those who use them cynically to continue their own proxy wars? How much longer must the nations of Central America and the Caribbean endure ill-disguised interference in their internal affairs and blatant violations of the most fundamental tenets of international law? How much longer must the people of Namibia and the people of South Africa be victimized by the very fascism and racism the Organization was formed as an alliance against?76.	Let us not suffer from historical amnesia. South Africa is an openly racist regime which was imposed and is maintained by force and violence. It was illegitimately conceived and constituted. And it continues consistently to violate major principles of the Charter of the United Nations  fundamental provisions of international law and standards of common decency and civilization.77.	In short  in a very real and meaningful sense  it is a bandit regime which has institutionalized and elevated to State level the very terrorism every nation in this chamber condemns. How  then  can some continue to rationalize and excuse the actions of that State? How  then  can some continue to qualify their support for the General Assembly's resolutions because of what they term ""imperfect language""?78.	How  then  can some support armed insurrection in Afghanistan  but not in South Africa? How  then  can some support armed struggle against the Government of Nicaragua  but not against the terrorists in power in Pretoria? How can those who have helped make South Africa strong and its neighbours weak applaud South Africa's ability temporarily to impose its will through the use of its military and economic might? How can those who trade with South Africa by choice equate their actions with those who are compelled to deal with South Africa?79.	Finally  what will those who today are indifferent to the plight of the people of South Africaâall of the people of South Africaâsay to those people when they finally do triumph and drive the Fascists from power? Will they then claim to have always sup-ported and loved the people of South Africa  as they now claim to have always loved and supported the people of other countries who have succeeded in overthrowing their own dictators?80.	For us  declarations of any kind can never substitute for action. With respect to southern Africa  we do what we can. Our major regret is that we can do no more. Perhaps our greatest contribution lies in our efforts to make Vanuatu a better society and to promise our people a brighter future than the current regime in South Africa is able to promise all of the people of that troubled land. We wish that those who have it in their power to change South Africa peacefully would use that power.81.	In the absence of such action  we believe that the international community is left with no alternative but to support the liberation movements of Namibia and South Africa. SWAPO and the African National Congress of South Africa are in reality acting for all of us. They are  in effect  soldiers of the United Nations  fighting to defend and uphold the Charter and our declarations.82.	At every session of the General Assembly  most of the nations of the world declare their opposition to certain policies of the Government of Israel and of the Government of South Africa. We believe that most mean what they say. We also believe that most act accordingly and do not themselves define a person's worth or rights of citizenship on the basis of race  religion  sex or economic or social class. After all  how can we condemn the exclusionary policies of one State and then practise our own forms of exclusion or condone those of others?83.	For a few  however  the denunciations of Israel and South Africa are mere rituals. Those States are among those who live by the familiar adage  ""Do as we say  not as we do"". For them  there is little meaning or substance to their declarations on Israel or South Africa. They are merely reciting well-rehearsed and politically expedient words.84.	In our region  there is such a State. There is a large country many times more powerful than its neighbours. There is also a country whose anti- colonial history we have long admired and respected. However  an outstanding anti-colonial past is not sufficient to justify or excuse the excesses that State is committing today.85.	We regret that there is some justification to the Israeli and South African complaint that the international community is very selective in its denunciations. It pains us deeply that there is  indeed  a grain of truth in this argument. How else can we explain the condemnations of the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights but the silence on the annexation of East Timor? How else can we explain the condemnations of apartheid but the silence of the plight of the Melanesian people of West Papua?86.	How else can we explain the appeals for the severance of economic ties with south Africa while a South African company participates in the exploitation of West Papua's oil resources? How else can we explain the concern over Israeli and South African military expansionism and the indifference to the military expansionism in our region which has seen West Papua and East Timor swallowed  if not digested  and which now provokes and threatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our good neighbour  Papua New Guinea?87.	We are prepared to wait for answers to these questions. However  we caution the international community not to wait too long lest another South Pacific nation be threatened with extinction.88.	In the Pacific  the valid exercise of the right of self-determination for peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories continues to be a major regional concern. Our region now has the largest number of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Our region is also probably the least known  the least discussed and the least understood of all the regions and sub regions represented here in this world body.89.	Thus far  the process of decolonization in our region has  for the most part  been relatively peaceful and conducted in a climate of tranquillity and good will. East Timor and West Papua are the major exceptions and are also the areas in which the process has  through the intervention of an outside Power  been aborted. It is our belief  however  that this is only temporary. Assure the people of those lands that they will be allowed to express themselves freely and we believe that they will end their resistance  which is a product of the violence visited upon them by an outside Power.90.	Some may be surprised to hear us speak of outside intervention  violence and resistance in those Territories  because few outsiders have been allowed to visit and none have been permitted to take anything but strictly guided tours. Even humanitarian organizations have been denied access. Almost a decade ago  in East Timor  journalists who were nationals of another neighbouring country were murdered as they attempted to report on the fate of East Timor's people in the face of massive military intervention.91.	Some may have forgotten  but we have not forgotten. Some may feel that we should forget  but we cannot. We cannot forget how and why these men lost their lives any more than we can forget what is being inflicted on our fellow Melanesians in West Papua and on the Maubere people of East Timor. It is our policy to support the wishes and aspirations of all peoples in the Pacific. Cynics may think otherwise  but we believe that the peoples of East Timor  West Papua  New Caledonia  Wallis and Futuna  French Polynesia and Micronesia are as capable as anyone else in this forum when it comes to determining their own futures. Whenever possible  we counsel and encourage them to pursue the path of dialogue and peaceful negotiations  but we also know that they must have someone with whom to have a dialogue and negotiate. Let us not prejudge the results  but let there be a valid process.92.	Our region is known for its calm and serene atmosphere. The countries of the South Pacific are populated by peace-loving people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. However  our similar colonial histories have instilled in us all a strong aversion to external interference and foreign rule. On this we are in total accord. Unfortunately  the international community has not yet taking note of it. Thus  while our support is given as a matter of principle to the struggle against apartheid  little is known of our own struggle against the same practices in our own region. Although our support is solicited for resolutions on Afghanistan and Kampuchea  not a thought is given to our concerns in our immediate region.93.	Far too often  short-sightedness  inflexibility and parochialism have obliged colonized peoples to resort to the politics of confrontation in order to achieve justice  self-determination and independence. The voices of moderation are seldom heeded until it is far too late.94.	The people of New Caledonia have now asked for what has always been theirsâthe right to deter-mine their own future. The administering Power has recognized that New Caledonia's people have their right  and we commend the administering Power for its realism and its apparent willingness to co-operate. However  it is our sincere belief that time is of the essence. The administering Power must  we believe  negotiate a timetable and mode of self-expression that is acceptable to New Caledonia's colonized people. Failure to do so will only encourage extremist elements amongst the settler population and lead to the type of confrontation all rational persons seek to avoid.95.	As New Caledonia's immediate neighbour  Vanuatu is concerned about the maintenance of peace and stability. However  we also recognize that a speedy redress of the grievances of New Caledonia's people is the surest way to guarantee peace and stability.96.	The Governments of the South Pacific Forum have noted the constitutional and electoral reforms which have been introduced. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum  however  we cannot under-stand why a referendum on the future constitutional status of New Caledonia cannot be held prior to 1989. With other Forum members  therefore  we urge the administering Power to move the date forward and to announce that independence is the logical outcome of the planned referendum. We also believe that additional political and administrative powers should be transferred to New Caledonia to ensure that it is adequately prepared for independence.97.	The nations of our region are in agreement that colonialism has no future in the South Pacific. We will do all that we can to ensure a peaceful transition to independence in New Caledonia. However  all must understand that independence is on the immediate agenda. The Kanak people have made that crystal clear. Let us now work together to ensure that all will live and prosper in harmony.98.	The denuclearization of the Pacific is  to some  an abstract idea. To us  a small island developing State in the region  it is a crucial ingredient for our survival. We are aware of the connection between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain Powers which are currently undertaking various nuclear activities in our region. We note with extreme disappointment that the consistent objections raised by the Governments and peoples of the South Pacific to certain nuclear activities seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Thus  testing of nuclear weapons continues  and it is still proposed that our waters be used for dumping nuclear wastes.99.	Arguments of relative safety do not impress us. Who can truthfully state with absolutely no equivocation that our environment will not be harmed by these activities? We know that the proponents of these activities do not even understand our environment  and we seriously doubt that their scientists ever will either. We are at peace with our environment  while they seem to be at war with theirs.100.	Accordingly  our Parliament has resolved unanimously to declare Vanuatu a nuclear-free State. We have therefore established a policy of not allowing nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed vessels to call at any of our ports. We are deeply committed to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in our region  and this is one step in that direction.101.	History teaches us that every weapon mankind has developed has eventually been used. The human race is now at a turning point. We  the Governments and peoples of this earth  must let our would-be protectors know that reasoning and understanding are better protectors of human life than any weapons system devised or yet to be devised by the military- industrial complex.102.	In our search for justice  we must leave no stone unturned. In our search for equality  we must leave no stone unturned. In our search for peace  we must also leave no stone unturned. We must remember that we live in an imperfect world  and that we are imperfect beings. Only the most arrogant of us believe that we can pass judgement on our Creator's work. We must learn to respect our differences and our frailties. We must learn to draw comfort from our universality. Patience is needed as we try to understand each other.103.	Perhaps we would be well advised to remember the biblical admonition  ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"". If we  the nations of the world  live by these words  there will be no stones cast  and this world might just survive."
"146",7500,"YEM",39,1984,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure  Sir  to express to you  on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic  our sincere congratulations on the clear confidence shown in you by the international community represented in this great Organization by electing you to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will direct the work of this session in a manner that will make useful and effective our efforts to find answers to the challenges we are currently facing and to shoulder our grave responsibilities. I can assure you that we will spare no effort to co-operate with you in order to bring this session to a successful conclusion and ensure that it achieves its aims  guided by the lofty principles and ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.251.	It gives me pleasure also to express our admiration and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  the President of the thirty-eighth session  for his wisdom and competence in conducting the work of that session  thus ensuring its success.252.	I am pleased also to commend the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General to find just solutions to various international problems and crises. We also thank him for his valuable report on the work of the Organization and for his comments aimed at reinforcing the role of the Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security.253.	We congratulate the people of Brunei Darussalam on their accession to independence and the admission of their State to membership of the United Nations. The people of Brunei Darussalam have age- old historic and religious ties with the people of Yemen  and we wish them prosperity and progress.254.	We live today in a world of turmoil  an unstable world  where a climate of tension and anxiety exists in relations among nations. This is no doubt the result of the many occasions on which the threat or the use of force has been chosen over the peaceful settlement of disputes. There can be no doubt that the use of force in international relations in order to impose solutions safeguarding private interests is contrary to the principles and norms of international law and a violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. The use of force contributes to tension and turmoil in international relations  to the return to the cold-war climate and to the consequent frenzied arms race and production of all kinds of destructive weapons.255.	Complicating things even more are the recession and stagnation besetting the world economy  which have had adverse effects on international relations. We are faced today with grave responsibilities and heavy burdens. It is our duty as members of an international community  in which we seek complementarity and interdependence  to join our efforts to alleviate tension and eliminate its causes and to prevent a third world war  in which nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction would be used. That can be achieved only by the deployment of efforts  based on genuine good will  for the establishment of an international community founded on justice  equality and co-operation among all its members and thereby guaranteeing that the common interests of all are protected.256.	In addition to the exertion of such efforts  there must be a serious recommitment and adherence to the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter  and United Nations resolutions must be implemented  not violated. Unilateral solutions must not be imposed  leaving the Organization  which represents the collective will of the international community  on the sidelines.257.	It has become clear that the question of Palestine is the core of the conflict in the Middle East. It is one of the most important issues of concern to the international community and one that has been before the Organization for more than 36 years.258.	It cannot be a secret to anyone now that the root cause of this chronic problem is the intransigence of Israel and its insistence on continuing to occupy Palestine  its denial to the Palestinian people of the exercise of their legitimate national rights  its pursuit of expansionist  racist and aggressive policies against the Palestinian people and the other Arab States and its use of methods of oppression and terrorism. All this constitutes an affront to the international community and a flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.259.	A just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only if the question of Palestine  the core of the conflict in the region  is solved. Foremost among the elements of such a solution must be recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right of return and its right to self-determination and to the establishment of its independent State on its homeland  under the leadership of the PLO  its sole legitimate representative.260.	Many efforts have been made to solve the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem and to ensure stability  peace and justice  but the obstinacy and arrogance of Israel  its contempt for United Nations resolutions and for the will of the international community  its constant pursuitâwith impunityâof its policy of expansion  annexation and mass expulsion  its oppression of innocent people  its establishment of settlements in the occupied territories  its adoption of decisions designed to change the cultural  demographic  political and religious character of Al-Quds al-Sharif and other occupied Arab territories  are all obstacles to the achievement of a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem.261.	It is high time for the international community to put an end to Israeli aggression and arrogance and for the just rights of the Palestinians to be recognized. The States that support Israelâforemost among them the United Statesâby providing it with weapons  funds and diplomatic and political support  must reconsider their position towards Israel and its policy of aggression in the Middle East. We wonder how the United States can reconcile the strategic cooperation agreement it concluded with Israelâwhich today is the most dangerous regional military force  seeking expansion and hegemony in the Middle Eastâwith its responsibilities for international peace and security.262.	Israel has been a constant source of tension and threat to international peace and security since its founding. It is time that Israel and its friends and allies realized that peace and security in the region can be achieved only through the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right of return and its right to self- determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its homeland  under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  the PLO. Moreover  real security has nothing to do with the Israeli concept  which is based on inadmissible expansion and aggression.263.	The United States must now reconsider its position of bias towards Israel if it wishes effectively to contribute to the search for a solution of the question of Palestine and of the crisis in the Middle East. It must co-operate with the international community in obliging Israel to comply with United Nations resolutions  in the interest of international peace and security.264.	Those who truly support peace  justice and human rights also support the inalienable and historic rights of the Palestinian people. But those who support the expansionist policy of Israel stand side by side with aggression and usurpation. There can be peace in the Middle East only if all the efforts to achieve it are channelled to the adoption of practical measures to put an end to Israel's arrogance and its constant disregard for international resolutions  and to compel Israel to implement the United Nations resolutions on the question of Palestine and the Middle East  to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and to establish an independent State on its homeland.265.	The General Assembly has adopted a resolution calling for an international peace conference on the Middle East. That is the proper framework for any peaceful approach to solving that sensitive issue  since it is based on the participation of the Palestinian people  represented by the PLO  in the quest for a peaceful and just solution that will guarantee to the Palestinian people the exercise of their legitimate rights  in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions  as well as Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories.266.	The Yemen Arab Republic  which has given genuine and effective support to the Palestinian peopleâand the blood of Yemeni martyrs attests to thisâreaffirms that any settlement that disregards the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its right of return and its right to self- determination and the establishment of an independent State on its national soil  can only be an unjust settlement and doomed to failure.267.	It has become clear through the events of the past few years that the attempts at partial solutions and separate accords have made the solution to the question of Palestine more elusive. It is sufficient to remember that the Camp David accords encouraged Israel to intensify its policy of aggression and expansion.268.	The Arab States have done their utmost in the search for peace in the Middle East and have proven their peaceful intentions through the decisions adopted on 9 September 1982 by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez "" which were welcomed by all regional and international organizations which support right  justice and peace.269.	While the denial of the rights of the Palestinian people constitutes a set-back for lofty objectives and for international law and reflects a tragic picture of the development of events owing to the failure of the international community to assume its full responsibility to deter the aggressors and to restore the usurped rights  another Arab country  Lebanon  has  since the Israeli invasion of 1982  been the target of the expansionist ambitions of Tel Aviv  and its southern part is still chafing under Zionist occupation  oppression and terrorism. We will not forget the destruction of Beirut of the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila camps with all their atrocity and barbarism.270.	We salute the heroic resistance and determination of the Lebanese people against the Israeli occupation and condemn the occupation of Lebanese territories  and we call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories  in pursuance of the relevant Security Council resolutions. At the same time  we declare our whole-hearted support for the Lebanese people in its determination to settle its problems by itself  free from external interference or intervention  in such a manner as to safeguard the territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty  stability and effective role of the Arabs in Lebanon.271.	We express our grave concern at the continuation of the protracted Iran-Iraq war  whose dangers have escalated in such a manner as to threaten dire consequences for the region and for international peace and security. While commending the position of Iraq and its sincere response to the resolutions of the Security Councilâespecially resolution 540 (1983)âand to the appeals and endeavours of the Secretary-General  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other endeavours made to put an end to this futile  tragic blood-letting  we appeal to our brothers  the leadership in Iran  to respond positively to those endeavours and appeals to put an end to the war and to settle the conflict peacefully through negotiations with Iraq  its neighbour and sister  to achieve a just and honourable settlement which will safeguard the sovereignty and legitimate rights of both countries  in accordance with good-neighbourliness and all the other brotherly links between the two Muslim countries  and to safeguard the wealth and resources of both countries in the interests of their peoples  as well as for prosperity  progress and security. We commend every peaceful initiative and every positive response to the efforts at mediation and call upon all States  especially those with influence  to continue to make serious endeavours to put an end to this destructive war.272.	My country  which firmly believes in regional co-operation among geographically neighbouring States  is interested also in the preservation of security and stability around its borders. It therefore feels grave concern at the recent threats to navigation in the Red Sea. It condemns those criminal acts  which are aimed at destabilizing the Red Sea region  and reaffirms its previous declaration that the preservation of security in the Red Sea is the exclusive responsibility of the States of the region and that the region must be a zone of peace  free from foreign rivalry and conflicts.273.	My country also condemns any military presence or military bases in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea and once again stresses the need to declare those areas zones of peace  free from fleets  warships and military bases. We support the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and confirm the necessity of convening the Conference on the Indian Ocean  in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolution.274.	My country  which believes in  and firmly and unreservedly supports  the liberation movements in the world  particularly the PLO and SWAPO  calls for an end to the impasse concerning Namibia and reaffirms that the solution to the Namibian problem and the ending of the illegitimate South African occupation of Namibia can be achieved only through persistent efforts by the United Nations. We believe that the implementation of the resolutions of the Organization  especially Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  constitutes the proper and practical approach to the solution of this problem.275.	The United Nations and the entire world have condemned South Africa for its racist policy  which is a blot on the modern history of mankind. While the racist regime of Pretoria still boasts of pursuing this shameful policy  thus defying world public opinion and international resolutions with an arrogance matched only by that of its Zionist ally in Tel Aviv  those two entities  with their racist policy of aggression  still enjoy the support and acceptance of a number of States Members of the United Nations. We caution against increasing co-operation between the two racist regimes in Pretoria and Tel Aviv in the production and manufacture of weapons  especially nuclear weapons  and call upon the States which provide those two regimes with the necessary resources and materials for the production of nuclear weapons to cease dealing with those two regimes.276.	We note with satisfaction the aspirations of the people of North and South Korea for the reunification of their country. We believe that those aspirations can be realized only through peaceful and democratic means  free from any foreign influence.277.	The turmoil and armed conflict prevailing in Central America make it imperative that greater efforts are made to eliminate the causes of that tense situation. What we should do foremost is to encourage the peoples and nations of the region to rely upon themselves in settling their dispute peacefully before it deteriorates into armed conflict. The peoples of Latin America must be enabled to choose their own future and to express their will free from any foreign interference. In this regard  we support the agreement reached by the Contadora Group. We feel that it constitutes a sound basis and a positive point of departure for solving the problems and removing their causes.278.	The persisting and unresolved Afghanistan problem constitutes a hotbed of tension. The Yemen Arab Republic supports the efforts to settle the Afghanistan problem peacefully through negotiations between the parties concerned  so as to put an end to the terrible blood-letting and enable the Afghan people to choose the social  economic and political system which it deems appropriate  free from any pressure or interference in its affairs. We also feel that we must try to solve the problem of the refugees and of their repatriation as soon as possible.279.	With respect to the problem of Cyprus  we feel optimistic concerning the negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We feel that genuine efforts must continue to be made in order to achieve a solution that is satisfactory to both communities  safeguarding freedom of religion and equality of rights and duties for all in an independent  unified Cyprus.280.	We are stating nothing new when we say that the intensification of international tension  and the relations between the super-Powers in particular  and the attendant hotbeds of tension and confrontation prove the credibility of the non-aligned policy and the importance of the role of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries.281.	We in the Yemen Arab Republic are proud of our adherence to the policy of non-alignment and positive neutrality  our commitment to the objectives and principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and our rejection of the policy of blocs and axes. We are convinced that this is the only way that we can stand up to all kinds of domination and hegemony by major Powers and contribute to the support of world peace and the promotion of international relations along the path of detente and peaceful coexistence  while pursuing a policy that is open to co-operation with all  regardless of the economic or social philosophy of this or that regime  on the basis of mutual respect and equal treatment unprejudicial to the vital interests of our country.282.	My country is committed to the policies  principles and objectives of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and attaches special importance to disarmament issues and to efforts to put an end to the arms race. We share the increasing concern of the international community over the prospect of the outbreak of a third world war  which would involve the use of devastating nuclear weapons. That concern is heightened by talk of using outer space to launch future wars. Today it is more urgent than ever to make every effort to prevent a nuclear holocaust. The only means to avert this is to search for the appropriate means to make practical  effective arrangements to which the nuclear-weapon States  especially the super-Powers  would commit themselves. We call upon those States to seek agreement among themselves to put an end to the arms race and the production of weapons and to effect a balanced  gradual reduction of the stockpiles of weapons so as eventually to lead to their elimination and to general and complete disarmament. If this common aim is achieved by the co-operation of the peoples and nations of the world  it will be possible to channel the immense material and human resources now spent on armaments and arms production towards freeing the majority of peoples from the grip of starvation and disease and overcoming the grave shortages in their resources and potential for tackling the problems that face them in their efforts to build and develop their societies in the social and economic fields. We believe that the establishment of nuclear- weapon-free zones in the most strategic parts of the world would constitute a practical way of contributing to control of the nuclear-arms race.283.	The world today is experiencing a situation of economic imbalance: the rich grow richer while the poor grow poorer. The result of this grave dichotomy is the widening of the gap between the developed and the developing countries  with its serious implications for international economic relations in general and for economic relations between the developing and the developed countries in particular. We believe that it is more urgent than ever to establish the new international economic order  based on justice and equality  as well as new international monetary and economic structures. This requires the mobilization of a strong political will capable of tackling this enormous imbalance and of redistributing wealth instead of its being monopolized by certain States. We must always take into account the interests of all parties.284.	The prevalence of negative phenomena in international economic life  such as high interest rates  fluctuating exchange rates  protectionist trends and tariff and non-tariff barriers obstructing the exports of developing countries  and the imposition of restrictions which create obstacles to the transfer of technology to the developing countries  have led to a heightening of the international economic crisis and its serious effects on the developing countries and their development plans. The deterioration of world terms of trade  the chronic balance-of-payments deficits of the developing countries  their increased indebtedness year after year and their low growth rates  both economically and socially  have meant that the developing countries are paying the price and are sacrificing their development in the interests of the industrialized  rich countries.285.	The third-world countries must not continue to be a source of raw materials and a market for finished products. It is not in the interests of the international community to keep these States in a position of chronic economic deficit in which they are unable to honour their commitment to their peoples and to provide them with the basic necessities of life.286.	Assistance to the developing countries in their development plans is not mere generosity but  rather  it directly benefits the industrialized States in our complex  interdependent world. The de-eloping countries have submitted a number of constructive  practical proposals in international forums to deal with the international economic crisis; these include the Economic Declaration adopted by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 19 83  and the Buenos Aires Platform  adopted at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held from 28 March to 9 April 1983.287.	We can achieve welfare and prosperity for the whole of mankind if we work objectively and unselfishly  free from parochialism.288.	As we see the world of today moving towards further interdependence and complementarity  we should all seek ways and means to implement General Assembly resolution 34/138  on global negotiations  since they represent the most important  positive initiative towards activating multilateral international co-operation and implementing the principles contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.289.	My country  one of the least developed countries  in addition to its limited resources  has fallen victim to natural disasters such as earthquakes and repeated drought. These have necessitated a modification of our development projects and plans  which were scheduled to be implemented within the context of our second five-year development plan. However  under the guidance of our political leadership and with the assistance of friends and brothers within and outside the United Nations  we are optimistic about our country's ability to overcome these obstacles.290.	The needs of the age of technological revolution and the imperatives of comprehensive development call for reconsideration of the prevalent international information order  in accordance with the principles of the new information order  which should be given special priority in the joint action of the Organization.291.	In reaffirming in deeds rather than words our adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  we are reflecting values and concepts ingrained in our people throughout its history  values and concepts set forth in our national Constitution  which is the intellectual and practical guide for our people's progress towards national construction  prosperity and unity.292.	My country  which is now celebrating the twenty-second anniversary of the glorious revolution of 26 September 1962  is living through a great phase in its history and marching resolutely towards the freedom  democracy  development and unity of Yemen  under the leadership of Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh  President of the Republic  Supreme Commander of the armed forces and Secretary-General of the General People's Congress.293.	The convening of the second session of the General People's Congress last August vas of great significance in our country's progress within the context of the national Constitution. Our people  leadership and Government are working together for the triumph of democracy and freedom in our country and the development of our cultural  social  economic and political life on the basis of our Islamic faith and in accordance with the principles of the immortal revolution of 26 September 1962. Our country has made great progress in establishing an infrastructure for development  and progress is also being made in the fields of education  health  expansion of internal trade and increased agricultural production. Exploration of our mineral and oil resources is under way  based on the principle of the people's sovereignty over its natural resources.294.	The Yemen Supreme Council has made great advances in fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Yemen to re-establish the country's unity. Commissions on unity are nearing completion of their work on national reunification  bringing together our people in the south and in the north.295.	Our foreign policy is based upon a deep belief in the unity of the Arab nation and on the necessity of improving the climate of relations among Arab States  whether at the level of the League of Arab States  through summit conferences or in bilateral meetings.296.	My country  a founding member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  seeks to strengthen links in all areas with other Muslim countries. The Fifth Conference of Foreign Ministers of States members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  scheduled to meet at San'a in December of this year  will be an opportunity for a discussion of issues of vital interest to all the peoples of the Islamic nation and will contribute to the settlement of many issues on the agenda of the General Assembly.297.	Our position on regional and international questions and our foreign relations reflect our firm convictions and our genuine desire for the establishment of relations based on mutual benefit and respect. We are proud of our constantly growing circle of friends  and we feel that dialogue  cooperation and understanding are the basic elements necessary for constructing a world in which peace  stability and prosperity will prevail.298.	Lastly  I am honoured to express the sincere wish of the President  Government and people of the Yemen Arab Republic that the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success and that understanding  peace and justice will prevail in the world."
"147",7547,"YUG",39,1984,"ï»¿I congratulate you cordially  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I also take great pleasure in pointing out that the relations between Zambia and Yugoslavia  two nonaligned countries  are characterized by sincere friendship and long-lasting fruitful cooperation. I am confident that your vast experience in the United Nations will greatly contribute to the successful conclusion of the work of this session of the General Assembly.143.	I should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Jorge Illueca  of nonaligned and friendly Panama  who guided the deliberations of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly with such authority and wisdom.144.	We highly appreciate the persistent endeavours of the Secretary General aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations in international relations  as well as his personal involvement in the solution of many important issues.145.	I am also pleased to congratulate Brunei Darussalam on its admission to membership in the United Nations.146.	I regret to say that at this year's session of the General Assembly we cannot but reiterate once again the assessments we have been repeating for a number of years now regarding the grave situation in the world  one which has dangerous implications for the future of mankind. The positive values and achievements built patiently and painstakingly over the years by our joint efforts and endeavours in the struggle for peace  security and equitable international political and economic relations are perhaps more than ever before in jeopardy.147.	No pressing international problem has been solved  or even alleviated  in the period that has elapsed since the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly. One could say that many of these problems have been exacerbated even further. Yet another year has been lost for detente. We are faced with the same phenomena that threaten peace  security  cooperation and development. A new cycle of the arms race is under way  and no one is any longer certain whether this race and the means of destruction it generates can be kept under control. General insecurity and a feeling of growing threat make us increasingly hostage to the fear of self-annihilation.148.	Negotiations and dialogue between the superpowers and blocs have given way to rivalry and to accusations and counteraccusations. The need to negotiate is far too often approached from the position of gaining advantage and supremacy. The expansion of spheres of interest or influence and growing divisions seem to have become the main preoccupation  instead of efforts to overcome these divisions in the world. Therein lie the root causes that are blocking forums and channels of negotiation and agreement.149.	There are frequent cases of threats to sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and national unity  of interference in the internal affairs and undermining of the internal stability of countries  and of failure to respect the most elementary human rightâthe right to self-determination and to a free choice of one's own development. Violence and terrorism are continually used as a means of state policy.150.	The crisis in international economic relations is getting worse. The world is facing new forms of economic  financial and technological dependence and neo-colonial exploitation. The position of the developing countries has worsened dramatically  as reflected particularly in the problem of debts. The gap between the developed and the developing  between the rich and the poor  appears to be widening while the readiness of developed countries to engage in global negotiations and in a joint search for solutions is diminishing.151.	Are we not faced with attempts to block the process of emancipation and democratization of international relations and to contest and repress the principles and practices which have contributed to their positive development? Are we not faced with increased pressures to preserve and expand domination by the rich and the powerful? After a period of relaxation of tensions  greater understanding and upsurge in cooperation  we have found ourselves in a situation reminiscent of the times which  we thought  had been relegated to the past.152.	Is such an international situation actually beneficial to anyone? Do not even the most powerful countries feel more threatened today than at the time when they were negotiating and showing more tolerance for the interests of others? Has the interruption of substantive talks not undermined the positive achievements on which the great Powers themselves have built their mutual relations and respect for a long time? Does the poverty of the majority not threaten the affluence of the minority?153.	If mankind wishes to survive  it can have only one futureâa future of peace  cooperation and equality  with the right of all peoples and countries to decide upon their own internal development and foreign policy. Mankind is already well advanced along the road to such a future. However  at present it is faced with efforts to halt such a development. On certain points and on certain issues  this can and does bring about temporary stoppages. If such attempts continue  grave disturbances and disruptions will become inevitable. Is it not obvious from what they have already brought about that these attempts at halting progress in international relations lead to a deterioration of international relations that brings us nearer to serious political  economic and social upheavals with unforeseeable consequences? Is it not obvious that this road could lead to new wars? How many times has it been proved over the past decades since the establishment of the United Nations that peace is indivisible from progress in world relations and that the policy of domination  exploitation and hegemony in international relations constitutes a threat to peace?154.	There is a vast discrepancy between the present unfavourable state of affairs and conditions in the world and the need for and possibility of halting that dangerous and retrogressive trend and turning it towards peace  equitable cooperation and general progress. Peoples throughout the world are opposed to historically outdated concepts aimed at preserving any position of privilege and domination in the world. The policy of alignment and the Movement of Nonaligned Countries have offered a vision of and a platform for the transformation of the international order in the interest of all the peoples of the world.155.	The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of non-aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  offered the world a comprehensive and concrete programme for overcoming the crisis in international political and economic relations and resolving the problems which create focal points of crisis  a programme leading to a future in which peace  cooperation and prosperity would prevail. A growing number of proposals aiming at the same objective are being advanced from various quarters. The world is not short of initiatives designed to correct the present state of affairs. It suffers  however  from a lack of the will to act  especially on the part of those who bear the greatest responsibility for the present situation.156.	The development of international relations and the future of mankind cannot be left to chance  subjected to anyone's selfish interests or  for that matter  entrusted to the wealthiest and most powerful  influential and developed group of countries. The fate of all of us depends on the way in which international relations develop. It is therefore natural that we should all make our contribution to shaping that development.157.	However  the greatest responsibility for overcoming the present extremely dangerous international situation is born by the great Powers. We are all aware of the impact of their mutual relations on overall international development. Thus the entire international community has the natural right and obligation to assist in and contribute to an improvement in their relations. We therefore request the great Powers to sit down at the negotiating table in order to make the contribution expected of them by means of negotiation and accommodation.158.	We cannot accept the imposition of a cold war ideology on problems and issues of international and bilateral relations. History abounds in lessons learned at great cost which teach us that it is necessary to live together and cooperate regardless of our differing systems and ideologies. We are aware of the implications of attempts to export and impose systems and ideologies  attempts to interfere with a view to influencing internal social and economic development. We are also aware that in this increasingly interdependent world we exert an influence upon each other through our own values and common achievements  that we enrich each other with progress and achievements that have a genuine value. True values  regardless of who contributes them to the treasury of world progress  know no frontiers and do not need to be exported.159.	I would recall that we have asserted in the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States  adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session by a large majority  that:""No State or group of States has the right to intervene or interfere m any form or for any reason whatsoever in the internal and external affairs of other States."" The Declaration also states that it is the duty of a State to ensure that its territory is not used m any manner which would violate the sovereignty  political independence  territorial integrity and national unity or disrupt the political  economic or social stability of another State.160.	To what extent are these principles actually observed and applied? Unfortunately  we must say that we still witness frequent and flagrant infringements of them rather than their observance. Observance of these principles is precisely the way to a future of international cooperation  understanding  equality and confidence.161.	With each new weapon we fall behind in the race for peace. Is this not endangering the security and disturbing the tranquillity even of those who see their own security in military superiority? Can the security of some be strengthened by constantly increasing the insecurity of others? Can we reconcile ourselves to the fact that almost $ 1 trillion a year is being spent for armaments while hundreds of millions of people live in poverty and want and thousands of children die of hunger every day?162.	We have not lost hope that we can arrest the march towards the Slough of Despond  from which there is no return.163.	We recall that  together with nonaligned and other countries  we have constantly advocated from this rostrum the adoption of measures conducive to the start of a process of genuine disarmament. We are in favour of the adoption of all proposals aimed at the prevention of nuclear war; a freeze of the development  production  stockpiling and deployment of nuclear weapons; the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty; and the conclusion of an internationally acceptable agreement giving guarantees to nonnuclear States that nuclear weapons will not be used against them and that they will not be threatened with their use. We also support all actions aimed at halting the arms race in outer space and banning the use of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction. We particularly support the elaboration and adoption as a matter of urgency of a comprehensive programme of general and complete disarmament. We consider the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones to be a way of creating a world free of the heavy burden of nuclear armament.164.	Use should be made of every opportunity for negotiations and to seek internationally acceptable solutions.165.	I have already pointed out at the beginning of my statement the gravity and dramatic character of the crisis in international economic relations. This situation is fraught with the danger of great political disruptions and explosions. It seems that we have entered a period in which a new wave of neo-colonialism is affecting a large number of countries. The persistence of the developed countries in their domination is bring!"" about an ever deeper economic crisis  as a result which these countries  too  will inevitably suffer great losses and face unforeseeable consequences.166.	How is it possible to seek solutions acceptable for developing countries in conditions of growing protectionism  reduced commodity prices  huge interest rates  foreign exchange fluctuations and diminished inflow of official development assistance  which hardly exceeds half the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product?167.	Is it possible that the alarming plight of the least developed countries cannot arouse solidarity in the international community? Instead of repeating continually that these are the most seriously affected countries  it is high time to take concrete measures aimed at surmounting this critical state of affairs. The exceptionally difficult economic situation in Africa makes this all the more necessary.168.	The debts of the developing countries are the most alarming reflection of the crisis in economic relations. They threaten seriously the economic development of these countries as well as their political  social and economic stability.169.	Debts exceeding $800 billion and the burden of debt servicing intensified by high interest rates for which the developing countries will have to pay over $75 billion this year alone are unfortunately also being used as a means of exploitation  pressure and interference in internal affairs and to exhaust the economies of the developing countries.170.	The practice of shifting the entire debt burden on the shoulders of debtor countries alone is unacceptable. The creditors should also have their share in this burden. Urgent solutions for this world problem must be sought through the broadest possible engagement of the international community. It is indispensable to reach global agreements not only to facilitate the terms of repayment and to reduce interest rates  but first and foremost to ensure an accelerated economic development of debtor countries. We fully support the efforts of the 11 Latin American countries which are seeking and offering ways in which to surmount the debt crisis in their own interests as well as in the broadest interest of stability and development of the international community.171.	We expect the international monetary and financial institutions  particularly the ones most directly involved in resolving debt problems  to show greater understanding and respect for the real possibilities of developing countries and to abandon the existing practice which is unacceptable and outdated.172.	The international conference on money and finance for development  whose concept will be presented by the Chairman of the Movement of Non Aligned Countries  will be an avenue for seeking solutions to these problems.173.	We still firmly believe that lasting and stable solutions to the development problems inevitably call for profound changes in world economic relations aimed at the establishment of the new international economic order through global negotiations.174.	A way out of the crisis does not lie in confrontation between developed and developing countries. The developed countries are not in favour of this and will not accept it. A way out can be found through dialogue and cooperation which would ensure economic stability and diminish the differences in the levels of development. This is in the interest of the entire international community.175.	Time has shown once again that there can be no just  lasting and comprehensive solution to any of the foci of crisis without observance of the Charter of the United Nations and of the principles of self-determination  sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  equality  non-interference  withdrawal of foreign troops from occupied territories and full respect for the right of peoples to choose their own social system as well as the path of their internal development and involvement in international relations.176.	My country has always seen the possibility of achieving solutions based on these principles to such current crisis situations as: the Middle East crisis and the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  its sole and legitimate representative; the final accession to independence by the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its sole and authentic representative; the termination of the war between Iran and lraq; support for the unity and nonaligned status of the Republic of Cyprus; the termination of foreign intervention and interference in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Grenada  as well as the elimination of the crisis situation and tension in Central America and the Caribbean with the full support of the efforts of the Contadora Group.177.	Yugoslavia has been actively participating in all the endeavours aimed at restoring the atmosphere of relaxation of tensions and greater understanding in the Mediterranean  a region fraught with many conflicts. With a view to implementing General Assembly resolution 38/189  adopted by consensus on 20 December 1983  the Mediterranean members of the Movement of non-aligned Countries  at their recent ministerial meeting  held at Valletta on 10 and 11 September  have identified their joint position and programme of action aimed at strengthening peace  security and cooperation in the Mediterranean.178.	In its entire international activity  Yugoslavia has proceeded from the fact that the United Nations is an irreplaceable forum for safeguarding peace  strengthening security and resolving international problems. We oppose any attempt to undermine the positive results achieved by the United Nations in numerous fields and to exclude the world Organization from the solution of the major problems of the present day.179.	This session of the General Assembly is faced with questions: what are we bringing with us into the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  what have we learned from the experiences gained over the past four decades and what are we expected to do as a result of the great transformations that have taken place in the world and have changed the Organization? Where and how to continue is the question to which an answer should be sought and found precisely on the occasion of this anniversary  and particularly an answer to the question of how to make the United Nations more effective and capable of ensuring respect for and implementation of the principles  norms and decisions that we have adopted and will adopt in the future. This anniversary provides an opportunity for the greatest possible number of heads of State or Government to gather at the United Nations and engage in a useful dialogue on the most important questions related to the functioning of the Organization and to the problems of the present-day world.180.	In the present dangerous international situation  it is difficult to be an optimist  but nor are we pessimists. We do share a common destiny and a common future. We have to defend what we have in common since we made many sacrifices and have invested much effort and hope. Consequently  we should not forsake our common heritage. Furthermore  we must persevere in our effort to make the world of tomorrow better than today's world. Let us therefore respond in thought and action to the message of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of non-aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983: ""The earth belongs to us allâlet us cherish it in peace and true brotherhood  based on the dignity and equality of man."""
"148",7575,"ZAF",39,1984,"ï»¿Allow me first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Central African Republic  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your long experience acquired in the course of your diplomatic career and your superb knowledge of international issues bode well for the great success of the work of this session. My delegation would like to assure you at the outset of its readiness to assist you.105.	I should also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the support of the Central African Republic for the Secretary-General  whose work on behalf of the Organization is both dedicated and selfless.106.	Lastly  our delegation wishes to extend a warm welcome to Brunei Darussalam whose admission is a further reflection of the universal role of the United Nations.107.	Since the founding of the Organization  its usefulness and effectiveness have continually been called into question. The resolutions it has adopted  the solutions it has worked out  the recommendations it has made  have never really fulfilled the hopes cherished by peoples stricken by crises and conflicts; they have never completely allayed the tensions and upheavals in the world. Therefore  despite the heterogeneous nature of the Organization and its complexity  it should show a more definite spirit of consensus and return to its original objectives  namely  the noble ideals of peace and development laid down in the Charter of the United Nations.108.	The sweeping currents of ideas  discoveries and technological innovations should lead to a change in the relations between nations; all such changes should lead to a true world balance. Unfortunately  reality is quite different. We are  in fact  witnessing a resurgence of intolerance  insecurity  selfishness and violence. Despite that gloomy picture  we shall not give in to either defeatism or scepticism. Despite numerous stumbling-blocks  the United Nations continues to be the forum in which discussions and negotiations on the fate of the world are held.109.	In today's world  which is characterized by diversity  the right to be different should be recognized as a fundamental principle governing relations among States  a right to be different that the United Nations fosters and develops  the right of each people to flourish within the context of its own history  its own culture  its own beliefs and the political and economic system it has freely chosen. When denied to othersâas is so often the caseâthis right to be different becomes a source of turbulence  hatred and confrontation.110.	In Africa  in Asia  in Europe  as well as in America  evidence of such intolerance and selfishness is all too common. Often  peoples are stifled. Their legitimate struggles for their inevitable emancipation and their power to decide their lot in full exercise of their sovereignty are being thwarted by sordid personal interests.111.	Are examples necessary? The situation prevailing in southern Africa is a very eloquent case in point. It is  of course  true that the agreements recently concluded between South Africa and some countries of the region are an encouraging step along the road towards peace. However  that remains problematical. So long as SWAPO  the sole representative of the Namibian people  is denied recognition of its national rights  peace cannot be lasting and total. It is more than ever important that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) be fully observed and implemented.112.	The Central African Republic welcomes the recent agreements concluded between France and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to withdraw all foreign forces from Chad. It hopes  however  that the simultaneous withdrawals will be effective and complete  not just from the capital  N'djamena  and its immediate environs  but from all Chadian territory. Chad must regain possession of the whole of its original territory. That would enable the Government of that brotherly neighbouring country finally to dedicate itself fully to the task of reconciliation and national reconstruction begun by President Hissein Habre.113.	With regard to the question of Western Sahara  our delegation believes that an excellent basis for seeking a solution can be found in the resolutions adopted at the eighteenth and nineteenth ordinary sessions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity. In that connection  we cherish the firm hope that the next session of that Assembly will provide an opportunity to assess the efforts made by the countries involved.114.	With regard to the question of the Middle East  everyone knows that the Palestinian problem lies at the heart of the conflict. No acceptable solution can therefore be arrived at which ignores the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In that connection  we shall continue to support any initiative in line with the spirit of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) aimed at bringing about a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the conflict.115.	In the same context  the Central African Republic makes an urgent appeal to the international community to spare no effort to preserve and guarantee the national unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty and neutrality of Lebanon.116.	In the name of the principle of recognizing the right to be different  Democratic Kampuchea should be enabled fully to exercise its sovereignty. To that end  we hope to see the full application of the principles laid down by the Organization.117.	The Central African Republic also supports any initiative designed to enable Afghanistan to regain its national rights and its status as a neutral  non-aligned country.118.	The problem of Korea remains a pressing one. The persistent tension in the Korean peninsula is of concern to the Central African Republic. Thus  as part of our contribution to the efforts being made by the international community to reduce such tension  we shall continue to urge both parties  which undeniably aspire to reunification  to pursue their dialogue on the basis of the South-North Joint Communique of 4 July 1972  which set forth the principles for such action. Free  direct dialogue  free of outside interference  would unquestionably enable the parties to establish the conditions for the restoration of the mutual confidence indispensable for the maintenance of peace in the region. Both parties could  in the meantime  plan for their simultaneous admission to membership in the United Nations.119.	Given the situation prevailing in Central America  the Central African Republic believes that negotiation is the only appropriate means for achieving a peaceful solution and for promoting the harmonious coexistence of the States of the region 120.	These several examples of the refusal of certain States to recognize and accept the right to differences are based on a two-pronged interest. First  there is an ideological interest  since those States which reject the right to differences are often members of an alliance bloc. A treacherous complicity does  indeed  exist on the part of part of the international community. That complicity impedes mutual understanding and confidence. And then there is strategic interest in the policies of certain States which have embarked on the arms race in order to maintain their military and economic domination.121.	Thus  while the Central African Republic welcomes the negotiations under way on disarmament  it also deplores the fact that they are brought to stalemate at a time when the proliferation and development of arms are reaching alarming levels  thus perpetuating the vicious circle of destruction.122.	The disarmament we so fervently wish for cannot be achieved solely through regional security and arms limitation agreements. All States must be aware of the pressing and collective task of championing international  peace and security.123.	The Central African Republic is firmly convinced that the effective development of all the countries of our community is a condition for global balance and a guarantee of peace. Development also means the right to life and therefore it cannot be jeopardized. We call on the developed countries to contribute effectively  through bilateral or multilateral agreements  to the realistic development of the countries of the third world. For  one and indivisible  peace requires  if it is to be preserved  the universal development of all the members of the international community.124.	The inadequacy of the present international economic system is resulting in enormous difficulties for the developing countries. Will the alarm so often sounded ever be heard?125.	While concerned with providing a minimal decent standard of living for our peoples  our countries are rarely able to find the means to implement the economic plans and programmes which have been drawn up. Thus  we continue to suffer severely from the effects of the world economic crisis and from the shortcomings of the economic system. We deplore the attitude of certain industrialized countries which act as though the developing countries should come to terms with their poverty levels and even be content with them.126.	The countries of the third world are struggling not only for the right to development but also Tor a more significant mobilization of the means for development. The unbreakable link between the right to development and the right to security requires  in turn  the developing countries to observe an indispensable and reasonable balance between the means allocated for security and those given over to development.127.	Thus  it is regrettable that  after the adoption in 1974 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  there is still a gap between the socio-economic development efforts of certain industrialized countries and others which are less industrialized.128.	The international crisis seems to have disallowed any claim of the developing countries to such development  and therefore to life. The assistance which is accorded them  dwindling day by day  is clearly inadequate and the terms of trade are growing worse at a dizzying pace.129.	Our countries are in debt and are bowed under the burden of the amounts due; these debts are worsened and inflated by the crisis of the international monetary system. At the same time  our balance of trade shows a deficit and access to development sources and new technology  which are so badly needed to maintain development projects  seems to be denied to us solely because we happen to be developing countries.130.	We continue to be greatly disappointed  and we state this in this lofty gathering  all the more so because our hopes have faded since the work of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in 1983  and of the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  held at Vienna earlier this year.131.	A joint definition of new international economic regulations by the industrialized countries and by the third world is needed today. The entire international community would benefit from the beginning of global negotiations designed to putting a halt to this crisis.132.	The results achieved in three years by the Military Committee for National Recovery in working to restore and rebuild the Central African Republic are very encouraging and are a cause of satisfaction for us because the result first and foremost from our own efforts133.	But such success is also due to the valuable assistance given by friendly countries and by international organizations  including the United Nations. I should like once again to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General and his co-workers for the unceasing concern which they continue to show for the Central African Republic. The road is still long and the task an arduous one. That is why we should like to be assured of continuity and stepping up of international assistance.134.	While observing the third anniversary of ac-cession to power of the Military Committee for National Recovery  the Head of State  General Andre Kolingba  began his speech as follows: ""For three years now the Central African Republic has seen the Military Committee for National Recovery at work. These three years have been imbued  above all  with peace ""âI repeat  with peaceâ""a factor working for stability and a sine qua non condition for any kind of development.""135.	That equation of peace and development is the basis of the philosophy of action advocated by the Central African Republic  on both the domestic and the international level.136.	For we have faith in the possibility of warding off those ills which loom as a serious threat over the future of the international community. The solution lies in respect by all States for the fundamental values of the right to differences and the right to development.137.	That is the message which General Andre Kolingba  Chairman of the Military Committee for National Recovery and Head of State  deeply convinced of the ability of the Organization to resolve world problems and drawing inspiration from the well-springs of our philosophy  has entrusted us to present for the consideration of the Assembly.138.	The entire Central African Republic joins us in wishing all possible success for the work of the Assembly."
"149",7645,"ZWE",39,1984,"ï»¿First  Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you most warmly on your richly deserved election to the highest office of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Yours is probably one of the longest associations with the United Nations  making you one of the most experienced and knowledgeable diplomats with regard to its operations. This  together with your tested and proven personal abilities  gives us advance confidence in your stewardship of this Assembly. I wish also to note with particular satisfaction that your great country and people are linked to my own by a commonality of geography  history and culture  all of which shape our common destiny. As I wish you well in your tenure in this onerous office  let me also pledge the full co-operation of the Zimbabwe delegation in all your efforts to make this session the most successful.3.	Secondly  I should like also to congratulate your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jorge Illueca  the President of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  for the efficient manner in which he performed his duties and responsibilities.4.	My third  and a special  tribute goes to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts for the enhancement of the effectiveness and strength of the Organization and for his quest for international understanding  harmony  peace and prosperity. His efforts in Africa in general and in the volatile southern African region in particular have earned him the admiration of all of us in Africa. His thought-provoking and honest analysis of the prevailing unstable world situation  as outlined in the 1982  1983 and 1984 reports on the work of the Organization  not only reflects a deep concern about the state of our international relations  but also calls for serious reflection by all who are concerned that the United Nations fulfil the original ideals and purposes its founding fathers intended for it 40 years ago.5.	Finally  on felicitations  we of the Zimbabwe delegation very warmly greet and welcome to our midst the 159th and newest Member of this great international family of nations  the sovereign State of Brunei Darussalam.6.	I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to participate today in the Assembly's deliberations. My last address to the General Assembly was on 26 August 1980  at the eleventh special session  on the historic and momentous occasion on which my then only four-month-old sovereign nation was admitted to the United Nations. My pleasant  if also rather difficult  task then was to thank  on behalf of my Government and people  the international community and all progressive international forces  countries and groups for their respective assistance to the gallant Zimbabwean masses in our glorious liberation struggle to end a century of one of the most vicious and brutal types of colonialism  imperialism and capitalist exploitation. I also enunciated the main principles and ideals inspiring and guiding my fledgling nation's domestic  foreign and economic policies  which  as I emphasized at that time  are also very consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.7.	At the risk of boring the Assembly  I should like with its indulgence to say a word about developments in Zimbabwe since my last address to this body. Soon after the attainment of our independence  our most immediate and paramount task was the integration of the three previously hostile armed forces. Painstakingly  that was done  and today we are proud to speak of a single integrated Zimbabwe National Army.8.	At the national level  we embarked on the policy of reconciliation. We did not embrace this policy of national reconciliation just for its own sake. In fact  as a Government we believed that  for the people to tackle the enormous task of national development  past differences had to be forgotten and past crimes forgiven. We believed that peace  mutual respect and trust  as well as unity of purpose  would be the only way to surmount the daunting social and economic problems that faced us after a long and bloody conflict.9.	In line with the policy of reconciliation  a Government of national unity was created in which members of minority parties were invited to participate actively. Owing in no small measure to that policy and  of course  to the sheer determination of our people  we have gone a long way in our tasks of reconstruction  rehabilitation and resettlement. Hence  it is fair to say today that true democracy  social justice  national confidence and peaceâhitherto a mere dreamâare now realities in Zimbabwe.10.	We are determined not only that our people must exercise political power but also that their political independence and freedom should be accompanied by the enjoyment of concrete and material benefits emanating from the new order. In other words  the satisfaction of the material needs and welfare of our people is to us as important as their right to political control. It means  therefore  that the building and development of the new Zimbabwe has to be done in conditions of sustained economic growth with equity.11.	Major and far-reaching political decisions designed to enable the country both to attain its domestic policy objectives and to play its rightful role in the regional and international arenas continue to be adopted. The latest of these were taken by the Second Congress of my Party  the Zimbabwe African National Union  held at Harare last August. The Congress gave policy guidelines on all major national issues.12.	This session of the General Assembly  like the two or three sessions before it  is taking place against the background of a really sombre international environment. The world economic situation  world peace and security  and respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of all peoples  which are the main concerns of the United Nations  are all in jeopardy. Unless we all  and especially the wealthy and the militarily more powerful nations  rise to our collective responsibilities in accordance with the trust which all mankind reposes in us by virtue of being Members of the Organization  the crisis now confronting world civilization will continue relentlessly until this civilization is brought to its extinction.13.	In commenting upon the gravity of our contemporary international situation and the numerous serious problems buffeting it  I wish  with the Assembly's indulgence  to begin by drawing urgent attention to developments in southern Africa. As representatives know  there the apartheid Pretoria regime's dual policy of domestic terror  repression and exploitation of the mass of the black population under its ferocious rule  on the one hand  and the systematic military intimidation  brute bullying  political and economic blackmailing of neighbouring and front-line States  on the other  is endangering the sovereignty of those States. It is also seriously undermining and threatening the entire region's economic viability  peace and security.14.	The people of Namibia continue to suffer under the colonial domination and brutal oppression of the South African racist regime. Although the latter has long declared its acceptance of the now six-year-old Namibian plan designed to effect the peaceful transfer of power to the people of Namibia and  therefore  end the liberation war  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has yet to be implemented because South Africa  encouraged and assisted by some respectable Members of the General Assembly  has since 1981 been equivocating and prevaricating on this plan. But the more important aspect of the Namibian problem to us is the fact that a quid pro quo for the withdrawal of South African occupation forces in Namibia has been introduced which has nothing to do with the issue of decolonization of that Territory; and the even more surprising feature of that demand is the fact that it has been fully endorsed by some Members of the Assembly. I am referring to the demand that Cuban troops must be withdrawn from Angola before Namibia can achieve its independence  which thus envisages the parallel or simultaneous withdrawal of Cuban troops and South African occupation forces from Angola and Namibia  respectively.15.	Zimbabwe continues to reject categorically and totally that linkage and any other insidious machinations contrived by Pretoria or any other Government to delay Namibia's independence. Further  we also want to make it abundantly clear that we stand totally opposed to any initiatives designed to undermine Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which has been reaffirmed by Council resolutions 532 (1983) and 539 (1983). Namibia is a unique United Nations responsibility and cannot and should not therefore be reduced to a bilateral issue  as that would be detrimental to the interests of Namibia and to international peace and security. Zimbabwe fully subscribes to the position adopted by the Summit Meeting of Front-line States  held at Arusha on 29 April 1984  that:""the immediate objective for Namibia is and must be the rapid implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  in order that Namibia may attain full and internationally recognized independence on the basis of self-determination by all people of that country"" The leaders of the front-line States also reiterated the continuing role of the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the implementation of the United Nations plan  as reaffirmed in Security Council resolutions 532 (1983) and 539 (1983).16.	In South Africa itself  we continue to witness the brutal exploitation and oppression of the masses by the racist apartheid regime. We do not wish to take up precious time in merely condemning that iniquitous system based on racial bigotry. Thousands of South African patriots are languishing in prisons because of their resistance to and repudiation of the apartheid system. Many more have lost their lives in the struggle for their birth right and freedom. The racists are making efforts to extricate themselves by trying to hoodwink the international community through the introduction of the so-called constitutional reforms.17.	I must  however  warn that not even that so- called political dispensation and the subsequent sham elections among the Coloured and Asian communities can deceive the oppressed South African masses about the real political objectives of the racist regime. The oppressed masses of South Africa and all their external friends and allies know full well that these so-called constitutional changes are but another chapter in the dark and sordid history of apartheid and that their real objective is the enhancement of and not the tampering with institutionalized racism. It is not surprising  therefore  that the so- called elections were boycotted by the majority of the peoples whose interests they purported to protect. Not surprising also were the demonstrations against the elections in black and other townships during the first weeks of September. Sad  but equally predict-able  was the violent and bloodthirsty manner in which the legitimate protests were handled by the ferocious police machinery of the apartheid regime  which left no fewer than 50 persons dead  including schoolchildren.18.	In the face of the brutality and stubbornness of the racist apartheid regime  the international community has no alternative but to give more help to the South African national liberation movement and all those waging a just struggle for freedom and dignity in South Africa.19.	It is now common knowledge that the racist Pretoria regime is engaged in a vigorous campaign of destabilizing the front-line States. It has recruited  trained  financed and equipped mercenaries and armed insurgents to carry out acts of banditry against the sovereign States of Botswana  Lesotho  Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe. Economic blackmail and sabotage are all tactics used by the racist South African regime. The racist regime has not even refrained from taking advantage of the unfortunate position of its land-locked neighbours.20.	The States Members of the United Nations are well aware that the South African forces are still occupying parts of the Republic of Angola. The abortive coup dâÃ©tat against the Government of the Seychelles two years ago showed once again the dangerous nature of the racist regime. In December 1982  the racist troops of the Pretoria regime committed yet another heinous act of aggression in neighbouring Lesotho  where they massacred more than 40 innocent people  including women and children  in cold blood.21.	We vehemently condemn these acts of aggression  which seek to foment political and economic instability in our region and increase the dependence of the front-line States on South Africa. We call upon South Africa to stop this policy of aggression.22.	Only through broader economic co-operation with the rest of the world can the countries of the southern African sub region evade one of their major problems  emanating from a complex linkage of their economies to that of racist South Africa.23.	As a region  we have taken concerted action to free ourselves from South African economic domination  and to that end  as is known  we formed the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference in 1980 and the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade Area in 1981. These two organizations should not be viewed in a narrow sense as merely economic organizations but rather in the broadest perspective as components of wider strategies and instrumentalities designed to facilitate a number of the grand aspirations and objectives of our respective States and Governments. We seek to promote closer economic interdependence between the economies of our countries with a view to creating a viable and meaningful economic community. Although appreciable progress has been made in both organizations  economic sabotage and incursions against our infrastructure  installations and other equipment by South African-sponsored insurgents have caused a lot of set-backs for our economic development. It is in this light that we are calling upon members of the international community to aid and co-operate with the front-line and other States of the sub region in fostering their economic independence and sovereignty.24.	I come now to other world issues. It is our feeling that the United Nations must be gravely concerned about and must reject and condemn racism  colonialism  military aggression  intervention and destabilization wherever and by whomever they are perpetrated  be it in Western Sahara  where the Saharan people are denied their self-determination; in the Middle East  where the root cause of all the tension and conflict is zionism and Israeli expansionist policies and practices and where the Palestinians' right to a homeland and to self-determination is denied them; in Cyprus  where external aggression and interference have promoted and encouraged the unilateral secession now threatening that country's territorial unity  political integrity and sovereignty; in Central America and the Caribbean  in particular in Nicaragua and Grenada  where external intervention and interference in the affairs of States is sowing seeds of tension and conflict which hamper and impede democratic processes of transformation and interstate harmony; in East Timor  where foreign occupation prevents the people from exercising political independence and sovereignty; in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where the presence of foreign troops and the lack of strict observance of the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of other States are threatening the political sovereignty and the non-aligned position of those countries.25.	My Government's concern over the situation in these countries has been reiterated in every international forum  including the General Assembly  and is therefore well known; so also is our moral and diplomatic support for and solidarity with the liberation movements and progressive forces striving to bring about change in their respective countries.26.	I now turn to a theme that is of particular relevance and importance to the General Assembly at its current session  that is  the state of world peace and security. This session is taking place on the very eve of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and unhappily also against the background of an international situation characterized by everything the Organization was founded to prevent. This session therefore provides us with and opportunity for serious introspection regarding those noble objectives and ideals which inspired and guided the founders of the Organization 39 years ago. As we begin this introspective exercise  we will do well to recall that the founding nations committed themselves  in the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"".27.	To the extent that  since the founding of the United Nations  mankind has not witnessed a global tragedy  an agony and turmoil of the magnitude of the two world wars  we can perhaps congratulate ourselves. We can also hope that the tragic lessons of the two world wars have had a salutary and permanent impact on our generation and on future generations. We are afraid  however  that such hopes may not be worth much when viewed against the realities of the increasingly threatening international situation  characterized as it is by disrespect for and gross violations of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Some Members  especially those which are militarily more powerful  do not hesitate to resort to the threat or actual use of force or armed intervention in the internal affairs of other States in the pursuit of their own  often narrow  national interests or aspirations.28.	Such disregard for and violations of Charter principles and international law  together with the now more than apparent powerlessness and inability of the Security Council to act effectively in such situations  throw into doubt the efficacy of the system of collective security  as envisaged in the Charter. The small and militarily weaker nations  constituting by far the largest percentage of the membership of the United Nations  live in real fear that this is the tragic direction in which the world is moving.29.	The fears about the increasingly deteriorating international situation and the uncertainty about the future of world civilization are exacerbated further by the proliferation of the arms race. I am not suggesting here that the small and militarily weak are the only ones concerned about international peace and security. But it is common knowledge to all of us that the arms race competes with development objectives. Not only is the development process robbed of much-needed resources  but humanity in general is deprived of the means of improving the quality of life. As the old African adage goes: ""Where two elephants fight  it is the grass that suffers""; so is it true that through the proliferation of armaments  the least developed countries suffer most. To halt the arms race has therefore become one of the most urgent tasks of our times. The United Nations will have failed dismally if it does not heed the eloquent calls  emanating from all corners of the earth  to halt the arms race.30.	This already tense international situation is further exacerbated by the current international economic crisis  unparalleled in modern times. We are convinced that the problem afflicting the international economy is a structural one  resulting from the asymmetry and disequilibrium of the world economic system.31.	The gravity of the crisis can be seen from the fact that no group of countries has escaped its malignant consequences. Even the developed countries have experienced low growth rates  stagnating incomes  excessive interest rates  high rates of inflation and massive unemployment. The social and political manifestations of the prevailing malaise can be seen from organized protests  strikes and growing social violence.32.	The situation has been and continues to be even more critical in the developing countries  some of which have the weakest national economies in the world. For these and  therefore  for the many millions of the world's population  the effects of the worsening world economic situation have been really catastrophic. In Africa  our fragile economies have been experiencing negative growth rates  and per capita incomes have actually dropped to about 4 per cent below the 1970 levels. This drop in per capita incomes clearly spells grave socio-political consequences when viewed against the fact that Africa's population growth rate is 3 per cent per annum. In many parts of the continent  too  successive years of drought have resulted in complete crop failures and threatened the very viability of agriculture  on which millions of the continent's population depend for sustenance and gainful employment. Africa's problem is further compounded by other natural factors  including desertification  the siltation of riverbeds and  in some cases  flooding too.33.	Even where and when we have been able to produce enough and are seeking outlets for our exports  tariff and non-tariff barriers in the industrialized countries have arrested our export growth. Similarly  our economies continue to endure balance- of-payments problems  and the position has not been ameliorated by the completely unrealistic approach taken by the IMF to the problems of the developing countries  in fact  our terms of trade have been failing  because of the prices of raw materialsâon the export of which our economies dependâare experiencing a downward trend  whilst those of manufactures and capital goods have been rising.34.	We are also seriously concerned by the indebtedness of the developing nations. For example  developing Africa's estimated outstanding external debt alone reached $150 billion at the end of 1983. That is $25 billion more than in 1980. The rise in indebtedness coincided  of course  with a steep increase in the associated debt-servicing costs. Efforts to alleviate the debt-servicing costs through rescheduling have not been very successful because they have been on conventional lines  providing only short- term relief. In fact  greater proportions of the debt are composed of previously rescheduled debts  which in normal conditions have lost their eligibility for further rescheduling.35.	In these circumstances  our countries would have expected more development aid. Although sub- Saharan Africa's share of the otherwise stagnant or declining official development assistance has been slightly increasing  net capital flows from private sources have declined by as much as 50 per cent since 1980. Another worry we have is the progressive erosion of multilateralism in official development aid. The bilateral nature it is assuming is  much to our dissatisfaction  accompanied by its increasing politicization and commercialization. In fact  this trend is evidenced by the under-funding of international development institutionsâIDA  UNDP  IFADâinstitutions that are of particular significance to African and other low-income countries.36.	In order to ameliorate this situation we have tried to get the global negotiations launched. The Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at their Seventh Conference  held at New Delhi in March 1983  suggested a two-pronged approach to this problem. Emphasis was laid on a programme of immediate measures to encompass such important areas as commodities  trade  development  money and finance. The other measures would relate to the restructuring of the world economy in the long term. Unfortunately  all our efforts to get these negotiations launched have been in vain. Global negotiations must remain the framework of concerted efforts aimed at restructuring international economic relations to match our new needs. Let us recognize the interdependence of all economies  for there can be no revitalization of the world economy without active participation by all countries.37.	Let me conclude my statement with a sincere call on all members of the General Assembly for bold and far-sighted action. The problems facing the Assembly need dedication and audacity  so that together we can implement the mandate given to us by the millions of people all over the world who have reposed their confidence in the United Nations. We cannot afford to fail.38.	I wish to assure you  Mr. President  and all the representatives here present that Zimbabwe will do its utmost towards the fulfilment of the noble goals of the United Nations."
