"1",12,"AFG",37,1982,"May I  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  congratulate Mr. Hollai of Hungary on his election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His election to that important post is not only precognition of his professional and human qualities  but also a well-deserved tribute to his country  with which we enjoy the best of relations. These relations were further consolidated by the signing 10 days ago of the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation between our two countries during the visit of Babrak Karmal  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and President of the Revolutionary Council  to his fraternal country. I hope that under his presidency the current session of the General Assembly will make a notable contribution to the cause of strengthening international peace and security. I should like to assure him that the Afghan delegation will fully co-operate with him and help him in every way to discharge his duties. May I also express my appreciation to his predecessor  the prominent Iraqi statesman and diplomat  Mr. Kittani  for his skilful conduct of the deliberations of the last few sessions of the General Assembly. I should further like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to make the United Nations more efficient in maintaining peace and security.At the thirty-sixth session  during the general debate  we spoke at length about two trends in the world arena. Since then the confrontation of these two trends has acquired a still more acute and tense character.Numerous facts in international affairs clearly testify to a growth in the tendencies of the foreign policy of the imperialist forces  the United States of America in the first place. The imperialists are engaged in all-round psychological and material preparations for war  carrying on the arms race on an unprecedented scale and building up their military strength both qualitatively and quantitatively. Their interference in the affairs of sovereign States is being expanded  special forces are being set up for armed intervention  their military presence in various parts of the world is being increased old bases are being modernized and new ones are being established. One of the negative consequences of that policy is the fact that the non-aligned developing countries are becoming more and more involved in the ruinous arms race  which undermines their struggle to achieve economic independence and social progress. The imperialist policy of the use of force has dragged the whole world closer to the edge of nuclear catastrophe. That is an alarming reality of the present- day situation  which poses a serious threat to the very existence of all countries and peoples  large or small  developed or developing. This threat urgently demands the collective efforts of all peoples of the entire globe to put an end to the arms race  particularly the nuclear one  to prevent the imperialist  adventurist and militarist circles from carrying on their mad drive towards a new war  to improve the international climate  to find solutions to the crucial problems at the negotiation table and to secure peace all over the world. The concern of millions of people over the destiny of mankind was vividly expressed in the statements by most of the delegations during the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament and in the mass manifestations throughout the world.To avert the threat of an outbreak of a thermonuclear war is the main and primary task of the United Nations  which was created for the very purpose of preserving peace and preventing the destruction of man's civilization. In a world where attempts are made in some quarters to convince the public of the admissibility of ""limited"" or ""protracted"" nuclear war  will the Organization be able to prevent the world from slipping into such a war? We hold the strong opinion that it is within our ability to avert the danger of a nuclear holocaust. The policies and the tireless efforts of the peace-loving forces  represented by socialist States and the non-aligned countries  are aimed at that very purpose. It is only natural that we have given our support to all initiatives and proposals for curbing the arms race and  first of all  the prevention of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. We regard the unilateral declaration by the Soviet Union on non-first-use of nuclear weapons as a gigantic step towards reducing the danger of the outbreak of a nuclear confrontation. If complemented by similar declarations by the other nuclear-weapon States  the possibility of such an outbreak would be reduced to naught.We also warmly welcome the two new proposals by the Soviet Union which were advanced in the statement of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Mr. Andrei Gromyko  aimed at warding off the threat of nuclear war and achieving the cessation of the nuclear arms race.We earnestly hope that the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly will give a strong impetus to the negotiations on the most urgent concrete problems—halting the arms race and achieving real disarmament—and thus help to consolidate international detente.Countries in different parts of the world are raising more and more insistently the question of adopting and carrying out regional measures aimed at creating more harmonious relations among the countries of their regions and promoting stability  which in turn would strengthen international peace and security.In this connection I should like to say that the armed incursions with the use of sophisticated weaponry into the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan still continue unabated  which aggravates the situation around Afghanistan.The hypocritical and demagogic approach of the imperialist countries  particularly the United States  the Chinese hegemonists and other reactionary quarters is yet another obstacle to the steady and natural improvement of the situation in the region of South-West Asia. In addition to the previous United States Administration's covert and overt actions  the United States Senate took another provocative decision in recent days on the supply of arms to the bands of terrorists attacking Afghanistan from abroad. This is an of clear and outright interference in the internal affairs of a State Member of the United Nations and is a blatant violation of international law and all norms governing international relations. It is tantamount to instigating terrorism against a small country and exporting terrorism into that country. It must be firmly condemned  and we believe that the international community will take note of it.We emphatically state to the aforementioned quarters and to all others who still cherish the illusion of turning back the wheels of history in Afghanistan that our heroic nation has determined its destiny once and for all and is resolved to construct an independent  democratic and just system. With or without the obstructionist designs adopted by the enemies of our revolution  the glorious march towards those goals will continue unhindered.As for the present-day situation inside my country  the corrective actions and principled line of the Revolutionary Government have yielded the fruits which were expected. A greater degree of stability and normalcy has made possible the speedy recovery of economic and social activities. As a result of the recent call made by Babrak Karmal  large numbers of Afghan nationals who had gone to the neighbouring countries for various reasons have returned to their homes. Had certain quarters not created obstacles  the number of returnees would have been much higher. More and more sectors of the society are how rallying behind their Government and taking an active part in the defence of the revolution and its achievements.The mercenaries and hirelings of imperialism and international reactionary forces are suffering severe blows; most of their hideouts have been wiped out and their arms captured. Needless to say  banditry and terrorism would have long since vanished were they not supported  financed and equipped from external quarters. These interventions and incursions constitute the cause of instability and differences in our region which can and must be tackled by peaceful means  through negotiations. Time has demonstrated the validity of our approach to the problem and has clearly shown that our initiatives put forward on 15 May 1980 and 24 August 1981 are flexible and realistic enough to be a sound basis for a comprehensive settlement of the situation and normalization of relations among neighbouring countries.We shall continuously and sincerely pursue our efforts for the resolution of the situation around Afghanistan. As was stated by Babrak Karmal at the ninth plenum of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan:""We have declared many a time and once again proclaim that it is our desire to make our relations with our eastern and western neighbours  that is  Pakistan and Iran  normal and even friendly on the basis of good will and reason through constructive talks. ... the Geneva talks showed that foundations existed for the achievement of agreements acceptable to both sides on all of the issues concerning an all-sided critical solution and that only good will and understanding were needed to solve the existing differences. We are ready  as far as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is concerned  to meet them half-way in order to improve conditions in the region and to normalize our relations with them.""We express our appreciation to the Secretary- General and his personal representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  for their efforts to bring the parties concerned closer in order to achieve a negotiated settlement  and assure them of our continued co-operation.The question of strengthening security and easing tension in the Indian Ocean has acquired great urgency in the past few years. The right of the nations of that region to peaceful life and their desire to concentrate their efforts on their economic and social development have been jeopardized by the increased military activity of the United States  by its constant blocking of the efforts to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean. We have invariably supported the desire of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean to turn that region into a zone of peace where all foreign military bases would be dismantled and no one would threaten the security  independence and sovereignty of the States in the region. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan resolutely supports the holding of the Conference in Colombo on 9 May 1983 as proposed by non-aligned countries that are members of the /If? Committee on the Indian Ocean We reaffirm our support for the proposal by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  Mr. Ratsiraka  for the convening of a summit conference of hinterland and littoral States of the Indian Ocean region  to be held in Antananarivo.In the context of regional security my delegation speaks out in favour of the initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic on the signing of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in the Asian and Pacific region. The decision and proposals of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the three Indo-Chinese countries held in Ho Chi Minh City on 6 and 7 July 1982 constitutes a concrete and realistic programme for the normalization of the situation in that region of South-east Asia. These steps  if accepted  will undoubtedly contribute to a substantial improvement in the political climate in the region in favour of peace  stability and co-operation between the Indo-Chinese countries and the countries members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations.The recent setting up of the so-called Coalition Government is but a scheme of China in collusion with United States imperialism and other reactionary forces to cover up the abominable face of the genocidal Pol Pot clique and to be used as an instrument against the rebirth of the Kampuchean people and for interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  to create tension and to haltthe tendency towards reconciliation and co-operation in the region.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the reunification of Korea in a peaceful and democratic way as a constructive step towards peace and stability in the region.After over three decades of wars and confrontations the situation in the Middle East has acquired still further explosive dimensions due to the aggressive  expansionist and racist nature of the Zionist entity supported by United States imperialism. During the recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon the world was outraged to witness how far Washington's support of Tel Aviv's aggressive plans spreads and how disproportionately great are the ambitions of the Israeli leaders  who are ready to use every means available to achieve their delirious over-ambitious aims regarding the creation of Greater Israel.The hideous Israeli crimes of genocide and massacre of the Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in west Beirut will forever remain unsurpassed in the history of mankind. But the Israeli aggressors and their American patrons must remember that the popular movement based on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians cannot be suppressed by brute force. The Palestinian people will never be crushed by an aggressor. Their just cause will eventually triumph. It is evident that the aggressor would not be able to behave so brazenly if its partner in strategic co-operation were not the biggest imperialist Power. That is why the United States shares responsibility for the horrendous crimes that have been and are being committed in Lebanon.Israel's designs to win an easy victory by forcing the Palestinians to surrender proved to be miscalculations. The aggressors met with valiant resistance from the Palestinians  the patriotic Lebanese forces and the Syrian armed forces  whose courage has won them admiration.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  as a staunch supporter of the Palestinian and Arab cause  once again expresses its all-round solidarity with our Palestinian brothers in their heroic struggle. We demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territories and restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their national State in Palestine.Afghanistan believes that it is now imperative to start a collective search for an all-embracing  just and realistic settlement in the Middle East within the framework of a specially convened international conference as set out in the Brezhnev six-point plan. We have also noted with interest the relevant outcome of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez.At its thirty-seventh session the General Assembly is expected to bring pressure to bear on the Zionists and their imperialist supporters  particularly United States imperialism  with a view to ensuring full compliance with the repeated calls of the international community.Since the beginning of the unfortunate armed conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the continuation of which will seriously affect not only those two neighbouring Islamic countries but the entire region  we have sincerely hoped that the Governments of Iran and Iraq will desist from actions that may cause the situation to worsen still further and that they will find peaceful ways and means of resolving their disputes.We express our appreciation for the work done by the Secretary-General and his mission in this regard. We urge him to continue his efforts aimed at finding a just and peaceful solution to this tragic conflict.As in the past  Afghanistan expresses its full support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus.We stand side by side with our African brothers in their struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo colonialism and	for independence  social justice and development.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan strongly supports the people of Namibia  which  under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  SWAPO  are struggling against the apartheid regime's occupation We reaffirm our solidarity with the heroic peoples of South Africa in their struggle to free themselves from the abhorrent system of apartheid. We resolutely condemn the South African racist regime's continued aggression against Angola and other front-line States and its attempts to topple the Governments of some independent African countries  particularly that of Seychelles.In our view the Assembly should take action to increase assistance to the national liberation movements with a view to accelerating exercise of the right of self-determination and the independence of peoples still under alien and colonial domination.It is in this context that we express support for the struggle of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic for full sovereignty over its territory.We are in solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico trying to exercise their right to self-determination and full independence.My delegation reaffirms the fU.t support of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for Mauritius's sovereignty over Diego Garcia Island.We also strongly demand the return of the Malagasy Islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar.It is our belief that the Malvinas Islands are an integral part of the Argentine Republic.The situation in Central and Latin America and in the Caribbean has been further aggravated as a result of the interventionist  aggressive policies of the United States.While strongly condemning the sinister plots of the United States Administration in the region  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan expresses full solidarity with the revolutionary peoples of Cuba  Nicaragua  Grenada  El Salvador and other peoples of Latin America in their struggle against United States imperialism.The present state of the international economic situation constitutes a source of deep concern for the developing countries. The reluctance of certain capitalist countries regarding the launching of a genuine dialogue with the developing countries within the framework of the United Nations has so far prevented the achievement of agreements on structural changes in the mechanism of international economic relations. The prevailing uncertainty about the world economy clearly shows the essential need for a new and just international economic order that would benefit all. Therefore no effort should be spared within the framework of the United Nations and within the regional organizations to overcome the disparities of the present situation. That situation  coupled with the economic policies adopted by many Western countries  places serious constraint for the developing countries  attempts to attain the growth rates established in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. This adverse impact has been particularly grave for the least developed landlocked countries. Their growth rate has been retarded  and they have witnessed an actual decline in their per capita gross domestic product in recent years. While in 1970 the average per capita gross national product of the least developed countries was 36.3 per cent of that of all developing countries  it declined further  at the end of 1979  to 29.1 per cent.Compared with the average annual growth of 3.1 per cent in the gross domestic product of all developing countries in past decade  the achievement of the least developer countries was even less than one per cent during the same period. We thus emphasize the need for special measures  large-scale assistance and continued support by the international community for the development of the least developed countries and we stress the need for full and timely implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted in Paris.The distinctive and disadvantageous position of land-locked countries and their need for adequatetransport and transit facilities in the promotion of their trade and economic development has been recognized by various United Nations agencies and international conferences  and numerous resolutions have been adopted specifically to overcome those problems. However  it is regrettable that effective and full implementation of those decisions  including the establishment of a Special Fund for Land-locked Developing Countries  has not materialized.We stress the importance of economic cooperation among developing countries as a means of promoting the rational and efficient use of human  material and financial resources available for the progress of developing countries. I should also like to stress that the international community should generate the necessary pressure to put an end to the arms race  in order to release the enormous resources badly needed for development programmes for the developing countries. Realistically  it would be impossible to analyse in one statement all the economic  social  political and security problems facing our world. It is even less possible to suggest the solutions required for those problems. Nevertheless  due attention must be paid to those which are outstanding and remain global in character.To underline the approach taken by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to those problems  allow me to quote briefly from a statement by Babrak Karmal:""The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  in full harmony with its decisive revolutionary domestic policy  follows a principled  peaceful path in its relations with all countries of the world. Afghanistan is and will remain a non- aligned nation. We will profoundly and actively support the principles of positive and active non- alignment  peaceful coexistence  the policy of detente and general disarmament. And we will fight against warmongers  against old and neocolonialism  against imperialism and Zionism  against fascism and racism  against racial discrimination and together with the peace-loving forces in a vast global front."""
"2",51,"AGO",37,1982,"It is a great pleasure to begin by extending to the President on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola  our most heartfelt congratulations on his election at this thirty-seventh session of the general  Assembly. Allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to express our great satisfaction at seeing preside over this august Assembly  a distinguished representative of a socialist country  the People's Republic of Hungary  with which we maintain excellent relations of friendship  solidarity and co-operation. We wish him every success in the exercise of his lofty responsibilities. May I also reaffirm to Mr. Kittani  our deep appreciation for the dignified and clear-sighted manner in which he acquitted himself of his mandate during the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. May I further reiterate to the Secretary-General our most sincere appreciation for his tireless efforts in seeking the most appropriate solutions to the grave problems which the international community faces.184.	The thirty-seventh session is being held at a very critical time  since the international situation has deteriorated seriously to the point of gravely threatening the survival of a certain number of peoples.185.	Every year we all come to participate in the annual session of the general Assembly; a torrent of speeches is heard  support for the noble principles of freedom  peace  justice  democracy  solidarity  development and co-operation is reaffirmed by every one of us  but  unfortunately  the application of these ideas stops for some among us as soon as we leave the United Nations Headquarters.186.	Repeatedly  and from this very rostrum  we have expressed our profound concern because of the progressive deterioration in the international situation and because of its disastrous consequences for all of mankind. We cannot  nor should we conceal our great anguish at seeing the impotence  the resignation or the abdication of the competent international bodies when faced with the proliferation of hotbeds of tension  which are deliberately and dangerously kindled by imperialist Powers  and in particular by the present United States Administration.187.	No one here should ignore the causes and agents which are responsible for so sombre a picture. We wonder how long peoples and Governments which love peace and justice will have to wait for the adequate existing United Nations organs firmly to shoulder their responsibilities and take really effective measures -which are available to them-with respect to the Governments of certain Western Powers  in order to put an end to: the flagrant violations of the fundamental principles of the Charter; continuance of colonial wars  and the promoting of aggressions of every kind  directly or indirectly against States which adopt independent and progressive positions; the economic plundering of underdeveloped countries and the persistent prevention of a gradual reduction in the ever-widening gap between the rich developed countries  and the poor underdeveloped countries; the imposition of military bases in every comer of the world  generally maintained against the will of the peoples; the insistence on hampering the serious efforts made by the socialist countries and progressive and democratic forces to achieve detente  general  and complete disarmament  the global prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear  biological and chemical weapons  including the neutron bomb; the accelerated rise of military budgets and expenditures stimulated by an escalation in the arms race  so that these astronomical amounts of money might be judiciously devoted to the economic and social development of the underdeveloped countries; and the systematic manoeuvres designed to counter the establishment of a new international economic order  as advocated by the movement of non-aligned countries.188.	Faced with this alarming situation  which obviously endangers the future of peoples  and faced with the growing tragedy endured by millions of human beings  who are still deprived of their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny  lacking in the ways and means to fight against servitude  humiliation  tyranny  wretchedness  famine  ignorance and disease  we feel compelled to repeat  who bears the grave responsibility  in the first place  for such a deterioration in the international situation? As we see it  it is the present United States Administration  and certain of its allies and agents  or preferred instruments which  bear this responsibility: the racist and Fascist regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv.189.	We see it this way because of the firm conviction of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola that no country that was socialist  progressive or loved peace and justice has taken or will take initiatives to promote hotbeds of tension  to unleash a nuclear war or use other weapons of mass destruction  because the survival of mankind  international peace and security  the independence of peoples and peaceful coexistence are for them a primary principle and objective.190.	World problems which seriously affect peace  security  development  freedom and independence require considerable efforts from the international community as a whole and a global response that has due regard forth fact that each people has the right freely to choose its own political  economic  social and cultural system  without intimidation or pressures; that it is the right of every people to be in charge of its own national riches and to exploit them for its own benefit; that it is the right of every people to reject any form of subordination to and dependence on any source  and any interference or pressure  political  economic or military.191.	There is no denying that in the present situation detente  general and complete disarmament  the nuclear threat and the arms race are the major concerns of countries that love peace and justice. In this respect  may we recall that the position of Angola has been clearly defined once again during the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  so we need not repeat it here.192.	Since the People's Republic of Angola is a geopolitical component of the African continent  it is legitimate for the Government of Angola to give primary attention to African problems  in particular to those of southern Africa  in view of the grave implications for the region and for the world.193.	For some 20 years many relevant resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations  the OAU and the non-aligned movement  recognizing  on the one hand  the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence and  on the other hand  denouncing or firmly condemning the illegal occupation of Namibia by the criminal South African regime.194.	Directly confronted with threats  aggression and armed invasion by the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime since 1975  the People's Republic of Angola expects from the international community a decisive commitment in line with the requirements of our time   so that the problem of Namibia may be finally settled and so that the people of Angola may  for its part  be able to expel the racist invaders  to respond to future aggression and to ensure the defence of its national Sovereignty and territorial integrity.195.	What is the situation today? As we nil know  the contact group submitted to SWAPO  the frontline States and to Nigeria in October 1981 a plan of action that includes three phases; first  the adoptionby the end of January of 1982 of the so-called constitutional principles by the concerned and interested parties  principles which are to be included in the future  constitution  of Namibia; secondly  approval by the end of March by the Security Council of the composition and size of the United Nations troop contingent  and resolution of the question of the United. Nations  impartiality raised by the Pretoria regime; thirdly  implementation  starting in April  of the United Nations plan in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  containing four fundamental aspects: a cease-fire; the gradual reduction of South African troops to 1 500 men; stationing of United Nations troops in Namibia; and free and fair elections.196.	Since the first meetings with the contact group -and quite outside its framework and mission-the United States delegation has asked for bilateral contacts with the Angolan authorities and has begun to try to link the presence of the Cuban internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola to the negotiating process for the independence of Namibia. This has always been firmly rejected by the Government of Angola  in view of the absurdity of such a linkage which  in fact  ill conceals the obsession or paranoia of the United States Administration about the stationing of the Cuban internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola.197.	In view of the deadlock in the negotiations on the first phase  because of the electoral system proposed by the contact group  and since the presence of Cuban forces in the People's Republic of Angola has become the subject of a slanderous and hostile campaign by the United States Administration which is shamelessly seeking at all costs to link that presence to the process of the independence of Namibia-directly  or through the racist South African regime  which has become its sounding board-as an additional means of preventing the implementation of the resolutions which the United Nations has already adopted  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Angola and of the Republic of Cuba  on behalf of their respective Governments  prepared and signed a joint declaration on 4 February 1982  with which all the Members of this international body are fully familiar.198.	It is therefore fitting to recall that  at the end of the month of August 1981  at a lunch offered to the foreign press accredited in South Africa  and at the very moment when a large-scale aggression was being perpetrated against the People's Republic of Angola  the South African Prime Minister declared that the Cubans represent no threat to South Africa and that South Africa does not regard the withdrawal of the Cubans from Angola as a prior condition to the peaceful solution of the Namibian question.199.	Nevertheless  it is surprising but significant that a certain number of those who express their concern about the presence of the Cuban internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola show no such concern in respect of the illegal occupation for more than a year of a part of the territory of Angola by the racist and Fascist South African troops. What moral can be drawn from that?200.	And yet  in the course of these last nine months  the South African army has carried out 580 reconnaissance flights  18 air bombardments  96 landings of troops from helicopters and several sabotage and reprisal actions against the civilian population. The Angolan armed forces have suffered 31 dead  65 wounded and 38 missing  while the enemy forces have suffered 39 dead. Seven South African aircraft and three helicopters have been shot down.201.	Thus we believe that the following positions of principle must be borne in mind.202.	First  the joint Angolan-Cuban declaration states solemnly and unambiguously that the intention is gradually to withdraw the Cuban internationalist forces stationed on Angolan territory.203.	Secondly  on 23 April 1976  a month after expelling the South African troops  the Angolan and Cuban Governments agreed on a programme progressively to reduce those forces and  in less than a year  the Cuban military contingent was reduced by more than one third. Towards the middle of 1979 the two Governments once again decided to implement another programme for the gradual reduction of the Cuban forces. Nevertheless  those two programmes had to be suspended at a certain point because of the growing number and scope of South African armed aggression against the provinces of Cunene and Huila. It should be emphasized that the Angolan and Cuban Governments spontaneously took the initiative to implement those programmes. Ho Government -including that of the United States of America- and no international organization dared to propose or demand that we do so. How is one then to understand the sickly insistence of the United States Administration on this subject and its inability to realize that such an attitude is a gross and inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign country?204.	Thirdly  in that same joint declaration we stated that when the Governments of Angola and Cuba so decide  the withdrawal of Cuban forces stationed on Angolan territory will be carried out by a sovereign decision of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola when there is no further possibility of aggression or armed invasion and  in that connection  the Government of Cuba reiterated that it will unreservedly respect any decision taken by the sovereign Government of the People's Republic of Angola concerning the withdrawal of those forces. Once again we solemnly reaffirm before the Assembly what our intentions are.205.	Furthermore  in the course of these last three months  American representatives in the contact group have been making a very special effort to spread optimism about the results already achieved in the negotiations that have been going on in New York since the month of June. In fact that is a false and ill-intentioned optimism. It is false  because the electoral system has not yet been defined  the  final composition of the United Nations forces has not yet been decided  and the cease-fire between SWAPO and the Pretoria regime  which will constitute the essential point of departure for the implementation of the United Nations plan  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  seem to us to be far from being anticipatedor applied. It is ill-intentioned in that the American Administration has started a manoeuvre to attribute to the People's Republic of Angola responsibility for the delay of  or even for preventing  a swift and adequate solution of the process of independence for Namibia owing to the position of the Government of Angola regarding linkage and the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces. In point of fact  this manoeuvre constitutes an escape hatch for those who are or will be the ones really responsible for such a situation.206.	Thus  since the position of the Government of Angola is a legitimate one the heads of State and Government of the front-line States meeting at Lusaka on 4 September 1982:  ... noted with indignation that a new element has been introduced by the United States of America in seeking to link the negotiations for the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angora. In this respect  the Summit emphasized without any ambiguity the importance of separating the decolonization process of Namibia from the stationing of Cuban forces in Angola. The insistence on maintaining this linkage is contrary to the spirit and the letter of [Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) and can only hamper the negotiating process. Furthermore  this insistence constitutes interference in Angola's internal affairs. In this context  they expressed their complete support for the Angolan position on the question  which is clearly defined in the joint declaration of the Governments of the People's Republic of Angola and of the Republic of Cuba  of 4 February 1982. Accordingly  they rejected any attempt to make the People's Republic of Angola responsible for any delay in the prompt conclusion of the negotiations on the independence of Namibia. They strongly condemned the aggression and invasion of Angola by South African forces and demanded that the Pretoria regime cease all acts of aggression and withdraw its troops from Angola.207.	A similar position was taken during the Third Conference of Heads of State of the People's Republic of Angola  the Republic of Cape Verde  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  which was held in the capital of Cape Verde on 21 and 22 September 1982.208.	May I be allowed to remind the Assembly of the enormous sacrifices which the heroic people of Angola has already made and the extremely high price it is paying in thousands of lost human lives and material damage amounting to more than $7.5 billion.209.	I should like once again to remind the Assembly of the proposal made at the thirty-first session by the Angolan Government for consideration by the general  Assembly  that an international fund for the national reconstruction of Angola be established  amounting to approximately $300 million. It is sad to note that so just a proposal has not received the least attention from this world body  despite the fact that in its resolution 475 (1980) the Security Council requested  Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People'sRepublic of Angola and the other front-line States   and called for 'the payment by South Africa of full and adequate compensation to the People's Republic of Angola for the damage to life ard property resulting from these acts of aggression.  May we renew our hopes that this bitter cry will be heard?210. Everyone knows that in South Africa the internal situation is progressively deteriorating as the conflicts within the hideous regime and the ruling party grow worse  and the valiant fighters of the African National Congress [ANC] steadfastly and heroically carry out political and military; their efforts are recognized even by the Pretoria regime  and this has led to an escalation of threats and aggression  as well as an increasing use of mercenary forces and bandit groups-trained  financed  organized and commanded by South Africa-against the People's Republic of Mozambique. It has also led to acts of aggression perpetrated against the Republics of Zimbabwe and Zambia 2nd the Kingdom of Lesotho. All States Members of the United Nations should firmly condemn these actions and should stand in active solidarity with the ANC and the front-line States.21L With regard to Western Sahara  we reiterate our unflinching solidarity with the heroic Sahraoui people  which  under the leadership of its sole authentic representative  the POLISARIO Front  is victoriously pursuing its armed struggle against Moroccan occupation to recover full independence and territorial integrity. We welcome the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the OAU  and we reiterate our conviction that there trust be direct negotiations between the two conflicting parties in the search for a political solution.212.	With regard to the temporary difficulties now being experienced by the OAU  we consider that any problems that might affect us should be discussed by us alone  within our continental organization  and without any interference from outside Africa  as has been noted. The fact that the thirty-eighth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU  held at Addis Ababa in February 1982  and the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at Tripoli  held in August 1982  were obstructed is a part of the strategy of American imperialism and some of its allies aimed at subjugating or paralysing international bodies which play an active role in the struggle for the political and economic independence of peoples. We are absolutely convinced that this momentary crisis will soon be overcome.213.	We are deeply moved by the bloody events in Lebanon. The brutal armed invasion carried out by the racist and fascist Tel Aviv regime  with the full and shameful connivance of the United States Administration and the inadmissible passivity of certain Arab States; the genocide of Palestinians and Lebanese in west Beirut; and the massacre  the carnage  at Sabra and Shatila: these can never be forgotten  and call for our strongest condemnation and an appropriate response in due course.214.	We are firmly convinced that the Palestinian people and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  will resume the fight after having  by their heroic resistance during the fierce battles of those 73 historic days  won the respect andadmiration of all those who stand with the peoples struggling for their independence. We reaffirm our unswerving solidarity with the Palestinian people and the PLO as they carry on their struggle to recover their usurped homeland and to establish an independent State there.215.	After seven years of Indonesian military occupation  the people of East Timor  under the leadership of its vanguard organization and legitimate representative  the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente  continues its heroic resistance  in spite of the lack of solidarity on the part of some countries of the non-aligned movement. Those countries should identify themselves with the struggle of the people of East Timor  out of respect for the fundamental principles of non-alignment.216.	The inability of the Indonesian army to stamp out the armed liberation struggle of the people of East Timor clearly shows that people's rejection of integrate into or annexation by Indonesia of its homeland. The 35 000 Indonesian soldiers present there  recourse to helicopter-borne forces to try to destroy the fighting forces of FRETILIN  which control 70 per cent of the national territory  the terror and famine imposed on the people of East Timor -will all fail to thwart the nationalist feelings of that people or its resolve to fight. Yet more than 200 000 persons have been massacred by the troops of a self-styled non-aligned country which never fought against the former administering Power  Portugal  during the colonial period.217.	The Indonesian troops  and thus the Indonesian Government  are today carrying out an appalling genocide  through physical liquidation  cultural repression  deportation  and repopulation with thousands of Javanese citizens. But there are the beginnings of resistance in the Indonesian army against participating in operations aimed at eliminating the patriots of East Timor. This is proved by the recent refusal to act of two battalions  which are today isolated on one of the islands of the country.218.	It only needed Portugal to shirk its responsibilities towards the people of East Timor by not proceeding to the transfer of power to the FRETILIN leaders for Indonesia to invade and militarily occupy part of East Timor and the outskirts of the capital  where its military contingents had established themselves.219.	Ever since the thirtieth session of the general Assembly the Organization has been expressing deep concern over the situation obtaining in East Timor as a result of the intervention of Indonesian armed forces and has been requesting the Indonesian Government to withdraw without delay its forces from the Territory in order to enable the people of East Timor freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence  as provided in general Assembly resolution 3485 (XXX). Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and 389 (1976) once again call on the Indonesian Government to withdraw its forces from the Territory forthwith. Resolution 36/50  adopted at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly  reaffirms the same principles and makes the same requests. The Indonesian Government  however  shows no sign of willingness to respect United Nations decisions. It is therefore imperative that States Members of the United Nations  in particular those which are members of the non-aligned movement  do not endorse the brutal annexation of East Timor to Indonesia  a country which does not even respect our resolutions.220.	Bearing in mind that the Government of Portugal seems to wish to resume its responsibilities as the former administering Power in order to bring the tragedy of the people of East Timor to the attention of the international community  we wish to express encouragement for the request of the Government of Portugal aimed at satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.221.	With regard to developments in the situation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  in the People's Republic of Kampuchea  in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and in the Republic of Cyprus  we reaffirm our active solidarity with those peoples in their respective causes and our support for the positions of their Governments in the quest for just and appropriate solutions.222.	With regard to Latin America  we reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Salvadorian people and with its legitimate representatives  the Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in their just struggles against the present regime in El Salvador  and we heartily welcome the victories they have already won.223.	We wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the Cuban people in their revolution. We support their efforts to overcome the consequences of the criminal economic boycott imposed by American imperialism  in flagrant violation of human rights  and we denounce the aggression and the threats against the Cuban people. We welcome also the revolutionary process of the peoples of Nicaragua and Grenada and their determination to face the serious threats that hang over them. We also reaffirm our active solidarity with the Puerto Rican people and denounce the imperialist manoeuvres which  by means of despicable political and economic pressures  have prevented the inclusion of the question of Puerto Rico in the agenda.224.	No one is unaware of the fact that the Security Council and General Assembly as well as the OAU have already adopted several resolutions on mercenarism  condemning the activities of mercenaries  their recruitment and their use for the purpose of destabilizing actions in underdeveloped countries  particularly on the African continent. While it is true that a Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa has already been adopted by the OAU-and the People's Republic of Angola  which has suffered and continues to suffer the misdeeds of mercenaries  is proud of the important contribution it made to that Convention-it is imperative  none the less  for the General Assembly to adopt as soon as possible an international convention prohibiting the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries and the provision of transit facilities to them. Indeed  we hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries  established under general  Assembly resolution 35/48  will fulfil its mandate and that such a convention with finally be adopted.225.	Next month the Angolan people will celebrate the seventh anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola  under the dynamic and visionary leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo dos Santos  President of the MPLA-Labour Party and President of the Republic. Important results have already been achieved in consolidating the Angolan revolutionary process  in setting up the structures of the party  in strengthening national unity and defence and in laying the foundations for a socialist society in the People's Republic of Angola.226.	Unfortunately  however  the Angolan Government has had to devote most of its human and material resources to the defence of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity  because of the continuous acts of aggression by the racist and Fascist regime of Pretoria. This has seriously affected the economic and social development we had planned  but if we are to attain that paramount goal the undeclared war against us must be brought to an end. We need peace  and we dare to hope that that peace so fervently desired by the Angolan people will be attained in the coming year.227.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
"3",98,"ALB",37,1982,"First of all I should like to convey to you  Sir  the congratulations of the delegation of Albania on your election to the office of President of the Assembly. It is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to greet the Secretary-General and to wish him every success in the accomplishment of his important tasks.103.	An objective analysis of the world events that have taken place since the last session of the General Assembly shows that the present international situation is very tense and fraught with dangers for the peoples' freedom and world peace. The aggravation of this situation and the grave economic  political and social crisis which has the capitalist and revisionist world in its grip have increased the danger of war.104.	This situation is a direct result of the expansionist and neo-colonialist policies pursued by the imperialist Powers  and above all by the two super powers. At present there is no area in the world that is not affected by or subject to their predatory ambitions. Both super-Powers obstinately continue their expansionist policy of establishing world domination  which is seen also in their unceasing race to achieve political and military superiority the one over the other  to attain new strategic positions  and so on. It is this aggressive policy and the rivalry between the two super-Powers that further complicate the various situations and make them more tense and fraught with dangerous consequences.105.	The efforts of the United States imperialists to impose their will on various countries impose their expression in United States persistence in an ever more aggressive foreign policy which relies increasingly on military force. The same intensification of aggressiveness is also seen in the foreign policy of the Soviet social-imperialists. At the present time all- round militarization of the country's life and the exercise of pressures and military force against other countries characterize that policy.106.	United States interference in Iran and the stationing of its aggressive military forces in the Middle East  the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union  the incitement of conflicts on the African continent  intervention in Latin America and Southeast Asia along with the political  economic and military threats and blackmail in regard to many countries by the two super-Powers  all go to show that they are pursuing a policy of oppression and aggression. There is no area in international relations where one does not encounter their policy from a position of force; there is no armed conflict or hotbed of tension that  directly or indirectly  the super powers do not have a hand in. More than ever before  they are arming their war machines by adding to their arsenals of new  sophisticated weapons. The propaganda clamor about disarmament by the superpowers is nothing but a maneuver to cover up their frenzied arms race. And at the same time as they are arming themselves  they are engaging in an arms traffic which has become a business of immense scope  from which they reap fabulous profits and which increases the political and economic dependence on them of various countries.107.	In order to conceal their true aims and to deceive the peoples  the super-Powers make a big demagogic fuss so as to present their actions as being in favor of safeguarding peace. To that end  they have set up a number of commissions and machinery dealing with various problems: from the strategic arms limitation talks to European security  from the reduction of troops in Europe to the demilitarization of outer space. All this aims to create the false impression that something is being done  that the key to peace lies in their agreements and their initiatives. AH this demagogy also has the aim of imposing on the peoples the idea that they should not take any action but should inevitably yield to the big Powers.108.	The situation continues to be very serious on the European continent. The events which have occurred in and around Europe clearly indicate that the political and military blocs headed by the United States and the Soviet Union  their policy of an ""atomic umbrella"" and of spheres of influence  constitute the source of discord  tension and confrontation between various countries.109.	The statements that the signing of the Helsinki Final Act would eliminate political  ideological and military tension and that the Madrid meetings on European security would strengthen peace in Europe have showed themselves to be a bluff. The insecurity of Europe has grown even greater.110.	The two super-Powers with their rival aggressive blocsóNATO and the Warsaw Pactóhave strengthened their military power with the most modem weapons  accumulating an unprecedented war arsenal. They are filling Europe with missiles and nuclear weapons so as to use them as a means of threat  and blackmail against the countries where they are stationed and against other European countries. Military maneuvers of an aggressive character have grown in intensity and have assumed greater proportions. The presence in the Mediterranean of big naval fleets belonging to the super-Powers has turned that basin into a militarized sea; that presence constitutes a serious threat to the freedom and independence of the coastal countries of that basin as well as to peace in Europe and in the world.111.	The Albanian delegation believes that real security and co-operation in Europe can be attained only by the European countries strengthening their independence and sovereignty  by opposing the policy of both super-Powers  by liquidating bases and blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact and by driving foreign military forces  together with their missiles and Other nuclear weapons  out of their countries. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania will never allow the stationing of foreign military bases and forces on its territory. It has declared that fact publicly and has endorsed it in its Constitution.112.	The situation in Europe is also reflected in the Balkan region. The two imperialist super-Powers have not renounced their goals and are aiming at turning the region into a permanent powder keg. They strive to prevent the normal development of relations between the Balkan peoples and countries  to revive did hostilities and quarrels  to encourage and mcite chauvinist sentiments and passions and to imbue then  With a sense of confrontation. Such attempts are fraught with danger for the peoples of this area and run counter to their sincere desire for the establishment of mutual confidence  understanding and genuine co-operation.113.	In its relations with neighbouring countries  the people's Socialist Republic of Albania has  since its very inception  always been guided by a policy of good neighborliness. Its desire and aim have always been that the Balkan countries might live in peace and friendship without interference in each other's internal affairs  implementing the fundamental principles of mutual co-operation and respect. We are convinced that this is the correct way to forge fruitful and lasting relations which serve the cause of peace and security in the Balkans. The leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha  has said:""The People's Socialist Republic of Albania believes that at present the genuine aspirations of the Balkan peoples and peace and stability in this region can best be served by preventing the imperialist super-Powers from interfering in the internal affairs of the countries of our region and by taking concrete and constructive steps with a view to the positive development of relations on the basis of the policy of good neighborliness. The situation in the Balkans would be greatly improved if the Balkan countries were to undertake officially not to allow the super-Powers to use their territory in order to threaten or endanger neighbouring countries. In the future  as in the past  socialist Albania will consistently adhere to this policy and will make every effort to ensure that mutual respect and genuine understanding prevail in its relations with neighbouring States.""114.	In the Middle East  the situation has deteriorated further. Fifteen years after their aggression  the Israeli Zionists continue to hold the occupied Arab territories. In an arrogant and unrestrained manner  and under the protection of the United States  they have undertaken new invasions. The crimes and massacres committed by Israel against the civilian Palestinian population  which surpass even those committed by the Hitlerites  have aroused the indignation and profound hatred of the peoples of the world. The events which have occurred in the area this year are a consequence of the situation imposed by the super-Powers. They show how the peoples pay with blood and extraordinary sacrifices for the intrigues and plots hatched behind their backs.115.	The peoples of the world  and above all the Palestinian people  see clearly that this barbarous Aggression constitutes one of the most flagrant expressions of the agreements and intrigues concocted between the United States and the Soviet Union fbr concessions and mutual recognition of the aggressions they have committed or are about to commit. It is also the expression of the bargains they have struck with each other against Iran  Afghanistan  the countries of the Persian Gulf  the Midtue East and other States in various regions of the world.116.	Washington's emissaries offer various plans for the alleged settlement of the Middle East problem  but in the final analysis; all of them boil down to the Camp David agreement and aim at liquidating the Palestinian question  denying the Arab peopled their rights and annexing the territories occupied by Israel under the false pretext of guaranteeing ""secure boundaries""117.	The Americans and the Soviets  through their imperialist policies  are responsible for the shedding of the blood of the peoples and are the main culprits. We note with indignation that Governments which could have acted to stop the hands of the murderers did not even raise a finger to avert the Israeli onslaught against Lebanon And the Palestinians  to stop the barbarous massacres and genocide committed against the martyred Palestinian people.118.	I could speak here in diplomatic terms  but that would be of no value. I am going to speak in a different fashion  openly; I shall say what our people think. If the aggressive thrust of the United States imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists is not stopped  the world will find itself on the verge of a third world war. But that cannot be stopped by words and protests. I would recall that the Security Council resolutions and its protests on the most burning issues have yielded no result. The Israeli war and the genocide against the Arabs  and against the Palestinians in particular  continues  as does the aggression and oppression against Afghanistan  and the list is longer.119.	The situation in the Middle East is fraught with the danger of an imperialist war and of bloodshed and oppression for the Arab peoples. In our view it should be clear to anybody that it is the United States imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists that puM the strings in all the plots against the freedom and independence of peoples; it is they that shamelessly divide the zones of influence between them and play with the fate of peoples: it is they that incite hostility among the peoples and organize the networks of agents and putsches to pave the way for their expansionist and hegemonist ambitions that situation is intolerable fbr the people and we therefore believe that it should be resolutely opposed and exposed.120.	The difficulties that may be created for the brave Palestinian people will never put an end to their just struggle. Recent developments in that region have shown the Arab peoples that the great mission of their national liberation and the defense of their freedom and independence can be carried out only by them. The unity of the Arab peoples against Zionism and the plots of the super-Powers is a basic factor in their struggle in their just cause.121.	The Albanian people and Government strongly condemn Israel's barbarous aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples  its monstrous crimes and the genocide it has committed. In the future too we shall fully support th5e just struggle of the Palestinian people to have  like any other people  their own homeland and State  and the efforts of the Syrian people and other fraternal Arab peoples to drive the Israeli aggressors out of the occupied Arab lands. Lebanon must be an independent and sovereign country and the aggressive Israeli troops must withdraw immediately.122.	Our country  Albania  has taken all the necessary measures and is ready to defend itself and overcome any aggression by its enemies. But  being a small country  we are not able to render material aid to oppressed peoples fighting imperialist domination. What we can do is unmask the aggressive policy of United States imperialism and of Soviet social- imperialism and the policy of subjugation. This we are doing and shall continue to do  come what may.123.	The situation in the Gulf area  where  since the victory of the Iranian revolution  the great Powers have intensified their policy of plots and blackmail  remains serious. In spite of the shameful defeat which the United States imperialists suffered in Iran  they never give up their efforts to regain their lost privileges and positions  while the Soviet social-imperialists are trying to exploit the situation in their own interests. The courageous Iranian people have successfully overcome the numerous difficulties created for them after the victory of the anti-imperialist revolution  and are safeguarding the freedom and independence of their homeland.124.	The Albanian Government holds that it is in the interest of Iraq and Iran to end their conflict and settle their disputes through negotiation so that the two peoples may live in peace and friendship. This would also be in the interests of the people of the region and their welfare and progress; and it would be a blow against the policy of the super-Powers  the aim of which is to see various countries pitted against each other.125.	We support the courageous Afghan people who for three years now have been continuing the fearless struggle against the Soviet occupation forces to regain their national independence.126.	Only a few months ago in the Malvinas Islands the British imperialists  with the support of the United States  put into effect their gunboat policy. Once again the Latin American peoples saw the true face of United States imperialism and understood the value of the treaties and agreements concluded with that country. Notwithstanding the manner in which the events unfolded  no one can deny Argentina its right to exercise sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. The sovereign rights of nations and peoples cannot be violated or proscribed either by force of arms or by treaties and agreements concluded to the detriment of peoples.127.	The countries of South-East Asia  which for decades have suffered from cruel colonial oppression and exploitation and have been subjected to imperialist aggression  are still under the political and military threat of the United States  the Soviet Union and China  which are doing their utmost to pit them one against the other  to pave the way for their interventions and to safeguard their hegemonistic positions. As in the past  Albania supports the right of the peoples of those countries to settle their internal problems themselves and to decide their own future without foreign interference. No one has the right to infringe their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  no matter what the pretext. The countries of that region have the right to be fully independent  free and sovereign under the tutelage of none.128.	The situation in the Korean peninsula continues to be tense because of the presence of the United States occupation forces in South Korea. The Albanian people and Government support the just struggle of the Korean people to drive United States troops out of South Korea and for the independent reunification of their homeland.129.	The African countries and peoples which have just freed themselves from savage colonial oppression and exploitation have intensified their efforts and their struggle in defense of their sovereign rights against all-out imperialist and neo-colonialist interference. They are constantly faced with the policies of the super-Powers  which keep alive conflicts and hotbeds of tension and encourage African countries to fight against each other  in order to pave the way for their further penetration into Africa  expand their zones of influence and plunder the vast natural resources of that continent. This policy and activity encourage the racists of South Africa to continue the occupation of Namibia and the oppression of its people. The barbarous oppression  ruthless racial discrimination and odious apartheid policy carried out by the Fascist Pretoria regime against the indigenous population  together with its serious acts of aimed provocation against neighbouring countries  constitute a permanent threat to the African peoples. The Albanian people is in complete solidarity with the peoples of Azania and Namibia and other African peoples and resolutely supports their just struggle for liberation  to uproot colonialism and neo-colonialism and to foil the intrigues and prevent the interference of the imperialist Powers.130.	A significant factor which cannot but have a negative effect on the present world situation is the general crisis gripping the capitalist-revisionist world. It has exacerbated the inter-imperialist contradictions and the economic  political and military rivalries. It has led to economic stagnation  a continuous fall in production  inflation and price rises  unemployment and the constant deterioration of the well-being of the working masses. Many countries have witnessed the growth of terrorism  anarchy and political and moral corruption. Social relations and inter-State relations have deteriorated. The crisis has made domestic and international tensions more acute both in the West and in the East. Typical of this is the critical situation in Poland  where the people are suffering the consequences of the capitulationist and opportunistic line dictated by Moscow. We support the resolute opposition of the peoples to oppression  plunder and financial manipulations flowing from the imperialist Powers' policy aimed at increasingly shifting the burden of the consequences of the grave economic crisis on to the backs of the working masses.131.	Today the peoples' struggle throughout the world against the policy of aggression and oppression as practised by the imperialist Powers  primarily the two super-Powers  is gaining in strength and scope. In Asia  Africa  Central and South America and elsewhere the peoples are struggling for national liberation  their independence and sovereign rights and their economic and social emancipation. Their struggle has gained irresistible momentum  thus becoming a significant factor in the process of world development  and winning the support of progressive mankind.132.	Albania resolutely supports the struggle of democratic States and peoples in defense of their national sovereignty and their legitimate rights and interests. It supports efforts to establish just international economic relations and to combat colonial exploitation. The gap between industrialized and developing countries is becoming ever wider. This is the direct result of the intensive exploitation which exists in various forms. Colossal profits are reaped by the capitalist monopolies from the toil and blood of the peoples of developing countries  burdensome credits and the imposition of very low prices for raw materials as compared with those of manufactured goods. The tactics of the imperialist Powers concerning the so-called North-South dialogue are nothing but efforts to perpetuate the old unjust economic relations and further to intensify exploitation. Countries and peoples have every right to exercise sovereignty over their national assets and to use them for the benefit of their national development and progress.133.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania follows a consistent and independent foreign policy based on principleóa policy of friendship and sincere co-operation with all peoples and countries that love freedom and peace. That foreign policy  which is guided by the principles of proletarian internationalism  is free from the slightest sign of narrow nationalism  chauvinism or national exclusiveness or any tendency to underrate others. It has always been and continues to be against the policy of aggression and oppression of the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  with which we neither have nor ever will have relations or lint s of any kind. United States imperialism and Soviet social- imperialism have been and remain the greatest enemies of the freedom and independence of peoples. We are against their attempts to create the psychosis according to which the world can only find stability under their tutelage. We have never accepted that international policy should be the monopoly of the super-Powers.134.	Proceeding from the well-known principles of equality  respect for sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of others and mutual benefit  our country has extended and strengthened its relations of friendship and co-operation with other States  with all countries that love freedom and peace. It has diplomatic relations with some 100 countries from all continents and trade and cultural relations with a large number of them. We are in favor of conducting normal and free trade exchanges without discrimination or restrictive measures  and against maneuvers and attempts by anyone to exploit them as a means of pressure and to impose their own will and political views. We also favor exchanges in the fields of art  culture  science and so on and believe that these should be expanded and enable the peoples to acquaint themselves with each other's achievements.135.	This year the Albanian people will celebrate an important event in its historyóthe seventieth anniversary of the proclamation of independence  which was the culmination of their century-long struggle for national independence. They had to make innumerable sacrifices and shed much blood to win genuine freedom and independence  to become sovereign masters of their own homeland and to open the road to development and progress. For our people have always valued national freedom and independence above all else. Hence  national oppression and practices of national discrimination  wherever they occur and in whatever form and no matter what the pretext or justification  are alien to us. We are against any policy of denationalization  against restrictions in and obstacles to the protection and free development of the national culture  art  language and education  against the negation of traditions and history. Every people  big or small  has the absolute right to preserve and affirm its national identity. Respect for national dignity and values and with the other rights flowing from the principles of the Charter of the United Nations creates conditions in which the peoples can live in friendship and States can have normal relations with each other.136.	Socialist Albania  without stretching out its hand to anyone for aid or credits  has ensured an independent and vigorous development in all fields of life. It has averted the destructive consequences of the  world economic and political crisis and created favorable conditions for the constant improvement of the welfare of the working masses of the country. The new price cuts which came into effect in June this year in Albania  at a time when everywhere else the opposite was happening  were a clear demonstration of the vitality of our socialist order.137.	There are those that accuse Albania of being isolated and cut off. This is not true. We are vigilant because we are alert and know that enemies are hatching plots against socialist Albania  because we see clearly and a familiar with their methods and the plots they direct against other peoples.138.	It does not bother us if some journalist writes an article alleging that Albania is a closed and a poor country. We find such propaganda worthless. Our people are satisfied with their own political and economic situation. They have everything they need and are sure that they will have much more in the future. It is to that end that they are working and struggling  relying entirely on their own resources. We would like to inform those who are supposedly concerned about the well-being of our people that in the part of the world where  according to them  abundance and well-being prevail  there in fact exists an incurable economic crisis that has thrown millions of unemployed persons into the streets  and that in their countries prices continue to rise and drugs and vandalism run riot. In socialist Albania  which they regard as a poor country  such phenomena do not exist. Perhaps those critics would enjoy seeing us too becoming prey to such phenomenaóbut that will never happen. Such things will never be condoned in our country; there is no room for them there. Albania has kept its door closed to such things in the past and will continue to do so in the future. But it has opened and will open its doors to its many friends and well-wishers who exist among the peoples and to whom we are grateful.139.	The Albanian delegation will spare no effort to make its modest contribution to the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly so that its work may take a proper course that with serve the interests of peoples and of peace."
"4",166,"ARE",37,1982,"Allow me at the outset to express on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates our warmest congratulations to Mr  Hollai on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his long experience in the field of international relations will be a positive factor in directing our deliberations and work towards the goals we have gathered here to achieve. I should also like to express our greatest appreciation for the tireless efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  to reconcile various points of view and to search for satisfactory solutions to numerous problems brought before the Assembly at the previous session and the special and emergency sessions. I further wish to express my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen the foundations and principles on which the United Nations was established. I appreciate his sound analysis of the obstacles facing the United Nations  along with his serious attempt to strengthen the ability of the Organization to perform its tasks as well as to solve international problems.55.	The Secretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization the difficulties that the United Nations is facing in playing its role effectively and decisively  particularly with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  since it represents an ideal forum in the conduct of negotiations for peaceful settlement of international disputes. In this connection  I fully agree with the unequivocal reference in the report that for our most urgent goal is to reconstruct the Charter concept of collective action for peace and security so as to render the United Nations more capable of carrying out its primary function. It is incumbent upon all Government to commit themselves to that sound approach  without which the logic of force will prevail and States  especially the smaller ones  will consequently be exposed to only dangers that threaten their security  safety and territorial integrity. This situation is not a myth; rather  it is a fact and it is sharply and tragically represented in the area of the Middle East  specifically in a Lebanon in agony.56.	The events in Lebanon have underscored the fact that the method of force and fait accomplis to which Israel resorts cannot achieve security and stability. The question of Palestine stands clearly before the international community in spite of the attempts by the Tel Aviv leaders to emasculate it with their military machine. Obviously the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the continued Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory both reflect the quagmire into which Israel's employment of its military might to cover up its political failure and international isolation have led it.57. The United Arab Emirates  as a peace-loving Arab State  expresses its revulsion at and strong condemnation of the ugly massacre perpetrated against the Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila camps by the Zionist occupation forces. It appeals to all Member States  and especially to the great Powers  to take serious action to stop Israeli aggression against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples and to work for the immediate and international withdrawal of the Israeli forces of aggression from all Lebanese territory  M order to preserve Lebanon's independence and territorial integrity and accordance with resolutions of the Security Council and other international bodies.58. In this connection  I cannot fail to stress the responsibility of the United States of America as a sponsor of and partner in the conclusion of the agreement that led to the evacuation of the Palestinian fighters from Beirut and the guaranteed the safety of the Palestinian in the refugee camps as well as the civilian potation of West Beirut. Any reliance on the part of the United State  of America would constitute a violation of Us political  contractual and moral obligations. We ask the United States to do its utmost  based on its obligations in this regard  to prevent the recurrence of crimes such as those committed in Lebanon  crimes unprecedented in contemporary to force Israel to withdraw unconfidently from Lebanese territory.59.	The PLO emergence from an unequal war victorious in its perseverance  flexibility and ability to negotiate from a position of right and its responsiveness to international resolutions demonstrate its desire to reach a just and peaceful solution unlike Israel  which has proved that it is an aggressive entity that does not respect international resolutions  norms or rules. The PLO emerged from the conflict more determined than ever to restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  despite the Israeli illusion that its war in Lebanon would destroy the Palestinian people and hence the Palestinian cause.60.	The shameful Israeli policies and practices reflected in its flagrant defiance of United Nations resolutions and its use of armed violence to attain illegal goals call for the reconsideration of its membership in the United Nations. Israel has unequivocally demonstrated  by the heinous massacre it committed in Lebanon and by its continued inhuman and illegal practices in the occupied Arab territories  that it is a Member that is neither able nor willing to carry out its elementary obligations of membership under the Charter. Its membership in the United Nations and all other international organizations should therefore be reconsidered.61.	President Reagan's initiative for peace in the Middle East represents progress in the American position  however  we hope that this position can evolve positively towards the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people and their legitimate representative  the PLO  so that the Palestinian people may exercise their national rights to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State. In order to attain this objective  which is based on the noble purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter  I urge the United States Government to reconsider its military and political support of Israel. Recent events have confirmed that such support is the backbone of Israel's arrogance  intransigence  continued aggression against the Arab people  especially the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples  and rejection of all peace initiatives.62.	My delegation reaffirms that the just solution of  Middle East problem lies in solving the Palestinian question on the basis of the following principles; first  complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including Holy Jerusalem; secondly  enabling Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights  including their right to return to their homeland  to self-determination  to national independence and to full sovereignty through the establishment of an independent State on their national soil and  thirdly  participation on an equal footing of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in any endeavors  efforts or conferences to settle this question. The conclusions reached at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference underscore the principles that determine the just and comprehensive framework for the solution of the Palestinian question.63.	Israel's rejection of the proposed options  whether advanced by the Arabs or by others  is nothing more than blackmail and an attempt to influence the current trend of international thinking. The comprehensive Arab peace plan  which is based on international legitimacy  forces the world to face its imperative responsibilities for attaining a just peace in the region. The plan does not address itself to any particular international party; rather  it addresses all peace-loving parties by assigning a highly important role to the Organization and to the members of the Security Council in supervising the guarantees for peace.64.	My country is concerned about the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran that broke out over two years ago and that is draining the human  military and economic resources of both countries. Moreover  that war threatens the security and stability of the Gulf region  which is of world-wide strategic and economic importance. The continuation of this war does not serve the interest of either country or of the international community. In this connection  my country commends the concrete response of Iraq with regard to ending the war in the interest of both countries and of the region as well  and particularly the withdrawal of its forces to the international borders. That initiative won the appreciation of the international community as a step towards rapidly ending the conflict. We also commend the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and by the non-aligned movement  as well as all the other international efforts made to restore peace and work for conciliation between those two Moslem countries and to establish new foundations for relations between them on the basis of peace  good-neighborliness and mutual respect  which are conducive to the welfare and safety of the region. We hope that Iran will respond to these initiatives designed to end the bloodshed and achieve peace in the region.65.	In recent decades the Indian Ocean region has been a centre of rivalry among the great Powers bent on establishing spheres of influence; that is due to its economic and strategic importance. As a State which is adjacent to that ocean we are deeply concerned about the continued escalation of tension in the area. We support General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. In that regard  we cannot but express o r regret that the attitude of some States has led to the postponement of the international conference which had been scheduled to be convened :n Sri Lanka in 1981 for the purpose of adopting the measures necessary for the implementation  particularly by the super-Powers  of that Declaration66.	The continued presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan  despite the numerous appeals made by the United Nations and other organizations for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces  is preventing the Afghan people from choosing its Government by means of free elections: a choice which it must be able to make without the least foreign interference.67.	That military presence jeopardizes the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country as a non-aligned State. The Government of my country has repeatedly condemned the foreign intervention in Afghanistan as a flagrant violation of the Charter and as an act of aggression against human rights and the freedom of peoples. We affirm that there should be a comprehensive political solution based on full respect for Afghanistan's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.68.	With regard to Cyprus  it seems to us that the holding of negotiations between the two communities constitutes one of the fundamental conditions for reaching a just settlement of the crisis which that State is experiencing. In this connection  the United Nations should continue  through the Secretary- General  its efforts to help the two c <n unities reach some understanding and to provide conditions which would be conducive to the restoration of peace.69.	Since its inception  the United Nations has worked to secure respect of the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence in accordance with their hopes  aspirations and interests. Although most peoples of the world have gained their independence  some Territories are still under colonial domination  notably in southern Africa  where the Government of South Africa persists in its racist policy notwithstanding the international condemna-tion of that policy as a crime against humanity. The denial to the people of South Africa of the ability to exercise their fundamental right of self-determination constitutes a violation of the most important principles of the Charter and of United Nations resolutions  as well as a grave challenge to the international community.70.	The continued economic  military and political co-operation which that racialist regime receives from certain States Members of the United Nations is what encourages it in its intransigence. My Government considers Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to be the soundest framework for the resolution of the question of Namibia. It reaffirms the basic responsibility towards that Territory which the United Nations has held since the termination of the South African Mandate in 1966. The Security Council should impose sanctions on South Africa and adopt the necessary measures envisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter.71.	My delegation affirms its support for the legitimate struggle waged by the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] for self-determination and independence for the Namibian people. It strongly condemns the repeated acts of aggression carried out by South Africa against neighbouring States.72.	The deterioration of the climate of confidence in international relations has led to the continuation of the arms race  which constitutes a serious threat to the whole human race. Despite the declaration of the First Disarmament Decade  and the Programme of Action adopted by the tenth special session of the General Assembly  the first devoted to disarmament  little progress has been made in this field because of the absence of political will on the part of the big Powers. The failure of the recent disarmament session is clear evidence of that fact.73.	We believe the   while disarmament may be the concern of all States  the responsibility for halting the arms race falls primarily on the shoulders of the big Powers  which are the ones producing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The declarations by the United Nations of nuclear-free zones represent a significant contribution to the creation of a climate of peace and security in the world. The possession of nuclear weapons by States which do not respect the norms of international behavior and the provisions of international conventions  and which violate the United Nations resolutions  truly constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. General and complete disarmament under international control remains a prerequisite for a general atmosphere of confidence  for reducing the dangers of tension in the world  and for the removal of the obstacles to channeling huge material resources into economic and social development  for the purpose of attaining prosperity and better living conditions for all mankind.74.	The results achieved at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during its last session held in April at United Nations Headquarters here in New York  namely  the approval by the overwhelming majority of the States of the world of the consolidated text of the Convention on the Law of the Sea/ which sets forth a comprehensive legal system for the peaceful exploitation of the seas for various purposes  especially maritime and economic onesówas the product of a comprehensive compromise which harmonized differing interests and points of view in the light of the principle of the for common heritage of mankind ' adopted by the United Nations many years ago. The success attained may be attributed to the United Nations  which endorsed the call to hold the Conference: to the Secretary-General  who sponsored it throughout its many sessions over several years; and to effective participation in the Conference  particularly by the Group of 77  which exerted commendable efforts in favor of conciliation.75.	Noting with deep concern the extent of the deterioration of the world economy  my country considers that it is necessary to reconsider the existing international economic order so as to make it more just and equitable  in the interest of humanity. The world economy is still confronted with problems regarding economic growth  international trade  and the continuing rise in the rates of inflation and unemployment. Therefore  international co-operation should be strengthened and arduous efforts should be exerted to cope with this deteriorating situation which threatens not only the developing countries  but also the economies of the industrialized States  since the world has become closely interdependent in the various political  economic and social fields. The inter-related nature of the world's economic problems calls for total rather than partial solutions. The industrialized States should be aware of this fact and should effectively contribute to reforming the current world financial and economic order. They should also favorably consider the proposals made by the developing countries  which hope for a further positive contribution to the development of their economies  which suffer from continued recession  stagnation and balance-of-payments deficits. Co-operation among developing countries in solving these problems should be considered as a supplement rather than an alternative to co-operation between the North and the South. It does not relieve the industrialized States of their responsibilities and duties towards the developing countries. Such responsibilities require that the industrialized States adjust the policies currently controlling commodity and service markets  with a view to presenting long-term solutions which give special attention to strengthening food security.76.	As a third world country  the United Arab Emirates requires various resources to develop its economy and to provide for the welfare of its people  yet it plays a concrete role in extending assistance to other third world countries through the financial mechanisms that it has established for that purpose. Most notable among these mechanisms are the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development  created in 1971 to provide foreign assistance  in addition to assistance for development from other sources  such as the Special Fund of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development  and the Arab Bank for African Development.77.	My country fully recognizes that the hope of solutions to the various international financial and economic problems lies in the credibility of a constructive North-South dialogue. The positive response of the participants in the June Versailles Economic Summit to the proposals made by the Group of 77 is an encouraging factor. We hope that the Versailles group will respond quickly to the proposals recently submitted by the Group of 77  which are considered a great concession  made to facilitate the progress of those negotiations. The present condition of the world economy makes more necessary than ever before the restructuring by the international community of the fundamental factors which control economic and social progress throughout the world and especially the development of the States of the third world.78.	Despite this gloomy international picture  I stress my country's full confidence in the ideals and principles of the Charter as an ideal framework for permanent consultation and dialogue to resolve the problems of the world by peaceful means. In this connection  I should like to urge the United Nations to do its utmost to play the fundamental role assigned to it by the Charter and to create conditions conducive to peace  harmony  progress and prosperity for all nations."
"5",213,"ARG",37,1982,"I should like to begin by congratulating the President on his election to the high office he has been asked to fill at this session of the General Assembly. His contribution as President of this forum will undoubtedly be invaluable in achieving the success we hope for in the tasks with which we have been entrusted  especially in the fulfillment of the principles and purpose of the Charter.233.	My country would also like to greet  through him  the friendly nation of Hungary  with which we have a very close and productive relationship.234.	Nor can I omit to take this opportunity to recall the outstanding performance of Mr. Kittani of Iraq  and to reaffirm our appreciation of the ability and effectiveness with which he carried out his task at a particularly difficult session of the General Assembly.235.	Finally  before I reach the substance of my statement  I should like  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of a Latin American country  to greet most warmly the first Latin American Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to whom my country is deeply indebted for his earnest efforts during the South Atlantic crisis to reach a solution to the conflict.236.	This year my country had to deal with a grave international crisis rooted in the fact that even today  on the eve of the twenty-first century  there remain forms of colonial domination in the world  despite the efforts of the Organization and of the overwhelming majority of its Member States to eradicate them. The crisis to which I am referring  which resumed in an armed confrontation between Argentina and the United Kingdom  would not have taken place had colonialism and its vestiges been completely eliminated from the face of the earth.237.	The conflict which took place in the South Atlantic  comprising the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  shows that there is as yet no end to the efforts of the United Kingdom to cling to its colonial possessions and to maintain its privileges  something possible only in an international state of affairs which is based on the existence of unequal relations  supported in the main by the crude domination of force.238.	The Government of the United Kingdom has attempted to obscure the very clear rights of the Republic of Argentina to claim territories of which it was divested by force; but the General Assembly is well aware of the historical background of the matter and the stubborn British attempts to distort it have come to naught.239.	Existing cartographic proofs offered by maps of that time demonstrate that the Malvinas Islands were discovered by Spanish navigators in the first half of the sixteenth century. Then  since the beginning of the seventeenth century  they were explored by French navigators until 1764  when Louis de Bougainville established the Port Louis settlement  now Soledad Island  a situation which gave rise to a Spanish protest and a subsequent recognition by France of the sover¬eignty of Spain over these territories. In 1766 Port Egmont was established in the islet of Trinidad  the only territory occupied by the British in the Malvinas Islands  from which they were also expelled by the Buenos Aires Government on 10 June 1770.240.	Subsequently secret diplomatic negotiations led to the precarious restitution of those settlements to the British on condition that at a later date they would have to withdraw from them definitively  a commit¬ment which the United Kingdom fulfilled in 1774. Since then the United Kingdom virtually forgot all about the islands until it took them by force in 1833.241.	In the period between 1767 and 1810  a year when Argentina started on its road to independence  the Malvinas were administered by 20 governors appointed by the Spanish Crown. The Republic of Argentina  having become independent from Spain  then succeeded Spain in all its rights  including the rights of sovereignty over the islands which belonged to Spain. By virtue of this  until 1833  the administra¬tion of the Malvinas was exercised by six Argentinean governors  under whose government my country had the peaceful and exclusive occupation of the archi¬pelago  without any discussion by the European powers of our claims  titles and rights to these territo¬ries. What must be emphasized  because it is a decisive point  is that the United Kingdom in 1825 recognized that the Republic of Argentina was a sovereign State  and at that time entered into a treaty of friendship  trade and navigation with Argentina and did not then voice any reservation with regard to its alleged rights over the Malvinas Islands or any other adjacent terri¬tories. This most clearly demonstrates that the United Kingdom was aware of the fact that it had absolutely no right over the Malvinas Islands and archipelago  whose sovereignty it questions today.242.	On 3 January 1833  eight year^ after Argentina was recognized as a sovereign State  and after the signing of the treaty of friendship  trade and naviga¬tion  British troops occupied the islands by force  bringing down the Argentinean flag  expelling Argentinean authorities and Argentinean citizens  residents of the area and forcing them to go to Montevideo. The Argentinean population was thus completely replaced by a British military garrison.243.	On 15 and 22 January of that same year  the Government of Argentina sent a protest to the Charge d'affaires of Great Britain in Buenos Aires  and on 17 June the Argentine Minister  Don Manuel Moreno  voiced the most energetic protest in London. Thus began an uninterrupted series of Argentinean protests against the British occupation and in all cases these were arbitrarily rejected by the Government of the United Kingdom.244.	The Republic of Argentina never agreed to the British occupation  nor did it ever give up its sover¬eign rights over the territory of which it was divested by force. All this is more than enough to show the inequity of any claims of acquisition by the United Kingdom.245.	Let the Assembly compare the historic and con¬sistent stand of my country with the silence of Great Britain in 1825 and its ominous aggression of 1833.246.	Let us come back now to our times. Following the creation of the United Nations the treatment in the Organization of the item of decolonization brought with it the adoption of the well-known General Assem¬bly resolution 1514 (XV)  which deals with decoloniza¬tion  as well as resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII) and 31/49  which is specifically applicable to the case of the Malvinas.247.	It was thus decided  first  that there was recog¬nition of the existence of a dispute over sovereignty between the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom  secondly  an invitation to those Govern¬ments to continue forthwith negotiations to achieve a peaceful solution of the matter  bearing in mind the provisions and objectives of the Charter  as well as the interests—not the wishes—of the population of the islands; thirdly  the recognition of the efforts made by the Republic of Argentina to facilitate the decolonization process and to promote the well-being of the population of the islands.248.	Starting in 1966 negotiations began between the two Governments but these negotiations did not lead to any result because of the indifferent attitude and dilatory tactics displayed by the British.249.	Acceptance by the United Kingdom of the invita¬tion to negotiate on the matter of sovereignty  for¬mulated in resolution 2065 (XX)  was embodied in the communications of Foreign Ministers Zavala Ortiz and Stewart '3 as a result of the visit of the latter to Buenos Aires in 1966. Clearly this acceptance was encouraging for it reflected  apparently  the beginning of a change in the British position  which up to that time had rejected all negotiations on the matter of sovereignty of the archipelago.250.	Later the terms of reference of the negotiation were formally set out in the joint communique of 26 April 1977 "" which stated specifically that it would include the matter of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. That agreement between Argentina and the United Kingdom was explicitly recognized in the parallel notes addressed in June 1979's by the Per¬manent Representatives of my country and of the United Kingdom to the Secretary-General  informing him that from 21 to 23 March 1979 the representatives of the Governments of both countries had held the fourth round of negotiations on the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  within the framework established in the aforementioned communique of 26 April 1977.251.	Nevertheless  the obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom in those documents and 17 years of negotiations failed to convince the Government of the United Kingdom to deal with the matter of sover¬eignty fully and in good faith. That was an arbitrary attitude which could not be explained in the light of the clarity of the commitments entered into.252.	On the contrary  my country continued to demonstrate at all times its sincere resolve to settle the dispute. Further proof of that was the letters addressed to the Secretary-General in 1971 by the Permanent Representatives of Argentina and the United Kingdom^ on opening up communications between continental Argentina and the archipelago  for that statement demonstrated in fact the declared intent of Argentina duly to take into account the interests of the inhabitants of the Malvinas.253.	Thus the supply of fuel  the establishment of regular maritime and air services  free medical atten¬tion in hospitals on the continent  the granting of fellowships in educational institutions and the supply of foodstuffs are some of the many indications of the sincere desire of Argentina to continue to improve considerably the standard of living of the inhabitants of the islands  which up to that time had been isolated and had suffered shortages  which Argentina—not the United Kingdom—tried to make good in the best interests of the inhabitants of the Malvinas.254.	One should bear in mind also that along with this  and from the beginning of the negotiations  my country repeatedly oHered to grant guarantees and safeguards under the protection of the United Nations in order to preserve the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the Malvinas  as well as their traditions and customs  with the idea of considering their interests  an idea which is contained in General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX).255.	Nevertheless  despite all the efforts of succes¬sive Argentine delegations in the rounds of negotia¬tions  which were once again renewed at the last meeting in February 1982  it was not possible to get from the British delegations  which also included islanders  a list of the guarantees and safeguards which they required for the protection of their interests.256.	The positive attitude demonstrated by Argentina in presenting to the United Kingdom in February of this year a new proposal for settling the dispute between the two countries met with complete silence on the part of the British Government. That proposal provided for a machinery to speed negotiations over sovereignty and achieve concrete results in the form of a system of monthly meetings  with a pre-established agenda  the venue of the meetings established in advance  presided over by officials at the highest level.But  as already stated  in accordance with the usual practice of Britain in matters of negotiation with our country  we were not able to obtain a reply to this reasonable initiative by Argentina  despite the requests made by our Government.257.	We come now to the episode which unleashed the present crisis. Argentina received the British ultimatum to withdraw a group of civilian workers who had landed on South Georgia to fulfill a private contract  which was known to the British authorities  under the threat of the use of force if their demand was not heeded. That intimidation was accompanied by the movement towards that area of various naval units  including nuclear submarines.258.	Thus the bloodless occupation of the Malvinas Islands by Argentina was a justified reaction in the face of the British decision to strengthen its colonial domination over a territory which by law belongs to my country and in flagrant contradiction with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 31/49. I should like to emphasize that the recovery of the islands was achieved without the British suffering a single death or injury due in any way to the intentions of Argentina  a country which preferred to sacrifice many of its own soldiers for the sake of not causing any victims among the British occupying forces or the population.259.	Furthermore  I should like to recall that imme¬diately and without any pre-condition the Republic of Argentina returned all British military personnel  along with their flags  in order to avoid further prob¬lems in trying to reach a peaceful solution.260.	The recognition by Argentina of the authority of the Security Council in this dispute was made quite clear in many statements by my Government in favor of an effective and full implementation of Council resolution 502 (1982). In his statement at this session the President of Brazil  stressing the importance of the General Assembly's consideration of the question of the Malvinas  stated that the first step towards a solution must be the full implementation of Security Council resolution 502 (1982)  adding: ""It is time for those who so vigorously condemn the use of force in the solution of controversies to demonstrate the consistency and sincerity of their designs"".261.	My Government spared no effort in order to obtain immediately a negotiated settlement of the crisis  accepting at all times the good offices offered to us; but we wonder about the possibility of arriving at a legitimate agreement when the United Kingdom  seeking no result other than a military victory and the maintenance of the colonial situation  brought its fleet into the South Atlantic unlawfully  invoking Article 51 of the Charter  and arrogated to itself the right to act  no matter what the consequences  by taking all sorts of hostile measures.262.	The generous offer made by the Secretary- General on 2 May this year  to be considered by both Governments  did not achieve the solution called for by the serious crisis.263.	The Government of Argentina from the very outset had full confidence in the role which the Organization  and especially the Secretary-General  could play in these grave circumstances  to help with the maintenance of international peace and security and to eliminate all vestiges of colonialism in the world; but the United Kingdom adopted an extremely rigid position with regard to the ideas which were being discussed  an attitude that was closely related to the increase of its military potential in the area.264.	Later came Security Council resolution 505 (1982)  and a British veto on a draft resolution'? in the Security Council^ which  if adopted  would have made possible an immediate cease-fire  thus avoiding loss of life on both sides. This was the clearest proof of the lack of political will on the part of the United Kingdom to find a peaceful negotiated solution. The only thing which the British Govern¬ment was interested in was a success by its punitive fleet  to consolidate its imperialist presence in the South Atlantic and improve its damaged domestic political situation. The facts show that from the very beginning military action was the only solution which the Conservative Government of the United Kingdom seriously considered.265.	I am revealing no secret when I say that the British Empire only reluctantly gave up its colonies. Many of the nations represented here have at one time in their history been colonies of the United Kingdom and know that their present situation as sovereign States is not due to any gracious conces¬sion on the part of that Power  agreeing m a gesture of generosity to grant them independence. On the con¬trary  every case of liberation was the result of a very difficult and cruel struggle by the oppressed peoples  or of the final inability of the United Kingdom to continue exercising its control over those people in the face of the irresistible force of the great movement of history leading to decolonization  generated essen¬tially by the United Nations.266.	The United Kingdom  which today attempts to act as the champion of self-determination  is pre¬cisely the colonial Power par	which in many cases raised all kinds of obstacles when the United Nations tried to assist the just process which made it possible to liquidate most of its Empire.267.	Thus  in the specific case of the Malvinas Islands  the practice of the United Kingdom thus far has been to pretend to fulfil the requirements estab¬lished in the resolutions of the General Assembly  requiring it to negotiate in the dispute over sover¬eignty  while in reality sabotaging any serious attempt to make progress on that important problem. It proceeded throughout with no sense of haste or urgency  while striving only to protect its special private interests  and the monopolistic exploitation of its colony.268.	The United Kingdom has proclaimed that Argentina resorted to action in the midst of the negotiations about the islands. No statement could be more false. That process has been frustrated precisely by the dilatory tactics and delays used time and again by the British Government  quite apart from its complete failure to reply to the last proposal made by Argentina in February 1982.269.	Moreover  I wish to state categorically that throughout the 17 years of fruitless negotiations imposed upon the United Kingdom by the will of theGeneral Assembly in 1965 in its resolution 2065 (XX)  the administering colonial Power of our Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands never gave any indication of trying in good faith to reach a solution to the dispute over sovereignty which exists between that country and Argentina  refusing to discuss the only subject that justified those negotiations and made them necessary: precisely the question of sovereignty.270.	Among the basic principles which it sets forth for the fulfillment of the purposes of the United Nations  the Charter  in Article 2  paragraph 2  states that ""All Members  in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership  shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter"". But the attitude of the United Kingdom constitutes a flagrant violation of this commitment to which it subscribed when it signed the constitutional statute of the Organization  and its actions and omissions have shown how little importance it attaches to the resolutions of one of the basic pillars of the relations in the international community.271.	Furthermore  if any doubt remained  the attitude of the present Government of the United Kingdom is full confirmation that its objective has always been to continue its usurpation of the Islands and to accept only those superficial changes which serve to conceal the true colonial nature of its domination over them.272.	And if the existence of colonies is an affront to the dignity of the peoples and a shameful blot on the name of an international community which claims to be civilized  even more shameful is the attempt to invoke the principles of decolonization to prolong the life of the ill-omened remnants of an era that fortunately has come to an end. The Government of the United Kingdom is trying to whitewash the guilt of its unlawful occupation by invoking the right to self- determination of the inhabitants of the Islands. In so doing  it is attempting to justify their plundering by invoking the principles that are generally accepted in the United Nations in the hope that the nations represented here will forget all the times when these principles were ignored or denied by the same United Kingdom which now invokes them.273.	For if the United Kingdom states that it is a nation which respects the right of self-determination  we are faced with a true historic paradox. How are we then to explain the struggle for independence and national sovereignty of India under Gandhi's leader¬ship  human symbol of anti-colonialism  peace and justice in our century? How can we forget the wars of liberation in Africa against British imperialism ever since the end of the Second World War? How can we explain the subjugation and domination suffered by the peoples of Asia at the zenith of the United Kingdom's imperial expansion? Could we perchance forget that he United Kingdom not only violated the true self-determination of the peoples  but it also made illegal use of force  violating the most elementary rules and principles of international law and ethics? Why did the United Kingdom  claiming to be such a staunch defender of the self-determination of peoples  displace by force the population of the island of Diego Garcia  to make over that territory for the establishment of a military base in the Indian Ocean?Cotild it be perhaps because they were not white  but Macks and people of mixed Mood?274.	Obviously  it is no mere historical coincidence that some of the major leaders of the developing world and champions in our day of the freedom and independence of peoples—men such as Nehru  Nasser  Kenyatta  Nyerere and Archbishop Makarios  among others—had to confront at various times in their political struggles the colonial or neo-colonial domi¬nation of British imperialism.275.	These facts show that when the U „ Kingdom claims to be defending the right to determination of peoples  that is not only a way vt concealing the truth about the nature of its illegal colonial possession of the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia and South Sandwich  but also a cynical attempt to adjust its position to the world of today  in order to perpetuate its last ties of political and economic domination; in other words  its intent is to seem to change things so that they can remain the same. The right to self- determination is basically a collective right  recognized for all peoples  nations and States. That right assumes a legitimate relationship between those who are to benefit and the territory to be decolonized  but the territorial link cannot be of any type  because the right to self-determination can never be used as an instrument to split up a territory.276.	For example  the settlements established by Israel in the occupied Arab and Palestinian terri¬tories—in contradiction of the rights of the countries and populations affected  and of the Geneva Con¬vention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  and in flagrant violation of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly—are a clear example of a policy infringing the right of territorial integrity. The international community has rightly condemned such policies  since the perpetuation of these illegal situations at the expense of Syria  Jordan  Lebanon and the Palestinian people year after year has become a constant source of tension and violence  endangering not only the Middle East but international peace and security.277.	Therefore  recognition of the right to self- determination of a population implanted by force  after the forced expulsion of those who were legiti¬mately living in the area earlier  is a mockery of the efforts of the Organization to put an end to colonialism  and can lead only to the renewal of colonialism in the guise of a settlement freely consented to. The relation¬ship between those who claim freely to exercise the right to self-determination and the territory in which they live must come from a justifiable situation that existed before the occupation.278.	The clear and maked truth is that the United Kingdom has established a colony in part of Argentine territory  and the definitive solution must be the restitution of that territory to its legitimate owner  in keeping with the right of territorial integrity  which clearly applies to this case  in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV). Otherwise  I must give warning that to legitimize the illicit origin of British pos¬session would be to establish a dangerous precedent for legitimizing future seizures of territory  based on the use of force  yet subject  it would be claimed  to legitimization by the passage of time.279.	The recent crisis in the South Atlantic prompted the Government of the United Kingdom not only to seek to consolidate its colonial domination  this time quite openly  over the Malvinas Islands and their dependencies  but also in violation of General Assem¬bly resolutions  to establish an extra-continental military base on the islands  with nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons in the area.280.	This provocative attitude has clearly introduced a focus of continuing tension into the South Atlantic  which is unacceptable both to the Republic of Argen¬tina and to Latin America. We must therefore put an end to that state of affairs. There has been a de facto end to the hostilities in the area  as everyone knows  and my Government does not intend to take the initiative in changing that situation. But following the cease-fire the United Kingdom carried out an armed attack on the Argentine scientific station ""Corbeta Uruguay""  established six years earlier in the South Sandwich Islands  imprisoning the staff  who were carrying out work of a strictly peaceful nature. That unjustifiable act of aggression was recently condemned by the Second World Conference On Cultural Policies  convened in Mexico by UNESCO.281.	Furthermore  my country has many times brought to the attention of the Organization acts of harassment by British vessels and aircraft against Argentine fishermen  even outside the exclusion zone which the United Kingdom continues to impose around the islands for Argentine civil and military vessels and aircraft. Although technically limited to an area of 150 nautical miles  this illegal and arbitrary measure has in fact been extended by the British Government to waters outside the area  where Argentine fishing vessels are constancy subject to intimidation. This is a serious matter that should be of great concern to us  since we all recall how during the recent conflict a British nuclear submarine did not hesitate to torpedo and sink the Argentine Republic navy cruiser Genera/which was sailing outside the exclusion zone established and defined by the United Kingdom Government itself—a completely illegitimate and brutal action which was no source of pride for British public opinion or any of its allies.282.	The facts that I have just described  as well as the stand taken so far by the British Government  opposed to any genuine negotiation  show clearly the need for the international community  through a decision by the General Assembly  to support the Latin American initiative to resolve the present situation and the dispute over sovereignty between Argentina and the United Kingdom by substantive negotiations carried out in good faith.283.	Latin America is today writing a page in its history marked by its spiritual umty and its heroic role  reaffirmed recently by the Panama Canal issue  and today by the Malvinas question.284.	This unity will be demonstrated in the forth¬coming meetings of Latin American heads of State proposed by Uruguay  Panama and Colombia  in all of which my country will take part. It will also be demonstrated next year at a meeting  convened by Venezuela in Caracas  of heads of State and other representatives of their peoples to commemorate the bicentenary of the Liberator  Simon Bolivar  who conceived of our continent as a federation of nations striving  through the strength of their common ideals and determination  to bring about a world of justice and freedom. With this dream  to which our Liberator  Jose de San Martin  made his outstanding contribution  were associated all the national heroes of Latin America  with a slogan that we have not forgotten  and are determined not to forget  calling for respect by the international community for our demands  today and for ever.285.	Latin America  united today by the Malvinas  and tomorrow by whatever other equally just cause may affect any of the countries comprising it  calls for a response that will meet its legitimate demands.286.	Latin America shall not be a breeding-ground for colonial adventures. The countries of the hemi¬sphere fought hard to win their independence and therefore have a long tradition of rejection of colo¬nialism. Those ideals of the founding heroes of the Latin American homeland inspire the actions of the Governments of the region  with whose decisive assistance and support the Hrst decolonization ini¬tiatives prospered in the United Nations. It is in that spirit that Latin America has demonstrated its whole¬hearted support for the fraternal initiative taken by Mexico  which calls for consideration of the question of the Malvinas Islands during the current session of the General Assembly.287.	I emphasize with pride and appreciation that the question of the Malvinas Islands is no longer in the Organization the private cause of my country but has become the cause of Latin America  as happened also in the case of Panama. In their letter to the Secretary-General  the Latin American nations made the following points  among others:""The persistence of this colonial situation in America and the dispute between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Islands  on which the General Assembly has expressed itself in resolutions 2065 (XX)  3160 (XXVIII) and 31/49  have led to serious armed con¬flict in the South Atlantic and constitute a situation that affects the Latin American region in particular.""The countries of America  which are peace- loving and anxious for a peaceful settlement of the conflict  consider that the negotiations between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations/' [Sep288.	That initiative earned the gratitude of all the Argentine people  for which the cause of the Malvinas is a national goal which takes precedence over partisan differences and binds together citizens of all sectors.289.	We extend the same gratitude to the non-aligned movement  which in its successive statements has categorically endorsed Argentina's claims.290.	I wish to express similar appreciation to all countries which have extended to us their support and have recognized the legitimacy of our claims.291.	The events in the South Atlantic have taught us some hard but useful lessons  which will have an impact on our future as a region and hence on our international relations. We have felt the warmth of solidarity and the bitterness of frustration  depending on the reaction to the legitimate claim of our peoples.292.	We shall never forget those who acted as our friends. As to those who did not so act  we shall re-examine in the future their earlier positions  bearing in mind the circumstances of that time  which for many were unclear or distorted. But the positions they are taking now  will have to stand up to the closest scrutiny by the Argentine people and by all those who agree with the very clear principles which the inter¬national community has committed itself to defend. Their conduct will be judged not by Governments  which are temporary things  but by peoples  which are permanent. History  which is incorruptible  will be a court of last resort. The Argentineans and all Latin Americans are convinced that it will be our ally  not to be suborned.293.	We firmly believe that negotiations in good faith between the parties provide the only possible path to peace. Hence we are prepared to heed the call of the General Assembly to begin negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the dispute over sover¬eignty which will take into account the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  with the assistance of the Secretary-General  in whom my country has sincere confidence.294.	Argentina has never expanded its territory through the use of force. On the contrary  it has traditional resorted to peaceful methods and negotiations to resolve its territorial disputes. In this spirit our country is committed to the peaceful settlement of its territorial dispute with the Republic of Chile in the southern part of the country  with the invaluable participation of His Holiness Pope John Paul II as mediator. The people and Government of Argentina wish to express here their deepest gratitude to His Holiness for his tireless mediating activities and his guidance of the negotiations with the Republic of Chile. Great importance has been attached by the Holy See to these activities  which resulted in the agreement signed on 15 September last at Vatican City. That agreement is an unequivocal confirmation of the complete confidence which the two countries have placed in the Supreme Pontiff and in his judgment as to the best way to settle the dispute. For our part  we reaffirm our belief that through mediation we will reach a final agreement acceptable to both parties which will put an end to the dispute once and for all  thus consolidating the traditional links between the two peoples.295.	The world situation is so serious  and the situa¬tion as regards the Organization's ability to fulfill its purpose of maintaining peace and acting as a useful forum for negotiation among its Member States has become so difficult  that the Secretary-General felt compelled in writing his exemplary report to abandon the usual practice of reviewing the broad range of issues involved in the work of the United Nations and to concentrate on the central  vital problem of the chances of achieving the aims which 37 years ago prompt J the creation of the United Nations  after the six years of agony and destruction of the Second World War.296.	In the year since the last regular session of the General Assembly the deteriorating trend of inter¬national relations has been confirmed. The tensions stemming from the traditional confrontation between the super-Powers have been aggravated by fighting resulting from long-standing conflicts which remain unresolved as a result of the lack of political will or an intransigent refusal to confront the problems intelligently and in a forward-looking way.297.	Thus the lack of trust between antagonistic blocs or States at the international level provides the political opportunity for serious regional crises  and the military pacts among the great Powers encourage their allies  whether or not they are in the right  in exaggerated confrontations or punitive operations reminiscent of the nineteenth century  although they use the ultra-sophisticated arsenals of the late twentieth century.298.	Furthermore  the developed nations  are en¬trenching themselves m positions of privilege and when they agree to a dialogue with other States which are not members of their club they do so only on their own terms. Fear of change makes them more inflexible and the climate of international tension  instead of making them outward-looking as regards the rest of the world  makes them turn inward  which is a futile flight from the collective responsibilities they should shoulder. Those nations close their ranks to defend the advantages they gained in the past  although the injustice of these is obvious. This is all clear evidence of a process of international political involution which augurs ill for the future.299.	We cannot but affirm emphatically here that if there remains any chance of justice and right prevail¬ing  it can only be within the framework of the Organi¬zation  which has the necessary ways and means to assist nations in conflict  provided those nations are really ready for dialogue and negotiations to settle their disputes. Hence  the international community must turn towards the United Nations in search of a reply and for attitudes which encourage the preser¬vation of world peace.300.	We all know that one traditional way is through disarmament but  unfortunately  the present session is taking place in the shadow of the failure of a few months ago of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The international community had great hopes in that session  which it expected would consolidate and develop the achieve¬ments made in the four years since the first such special session.301.	But the time is coming when all the countries  and in the first place the great Powers  will be unable to ignore the fundamental dilemma any longer: they must either make sincere and serious efforts to bring under control the massive increase in weapons  in particular nuclear weapons  or we shall be embarking upon an uncontrollable escalation of which we shall be the prisoners and probably the victims.302.	The recent events in Lebanon constitute a further tragic manifestation of the permanent threat stemming from the perpetuation of unjust and serious situations not resolved by the international system  which has once again failed in Its primary task  established under the Charter—^namely  that of maintaining international peace and security. Too many years have passed during which the people of Lebanon have had to suffer as a result of successive violations of their territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty. This unjust situation has been com¬pounded in recent weeks by the barbarous acts perpetrated in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila. This provoked the unanimous condemnation of the international community  in which my Government joined first with a communique issued in Buenos Aires and then by our vote at the seventh emergency special session  on Palestine. There can be no doubt of the responsibility of the Israeli Government which invaded the city of Beirut in violation of the agreement reached and on the pretext of preventing chaos.303.	The Government and people of Argentina are convinced that ajust and lasting solution of the question of the Middle East can be achieved  as my country has argued repeatedly in recent years  only if there is recognition of and respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence and to establish their own sover-eign Statu; acceptance of the right of Israel and all countries of the region to live in peace within inter¬nationally recognized borders; Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and  in addition  recognition of a special regime for the Holy City of Jerusalem  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.304.	Many other situations are subjects of grave con¬cern to us. The persistence of the hateful apartheid regime in South Africa and the unjustifiable delay in the inexorable process of independence for Nami¬bia  the decolonization of which must not be further postponed  are just two of these. South Africa cannot continue to resort to new and arbitrary excuses to preserve a shameful and unjust status quo the pur¬pose which is to deny the Namibian people the true exercise of their right to self-determination and national independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and with full respect for its territorial integrity. The international community must use its best efforts to put an end to this colonial situation  which is marked by economic exploitation and racial discrimination. The people of Namibia must be assisted in their just struggle to put an end to South African domination  which flies in the face of the most elementary principles of justice and equity accepted by the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations.305.	Another grave situation which for reasons of regional brotherhood concerns us profoundly is the instability and violence prevailing in Central America  which prompted the promising initiative of an offer of good offices by the Presidents of Mexico and Vene¬zuela  with a view to reducing tension and ensuring peace. Of course  my Government has already expressed its full support for those efforts.306.	I know that it is not original to refer to the crisis in international economic relations or to emphasize that the high cost is being borne by the developing countries. However  despite the attempts made by those countries to ensure the establishment of more just economic and political relations which ensure a proper place and equitable participation in the international sphere  some developed countries are working to prevent these through economic policies that undermine multilateral co-operation in general and co-operation for development in particular.307.	There has been a resurgence of protectionism in the major decision-making centers  accentuating further the economic and social difficulties on the periphery.' Selective and discriminatory policies have been established  based on concepts of so-called graduation  which establish arbitrary and harmful differences for developing countries. By increasing emphasis on bilateralism in international economic relations there has been an erosion of the multilateral framework of international co-operation.308.	As if all this did not constitute a sufficiently discouraging picture  we now see a tendency for certain developed countries to use economic means for political ends  by trying to bring pressure to bear on developing countries to subordinate the exercise of their sovereign rights.309.	The non-aligned movement has emphatically condemned such behavior and the Charter of Eco¬nomic Rights and Duties of States adopted by the general Assembly in 1974  is also emphatic on this point.310.	Within the Latin American framework  at the regional level  it was understood from the outset  as confirmed by decisions 112 and 113 of the eighth meeting of the Permanent Council of the Latin Amer¬ican Economic System  that Latin America must reduce its vulnerability to the concerted pressures of the developed world.311.	Nevertheless  in the midst of this disturbing picture there are on the horizon some positive facts  such as those originating in the Group of 77 and the recent statements made in the Economic and Social Council by some industrialized countries  which lead us to hope that global negotiations can begin shortly in an attempt to revitalize the North-South dialogue.312.	As regards co-operation among developing countries  the recent meeting in Manila showed the realities and potential of this broad range of co-oper¬ation and solidarity.313.	I cannot conclude my statement without saying that my country accepts the existence of this real and regrettable world political panorama because it is a matter of plain fact. However  we also believe in the absolute need to overcome this grave situation  because we are sure that the instinct of self-preser¬vation will compel all the peoples in the world to unite their efforts to change this picture of real and potential conflicts. But we also firmly believe that that primary objective cannot be attained through vague declarations and pious words  but only through specific action and a healthy political determination  which  by establishing good faith in international relations and encouraging progress and wealth  will make possible the emergence of new protagonists on the world scene. There must be new presences capable of restor¬ing a balance threatened today by the magnificent development of some nations at the expense of the stagnation or the slow development of others.314.	I should like to conclude my statement by referring once again to the Malvinas question  which is so vitally important to my country. The world knows Argentina's devotion to peace and that we have lived through more than a century without any periods of war. If a peaceful people felt it necessary to take up arms to defend its cause  in an unequal battle  it was solely as the result of the justice of that cause. Our forces consisted entirely of Argentineans who were fulfilling their patriotic duty. In our struggle we did not turn to foreigners boastful of their bloodthirsty ferocity closely tied to the degrading exchange of money.315.	Our martyrs  sacrificed in the desolate lands and frigid waters of the South Atlantic  will be constant witnesses to Argentina's unwavering sovereignty over the Malvinas  a cause whose defense brooks neither concessions nor hesitation. The hours of sacrifice of our combatants  as well as the blood and the lives laid down by so many of them  were not in vain. The cry that went up then and that will lead us steadfast to our goal will not fade from the conscience of mankind."
"6",273,"ATG",37,1982,"I wish to join with the leaders of other delegations in paying a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Kittani  who distinguished himself throughout last year in his efforts on behalf of the Assembly. I am also honoured to be accorded the privilege on behalf of my country to congratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I offer him my delegation's fullest support in the tasks which lie ahead of him.Never in the history of its existence has the Assembly convened against such a background of pervading universal gloom. Unemployment figures I the industrialized countries are assuming proportions traditionally associated with developing countries: 10.1 per cent in the United States and a similar figure in the European Economic Community. Every month that passes witnesses thousands more people being cast on to the heap of the unemployed with no prospect of jobs  no means of maintaining their standard of living and little means of ensuring the well-being of their families. Many marvel every day that there have not been widespread violent reactions in the streets; others expect those reactions to erupt at any time if this all-consuming recession continues unabated.And while unemployment in industrialized countries reaches the level normally linked with developing countries  the ranks of the unemployed in poor States are swelling to record volumes. Only an immunity to suffering born of generations of deprivation keeps some developing States from explosion.A blanket of misery has been cast upon the world: it has spared no country and it has brought many to the brink of disaster. This misery can only be measured in human terms-for it knows nor colour  nor religion  nor nationality. It grips many millions in developed countries who must struggle to survive on State support and many more millions in poor countries who must suffer with no support at all.In the 1930s  when mankind experienced a global economic recession such as the one we now face  the economists called it ""the Great Depression"". It was the forerunner of a terrible war which brought even greater human suffering than had obtained before it. As conditions currently exist in the world  it would not be too far-fetched for some to contemplate wars  however limited  as a solution to the current economic crisis. Indeed some are already advocating the Keynesian theory that military spending will create jobs  increase public demand and stimulate economic growth.In these troubled times  the global community should be able to spam the irrationality of the warmongers and turn instead to the United Nations for a sane and sensible direction. The words spoken in the Assembly by the world's leading personalities should invoke in mankind a spirit of hope and a sense of optimism for the future. But we are yet to hear those words. We are yet to hear an attempt at dialogue between the two super-Powers; we are yet to hear an attempt at peace between warring neighbours in the Middle East; we are yet to hear nations climb down from their nationalistic pedestals to the table of peaceful discussion for the benefit of all mankind. What we have heard is a discourse of the deaf; a mouthing of prearranged statements with no interest in response or reply. Statements have not been made for the benefit of other nations  let alone the world; they have been made for political mileage in national capitals.In that context the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization is both important and timely  for its summons us to recall the principles of the Charter and to review the Mechanisms of the Organization in order to make this body strong  not sterile; decisive  not dilatory; functional  not ornamental. It warns us that in a world fraught with tension and peril the United Nations is indispensable. The Secretary-General's report has identified a number of important ways in which the effectiveness of the United Nations could be improved and enhanced  particularly in regard to collective international security. Therecommendations  especially the call for a meeting of the Security Council at the highest possible level to discuss the problems of the United Nations  should be given the support of all Member States. In my view  part of the agenda of that meeting should be consideration of how much more effective the United Nations might be if we ended the veto system provided for the permanent membership of the Security Council. The concept of a veto was developed at the end of the Second World War when a few nations held dominion over many. But surely the results of a war  in whose creation the majority of the world's people played no part  should not continue to advise the procedures of the Security Council on an everlasting basis.In his report the Secretary-General has himself said that ""allegations of partisanship"" have been used by some Member States to justify side-tracking the Security Council. He has called on us to ""take such matters with the utmost seriousness and ask ourselves what justifications  if any  there are for them and what can be done to restore the Council to the position of influence it was given in the Charter"".There is no doubt that there exists among Member States a genuine fear that in certain circumstances members of the Security Council could act in a partisan manner. In fact recent history has shown that the veto has been used to safeguard narrow national interests in defiance of world opinion and the decisions of the Assembly. The use of the veto in such a manner does not inspire confidence in the Security Council.In this context my delegation contends that the most effective action that can be taken to restore the Council to the position of influence which the Charter intended for it is to end the veto system and to democratize the process of decision-making.Even as I state my delegation's position I am sadly aware that it has little chance of becoming a reality  for those that hold power seldom relinquish it willingly. None the less that is precisely why I state it  for the attention of the Organization and other international organizations must be focused on their collective impotence to meaningfully address the problems of the world while the will of s few dominates the aspirations of the many.As we consider the issues about which the many in the Organization have been concerned  we are struck by the dismal record of failure which confronts us. Let us first examine efforts in the Assembly to bring about change in the global economic arrangements. Although 1981 was the date set for the completion of global negotiations on trade  energy  raw materials  development finance and monetary issues  the few have ensured that this body has failed to produce agreement even on the procedures for such negotiations. Discussion on the global negotiations has been shunted from the thirty-sixth to the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly. While this delaying game has been played in the United Nations the prospects for growth and development in poor countries have been diminished by similar actions in other international organizations. At the recent joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank group in Toronto the few ensured that an urgent call by the Group of 24 for an increase in the Fund's quotas of not less than 100 per cent would be ignored. Equally  efforts to persuade donors to the International Development Association to improve their contributions in view of the Association's vital importance to poor countries met with only partial success.Developing countries have not only been denied the opportunity to discuss a framework for an international economic system based on the fundamentals of social justice and equality; they have also experienced a reduction in the quantum of badly needed assistance.Official development assistance from the Western industrialized nations decreased by 4 per cent in real terms in 1981. Official development assistance from the Eastern European countries  including the Soviet Union  is of course selective  and these countries have yet to show any interest in the international dialogue on aid  though they are active participants  to their own benefit  in the process of trade.Only a few nations provided more than 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product  which this body established as a desirable minimum  in the form of assistance. Those countries have the gratitude of the developing world; they deserve the respect of the international community as a whole. They are Denmark  France  the Netherlands  Norway and Sweden  from Europe  and Kuwait  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  three major donor countries that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  which gave 3.02 per cent of their gross national product in 1980.It is true that by providing aid in the volume that they have those donors have greatly assisted poor third-world States which are the worst victims of the current recession. But those donors have also rendered a service to the global community  especially the rich  for the third world countries are now the biggest market for the goods of the industrialized nations. For instance  one in every 18 jobs in the United States is in manufacturing for the third world. In such circumstances it is in the interests of all  including the industrialized nations  for third world States to survive. For if we are unable to purchase goods produced by the developed States they will lose many more millions of jobs  and that may be the trigger for those violent reactions which have not yet erupted in the streets.I have already mentioned our failure to advance the global negotiations and the reduction of aid to developing countries as setbacks to a prosperous global economy. Let me now add protectionism. The protectionism practiced by some developed States is the short-term answer to the problems of adjustment raised by the current recession. It is believed in some capitals that by shutting out the goods of developing countries local production will be stimulated to the benefit of the national economy.The evidence against that argument is now well known. Indeed recent studies have shown that betweenand 1977 protectionist measures imposed by the United States on goods imported from Latin America and the Caribbean resulted in a loss to consumers of $1 250 million for carbon steel  $1 200 million for footwear  $660 million for sugar  $400 million to $800 million for meat  and $500 million for television sets-a total of $4 billion for these five items. The cost to the consumer for every job protected was more than $50 000 per year. I submit that the national economy did not benefit in the long run.In this time of disarray in the world economy it is crucially important to establish an international trading system in which the developing countries are accorded a fair and equitable place. Therefore we call on Governments represented in the Assembly to approach the GATT Ministerial Meeting in November with the will to return to a set of agreed principles and rules applying to all international trade and providing a recognizable and ordered framework within which it can grow. Therein  we believe  lies the basis for promoting a sound world economy.Failure to achieve change in global economic arrangements is not the only example of the -Assembly's resolve to right wrongs being thwarted. South Africa is yet another burning example.South Africa continues to be a running sore upon the face of this earth. The inhuman system of apartheid has gone beyond excess in its brutality against the black majority. The iniquities of its regime continue to mock the authority of this body. And what is reprehensible about the success of the South African regime is that Pretoria has received tacit support from many large transnational and some of the very Governments which sit in this Hall.Many will plead that  although they have a connection with South Africa  they decry and bemoan the system is simply an excuse  for they are as aware as we are  though perhaps not as painfully  that any support given to Pretoria serves only to strengthen the regime and intensify its atrocities.Those atrocities are now legion: the permanent imprisonment of South African blacks for the crime of believing that they have a right to be free; the sentencing to death of young men because they fought to wrest their country from minority control; the dumping of hundreds of thousands of black South Africans in hastily created Bantustans in order to deprive them of citizenship in the land of their birth.We do not appear to have much chance of addressing the problem of South Africa in the comprehensive manner which it demands if we are unable to compel Member States to comply with our resolutions. We do not appear to have much chance of isolating the virus of South Africa  when a Committee established by the General Assembly in to draft an international convention against in sports is unable to present an agreed convention six years later.But we must continue to try  for what is happening in South Africa is a mark against all mankind  an assault on our decency  violence to our world as human beings. It requires every Government represented in the Assembly to support efforts to uphold creative ways in which the wrongs in South Africa can be put right. Not least amongst our efforts must be the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which establishes the framework for the independence of Namibia. The freedom of the people of Namibia must no longer be blocked by the perpetrators in Pretoria of the wicked system of apartheid must it be delayed by any attempt to link it with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The independence of the Namibian people is just  justified and justifiable; it should not be used to serve the national interests of other countries. I wish I could point to the Middle East as an area where the United Nations has been effective  for if this were true thousands of lives would have been spared  cities would have been saved from ruin  and millions of dollars would have been channelled into improving rather than destroying societies. Unfortunately  the principles of the Charter have been flagrantly disregarded and resolutions of the Security Council have been wilfully ignored. Consequently  the people of the Middle East  who have suffered so agonizingly long  have found no respite from the pain of war.The recent massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut was a cold-blooded and brutal act of barbarism. It goes beyond merely epitomizing the tragedy of the Middle East; it adds a new dimension to the horrors of the confrontation. Lebanon has become the bleeding heart of the world. Its anguish is shared in every man's conscience. This country deserves the urgent support of the international community to bind its wounds  restore its national pride and reconstruct its economy. The Israeli forces could now be helpful to that process if they were to withdraw immediately from Lebanese territory.The tragedy of Lebanon points once again to the manner in which some nations are willing to bypass the United Nations and to disregard its peacekeeping roles. The fact that a search for a solution to the Middle East problems is going on and that a peace-keeping force is in Lebanon without the involvement of the Security Council considerably dilutes the worth of the Organization. It makes small countries like mine wonder about the purpose of coming here at a cost we cannot afford  when the United Nations is dismissed by those who are its greatest power- brokers.Central to the issue which has wrought such catastrophe in the Middle East is the Fight of the Palestinian people to self-determination and their further right to a land of their own in the West Bank and Gaza. These legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be satisfied  and my Government will steadfastly support every initiative to secure those rights for the Palestinian people  while recognizing that Israel also has a right to exist securely within agreed and recognized boundaries. In any event  as my country has opposed acquisition of territory by force in our own Latin America and recently in the South Atlantic  so we oppose similar acts of aggression in the Middle East. The conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran is another instance of the United Nations being ignored. This two-year military engagement has also cost many thousands of lives. It has been particularly savage  with prisoners-of-war on one side being slaughtered in contravention of their rights as prisoners. We appeal to both countries to renew their commitment to the Charter and to end this bloody conflict  by complying with Security Council resolutions 514 (1982) and 522 (1982). In doing so  they would ease the suffering of both their peoples  who have been the greatest losers in the confrontation.One cannot help but wonder how many thousands of lives would have been saved  how much destruction averted and how much real development achieved had the Assembly's work on disarmament positive results rather than unmitigated failure. Much was expected from the second special session devoted to disarmament held earlier this year  particularly as tension heightened in so many parts of the world. Not least among those who had high expectations of the disarmament session were hundreds of thousands of young people all over the world. This summer they openly demonstrated in major cities  including here in New York  the seat of the United Nations. The protests of this generation against the continuous  unrelenting stockpiling of weapons have broken out like a rash. It is a rash of resistance  an epidemic of health in an otherwise unhealthy world. Many of those young people associate the failure to halt the arms race with the ineffectiveness of the Assembly  for in the creation of the United Nations did not Governments enshrine in the Charter a role for collective security? Did they not promise mankind to make the world a safe place in which to live? Did they not extend the hope of an enduring respite from the horrors of war?A generation has come to maturity with conventional wars and the threat of nuclear war still menacing their lives. They are not content that it should remain so. They want a broader  more comprehensive response from Governments  and it is obvious that such a response must be practical steps to arrest the arms race and to devise a system of collective security which demands of each nation a commitment to the protection of mankind as a whole.The arms race competes with development objectives. It not only robs the productive process of resources  it also deprives humanity of the funds needed to improve the quality of life. It not only creates international tension  it stagnates national economies.There are shocking statistics available to all who would pay attention. Funds allocated for technical assistance to all developing countries for the next five years are less than will be spent on weapons in the next five days. Developing countries received approximately $20 billion in assistance from industrialized nations last year; this year the United States alone will spend $18 billion on exploring the military uses of outer space. Total military spending' last year was $700 billion. That sum totals more than the entire income of 1 500 million people living in the 50 poorest countries.We should all consider what those funds would mean to the quality of life in developing countries if a portion were released for development assistance. Moreover  the rich nations should consider what effect the release of such funds would have on the productive sectors of their own economies  on jobs for their own young people and on health care for their old.My delegation was pleased to see a report this week that the chairmen of the biggest corporations in the United States  including many of those that count on the Pentagon for their business  have called for a cut in military spending. Although their objective may be confined to narrow national concerns in the United States  it is at least an acknowledgement by a powerful group that military spending is not sacrosanct.A halt to the arms race has become a matter for urgent global action in the cause of mankind's survival. The Assembly would fail to satisfy the noble ideals for which the United Nations was established if we turn a deaf ear to the eloquent calls for peace and a halt to the arms race that have echoed so profoundly across so many continents.The depression of the 1930s and the Second World War were followed by unprecedented international co-operative efforts to reconstruct the world economy. The international economic order  which was established as a result of those efforts  can no longer cope with the realities of the 1980s  but the efforts which attended its creation are worthy of emulation. For it is a similar kind of international effort which our global community requires today  one which includes countries of the North and South  the East and West.Such an effort must have as its goal a vision of how the world could be if there were a will by Governments to make it so. It should be a vision which acknowledges the pluralistic nature of our societies  accepts the inevitability of our economic interdependence and resolves that our children should inherit a peaceful and prosperous planet.The Assembly is in a unique position to help mankind establish that vision  for the conditions outside this building-in the cities and rural dwellings of our many countries-demand urgent change. It is a task which should be embraced with alacrity  for future generations will judge us harshly if  despite our recognition of a need to act  we sacrifice long- term global well-being for short-term national gains. Antigua and Barbuda stands committed to help make such a vision a reality."
"7",318,"AUS",37,1982,"On behalf of the Aus¬tralian Government  Sir  I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty seventh sessions of the General Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  who has shown great imagination and integrity in his first year in office.98.	No one can ignore the somber mood of the Assembly as it faces the critical issues of the day  particularly the terrible events of three weeks ago in Lebanon. Even in a world used to acts of violence  the Beirut massacres have numbed and shocked us all Outrage  however strongly worded and deeply felt  must appear inadequate to innocent non-com¬batants whose unhappy history has been written in blood and tears. Australians share the view of civilized men and women everywhere on the need for  and welcome  a full and independent inquiry into these appalling events.99.	Beyond Beirut  however  there is a wider tragedy of 30 years and more of the Middle East conflict that inexcusably still defies resolution and clouds the future of the region. One can only hope that the events in Beirut will shock more countries into a realization of the need for a comprehensive settlement.100.	Australia has always been deeply conscious of the age-long suffering of the Jewish people and their right to a homeland. We understand Israel's concern that it be able to live in peace  free of terrorist attacks. Recognition of Israel's right to exist in peace can  however  settle only one side of the Middle East problem. Israel must also recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  rights which should include a homeland for the Palestinians alongside Israel. Israel  pre-eminently among nations  should understand the significance of a national homeland for a dispersed people.101.	Equally important is the need for movement from the Arab side. We recognize that the proposals from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez provided an implicit recognition of Israel by calling for the Security Council to guarantee peace among all States of the region. Why  however  cannot the implicit be made explicit? All Arab nations should clearly accept what so far Egypt alone has accepted  namely  that Israel has a right to exist in peace and security behind stable borders.102.	So the problem has two aspects. It will need courage and imagination on both sides to deal with it. Otherwise there will be no peace in the Middle East— and the Middle East without peace will remain a threat to the peace of the world.103.	The Middle East is only one area of conflict. Other crises in other areas seem to arise with fright¬ening frequency. It is only too apparent that the international machinery developed here in New York to contain and settle conflicts has not been working as it should. The fact is that some Member States  including Australia  have had to go outside the United Nations framework for alternative peace-keeping arrangements. Examples are the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers  in which Australia is a par¬ticipant  and the current international force in Lebanon.104.	In an unusually candid report on the state bf the United Nations  the Secretary-General has this year set out the concerns so many of us feel about the present weaknesses in the Organization. We commend him for doing so. The recent record is dismal. As the Secretary-General has observed  we are perilously near to a new international anarchy.103. The Security Council  the primary organ for the maintenance of international peace and security  finds its resolutions routinely ignored. Those provi¬sions of the Charter dealing with collective action for peace and security have been rendered ineffective. Too often Member States have contrived to avoid bringing particular problems to the Security Council  or to do so too late for the Council to have any effective impact. Distressingly  for many Member States  the Council's writ hardly runs at all. And what applies to the Security Council applies even more in the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations.106. All that  as the Secretary-General has aptly observed  amounts to a crisis in the multilateral approach to resolving world problems  and to a crisis of confidence in the United Nations itself. But we must not be overawed by the problems. Their effects can be moderated if not overcome. The Secretary- General himself has proposed a number of measures which could improve the situation. Some of his propo¬sals  moreover  could be realized immediately. That is the case  for example  with his concern that there should be more systematic use of the Security Council. There is clearly a role for the Secretary-General himself  acting within the terms of Article 99 of the Charter  to bring potentially dangerous situations to the attention of the Security Council. The Council itself should be able to move more promptly into a dispute without  as the Secretary-General says  waiting for those directly involved to bring the dispute to its atten¬tion. The Council and the Secretary-General acting together could do much to defuse smouldering conflicts through  for example  the early dispatch of fact-finding and good offices missions. Such measures could con¬stitute a diplomatic early warning system  designed to identify and isolate disputes before they degenerate into armed conflict.107. The Secretary-General has gone further; he has urged the need for improving the collective security provisions of the Charter provided under Chapter VII. Specifically he has proposed—and Australia supports him—that Member States should use their collective influence to ensure respect for decisions of the Security Council. In an ideal situation Security Council peace¬keeping orders would be backed up by guarantees of collective action  including guarantees by the per¬manent members  to ensure compliance with all deci¬sions of the Council.108. We recognize that these constructive ideas of the Secretary-General will be the subject of intensive scrutiny. They presuppose  as he says  at least a modicum of co-operation among the permanent members. It is the lack of that co-operation in the past which has so often frustrated the work of the Council. But some such evolution along the lines the Secretary-General has outlined is essential if the present drift is to be arrested.109. Not that the recent record has been all bad; we should recall and reflect upon some of the signifi¬cant achievements of the United Nations. One notable example is decolonization. The Organization has made it possible for very many peoples to attain indepen¬dence and thereby make their own contribution to the international community.110. There are today very few situations where non-self-governing peoples have yet to exercise their right of self-determination. Namibia  however  remains on the agenda. The Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization reflects a sense of cautious optimism about Namibia. Let us hope that that optimism is well placed. A peaceful solution to this long-standing problem would clearly be a very great achievement  if such a solution is worked out  it will owe much to the persistent efforts of the contact group and the front-line States. Australia continues to stand ready to contribute an engineering and head¬quarters unit of about 300 men to UNTAG to help oversee and supervise the independence process.111.	Decolonization is not the only area of United Nations success. There have been  and continue to be  considerable achievements in the economic  social and technical fields—so much so perhaps that we sometimes take these achievements for granted. As a clearing-house for ideas and as an instrument for technical assistance and co-operation  the United Nations and its agencies have fulfilled a unique and valuable role.112.	In the North-South area  too  there has been progress  although we have not yet achieved our ultimate goals. Australia shares what I take to be the general sense of disappointment at the failure thus fhr to launch global negotiations. We also share in the concern  so evident at the recent meetings of IMF and World Bank in Toronto  about what thefuture holds. Finding durable solutions to the financial and economic problems besetting the world has never been more urgent.113.	One major issue rightly causing growing con¬cern is the extent of the world's indebtedness. A par¬ticularly disturbing aspect is the concentration in areas with limited ability to service and repay bor¬rowings  the cost of which has in some cases tripled since the time of the original loan.114.	Australia wants a break in the impasse in the North-South dialogue. There is a need to galvanize the kind of political will evident at the Common¬wealth Heads of Government Meeting at Melbourne in September/October 1981  and at the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  at Cancun in October 1981. In both cases it was shown to be possible to break across traditional North- South lines. Australia accepts the North-South frame¬work  and the developing country Group of 77 as a valid negotiating partner. But we also see merit in more flexible and open contacts across North-South lines as a means of bridging differences.115.	The benefits of such an approach were demon¬strated in the recent law of the sea negotiations. It was a remarkable achievement for a Conference of ISO countries to draft and reach consensus on hun¬dreds of articles of new international treaty law. While the Convention on the Law of the Sea perhaps never could have been entirely satisfactory to all parties  it represents a major step forward in the codification of maritime law and in co-operation between nations. This experience shows that we must not relax efforts to tackle the seemingly insoluble as well as the apparently soluble.116.	Among present international economic prob¬lems none concerns the Australian Government more than protectionism and restraints on trade. Australia is acutely aware of the obstacles to progress and of the entrenched national interest and rigidities which have to be overcome. The Australian Government has promoted the concept of collective reduction of protectionism by Governments aimed at providing a stimulus to world trade. The Australian proposal involves a standstill on all trade-distorting assistance measures and  following the standstill  a gradual wind-back of this assistance. We intend to pursue these proposals vigorously at the forthcoming GATT ministerial meeting and afterwards at the sixth session of UNCTAD.117.	What distinguishes the Australian approach is that we are ready to commit ourselves to action along these lines—provided that other comparable countries do likewise. In other words  the Australian Government  having considered the matter  has already taken the decision that  if the other major trading nations were to apply the approach we have outlined  or to attempt something like it  we would immediately join it.118.	It follows from what I have said that this is an area which must be addressed multilateral^ and in which States will inevitably be looking to progressive  balanced global reductions in trade barriers  export subsidies and other trade-distorting measures as a condition of their own participation. It is a further rationale for getting on with global negotiations.119.	Now is not the time for a detailed analysis of the present difficulties in launching global negotia¬tions  but a basis emerged from the Versailles Eco¬nomic Summit. I interpreted the Versailles language to mean: here is an opportunity to launch global negotiations now. If it is rejected  I believe it could be some time before we get another chance. Indeed  if the debate is allowed to drift again into the details of what groups should be constituted here to handle the talks  and thus what the agenda and degree of decentralization should be  this will amount to turning the clock back to a much earlier and more difficult phase in the discussions.120.	As in the North-South so in the humanitarian area the United Nations has an important role to play. Here it can point to a number of significant achievements. In some cases results have been attained only after arduous and lengthy negotiations. This has often obscured the significance of the ultimate result.121.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the two International Covenants on Human Rights provide the world community with a set of standards for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief is a further step along this road. Working through the Commission on Human Rights  ILO and other relevant bodies  the United Nations system has been able significantly to mitigate some of the worst breaches of human rights. Human rights in South Africa and countries such as Poland  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Guatemala have come under increasing scrutiny. Australia will remain active in these important areas.122.	Meanwhile  new areas of humanitarian concern are being considered. We have particularly welcomed the recent emphasis on the protection of indigenous populations. Australia was active in encouraging the establishment by the Economic and Social Council this year of a working group on indigenous populations.123.	Yet another area  regrettably  of increasing concern is the plight of refugees throughout the world. The facts are stark: a world refugee population of at least 8 million to 10 miHion  an increasing number of other displaced persons and movements of peoples within regions in response to pressures of poverty or deprivation. UNHCR has helped to cope with this huge problem; success  however  has been mixed. UNHCR has assisted and continues to assist millions of refugees and displaced persons  but it needs the assurance of a continuing mandate  not a fixed-term mandate  and a vigorous pursuit of durable solutions  especially volun¬tary repatriation. It needs  too  a widened acceptance by the entire international community of the moral obligation to provide at least temporary refuge to those compelled to leave their own countries. Australia proposed a code of conduct embodying this principle of temporary refuge in Geneva two years ago. We shall be pursuing the initiative further in the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner and at a later stage here in the General Assembly itself.124.	For many Governments and ordinary citizens the second special session on disarmament was a disappointment and its results limited. Nevertheless Australia considers that the session did help clear the air. It did establish  if not a meeting of minds  a better understanding of the essential basis of mutual con¬fidence if progress in arms control and disarmament is to be realized. It showed that a better under¬standing leading to an improvement in relations between East and West  essentially between the superpowers  is imperative if there is to be any significant progress in disarmament and  indeed  in other issues of strategic and political concern.123. I conclude by returning to the earlier theme of the role and promise of the United Nations. State¬ments made in this debate already indicate a sense of failure  frustration or disappointment felt by many about the United Nations during the course of the year. While it may be argued that publicly held expectations of progress had been too high  it is undeniable that a serious crisis of pubic confidence now exists about the capacity of the United Nations to carry out some of its most central) responsibilities.126.	Yet we must not turn away from the United Nations in frustration. Each nation must actively look for ways in which to strengthen public faith in the Organization and its potential capacity for negotiation and conciliation. We need less debate  less rhetoric and fewer resolutions; and more constructive effort  more effective action to resolve the major issues  including those of disarmament and development  which face us all. I hope that the Secretary-General's important and courageous comments will help to change the attitude of Member States towards adopting more responsible  more rational and more moderate approaches to the world community's problems. Australia is ready to play its part.127.	We are a growing middle Power. White our historical links are with Europe  we are situated in the South-East Asian and South Pacific region. We are thus a country with interests spanning both the developing and the developed worlds. We see our role as one of exercising a reasoned  responsible and steady influence in the world community. We have a strong and abiding belief in the essential validity of the United Nations. The Secretary-General can count on Australia's support."
"8",365,"AUT",37,1982,"81.	It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I extend to the President of the General Assembly the congratulations of Austria on his election. We welcome him as the representative of a country with which we enjoy close neighborly human  cultural and historical ties. Our two countries have demonstrated to the world in a clear and tangible manner that friendship and mutual tolerance can transcend ideological and political boundaries.82.	His rich political and diplomatic experience  long involvement with the work of the United Nations and well-known commitment to dialogue and compromise assure us that the General Assembly will be guided in an objective and constructive manner.83.	We should also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who presided over the General Assembly with particular tact and skill under most trying circumstances.84.	I further wish to seize this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring work in his high office during a year fraught with tension  crises and conflicts. We are very grateful for his official visit to our country and for his support of Vienna's status as one of the three main United Nations centers. We sincerely admire the courage and frankness with which he has analyzed  in his first report on the work of the Organization  the state of the world and of the United Nations. We agree completely with his conclusion that we are perilously near to a new international anarchy .85.	The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been convened against the background of severe crises in international relations. Rarely before has world peace been threatened from so many sides. The conflicts in the Middle East  the continuing armed interventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  the crises in Central America and in various parts of Africa  the Falklands and the situation in Poland are only a few examples. The confrontation between East and West continues  the disarmament process and the North-South dialogue are stagnating  human rights violations and acts of terror proliferate and every new day brings more bloodshed and human suffering.86.	How can we break this vicious circle of violence and destruction? Are we really condemned to impotence  passivity and frustration?87.	The difficulty with the present situation lies in the fact that we are faced with three closely related global phenomena: a world political crisis  a world economic crisis and a crisis of international organizations.88.	Today more and more voices speak of the'' irrelevance of the United Nations. They denounce the Organization's inability to live up to its mandate. The public continues to judge the United Nations by its capacity to produce solutions to major conflicts. Too often they overlook the fruitful work done by the United Nations and the specialized agencies in all fields of international co-operation. All important world political issues can be discussed at the United Nations. The United Nations provides the framework for dealing with all major problems of mankind. Furthermore  for smaller States not protected by alliances and dependent upon their own resources for their security  the United Nations  despite all imperfections  remains the only global forum where they can seek and hope to find the support of the international community for their legitimate concerns.89.	The United Nations is no more than the collective will of its Members. It is far from being a world Government. Therefore we must not be more critical of international organizations than we are of States. The responsibility for a solution to the three-fold global crisis lays not so much with international organizations as with each individual State. Finally  political morality must also play a role in world politics. One of the most important missions of the United Nations is to uphold ideas and principles  even when so-called realities stand in their way. We therefore firmly support all efforts to strengthen the authority of the United Nations and that of the Secretary-General  the Security Council and the General Assembly.90.	The Secretary-General can count on the full support of Austria in the implementation of his proposals  in particular those concerning the preventive intervention of the Security Council in the early stages of international crises and a more forthright role for the Secretary-General. We also support his suggestions regarding the strengthening of peace-keeping operations. As a country with traditional ties to the United Nations peace-keeping systemómore than 15 000 Austrian soldiers have so far served with the United Nations peace-keeping forcesówe have a vital interest in this area.91.	We feel that all the considerations submitted to us by the Secretary-General are of great importance and crucial to the future of the Organization. They should receive high priority and be pursued further  perhaps by a working group. Austria would be very happy to participate in any such endeavor.92.	The maintenance of peace is one of the major aims of our foreign policy. As President Kirchschlager has repeatedly emphasized  peace begins at home. Democracy and tolerance  human rights and social justice  conciliation and renunciation of the use of force are the principles that must be implemented to guarantee domestic peace. The Austrian Federal Government's political program is based on these principles.93.	Peace at home is the prerequisite for peace among neighbors. At a time when international tension is increasing  Austria attributes particular importance to a good-neighbor policy to improve and deepen relations with its neighbors irrespective of their social' and political systems. We hope therefore to contribute also to security and stability in Europe and in the world. Our good-neighborly relations with Switzerland  Liechtenstein  Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany  which are all committed to a pluralistic and democratic system  as well as with Yugoslavia and Hungary  have developed along very positive lines. As a result of pragmatic efforts on both sides  there is now also reason to hope for continuous improvement in our relations with Czechoslovakia  which in 1981 were overshadowed by a number of problems.94.	With regard to Italy  our policy of establishing good-neighborly relations with all countries has been actively supported by the United Nation. General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) of 31 October 1960 and 1661 (XVI) of 28 November 1961 on the question of South Tyrol brought about negotiations which in 1969 led to a new framework of autonomy for South Tyrol.95.	Since that time South Tyrol has undoubtedly obtained a significant amount of autonomy. Nevertheless certain problems remain unresolved. Some of these are of particular significance for the preservation of the South Tyrolean ethnic group; in particular  the language question and the autonomous section in Bozen of the Administrative Court. Last year Prime Minister Spadolini gave assurances that have not yet been carried out. The Austrian Federal Government wishes to express its firm expectation that the measures already agreed upon in 1969 and not yet implemented will be carried out as early as possible and in close consultation with the South Tyroleans. We do so in view of the quality of Austro-Italian relations  the positive outcome of my talks with Foreign Minister Colombo on 27 July of this year in Venice and the latest statement of the Italian Government  which has declared its determination to seek solutions acceptable to the ethnic minorities and to bring the entire matter to an early conclusion. We hope that this will not remain a dead letter and that a settlement will be achieved in the very near future. We cannot ignore the fact that such a settlement has also become urgent considering the increasing anxiety among the South Tyrolean population.96.	Good-neighborly relations are essential  but they are not enough. We must see the world as a whole. Austria is therefore making every effort to restore the policy which has been described by the term detente and was so beneficial to Austria  Europe and the world. Of course  when we speak of detente we do not mean a policy of appeasement but rather continuous efforts to achieve a modus vivendi for coexistence and co-operation.97.	In this connection the success of the Madrid follow-up conference to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe would be of great importance. Austria  together with other neutral and non- aligned countries of Europe  has submitted a substantial and balanced draft final document which provides inter alia for the convening of a conference on confidence-building and security-building measures in Europe. We believe that a positive result in Madrid on the basis of these proposals would be in the interest not only of detente in general but also of Poland  whose people have suffered such deplorable set-backs in their development as a result of the imposition of martial law. Austria understands the difficulty of Poland's problems today. Together we must find a way to revive Poland's economy. Federal Chancellor Kreisky has expressed ideas for comprehensive action by East and West to help Poland overcome its enormous economic difficulties.98.	Efforts to achieve detente cannot and must not be limited to one continent  detente must be universal. In the age of interdependence and given the global dimensions of international politics  Austria cannot and does not want to content itself with the role of a mere observer of world events. Every country's security depends on the security of others. Security cannot be achieved against one another but only with one another.99.	Austria's position on the Middle East question is well known and has been repeatedly presented in detail before the Assembly. We continue to believe that the core of the problem is a just settlement of the Palestinian question We see some encouraging signs: the joint declaration of the Arab States in Fez based on the concept of mutual recognition; the statement of President Reagan of the United States; and the growing perception that the Palestinian question demands a just settlement which respects the rights and interests of both sides. Austria welcomes the United States President's initiative as an historic move. It also recognizes the importance of the results of the Fez Summit Conference and Mr. Brezhnev's statement of 15 September 1982. We hope that a negotiating process will now be initiated and will finally lead to a balanced and lasting solution.100.	Austria has followed the tragic events in Lebanon with great concern. We deeply regret and condemn the use of force  which has claimed thousands of human lives. We have strongly condemned the continuing Israeli invasion of Lebanon  which is causing inconceivable suffering among the civilian population and giving rise to new misery and new streams of refugees. Another proof of the indiscriminate nature of the attacks of the Israeli army in Lebanon is the shelling of the Austrian Embassy  which is located outside military target zones.100. Austria learned with horror and consternation of the recent massacres of Palestinian men  women and children in the area of Beirut. We are deeply shocked by these atrocities. At the seventh emergency special session on Palestine. Austria had an opportunity to condemn this crime. Nevertheless  I would like to stress once again the necessity and the responsibility of the United Nations to ensure a Ml investigation and clarification of these criminal acts. In a letter addressed to the President of the Security Council on 21 September  proposed on behalf of the Austrian Government the establishment of an impartial and objective investigation commission. We expect that this proposal  which in the meantime has found general support in the General Assembly in the adoption of resolution ES-7/9  will be implemented as early as possible.101.	Austria feels strong solidarity with Lebanon and its severely tried people. The withdrawal of all foreign troops and the restoration of the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country is an absolute necessity. We hope that national reconciliation will be achieved in Lebanon  which will make possible the reconstruction of that war-torn country. We will contribute as much as we can to the attainment of this goal.102.	Austria continues to be concerned about the fate of the Cambodian people  which has suffered both tremendous human rights violations and foreign intervention. As President of the International Conference on Kampuchea  I feel a special responsibility in this regard. I had the opportunity to talk with the parties involved in the conflict and to obtain a first-hand picture of the present situation in Cambodia. I see the initiation of a dialogue between Viet Nam and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations as a positive development. I have always been convinced that the Cambodian problem can be solved only by a dialogue involving all parties. Dialogue is important  but tangible results must follow. The International Conference on Kampuchea has created the framework for a comprehensive political settlement. The Declaration and resolution of the Conference should be viewed as a package incorporating two key elements: the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia and a guaranteed the Cambodian people's right to self-determination. This implies the possibility freely to elect a Government. Therefore  no faction should receive any advantage in those elections or be placed at any disadvantage  and all outside influences must definitely be excluded. Internationally controlled elections alone must determine the composition of the future Government. This should be the basis for the reconstruction of a free and independent Cambodia  free from outside intervention from any side and assured of its place in a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. I appeal to all parties involved to make every effort to support the goals of the International Conference on Kampuchea in order to build a better future for this long-suffering country.103.	Apart from all the political problems of Cambodia  there is another issue of particular concern: the gradual decay of the latest temple city in the world  Angkor Wat. The present political situation must not prevent urgently needed international rescue measures. The splendid structures of Angkor Wat are part of the common heritage of mankind. New ways must be found to rescue them. Granting UNESCO the right to intervene to save endangered cultural monuments would be an appropriate approach. UNESCO's role in protecting the cultural heritage of mankind could be similar to that of the Red Cress in the area of humanitarian protection.104.	Austria remains convinced that the world economic crisis  which particularly affects the developing countries  can be overcome only by a major cooperative effort by industrial and raw-material- producing States to alleviate poverty in the third world. I am referring here to the proposal wade by Federal Chancellor Kreisky at the International Meeting on Co-operation aid Development  held in October 198i in Cancun. As one of the initiators of that meeting  we hope that agreement can soon be reached to revive the North-South dialogue.105.	Our commitment to human rights needs no reiteration. The figures creak for themselves. In 1981 alone 35 000 refugees came to Austria. This year  1982  our expenditures on assistance to refugees are expected to amount to about $100 million. On behalf of the Austrian Federal Government  I should like to thank sincerely those countries which have helped by offering a new home to many of these refugees. Austria will continue to care for people seeking assistance in desperation. Despite economic difficulties  we consider it a moral obligation  an essential element of our humanitarian policy  to continue to offer a haven of freedom and a source of hope.106. Disarmament is a topic of the greatest interest to the Austrian public and to me personally. Austria  which is constitutionally committed to permanent neutrality  cannot remain indifferent in the face of the accelerating arms race between East and West and in the third world. In 1981 alone military expenditures totaled $600 billion to $650 billion. And there is a trend towards these expenditures continuing to increase in the future. We are deeply convinced that this tendency has to be reversed and that the vicious circle of mistrust and arms build-up must be broken our goal must be common security  as stated in the Palme report:^ International security must rest on a commitment to joint survival rather than on a threat of mutual destruction.107. If we agree that military strength is no way to guarantee genuine and lasting security  the alternative can only be closer international co-operation. Cooperation creates confidence and mutual dependence  and both  in turn  strengthen security. Developments in Western Europe since the Second World War are proof of that fact. Traditional enemies have been brought together into a comprehensive system of cooperation which transcends the economic sphere and creates manifold ties between peoples. As a consequence of Western European co-operation  shaped around institutions such as the European Community and the Council of Europe  war among these nations has become inconceivable today.108.	The Final Act of Helsinki constitutes a new basis for co-operation and peaceful coexistence. The historical experience of one continent is not necessarily transferable to others  but I am convinced that the methods and instruments of co-operation developed in Europe could serve as models for other regions also.109.	Another threatening feature of the present arms race is the fact that it is no longer confined to earth alone; it is increasingly being carried into outer space. During the last decade more than 1 700 military satellites have been put into orbit. At least three quarters of all the satellites in space are being used for military purposes. In view of the growing concern of the international community  the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space UNISPACE 82  which took place under my chairmanship in Vienna in August  recommended that the General Assembly and the Committee on Disarmament give high priority to measures for the prevention of an arms race in space.110. I appeal to all States to conclude agreements aimed at banning all weapons from outer space. I have already presented Austria's position on all major aspects of this vital issue at the twelfth special session  the second special session on disarmament. Today I wish to emphasize just one point which  in our view  can be of great significance for the reduction of mistrust  namely  the development of internationally recognized mechanisms for the objective establishment and evaluation of the state of armaments at the regional  interregional and global levels. Austria has submitted a memorandum on this matter to all Member States. I should like to ask delegations to work with us on the further development and elaboration of this proposal.111.	Let us be frank: the second special session on disarmament was a failure. We note this with great disappointment. However  the dangerous world situation  the commitment to the survival of all and the increased awareness of world public opinion force us to continue our efforts to achieve disarmament as a matter of absolute priority. The goal of these efforts must remain a genuine balance at the lowest level  taking into account all weapon systems and regions. In this connection we welcome the resumption of the Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces and strategic arms reductions.112.	World crisis  the absence of peace and justice and the progressive militarization of international relations are the breeding ground for new violence and terrorism. Terrorism  which we condemn most firmly and for which there is no justification  must be repressed but it must also be prevented. We must strike at the roots of terrorism wherever human rights are constantly violated  wherever social injustice is perpetuated and wherever political convictions cannot be expressed in a democratic manner  the seeds of violence will grow. Violence breeds violence and injustice breeds injustice.113.	What can we do to prevent it? Every citizen and every Government in the world bears direct responsibility for peace at home and abroad. Our good example is the prerequisite for peaceful coexistence between individuals and peoples and for fruitful cooperation. It is only through co-operation that we shall be able to meet the great challenges of our time: peace  disarmament  respect for human rights  development  social justice and the elimination of violence and terrorism. We welcome all activities  and particularly those of the peace movements which aim to translate into reality the principles and goals of the Charter.114.	Pope John Paul II in his address at the 17th meeting of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly said:  I would like to express the wish that  in view of its universal character  the United Nations will never cease to be the forum  the high tribune  from which all man's problems are appraised in trust and justice.  In the spirit of that statement  I should like to express my earnest hope that the United Nations  to which there is no alternative  will play an ever more important role in achieving a just and lasting system of world peace."
"9",436,"BDI",37,1982,"Allow me first of all to add the congratulations of the delegation of Burundi to those already addressed to Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. The Assembly's decision to make him its President is a reflection of the respect and esteem which his country  Hungary  and he himself enjoy within the international community. His experience  competence and efficiency  as evidenced by his diplomatic career  have enabled him from the outset to give the work of this session a momentum that promises results in line with the hopes of the nations represented here. It is our firm conviction that he will manage to give our work the energy demanded by the seriousness and complexity of the questions being studied. We are all the more convinced of this as he will be assisted by a General Committee whose competence and devotion we fully appreciate. I must also congratulate Mr. Hollai's predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the outstanding work he did during the last session of the General Assembly. May I also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the effective manner in which he has carried out his lofty duties since his election. He has spared no effort to restore international peace and security wherever they have been threatened in the world.The international community is going through a period of crisis of disturbing proportions. The peoples of the world  particularly those who are economically the weakest  are rightly turning once more their anguished gaze towards the Organization  which is the special preferred and most appropriate forum for a promising dialogue among Member States. It is here that a new order-more just  more equitable and more human-is taking shape.Our present discussions will once again make it possible to study the international political and economic situation  and to evaluate the depth of the current crisis in international relations. But these -debates will not yield fruit as long as the decisions taken by the General Assembly are ignored and trampled on by some States Members of the United Nations  and as long as others want to paralyse the action of the Organization by subordinating that action to their own selfish interests.The political problems affecting South Africa  the Middle East and other regions of the world cannot be solved if there is lack of respect for the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and deliberate contempt for the obligations incumbent upon Member States under the Charter of the United Nations.Indeed  in South Africa the vile Pretoria regime has established apartheid as an institution  a system of colonial and racist oppression and exploitation that the Assembly has justly described as a crime against humanity. Pretoria's power and prosperity is being built on the denial of the most elementary rights of the black population  on contempt for them  and on their relegation to a social limbo.For many years the United Nations has continually demanded respect for the right of the black people of South Africa to freedom and dignity. Today  it is less a question of exposing the ignominious crime of apartheid than of stressing the urgency of finding a just and definitive solution to that problem.The international community must hope that  in order to react against the policy of apartheid practiced by the Pretoria regime in South Africa  the Security Council will use the powers given to it by the Charter to put an end to that odious crime. With the exception of an arms embargo decided upon in Security Council resolution 421 (1977)  which continues to be violated in a concealed fashion  the Security Council has remained paralysed by the use of the right of veto by some of its permanent members each time the situation in South Africa demands recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter.The Security Council's inaction in the matter strengthens Pretoria in its policy of oppression against the black population and in its aggressiveness against neighbouring countries. It is clear that the apartheid regime could not daily defy the injunctions of the international community calling for an end to its policy of apartheid without the political  military  economic and financial support of its allies.Faced with the gravity of the situation in South Africa  the struggle of the national liberation movements finds itself doubly legitimized by the nobility of their cause and the extent of their sacrifices. We today reaffirm our Government's constant support for them.A/37/PV.33A situation which is just as anachronistic prevails in Namibia: the racist and colonialist regime in Pretoria has become enriched in an illegal occupation by depriving the Namibian people of their right to determine their own destiny. Each passing year unfortunately adds to the long list of missed appointments and postponed deadlines for the independence of Namibia.When the International Court of Justice decided that South Africa's occupation of Namibia was illegal  and when in its turn the international community recognized the struggle of the people of that Territory  the dimensions of the Namibian question became clear. It was purely and simply a problem of decolonization. It was therefore incumbent upon the United Nations  as in similar cases  to do what it could to enable the inhabitants of the Territory to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. The United Nations has exercised that right consistently and constantly. It will not agree to the Namibian question so being distorted as to become a conflict on grounds and for reasons completely alien to the interests of the Namibian people.Allow me  therefore  to repeat my Government's consistent position on the Namibian question. We continue to believe that it is indeed a question of decolonization  falling completely and solely under the responsibility of the United Nations. The decolonization planned for Namibia  as endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  must be carried out fully. To that end  we urgently appeal to the five Western States  members of the contact group  to do everything in their power to persuade Pretoria to stop its specious dilatory tactics aimed at delaying implementation of the United Nations plan for the decolonization of Namibia.We also reject all parallelism intended to link South Africa's withdrawal from Namibia to that of the Cuban forces from Angola. Our view on this is based on our conviction that such linkage not only confuses two fundamentally different questions but also entails involvement in Angola's internal affairs. Indeed  we think it is for Angola alone to adopt  in complete sovereignty  the measures it deems most appropriate to ensure its own security as long as it considers that security to be threatened.We further believe that Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia ' enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia  must be strictly observed. We therefore ask those who are either directly or covertly involved in the exploitation of Namibian resources  regardless of their nature or origin  to cease their scandalous pillaging. We repeat our firm and constant support for the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.Moreover  we hereby reiterate Burundi's solidarity and support for the front-line States  in particular our brothers  the peoples of Angola and Mozambique  who are the targets and the victims of acts of aggression and sabotage by the	regime. The question of the Western Sahara remains a burning issue  to the extent that no step seems to have been taken since the adoption by the Assembly of its resolution 36/46. None the less we keep our faith in the capacity of the Organization of African Unity to resolve  in collaboration with the United Nations  the problem of Western Sahara  while respecting the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination and independence.The unparalleled frequency with which the United Nations considered the question of Palestine this year is a clear demonstration of the serious concern with which the United Nations views Israel's unacceptable policy of illegal occupation of Arab territories and its continued aggression against its neighbours. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon  causing death and destruction  the recent massacres of Palestinian refugees in the Shatila and Sabra camps in west Beirut have  alas  only confirmed the concerns expressed for almost three decades now. Those sinister events were added to the sufferings of a people already dispersed  a people whom Israel refuses not only the right to a homeland but even the right to an identity. The General Assembly has often asked Israel to withdraw completely and unconditionally from all Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. Israel has responded by annexing the Golan Heights  by imposing its own civilian administration on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and establishing settlements  and  finally  by the invasion of Lebanon and the savage bombardment of Beirut.It is not through violence  or the violation of United Nations resolutions that Israel will ensure its own security. On the contrary its security will be safeguarded and strengthened only when it recognizes the Palestinian people's right to existence  self-determination and a homeland in its own territory  in keeping with the relevant decisions of the United Nations.Today we renew the support of the Government of Burundi for the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization its sole and unique legitimate representative.Our conception of international relations follows a constant principle which rejects colonialism  racism  domination  aggression and the acquisition of territories by force. We have always held that it is up to each people  to each country  regardless of its size and economic potential  to define its own policies in complete sovereignty  free from any foreign interference and according to the priorities which those peoples and countries have chosen for themselves.The solution of the current disputes in Central America  South-East Asia  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus and elsewhere  must be guided  in our view  by the principles I have indicated. They demand a political solution. Recourse to force in international relations deprives the peoples involved of their right to choose the political system which best responds to their aspirations.Another deplorable situation is also of concern to the delegation of Burundi. I refer to the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In spite of the mediation efforts made by representatives of the non-aligned countries-to whom we pay a tribute-the war between those two countries continues. Burundi urgently appeals to the two belligerents to heed the voice of reason and bring the destruction to an end in order to promote true peace.The Government of Burundi has already expressed its views on the Korean question. That question  too  demands apolitical solution. The withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea is a prerequisite which would establish a climate of confidence conducive to negotiations between the two parties. We  for our part  will continue to support any effort aimed at achieving the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas.Four months ago we met in this very Hall to talk about disarmament. That debate  which began four years earlier  was necessary to the extent that it was becoming more and more apparent that the arms race was threatening to establish nuclear terror and to sow insecurity in the minds of nations. Is it not paradoxical  to say the least  that  at a time when a large part of mankind is bogged down in the most absolute poverty and people are dying by the thousands of sickness and hunger  the human and material resources that ought to have served to feed those people  to care for them and to educate them should be absorbed in the suicidal undertaking of the unbridled arms race?One of the tasks of the General Assembly at the twelfth special session and the second special session devoted to disarmament was to start considering seriously again the devotion of our collective efforts to limiting the arms race. At that session the Assembly was to have considered ways and means of beginning to implement the Programme of Action contained in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly. So it is not at all necessary to reformulate the principles and priorities that were agreed upon in 1978  much less to question them. It is time for the nuclear Powers to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue on the reduction of the nuclear weapons in their respective arsenals. This is a question of the security and  indeed  the survival of the planet. We also think it would be sterile for the super-Powers to limit themselves to a debate in which each one would absolve itself from guilt in the eyes of the world public by attributing all the blame to the other.The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea finished its work on 30 Apr' of this year by adopting the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The participants in that Conference succeeded after nine years of hard work and sustained efforts in reconciling positions and interests which at the outset were claimed to be irreconcilable. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will go down in the annals of history not only because of the complexity of the matters which it had to codify  the divergence of the interests involved or the time it lasted  but also and above all because it will prove to future generations that with a minimum of political will and good faith nations can  while respecting the essential interests of all concerned  solve the problems they face So the benefit of the international community as a whole  regardless of the scope and acuteness of those problems.The results of that Conference will prove  furthermore  that the United Nations remains the best framework for the North-South dialogue. Similarly  we believe in the viability and possible outcome of the global negotiations. It is our hope that those that for one reason or another were unable last April to agree to the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea will realize the advantages offered to them by that Convention and rejoin the rest of the international community so that together we can make the concept of the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor as the common heritage of mankind a reality of the future. In parallel with the international political situation which I have just described  a world economy is developing in a way that is of no less concern  in particular with regard to the developing countries. Unemployment  recession  inflation  the colossal debt of the developing countries  the disruption of the economies of the least developed countries  the reduction of official development assistance  the return to protectionism  the problems with United Nations funds which channelled the fruits of international solidarity to the least developed countries  the precipitous fall in raw material prices  which constitute the essential source of revenue for the developing countries-this is the not very comforting picture of the world economy. That picture is especially painful because it seems to combine with the present economic malaise actions which are even more disruptive and ineffective and which  if continued  would merely strengthen the current state of affairs. Whereas the present economic disorder affects international relations and requires a global approach  some persons seem to be proposing as remedies for the situation the return to selfish national interests and the strengthening of international financial and monetary mechanisms  the inability of which to meet the global needs of the international community has become clear. The role of the United Nations in the formulation of this global approach to the solution of the economic problems of our time is a primary one  although some seem to wish  for various reasons  to block its efforts in this matter. None the less  the Member States  by unanimously adopting General Assembly resolution 34/138  committed themselves to global negotiations in order to establish a new international economic order. The global negotiations have not been begun precisely because there is a suspicion that they would in the long run challenge the lack of equality in international economic relations. But the opposition to those negotiations cannot continue indefinitely because the present state of the world economy makes the launching and conclusion of the global negotiations an overriding necessity. It is equally clear that the settlement of the present economic crisis demands more determined solidarity on the part of the international community. Recent events have shown that the bankruptcy of the developing countries  whatever the level of their development  could  if we do not act in time  lead to the bankruptcy of the international economic and financial system. The time is past when some thought they could build their wealth on the growing impoverishment of others. The economic interdependence of nations is now a reality.The economic crisis affects the whole world. Nevertheless  there is a category of countries for which the present crisis is most bitter. I refer to the least developed countries. Whereas in the developed countries the crisis affects the customary well-being of the population  in the least developed countries it involves the loss of the essential minimum. In the former countries the crisis makes life less comfortable; in the latter it makes life simply impossible. We are particularly disturbed by the trend towards the reduction of official development assistance and the problems concerning the funds of United Nations bodies  such as UNDP  in which the least developed countries have placed such great hopes for a better future. Voluntary contributions to UNDP funds have made it a vital and effective instrument for development in the developing countries and the suspension of such contributions would block the development of the economies of the least developed countries. The wealthy countries must not allow themselves to become indifferent to the desperate situation of the least developed countries. It was envisaged that in the Third United Nations Development Decade special efforts would be made to enable the least developed countries finally to escape from their past and present stagnation and future prospects.The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in 1981  laid the foundations for the co-ordination of international assistance to the least privileged countries. And so today we launch an appeal to the entire international community to ensure that the spirit of solidarity and generosity that inspired the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted at the end of the Paris Conference is finally given practical effect.The economic difficulties faced today by the developing countries have prompted them to explore new methods of co-operation which can best take account of their own limitations and also enable them the speed up their own economic growth and improve position in the system of international economic relations. It is to this concern that the Programmes of Action of Amsha  Mexico  Buenos Aires and Caracas respond with a view to establishing a system of collective autonomy. The Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa which was adopted at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the CAU also responded to that necessity.It is through strengthening the regional and sub- regional economic groupings that we will achieve the collective autonomy envisaged in the different programmes of action mentioned. It is to this end that  in collaboration with our partners  we intend to strengthen the various types of co-operation whit the sub- regional and regional groupings  of which Burundi is a part.The analysis of the international political and economic situation which I have just presented to the Assembly is based on the principles which guideour foreign policy  namely  international co-operation with reciprocal respect among partners  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  good neighbourliness  positive non-alignment and support for national liberation movements.Sometimes justified criticisms of the United Nations have been made. But these present shortcomings should not make us lose our faith and be discouraged. International peace and security  whose guarantor the Organization is  demand that we concentrate our efforts on strengthening the United Nations through a progressive adaptation to the realities and requirements of our time. As the Secretary-General aptly pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization: ""The will to use the machinery of the Charter needs to be consciously strengthened  and all Governments must try to look beyond short-term national interests to the great possibilities of a more stable system of collective international security  as well as to the very great perils of failing to develop such a system."" My delegation's view is that this analysis is relevant. The dearest wish of the people and the Government of Burundi is to see the progressive establishment in international relations of a new world order where there is peace and justice  collective economic security  and co-operation with due respect for the right of nations to determine their own future and to choose freely their path of development in keeping with the aspirations of their peoples. May the United Nations be the cradle where this hope is nurtured."
"10",483,"BEL",37,1982,"Mr. President  like my colleagues who preceded me on this rostrum  1 should like  on behalf of my Government and of myself  to convey to you our most warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the present session of the General Assembly. Your dedication to the multilateral ap¬proach to international relations  to the authority and prestige of global and regional intergovernmental institutions and to the unique role of the United Nations constitutes the best guarantee that this session will take place in a most propitious atmosphere. May I convey to you my good wishes for the success of your endeavors and assure you of the full co-operation of my Government and myself.232.	The efficiency of your actions may be much enhanced by the fact that they take place within an exceptional framework: that of the report sub¬mitted to us by the Secretary-General to guide us in our work. Mr. Secretary-General  the Belgian Govern¬ment has in the past conveyed to you the importance it attaches to the fact that you have been called upon to assume these high functions. It told you that Belgium was ready to assist you to the best of its ability in the difficult but vital task that you were assuming. Today  the Belgian Government is familiar with your report on the work of the Organization  which I would not hesitate to term a milestone for the Organization. It has come at the right moment. It reflects the uneasiness created by the growing tendency to seek solutions to crises outside the framework of the United Nations and the inability of the Organization to have its decisions implemented. We must thank you for having put on the agenda the central problem of the Organization  that is  its ""capacity to keep the peace and to serve as a forum for negotiations.... its evident difficulties in doing so  difficulties related to conflicts between national aims and Charter goals and to the current tendency to resort to confrontation  violence and even war in pursuit of what are perceived as vital interests  claims or aspirations"". I can tell you  Sir  that from the outset my country can sub¬scribe to every statement contained in your report.233.	Belonging to the generation which spent its youth during the tragedy of the Second World War  I am among those who  37 years ago  enthusiastically greeted the birth of the Organization. At the end of the nightmare during which humanity suffered every possible anguish to an extent previously unequalled  States—from the largest to the smallest  from the strongest to the weakest  from the wealthiest to the most deprived  belonging to different systems— pledged to work together to free mankind from all the horrors it had just experienced  to free it from war and genocide  to free it from torture and hunger  to free it from discrimination  to free it even from the fear of all those horrors.234.	However  at a time when the shortcomings of the Organizations are being denounced  it seems important to me to recall its positive aspects. The work that it has accomplished is considerable. One could recall the part that the United Nations has played in decolonization. But I could also refer to its action on behalf of economic development of the so-called ""new countries""  the efforts it has made in the field of control  limitation and reduction of armaments as well as in nuclear non-proliferation and its initiatives to assure better understanding among nations or between groups of States from East to West and from North to South. Under its flag  the ""blue helmets"" have tried to come between hostile forces and to prevent the escalation of conflicts. Despite the dif¬ficulties they have encountered  their importance and the unique character of their role have not changed.235.	None the less  the essential goal that the sig¬natory States set for themselves at San Francisco and to which those that joined later adhered has still not been attained. I ask myself why it is that  despite its important partial successes  the United Nations has not fulfilled the hope its founders placed in it. For my compatriots  for the Government 1 represent and for me personally  this Organization is and remains the most courageous and generous attempt  and the only adequate one that has been launched since the dis¬appearance of the League of Nations  to assure the world of a modicum of order  understanding and co¬operation  without which it would not be able to survive.236.	Moreover  I share the hope expressed by the Secretary-General when he states that ""we now have potentially better means to solve many of the major problems facing humanity than ever before"". Nevertheless  we find that not enough use is being made of these means. The fundamental problem does not lie in the functioning of the institutions of the Organization  nor does it lie in the application of one or another Article of the Charter or in the work methods of its organs or the actions of the Secretary- General. No—the fundamental problem rests with us  the Member States. We have too often let ourselves be swamped by immediate problems and taken advantage of by interests which are often purely national in character.237.	We have forgotten that the Organization was not created by us in order to perpetuate in a new institution the habits and practices which had led to the failure of the former one. We nave forgotten the fact that we did not create it in order to have it serve as a forum for our diplomatic games  for the defense of our own interests  or for the confrontation of our rivalries.238.	What is worse  we have forgotten that we created the Organization for mankind  not for those of the East or the West  not for those of the North or the South  but regardless of frontiers  for all mankind.239.	Mankind is today the victim of three types of scourges  which unfortunately are often combined. The first is war  or the threat of war  including civil war  which has become increasingly cruel and deadly through the ever-greater sophistication  multiplication and wider commercial distribution of armaments. Then there are poverty and hunger  which are  to be sure  characteristics of underdevelopment  but which—let us not delude ourselves—are not the exclusive domain of those countries which we call the poor countries. Finally  there is oppression and the violation of the most elementary human rights.240.	The existence of these three types of scourges seems to me to call for the establishment of three orders of priority  which incidentally are interde¬pendent. The first order of priority seems to me to include essentially the following: first  the solution of so-called ""local"" conflicts  which are so numerous and on such a scale that they are turning our planet into a planet at war  together with an effort to end the civil strife which is tearing so many of our countries apart; secondly  an increased effort in the limitation  control and reduction of all kinds of arms and of the arms trade; thirdly  the prevention of international confrontations.241.	The second order of priority is aimed at developing between our States the mutual aid and co-operation which alone can provide a stable basis for international understanding and peace. We must act vigorously to reopen the North-South dialogue in order to establish among ourselves efficient interna¬tional co-operation which will ensure for all the fruits of economic development. We must improve and adapt our programmes of action and of economic development in the light of the critical evolution of the world economic situation. We must also fight poverty  wherever it is rampant. We must concern our Iives not only with those who are the poorest in the poorest countries but also with those who  in each of our Spates  do not have access to the benefits of society  to schooling  to participation in the production process  health benefits and housing  who have been described as the ""fourth world"".242.	The third order of priority has the following aims: first of all  scrupulous respect by each of our States for the Universal Declaration of Human Right; then  the acceptance and the implementation by the same States of all of the rights generally accepted as indispensable for the political  moral  cultural  social and economic fulfillment of human beings—I have in mind here  inter alia  the freedoms and rights of trade unions—and lastly  there must be resolute co-operation among all countries against terrorism  whose blind violence threatens all people.243.	The definition and the implementation of these tasks have to take place in the context of a determined effort to ensure respect for the Charter and to allow the machinery of the Organization to function as it should. Only this type of effort will allow us to achieve that the Secretary-General has assigned to us as the most urgent aim: the return to the principle of collective action for peace and security which is enshrined in the Charter  so as to make the United Nations better equipped to carry out its essential task. I wish to state this forcefully  because I  too  believe that without an efficient collective security system  the small and the weak will have no secure means of defense or protection.244.	In the light of these considerations should like to deal with a few aspects of the international situa-tion. In view of the remarkable statement made at the 8th meeting by our colleague  Mr. Elleman-Jensen  the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs  on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community  I need deal only briefly with four questions. The first one  based on the specific proposals advanced by the Secretary-General  concerns the functioning of the Organization. The three others relate to the essential aim of combining our efforts to defend man and his dignity. I shall address myself to questions of disarma¬ment  the promotion of the North-South dialogue and the global negotiations  and the monitoring of respect for human rights.245.	With respect first of all to the universal task of the United Nations and the active role it must play in the Held of peaceful settlement of disputes  it seems to me highly desirable that the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations be con¬sidered. That decision would be likely to promote a dialogue directed to a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. There was  moreover  a proposal made to that effect in January 1982 by the President of the Republic of Korea  which could constitute an adequate and equitable basis for discussion.246.	The question of the functioning of the Security Council deserves our full attention also. You  Mr. Secretary-General  in your sombre but accurate analysis of the present evolution of the international situation particularly emphasized the main obstacles to the activities of the Organization anxious to redress this situation  you informed us of the steps you intend to take and of the remedies you would like to see applied. I support those proposals. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on the constructive role you wish to play  which is fully in accordance With the Charter. Indeed  Article 99 of the Charter provides that the Secretary-General ""may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security"".247.	I also believe that reactivation of the preventive role entrusted to the Security Council by the Charter  together with the prerogatives of the Secretary- General  constitute the most appropriate measure to ensure that increase in tension in certain parts of die world does not lead to confrontation  violence  or even war. The initiative that the Security Council should take  by virtue of its preventive role under the Charter  presupposes  however that it would be informed in time about the development of the interna¬tional situation and that  in particular  its attention would be drawn to the real dangers that the existence of certain sources of tension in the world might lead to.248.	The Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  under the chairmanship of Olaf Palme  has produced a report which is excellent. This report proposes that you  Mr. Secretary- General  be entrusted with the task of presenting periodically a concise report on the evolution of the international situation with the precise aim of indicating what action should be taken to ensure that dissension among nations does not lead to violent confrontations. I subscribe to this proposal which moreover  meets the purposes of the Organization without requiring any amendment of the Charter.249.	I should like to stress in that respect the essential role which is vested in the regional organizations. They are in a better position to appraise and to judge the level of tension or possible discord which exists in their regions. If such be the case  they can help you in preparing your informational report and advise you on the nature of the actions that may be con¬sidered and of the measures that may be proposed to the Security Council.250.	Thus it becomes clear that the right to take preventive action should be considered as a duty the better to serve the objectives of the Organization.251.	The problems that confront human society today are numerous. Several are of such a scope that solutions can only be found on a global scale. Thus a heavy responsibility rests on the shoulders of all of the Members of the Organization  and particularly on the great Powers which have special authority in the Security Council. From their consensus and their sincere understanding with other nations there should emerge a better functioning of the Organization and a better guarantee of the establishment of an ultimate climate of lasting peace.252.	This joint action  supported by the political will and commitment of all the Members of the United Nations  should allow a transformation of the present situation of uncertainty and crisis into a climate of mutual confidence  a necessary prelude to the estab¬lishment of an era of peace and universal justice.253.	With the holding of the second special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament  the year 1982 seems to mark a new phase in this particular area  which is at the centre of our endeavors and affects the universal conscience to an ever greater extent. If the essentials of the disarmament effort could have been preserved  particularly the achieve¬ments of the first special session  in 1978  whose Final Document remains the solid basis on which to build our future efforts  it would be vain to try to hide the fact that the results of the special session of 1982 fall far short of our expectations.254.	We have tried to check and even reduce the increase in arms at a time when the sense of insecurity was increasing in the world. We have attributed that insecurity to the enormous over-capacity for mutual destruction  whereas in fact its roots lie in the increase in tension  of which the arms race is but a symptom. Our first priority  to ensure the security of States  is therefore the establishment of a more favorable political climate based on confidence  a sense of reality and good faith. Tension must be reduced before nations are disarmed. That is essentially a political undertaking  which is within the purview of the General Assembly at the thirty-seventh session; I urge it to succeed where the special session on disarmament has failed.255.	Economic progress is also one of the main objectives of the United Nations. The picture of the international economic situation today does not give rise to an optimistic outlook; everywhere one hears only of stagnation  unemployment  interest rates  fluctuations in the exchange rates  and deficits in the balance of payments. Peace and international security are the primary goals of the United Nations  but we should never forget that millions of unemployed people throughout the world follow our debates and wonder what the Organization is doing for them.256.	The economic crisis makes it incumbent upon the Organization and the specialized agencies to take all possible measures to mitigate the havoc caused by this depression  which is both cyclical and struc-tural  and to use every means at their disposal to alleviate the present situation as quickly as possible. One cannot sufficiently underline that absolute neces¬sity. My country is profoundly convinced that the United Nations  and more specifically the Economic and Social Council  could and should undertake this task by making recommendations to the General Assembly  to Member States and to the specialized agencies concerned  in accordance with the principles of the Charter.257.	May I recall in this connection the support that Belgium is giving to the action undertaken by the Director-General for development and international Economic Co-operation  Mr. Ripert  to strengthen and deepen the general economic debates in the Economic and Social Council. Those debates  by improving the co-ordination of economic policies  could provide a new impetus to international eco¬nomic activity.258.	Underdevelopment was already one of the scourges of our world; the financial crisis of today makes its elimination even more difficult. As far as the dialogue with the developing countries and the global negotiations are concerned  it should be noted that economic interdependence in the world has steadily increased. However  the slowing down of economic activity and the disruption of the international monetary system have seriously affected the volume of transfer of financial resources from the wealthy countries to the poor countries. That has resulted in a further deterioration of the economies of the least-developed nations  already strongly affected by the rise in oil prices.259.	That interdependence should lead each group of countries to view the revival of the world economy as a vital objective based on mutual interest. That is why Belgium  together with its partners in the European Community  is wholly in favor of beginning the global negotiations. A new North-South dialogue can succeed only if it results in a satisfactory outcome for all groups. Without such a dialogue  that inter¬dependence in the future will be accompanied by growing insecurity and antagonism between nations.260.	Belgium  for its part  would like to see new forms of co-operation substituted for those risks  allowing us to overcome the crisis and bring about a common responsibility for world interdependence.261.	The establishment and the general recognition of rights designed to protect the fulfillment of the indi¬vidual and his integration within the community are undoubtedly a great victory for civilization over despotism. Therefore  beyond doubt  the initial responsibility for ensuring respect for these human rights is primarily the duty of each State within its own territory. Nevertheless  the international com¬munity should not only endorse those fundamental rights; it should also be able to guarantee their observance.262.	It is not enough for States to endow themselves with the means to implement human rights. They need also the political will to employ these means and to allow a procedure of recourse in cases of omission or shortcomings  or what could be described as ""errors"" of interpretation of international norms  by the respon¬sible national authorities. The international community has already established different forms of monitoring with respect to human rights. However  we must admit that in most of the cases these safeguards produce only meager results  either because they are not binding  or because of the small number of those who have adhered to them. The causes of that deficiency are numerous  but I believe that they can be narrowed down essen¬tially to two.263.	In the first place  if it is true that human dignity is universal and that each human being has the right to enjoy his fundamental rights without discrimination  it is also true that the positive expression of this human dignity may vary  depending on time and place. Our sense of reality requires us to take these dif-ferences into account and to achieve a more effective protection of certain rights  a better result based on concepts which are less vague. On the whole  would it not be preferable to have a well-defined number of rights accepted in the different regions of the world that are effectively and fully respected  rather than to have a long list of theoretical rights?264.	In the same context  one may wish to give more extensive thought to the organic links which should be established between on the one hand the regional monitoring machinery over human rights—and I am happy to see that they are expanding not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world—and on the other hand the international monitoring devices  whose role could be reviewed in relation to their new link with regional mechanisms.265.	Secondly  more effective protection of human rights should  it seems to me  take into account the diversity of the international machinery. In a Utopia an independent body of magistrates would be estab¬lished to ensure the harmonious implementation of human rights all over the world while taking local circumstances into account. This body of magistrates would hold itself aloof from the partisan interests that are so dear to States  with their present egoistic outlook.266.	The way that co-operation between States has evolved within the Organization makes this vision still rather remote. I should like to suggest  however  that a number of practical measures could be taken progressively to bring us nearer to that goal. I think it would be desirable first of all for States to make an effort to designate  within existing organs or institu¬tions  internationally recognized personalities in the field of human rights and to give them a status that would  like that of the magistrates I mentioned earlier  ensure their total independence. Such personalities already exist in those bodies  but their independence is not always safeguarded. Furthermore  I think it would be useful if some of those personalities could participate in the work of more than one monitoring body  in order to establish among them a personal link of co-operation prior to the establishment of institutional Sinks. Lastly  could we not envisage the simultaneous participation of such personalities in the institutions of the regions from which they come and in international institutions  or is this Utopian?267.	The Organization was created in the aftermath of a ghastly war that was the result of the dissemination of ideologies whose principal characteristics were contempt for and enslavement of humanity. Those ideologies plunged our universe into a nightmare which lasted for 15 years. When it ended the world found itself rent apart  bloodless and lifeless  and mankind was for a long time traumatized by the horrors it had perpetrated and suffered. It is not surprising  there¬fore  that the primary concern of the founders of the United Nations at its birth were the protection  the dignity and the fulfillment of man  and that in drafting the Charter and establishing its institutions they made man the centre of their concerns. We must remain faithful to that original  basic concern  and we must give priority to the accomplishment of this task that has been bequeathed to us. Let us remember that all of us here are the servants of mankind and of its dignity  and that mankind must constitute for all of us in our joint action the measure of all things."
"11",529,"BEN",37,1982,"We have gathered together here  as we do every year at this time  in the supreme body of the United Nations system  the General Assembly  to think about and exchange views on the important problems which concern the international community as well as our respective States.151.	First of all  I should like to discharge a most pleasant duty-to extend our warm congratulations to Mr. Hoilai  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin  and express the great satisfaction we feel about his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We regard his unanimous election as a tribute to his great merits and outstanding qualities as a statesman and seasoned diplomat and at the same time as eloquent testimony to the respect in which the international community holds his country  the Hungarian People's Republic  for its active participation in our common task of peace and co-operation among all nations. Our delegation is convinced that under his enlightened leadership our deliberations will lead us to important decisions that will help to bring about concrete action designed to establish a new international order based on principles of justice and solidarity among peoples and for the maintenance of international peace and security. Our delegation would also like to take this opportunity to express its gratitude and admiration for the masterly way in which his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  of Iraq  guided our work and the good will he displayed during the thirty-sixth regular session of the Assembly as well as the second special session devoted to disarmament and the seventh emergency special session  on the question of Palestine. We would also like to express once again to the Secretary-General the appreciation of our country  the People's Republic of Benin  for the thought he is giving to ways to make the working of the United Nations system more effective and to enable it fully to shoulder its responsibilities in the face of the serious problems facing the world. We would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the action the Secretary-General has taken with vigour and determination since his election in dealing resolutely with the delicate task of making the voice of the United Nations heard amidst the clamour of passions and injustices of every kind.152.	The international situation is extremely distressing. The world is in a state of crisis at all levels -political  economic  cultural and social-and we feel powerless when we see that  despite our efforts  the resolutions and recommendations we have managed to adopt in this Hall have not had the results we had hoped for in settling the grave problems with which we and mankind as a whole are faced.153.	The self-same problems thus re-emerge in a more acute form. The serious events that have recently shaken the world and that continue to persist show the extent to which the international situation has deteriorated. Indeed  we are witnessing a sudden increased level of tension in the sensitive areas of the world that defies reason  and the exacerbation of conflicts is moving the world swiftly towards an explosion fraught with unforeseeable consequences.154.	.We are extremely concerned-how could we not be?-when we note that some Powers employ force with disconcerting ease as a means of settling disputes. Flouting international rules and conventions  those colonialist  imperialist  expansionist  racist Powers have systematized their irregular  illegal  immoral  amoral practices. Armed aggression  military intervention  the occupation of the territories of other States  the use of mercenaries and open interference in the internal affairs of other independent States have become their favourite means of imposing their domination and of achieving the triumph of their selfish and hegemonistic interests  to the detriment of the rights of other peoples.155.	With the exception of the problems connected with general and complete disarmament and periodic crises  the majority of the world's political problems are centred in Africa  Latin America and Asia. The agenda of the present session of the General Assembly  like the agendas of preceding sessions  merely reflects this situation. Hence  the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin believes that the poor countries  which an unjust international economic system continues to make poorer with each passing day  are the very same countries as are being subjected to the most despicable policies and in which situations that no longer exist in the northern hemisphere have become everyday practice  although their peoples seek only to live in peace and understanding with others in an international community in which rules of conduct are respected.156.	In Africa  we must once again stress the importance of the problems of Namibia  Western Sahara and apartheid. It is not our intention to go back over the origin of those questions; rather  we wish to emphasize that the efforts of the Organization are being flouted by a coalition of powerful States Minded by sordid short-term interests  to the detriment of justice and the protection of the vital interests of the African peoples.157.	The situation in southern Africa can be explained only on those bases  and we have no hesitation in saying that the key to the solution of the Namibian problem  for instance  like that of the apartheid and the racist South African regime  is being held by those Powers friendly to the white racists of South Africa. In that region  where the voice of reason has been stilled and where relevant resolutions of the United Nations  particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  have been Routed by an oligarchy of criminals and racists  the oppressed populations have been constrained to resort to the only solution still open to them  namely  armed struggle. It is time for the reactionary supporters of colonialism and racism in Pretoria to realize that there can be no peace  stability or security in southern Africa as long as Namibia has not regained its true independence and as long as the abhorrent system of apartheid has not been completely eradicated. It is time for the Pretoria clique to abandon the easy resort to delaying tactics and temporising and to Ml into line with the course of history by participating in the process of negotiations on Namibia's independence.158.	That is why our country  the People's Republic of Benin  has supported and will continue to support the Namibian people and its leaders  SWAPO  headed by our brother Sam Nujoma  until the achievement of total victory and independence without any political or territorial restriction. For the same reason we categorically reject the claim that there is a link between the presence of Cuban forces in the People's Republic of Angola and the process of decolonization of Namibia.159.	Likewise  the South African combatants struggling for the establishment of equality Justice and the eradication of racism in their homeland have always enjoyed the support of the People's Republic of Benin and deserve a greater degree of support from the Organization. In this connection the People's Republic of Benin has always advocated and will continue to call for the cessation of the organized murder of South African nationalists and for the liberation of Nelson Mandela and all the South African patriots and nationalists imprisoned or arrested by the Pretoria clique for having spoken out loudly against a system of government founded on racial discrimination and for having taken vigorous action to put an end to the anachronism and the scourge of our century  must be denounced and condemned by the international community.160.	Caught up in the spiral of a policy which seems to embody human folly those who practise apartheid attempt to export to countries of the region the violence and desolation which they inflict every day upon the people of many districts which for them are nothing but Bantustans. States Members the United Nations are daily attacked by South Africa  and with impunity. Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe are constantly diverted from their task of national reconstruction and development in order to defend themselves against an enemy financed by and under the protection of international imperialism. In the face of these intolerable acts of the so-called South African Republic  the Organization must make greater efforts to prevent its decisions from being cynically flouted and treated with derision. We owe it to ourselves to condemn the acts of aggression and destabilization perpetrated by the South African racists against Angola and the front-line States  and we must also disapprove of the use of mercenaries  a particular scourge of our century.161.	The international community must remain firmly behind SWAPO and support its just struggle for self-determination  national liberation an independence of a united and prosperous Namibia. The Security Council must take all necessary measures to ensure respect for its resolutions and decisions. It must consider undertaking global sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter  including an oil embargo  against South Africa  to make it see reason. Resolution 435 (1978) remains the basis for the settlement of the problem of Namibia  and any other approach must be rejected.162.	In the same context we deplore the paralysis of the Committee of the Security Council established under its resolution 421 (1977)  entrusted with the supervision of the mandatory embargo on arms for South Africa. Our delegation hopes that the report of the Committee  which is at present before the Council for discussion  will be adopted in order to strengthen the means of surveillance of the mandatory arms embargo.163.	We must with the same determination consider the situation in Western Sahara  which we mention with sorrow because the colonial invasion in this case is African and does not come from outside. The United Nations  in co-operation with the OAU  has adopted bold resolutions aimed at achieving the self-determination of the martyred Sahraoui people. Our country condemns the obstructionism and the refusal of frank and open collaboration displayed by the invader in the face of all the constructive proposals designed to find a solution to the illegal occupation of the territory of another country  an occupation which threatens the peace and security of the region  with increasing risks of internationalizing the conflict.164.	The People's Republic of Benin supports the just cause of the Sahraoui people and condemns most strongly the colonialist and expansionist policy which continues to deprive that courageous people of the exercise of its inalienable rights. The People's Republic of Benin reaffirms its solidarity with the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in its heroic struggle against foreign occupation. The desire to restore peace in the region demands that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco consider forthwith the ways and means of bringing an end to that conflict.165.	Regarding the situation in the Middle East  no one should underestimate the dangers of the tension in the region. The aggression perpetrated by Israel in its invasion of Beirut and its policy of genocide against the Palestinians constitute a characteristic aspect of the policy of global Zionism of the Tel Aviv authorities in the Middle East. The stubbornness of the Zionists of Tel Aviv in pursuing this policy of aggression  occupation and extermination is encouraged by the unconditional and massive support of international imperialism  which provides them with logistic support  the arms and the finance-which is no secret to anyone. The barbaric aggression and genocide perpetrated by Israel  such as the recent massacres of Sabra and Shatila  deserve nothing but indignation and strong and unequivocal condemnation.166.	Israel must withdraw its occupation forces forthwith and unconditionally from Lebanese territory and all Arab territories occupied since 1967. Israel must return to the strict practice of international morality for the right to one's own life does not imply the right to exterminate others.167.	The Palestinian people have the right to a national life  a country with recognized  secure and guaranteed boundaries and their own territorial entity. The People's Republic of Benin will always join in bilateral and multilateral efforts effectively to achieve that objective.168.	The international community must become increasingly aware of the grave situation in the Middle East and find the means to make the Zionist aggressors understand that they are placing international peace and security at risk  for peace in the Middle East necessarily involves the proper settlement of the Palestinian problem. The People's Republic of Benin condemns the Zionist policy in the Middle East and supports the struggle of the Palestinian people and their right to their own homeland. The People's Republic of Benin reaffirms its political and diplomatic support for the PLO  the sole representative of the oppressed people of Palestine.By the same token we should like to reaffirm our support for the people of Cyprus in their legitimate struggle for the reunification and integrity of their territory  for peace between the two communities  and against foreign interference.170.	In Asia  although the echo of gun fire seems to have diminished lately  political and military tension is nevertheless high. Hence our delegation stresses its condemnation of all imperialist manoeuvres in that region designed to revive those crises that the determination of the peoples involved is gradually resolving. The Kampuchean and Afghan peoples alone have the right to choose their own political systems and we condemn any interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. The peoples of those two countries must be left free to decide their destiny  and threats to their security and foreign occupation must cease. This is a meaningful massage for real peace in the region.171.	The People's Republic of Benin has recognized and will continue to recognize the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea and supports all its efforts to achieve the political unification of the country and oppose foreign aggression and interference by international imperialist factions.172.	The people of Korea aspire to peace and to the peaceful reunification of their homeland free from foreign interference. This is the feeling in both the south and the north of the peninsula. The People's Republic of Benin welcomes the efforts of the North Korean authorities to bring about the peaceful reunification of the great Korean country. In order to achieve this objective the Korean people must be free to decide their future. Thus we call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the peninsula. This is the only way to ensure a definitive and viable settlement of the Korean crisis. The People's Republic of Benin affirms its firm and unswerving support for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its valiant efforts to put an end to the artificial and arbitrary division of Korea by the satisfaction of the legitimate aspiration of the entire Korean people  that is  independent and peaceful reunification and the establishment of the Confederated Republic of Koryo.173.	We also support the people of East Timor in their legitimate struggle for freedom.174.	The People's Republic of Benin supports those peoples in Central America and the Caribbean that aye courageously extricating their countries from the grip of international imperialism and striving to take their destiny into their own hands. AH peoples aspiring to independence in that region should be able freely to express their views on their future. In this context  my delegation believes that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations must be borne in mind and respected by all. Blackmail and military plots of all kinds are constantly used to ensure the failure of the revolutionary experience of the countries of the region. The heroic resistance of the Latin American peoples  whose political maturity grows stronger every day  deserves our full admiration and support. Peoples that cherish peace and justice must continue to support the peaceful cause of independence and freedom of Cuba  Nicaragua  El Salvador  Grenada and others.175.	The Indian Ocean has become an area of competition where the great military Powers are building their own gigantic arsenals for a possible future confrontation. Gigantic observation  control and communications complexes rise above the peaceful waters of that immense Ocean and there are huge stocks of the most modem and sophisticated weapons on those floating bases. All these means of destruction stockpiled on that Ocean constitute a threat to international peace and to the security of the coastal States. The People's Republic of Benin  concerned at this race to militarize the Indian Ocean  reaffirms its support for all measures and decisions aimed at transforming the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. In this context  the bold proposals of the President  Didier Ratsiraka  of Madagascar should be accepted and given concrete form.176.	The subject of the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean brings us to the problem of disarmament. It is by now no secret that when we bear in mind mankind's problems of life and survival the exorbitant expenses involved in the arms race are truly scandalous  if not utter madness: $450 billion are spent on it each year  when $20 billion would suffice for development assistance. Apart from the fact that this accumulation of increasingly dangerous equipment heightens the risk of general confrontation  it is also a heavy burden for the major Powers that prompts them to shirk their international responsibilities. We in the People's Republic of Benin are convinced that this arms race threatens not only the survival of mankind but also the economic development of the world. For the limitation or complete elimination of the arms race would enable the Powers which now engage in that arms race to channel more money into development assistance and the improvement of the living standards of their own citizens.177.	My delegation regrets that at the second special session devoted to disarmament the General Assembly failed to make any progress  despite the many proposals from all sides. The Organization must continue its efforts to achieve general disarmament  which at this time of chronic economic crisis could permit the enormous financial resources that are today squandered on destruction and death to be reallocated to the fulfilment of the noble ideals of preserving life and promoting international peace and security.178.	We make a most urgent appeal to the conscience of both the Soviet and American peoples to induce their respective Governments to engage in sincere and decisive negotiations to put an end to the arms and to achieve a balanced arms reduction so as to release large quantities of resources which could then be devoted to the promotion of the well-being of peoples and to assistance to developing countries.179.	Those  in our opinion  are the main political concerns of the international community. They are not new  and the Organization has continually been adopting resolutions to deal with them. But we must note that a great number of Member States flout United Nations decisions to such an extent that we must wonder whether the Organization would not gain from a restructuring-particularly the Security Council. It must be recalled that the Charter not only stipulates rights: it imposes duties upon States  as well. Legally adopted decisions must be implemented. At this juncture we would like to pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General for his commendable efforts to preserve international peace and security.180.	The critical situation in the world not only political in nature; it is also economic. Indeed  the international economic situation gives us growing cause for concern. The persistence of this economic crisis  which has lasted more than a decade and continues to deteriorate  brings to light a long-term structural phenomenon: monetary upheaval  galloping inflation  constantly soaring interest rates  unbearable instability in the balance of payments  and increased indebtedness are its main characteristics; they have harmful effects upon the economies of the developing countries.181.	The development of those countries is seriously handicapped by that situation. Their investment capacity is reduced. The acute deterioration in the terms of trade dangerously decreases their expected export revenues. Their production effort is affected and economic stagnation is compounded by social stagnation because of the increase in unemployment.182.	Until recently we have devoted our efforts only to the external manifestations of this economic crisis and have attempted to solve them with stopgap measures  but to no great avail. Is not the fundamental question really the problem of development itself and the establishment of new relations in the system of co-operation among nations based on international solidarity  justice and equity?183.	Since the holding of the special sessions devoted to the problem of development and to the establishment of a new international economic order  and the various North-South dialogues in Paris  followed by the global negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and the Cancun meeting  there has certainly been an evolution  in terms of vocabulary  if not of ideas. But the facts have changed little. The intransigence of certain rich countries blindly attached to the privileges and advantages they have unjustly acquired prevents the appeal for solidarity from being heard and in no way fosters the establishment of a new international economic order.184.	The failure to restructure international economic life has resulted in a continuing  alarming deterioration of the world economy  which is not likely to reduce international political tension  since the economically weaker countries have come to realize that the economically stronger countries have deliberately been contributing to keeping them in the status of marginal States. If we want to strive for international peace and security  it is clear that this intolerable situation cannot be allowed to go on much longer.185.	International co-operation is obviously adversely affected by the situation. Indeed  we note a deteriorating spirit of multilateral co-operation  the principal cause of the stagnation in international negotiations. There is also a discernible disproportionate indebtedness in the developing countries.186.	How can those developing countries honour their foreign debt commitments  which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars  we know that they are undergoing an economic recession which seriously affects their budgets  when we know that their populations are suffering hunger  malnutrition and disease  when we know that 25 per cent of the people proceeds from their meagre exports is sacrificed to pay the interest on the various loans needed for their investments in the public sector? The gap  the imbalance  between the rich countries and the poor countries is continually increasing.187.	The rich countries alone monopolize 70 per cent of the revenues from world trade  80 per cent of industrial activities and 90 per cent of technology. They are doing all they can to block the process of co-operation through the selfish practice of protectionist measures; we have seen an emerging and growing tendency towards selectivity in aid  accompanied by its progressive decline.188.	Rather than accepting the idea of global negotiations  which  in our view  could improve the chances of emerging from the present economic stagnation and promote justice among nations  the countries of the North are clinging to palliatives  to caricatures of solutions  which hardly conceal their desire to maintain their long-standing domination and economic exploitation of our countries.189.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin believes that the present economic crisis is extremely serious and deserves our full attention  and that no viable and lasting solution can be found without understanding among all parties  and without a spirit of solidarity. It would be pointless to think that a national or sectorial search for solutions could solve the problems.190.	Only global negotiations  bringing together both developed and developing countries  are likely to improve the situation  in the framework of the establishment of a new international economic order.191.	In the short term  we believe that the developed countries must try to reach the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in aid devoted to the development programmes of the economically weak countries. Multilateral assistance must be revived; in that connection the rebuilding of the financial resources of institutions such as the International Development Association is of high priority  and there is an urgent need for a far-reaching reform of international assistance machinery and the establishment of a code of conduct for transnational corporations  which must cease to plunder the wealth of the host countries with impunity.192.	It is appropriate now to bring to the attention of the international community the inadequacy of the Resources of UNDP and the great needs of the countries that benefit from its assistance. The People's Republic of Benin associates itself with the appeals launched from this rostrum that UNDP be granted the necessary means  to enable it to carry out successful its activities for the benefit of the developing countries.193.	Our country  the People's Republic of Benin  suffers the consequences of the economic crisis all the more intensely not only because it is among the least-developed countries  but also because the consequences of the armed aggression to which it was victim are still being felt.194. My country thanks the United Nations for the programme of special economic assistance established at that time and for the measures which are to be taken by the Assembly at the present session to complete the achievement of the goals of that programme. L would also like to thank all the States which have contributed to the implementation of that programme to assist the people of Benin.195.	That demonstration of solidarity constitutes support for our country at a time when it is making enormous sacrifices to build the foundations of its economic development. A round-table of the partners in Benin's development will be held in June 1983 at Cotonou. We earnestly hope that the States which have been invited and the United Nations bodies concerned will respond positively and massively to our appeal for broad participation. My delegation would be grateful to the Secretary-General for any steps he might take to that end.196.	We thank the Secretary-General in advance  and through him  Mr. Farah  the Under-Secretary-General  who personally worked to establish the special programme for the benefit of the People's Republic of Benin. His report  which will be considered at this session by the Second Committee  will make it possible to continue efforts for effective international assistance in support of the development effort of the courageous people of Benin.197.	We should also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Bradford Morse and  through him  to Mr. Doo Kingue  for UNDP assistance in organizing the round-table which is provided for in our 10-year social and economic development programme.198.	We should like also to reiterate the gratitude of the People's Republic of Benin to all the friendly countries and organizations which have tangibly demonstrated their solidarity with the people of Benin  who have been stricken by the recent floods in the south of our country.199.	The People's Republic of Benin  which is among the least-developed countries  is waging a courageous national struggle Car economic development. The People's Republic of Benin  its people  its party  its Government and its President  Mathieu Kerekou  hope that our appeal from this rostrum will not be a voice crying in the wilderness. We rely on international solidarity and co-operation for the success of the round-table planned in our country and for the achievement of the objectives of our programme of special economic assistance.20C. Despite the accusations of ineffectiveness so often levelled at the United Nations  the Organization is an indispensable instrument for the protection of peace and security. Thus  it is the historic duty of Member States to overcome their national selfishness to make the Organization better able to function by granting it means commensurate with its purposes and its universality. Member States must act to ensure that the United Nations is not merely a gadget to gratify their selfishness; further  we must turn it into a real tool  operating full time in the service of peace  freedom  justice and the development of the people. Member States  large and small  rich or poor  must resolve to turn the United Nations into a real centre of consultation and action to promote understanding and co-operation among peoples and to bring about peaceful coexistence between States with different political systems.201.	May that thought inspire the representatives at this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly to guarantee the success of the Assembly  a success to which the delegation of Benin pledges itself to contribute by means of dynamic and constructive participation.202.	Ready for the revolution  the struggle continues!"
"12",574,"BFA",37,1982,"The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a particularly crucial time in international life  characterized basically by a series of grave crises: political crises that endanger international peace and security  social crises stemming from unchecked population growth  economic crises unprecedented since the establishment of the Bretton Woods system  crises in international structures and institutions.	 Hence we see before us the United Nations  with its imposing structures and prestige  facing the greatest difficulty in ensuring that international law is respected. We see the Organization displaying its impotence in the tragedy taking place in the Middle East. Never before  in the discharge of its responsibilities  has the United Nations been so convinced of the futility of its decisions—witness its resolutions being trampled underfoot by certain Member States whose duty it is because of their capacity to negotiate  to set the course of justice and reason.This preliminary assessment of the world situation was necessary in order to highlight the immensity of the task of presiding over the Assembly since  through our deliberations and decisions  it may be possible to restore confidence in the United Nations and in all those that never lost faith in its calling. In extending our most sincere congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his election  our delegation would like to offer him our best wishes for the success of our work. He may be assured that my country  which as a Vice-President is working with him  is anxious to give him all possible support and assistance. I also address my best wishes to the Secretary-General for success during his term of office. The way he has discharged his responsibilities during this first year  so rich in events  is striking proof of his skill and ability to direct the Organization. Moreover  his report on the work of the Organization contains lucid comments and guidelines which have the full support of the Upper Volta.Last year  looking back on the situation in the world  at the 28th meeting of the thirty-sixth session  I spoke of a momentum and of hopes which should not be dashed. Today once again these are our wishes  although the ills that envelop and afflict our world make despair a constant companion.In the Middle East  first  in spite of four special sessions of the General Assembly  several Security Council meetings  a special meeting of the non-aligned countries and many appeals by the international community  Israel placed greater faith in war than in dialogue. AH the efforts made to reach a just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question crashed against the wail of death and bellicose arrogance erected by Israel—Israel which  having become a constant aggressor  proclaims and defends its own rights while trampling on those of others.The tragic events in Lebanon are proof enough that 37 years after San Francisco a State is able to invade another with impunity under the pretext of being a liberator. After events in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Lebanon  who would dare to speak of international morality? For those of us not having double standards  those acts of aggression are all equally reprehensible.Thus  we see the Hebrew State  not content with occupying Arab lands  now interfering in Lebanese affairs. In this respect we condemn the principle of fait accomplit. This is why my country fully supports the Security Council resolution which demands the establishment and maintenance of a multinational force whose primary mission would be to guarantee the security of Palestinians and to consolidate the integrity and independence of Lebanon. The massacres of Shatila and Sabra can in no way wipe out the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Israel  above all  should know this. Israel should know that as regards the struggle for the right to life and freedom more often than not everything follows the well-known biological phenomenon of organic regeneration. In other words  the Palestinians who died for freedom and justice. In these conditions  where does victory reside? Regardless of the final solution found and regardless of the means used  the tragedy in the Middle East cannot be resolved by force of arms. Only frank and sincere negotiations between the parties can lead to an equitable settlement of the dispute. That settlement must be based on the relevant decisions of the United Nations  with mutual recognition of the right to existence of both the Palestinian people and the Israeli people as an indispensable prerequisite. In this context  the Arab peace plan which resulted from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez is an initiative in the right direction.Israel must understand this wisdom  this sacrifice  and respond by giving up all the territories occupied by force and beginning a dialogue with the Palestinian people  through its legitimate representative  the PLO. A policy of domination or revenge on either side would be a dead-end policy  catastrophic for the region  which needs peace so much in order to regain unity and pool its vast resources to promote its economic and social development.The region is also the arena of another conflict  which has for two years now pitted Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran against each other on geo-strategic and political-ideological grounds. The Upper Volta is increasingly concerned by the magnitude of that confrontation  which  if not soon honorably resolved may lead to foreign intervention  thus endangering international security. We appeal to those two non-aligned States to conform to the ideals of the non-aligned movement  which are based on peaceful coexistence  and put an end to a fratricidal war which wounds and weakens us all.Africa and Asia are also hotbeds of tension  and here again we cannot but be pessimistic. With the complicity of certain Powers  the racist regime of Pretoria stalks and murders the freedom fighters who struggle to recover their dignity as free men. In spite of these vicissitudes  the African National Congress and SWAPO are continuing their heroic struggle for a completely free South Africa and an independent and sovereign Namibia.The blind hostility of apartheid to the objectives of Africa lead to repeated incursions against the frontline States  inflicting human suffering and material damage upon them and arousing only verbal condemnation from the Powers which oppose any sanctions against the South African regime. None the less those sanctions are necessary to compel the South African authorities to be more reasonable. Those sanctions are essential to put an end to the odious segregationist system which still  at the end of this twentieth century  dares to institutionalize as a system of government the theory of racial superiority dear to the Fascist regimes. In the name of justice and dignity  we wish to reiterate our support for the front-line States  whose determination and perseverance do honor to all Africa. In the name of justice and freedom  we ask the members of the contact group to apply all their skill in persuasion and negotiation to make the Pretoria regime understand that the independence of Namibia is inevitable and necessary.As regards the events in Chad  every African country had its own opinion  and positions were often contradictory and even conflicting. What is comforting is that we were able to exercise self-control and turn to will rise again from their ashes the OAU  which had its first experience of maintaining peace in a country prey to civil war. Despite the difficulties it faced  the OAU accomplished useful work in Chad. In these circumstances  who would venture to question the usefulness and importance of that organization? It follows that the disagreements that now exist within the OAU because of the question of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic will not inevitably lead to its disappearance. On the contrary  the enthusiasm and faith that presided over the organization's birth must not wane and give way to disputes and excommunication.On the question of Western Sahara  my country's position is very clear: it is based on our desire to work sincerely for the unity of Africa and on our wish to respect the norms of law  without which that unity would be only artificial. We in the Upper Volta are accustomed to independent thought and action  because the Upper Volta does not belong to any outside school; it has its own school. This underlies our vision of African unity; it also underlies our position on the question of Western Sahara  whose solution must involve an awareness of the following realities.The question of Western Sahara is an exclusively African question; hence there is no need to refer it to the League of Arab States. A just and lasting settlement of the question must be based  above all  on the original principles of our organization; it is essential that the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU be held  as planned  at Tripoli.Above and beyond misunderstandings and sensitivities  what is important is cohesion and unity. In the life of any institution at some time or other there are difficulties that must be overcome. Let us  therefore  rally to safeguard our own unity. This is a categorical need  because an Africa bedeviled from within cannot allow itself to be destabilized or distracted by hegemonic designs.Similarly  as regards Asia  we deplore the clear interference of foreign Powers in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In the case of those countries  just as wherever else it is violated—in Africa  in Latin America—we wish to see respect for the principle of noninterference.The question of Korea has always been a matter of concern to my country  which calls for and works towards reconciliation between the two Koreas and their reunification. The Upper Volta urges them to settle the Korean question by peaceful means  through negotiations  without foreign interference.Now the force which brings together the countries of Latin America  Asia and Africa  the non- aligned movement must preserve the integrity of its basic principle  non-alignment. Increasingly lost sight of  non-alignment is increasingly necessary  vital and consistent with our fundamental interests. Without strict respect for the principles of our movement and in the hands of hegemonic Powers  we become pawns in a game that they play and control to satisfy their own strategic interests. Our ideals transcend that sad destiny  and our actions must no longer doom us to it. Our task is to contribute balance and justice to the international community. We must also work fervently for a world based on true collective security.In this context we can only be disappointed and frustrated that the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  in which all countries had placed such great hopes  ended in failure. The main cause was the bad faith of the nuclear States  which kept raising objections and reservations in an attempt to make disarmament their own preserve. Even if their arsenals warrant such pretension  it still remains true that peace is everybody's business.In spite of those disappointing results  we consider it necessary  within the framework of the World Disarmament Campaign  to continue to mobilize world public opinion in favor of peace.The future of the world economy arouses deep concern in my country. The present crisis  because of its multifaceted nature  spares no country  whether of North or South  industrialized or developing. Inflation and unemployment have sounded the alarm everywhere. The elements of a crisis similar to that of the 1930s are again present and  as if this were enough to overcome it  certain economic Powers have taken protectionist measures  which have had the immediate effect of producing disorder in international economic trade. In the long term it is to be feared that those same measures may lead to social and polemical upheaval  with unforeseeable results.Another feature of the present situation which is equally disturbing to my country is the slowing down of the humanist movement towards international co-operation which had led to the creation of a number of bodies within the United Nations system designed to Foster the development of the least-favored countries.As proof of that I would cite the enormous difficulties now faced by UNDP  whose capacity to intervene in the sphere of international development has fallen in 1982 below what it was 10 years ago. For the countries that benefit from that assistance this situation will most certainly lead to the elimination of many projects whose economic and social impact is clear.123. The concern that I have just shared with the Assembly is not confined  unfortunately  to UNDP: it extends also  I am afraid  to such specialized agencies and bodies as UNICEF  FAO  WHO  UNEP  and others. It is as though in recent years the interest that led to the creation of such bodies has waned; it is as though the suffering  poverty and penury of millions of human beings prey to hunger  thirst and the most diverse and cruel ills no longer awakened ;he conscience of men of good will.It is therefore not surprising that this worldwide economic recession  whether we call it inflation  an energy crisis or deterioration in the terms of trade  which paralyses the growth of the most prosperous  powerful economies should be destroying the development efforts of the third-world countries  and  more specifically  the least developed among them. In Africa  and more particularly in the Sahelian countries  these ills  together with natural disasters and their consequences tend to become a veritable psychosis.By the end of this session of the General Assembly we expect to see an increase in the number of African countries classified as among the least developed  which will bring to 52 per cent the proportion of States on our continent in that category. These figures speak for themselves; they are proof that in spite of the struggle of the African countries since their independence and in spite of the Lagos Plan of Action and the efforts of the international community to help our continent emerge from its chronic underdevelopment  the results have not met the expectations of our peoples. Indeed  the results have even been negative in certain respects.It is often said that comparisons are odious. Without trying to draw analogies between the present situation of the developing countries and that of postwar Europe  my country  the Upper Volta  is convinced that only massive assistance to those countries along the lines of the Marshall Plan could help them to solve their economic problems. Obviously  the success of such a plan depends on the political will of all States  particularity the major Powers. In our view  the latter should reverse the arms race and devote the resources thus released to the peaceful purposes of economic and social development.It is within this framework that the Upper Volta attaches particular importance to resumption of the North-South dialogue and renewal of global negotiations on economic development. We therefore appeal to the rich countries  and to their political will  in particular  to recognize that the interests of mankind and the very survival of the human race transcend self-interest  demand the prompt resumption of those negotiations and must be the basis of their philosophy.The Upper Volta  a land-locked country and one which is geographically disadvantaged and classified among the least-developed countries  welcomed with great satisfaction the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea' on 30 April 1982. The decisive adoption of that instrument constitutes  in our view  a striking victory of an international community in search of its identity  an important step towards a more just and lasting balance in inter-State economic relations. Is that not an example  if example be needed  of the value of dialogue?I should like on behalf of my country to take this opportunity to appeal to the States that for different reasons were unable to adopt the Convention on the Law of the Sea to review their position. On a Convention of such importance  consensus would make it possible for us to mark one more milestone on the path towards peace and detente.Before concluding  I should like to restate my country's full confidence and faith in the United Nations and in its noble mission  which is that of bringing about an era of peace and progress for the well-being of mankind. The Upper Volta has attentively followed all the efforts made in that direction during the past year  whether it be the World Assembly on Aging  a matter which is increasingly of concern to the national community  or the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space which took place in August at Vienna. We believe that all these activities share a clear vision of objectives to be attained in order to make our world more fraternal and more humane.It is urgent that the United Nations  through the proposals for renewal suggested by the Secretary- General  regain its place and its role in accordance with the principles of the Charter. It is essential that all the nations of our world give the United Nations every support to enable it to accomplish its mission in our troubled world  that of safeguarding peace and justice.Above and beyond the difficulties of all types that today disturb international life  above and beyond national selfishness  tension and conflicts which govern inter-State relations  one truth remains: never before since the emergence of life on earth has mankind been more threatened  more haunted. Never has peace been more precarious  never has our world been more anguished  more disturbed; disturbed at the present  disturbed for the future. In these conditions  our only chance of survival is to mobilize all our energies in the service of greater justice  greater equity on earth."
"13",617,"BGD",37,1982,"The members of my delegation and I deem it an honour and a privilege to have the opportunity of participating in the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We bring representatives the warm greetings of the Government and the people of Bangladesh. On behalf of the Bangladesh delegation and on my own behalf  I congratulate Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election as President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his qualities of leadership and wealth of experience will be of immense value to the Assembly in accomplishing its task. We offer him our co operation and support in fulfilling his heavy responsibility during the days ahead. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  on his determined and energetic leadership not only during the thirty sixth session of the General Assembly but also during the second special session devoted to disarmament and the emergency special session on the question of Palestine. His patience and wisdom have been greatly appreciated by all of us. My delegation would also like to pay a tribute to the new Secretary General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  within the short period since the assumption of his most difficult responsibilities  has earned our trust and confidence for his absolute dedication and impartiality. The Government of Bangladesh congratulates him on his unremitting efforts and ceaseless endeavours in promoting the purposes and principles of the Charter. We assure him of our fullest support for all his efforts aimed in this direction. Bangladesh deeply mourns the passing of His Majesty King Khaled of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In him the entire world has lost an outstanding personality dedicated to the cause of peace and justice. Since its independence as a sovereign nation  Bangladesh has made consistent efforts to work for the greater interest of the international community. The foreign policy of Bangladesh is based on total adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We see this world body as a unique instrument for promoting global peace and development based on justice and equity. We greatly appreciate the candor with which the Secretary  General in his report has brought to our notice the shortcomings of the Organization. We in Bangladesh will support the Secretary General in all his efforts to make the United Nations an effective organization for maintaining world peace and security. Bangladesh has chosen non alignment as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. We are committed to working tirelessly together with other peace loving nations of the world to create an environment of peace in which people can harness all available resources to combat the scourge of poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy  thus achieving economic freedom without sacrificing political freedom. As at previous sessions this year  too  we have a long agenda and we are very conscious of the number of crucial issues before us. We notice a progressive decline in the international situation. There is widespread use offence  the continuing existence of foreign occupation forces and acts of aggression  total disregard for the principle of self determination  and flouting of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council. The situation prevailing in the Middle East remains dangerous and highly explosive  posing a serious threat to international peace and security. This state of affairs is due to the persistence of Israel in its flagrant denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  as recognized by the United Nations. The latest Israeli holocaust in Lebanon has rendered the situation in the Middle East more explosive than ever before. Along with the peoples of all peace loving nations  we in Bangladesh have been stunned by the appalling act of inhuman massacre of a large number of innocent and unarmed Palestinian men  women and children in their camps in west Beirut. The Government of Bangladesh is of the view that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem. There can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights  including the right to return to their homeland  their right to self determination and to establish a State of their own under the leadership of the PLO their sole and legitimate representative  with Jerusalem as its capital. Further  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force imposes an obligation on Israel to withdraw completely from all the territories it has occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem. Any solution that fails to recognize these rights and realities will pose a constant threat to peace and stability in the region. We are particularly distressed at the continuing and self defeating armed conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Bangladesh  as a member of the Islamic Peace Committee  has made sincere efforts to resolve that conflict peacefully. It is a great tragedy that despite our collective efforts the war is still continuing. We should like to make a renewed appeal to Iran and Iraq to stop this armed conflict forthwith and to resolve their differences through peaceful means. It is also extremely disheartening that the crises in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea remain unresolved. We should do everything possible to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those two countries and to ensure that the people in both those countries are permitted to determine their own destinies without any outside intervention or interference. We firmly believe that peace is possible In southern Africa only through the transfer of power to the people of Namibia. We appreciate the sustained mediatory efforts of the five Western Powers in evolving an agreement on Namibia's transition to independence under the control and supervision of the United Nations. It is the view of Bangladesh that peace and security would be promoted through the creation of zones of peace in areas like the Indian Ocean  South Asia and South East Asia  the Mediterranean and other regions. Such zones would have to take into account the interrelated aspects of eliminating the military presence of and threat from external Powers and the maintenance of security among the regional States. In this context  we support the convening of a conference in Sri Lanka next year as a step towards the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Bangladesh has also been making unrelenting efforts to promote peace and stability in the South Asian region through the creation of a climate of trust  understanding and co operation on the basis of mutual respect for sovereign equality and non interference in the internal affairs of other States. Taking into account our friendly relations within our region with India  Pakistan  Nepal  Bhutan  Sri Lanka and Maldives  Bangladesh has proposed the creation of a regional co operation forum among those countries. Substantial progress has been made towards the implementation of this proposal  and the necessary preparatory work is still under way for making the process self  sustaining and irreversible. It has also been decided to convene a meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers next year to launch the forum. We believe that our statement on global issues would be incomplete if we did not say a few words about our national efforts to achieve a better living for our people. Mr. H. M. Ershad  on assumption of the office of the head of Government of Bangladesh  clearly spelt out his Government's objectives: first  to bring maximum benefit to the 90 million people of Bangladesh; secondly  to ensure maximum participation by the people of the country through existing political institutions and  thirdly  to create a simple  well balanced administration capable of responding to the needs of the people. In order to achieve these objectives  the Government of Bangladesh has spelt out plan priorities  which are: self sufficiency in agriculture  population control  encouragement of the private sector  universal primary education and extensive and integrated rural development programmes  including health and social welfare. These priorities and the decentralization of administration which has been initiated by the Government are designed to revitalize the social and economic activities and to lay the foundation of a new Bangladesh. We are confident that these efforts by us at the national level will receive whole hearted support from the international community. We in Bangladesh are therefore deeply concerned that the international situation has further deteriorated  generating despair and pessimism. The world economy is passing through a very serious crisis threatening both the developed and the developing countries. The second special session devoted to disarmament has met with miserable failure  while armament expenditures continue to rise. The crisis spots all over the world also continue to multiply. Our most important task therefore should be to address these problems in a concerted and collective manner. The evolution of international society has made it manifest more than ever before that most problems today are interlinked and global in character. There can be no piecemeal solution. There can be no lasting peace so long as economic imbalances and injustices prevail. Peace is meaningless if it is not accompanied by development. To achieve a better world  mankind must have both. While we strive for peace  our efforts for development should not lag behind. Bangladesh strongly believes that the right to development is a human right and that equality of opportunity for development is as much the prerogative of nations as of individuals within nations. The present inequities of the world economic order  accompanied by the accelerated arms race  is therefore at the root of all world problems and one of the most significant obstacles to the realization of both the right to development and the right to peace. As the head of Government and President of the Council of Ministers of Bangladesh  Mr. H. M. Ershad  declared from this rostrum during the twelfth special session and the second special session devoted to disarmament  the three major challenges confronting mankind's continued progress and eventual survival are the arms race  underdevelopment and the unlawful use of force in solving international disputes. Peace and development are indivisible and both can be achieved to a large extent through effective disarmament. The enormous resources that can be released through a well intentioned disarmament process would give a tremendous boost to the development efforts of the developing countries. In this period of resource difficulties  such diversion of resources is of crucial importance. This point which we are making is not a new one and has been repeated many times in this forum as well as in others. Unfortunately  though  it has not been translated into reality by the parties concerned. We therefore urge everyone  big or small  to give this idea serious thought  keeping in mind the question of the survival and progress of mankind as a whole. The annual military expenditures of nearly $600 billion  which is more than 10 times the amount now available for development assistance  is totally irrational. Such wasteful use of enormous amounts of the world's precious limited resources is also clearly immoral when millions die of starvation and many more millions are struggling for their very survival. Bangladesh acceded to the Treaty on the Non  Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a demonstration of its total commitment to general and complete disarmament. In view of the failure of the second special session on disarmament  we urge the super Powers and other militarily significant States to concert their efforts so as to commence serious negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty as well as a conventional weapon treaty. Work on the comprehensive programme of disarmament  which forms the core of the negotiations on the reduction of armament  both nuclear and conventional  should be started inGeneva within the framework of the Committee on Disarmament. The failure of the Assembly at the second special session on disarmament to produce a final document on the comprehensive programme of disarmament should not be taken as an alibi to avoid the responsibility that devolves on the super Powers as well as other militarily significant countries. Bangladesh  in its total commitment to general and complete disarmament  has applied for membership in the Committee on Disarmament and is ready to contribute to all future disarmament negotiations to be undertaken in the Committee on Disarmament. The present world economic crisis is of a global nature. The interrelationship of issues and the interdependence of the countries are so clearly established that isolated measures by any individual country or group of countries cannot solve the contradictions and difficulties that appear as a result of profound structural imbalance. On the other hand  we agree with the view that deterioration in the international economic situation has in part been due to policies pursued in countries with a preponderant weight in the world economy  as they have sought to solve their problems on a national basis. The present state of crisis can be overcome only through a global and concerted effort on the part of countries. Therefore we believe that a lasting improvement in international economic relations can be achieved only through a global dialogue a sincere  determined and imaginative co operation between the developed and the developing countries. It does not need reiteration that all nations have a stake in the recovery of the world economy and should  therefore  engage themselves in a purposeful effort to address themselves to a world recovery programme and a restructuring the existing international economic relations. Bangladesh believes that the present unjust international economic system requires structural reforms which could result only from a comprehensive and integrated approach to the present international economic issues through the participation of all countries in a round of global negotiations for the establishment of the new international economic order. Bangladesh has  therefore  actively joined in all the initiatives and efforts for the launching of global negotiations as envisaged in General Assembly resolution 34/138. We earnestly hope that in view of its importance to the economic development of the world as a whole  it will be possible for us to launch the global negotiations without further delay. Bangladesh will continue to make its humble contribution towards this effort in its capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77. Before concluding  on behalf of the Bangladesh delegation  I wish to assure you  Mr. President  and through you all the members of the Assembly that Bangladesh is determined to play a meaningful and constructive role in finding just and equitable solutions to the problems which face us today. It is our strong belief that  despite the frustrations of the past  the United Nations system is still the only organization which can bring effective peace  progress prosperity to our world. In order to achieve common objective  all the Members of the United Nations  big and small  must unite together to make this body more effective both in spirit and in action."
"14",663,"BGR",37,1982,"Comrade President  I should like most cordially to congratulate you on your election to the important post of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and wish you every success in your important work. It is a particular pleasure for me to welcome in your person a representative of the Hungarian People's Republic with which the People's Republic of Bulgaria maintains relations of fraternal friendship and co-operation in the interests of both peoples and of peace and socialism. The Bulgarian delegation also wishes to express its warmest greetings to the Secretary-General. We should like to assure him of our readiness to afford him every co-operation in the discharge of his most responsible task.40.	The focus of attention of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is once again the cardinal issue of eliminating the threat of a destructive nuclear war  the cessation of the arms race and the elimination of sources of international tension  and this is only natural. In accordance with its goals and purposes the Organization has always given pride of place to the most important problems of the day. At this time the prevailing view isóand this has been corroborated by the whole course of the work at this sessionóthat there is now in fact no more urgent or immediate humanitarian problem than concern for the preservation and consolidation of peace throughout the world  which is in keeping with the interests of all peoples. It is being called for by all the peoples of our planet:41.	However  we must note with considerable concern that over the past year the situation in the world has continued to deteriorate and is becoming ever more explosive. A nuclear catastrophe has become a serious and real threat. The arms race is being stepped up. In practice  talks on a number of issues have been paralyzedóissues which are so vitally important for peace and security. Other issues have been marking time for years.42.	The policy of sanctions and diktat is undermining international economic co-operation and having the most adverse effect on political relations among States.43.	There still survive existing sources of tension. What is more  they are being exacerbated and becoming ever more dangerous to universal peace and new ones are constantly being added.44.	In the Middle East  the wounds inflicted on Lebanon by a barbarous act of aggression are still fresh. The world was shocked by the crimes of the ruling Tel Aviv circles. Such crimes would of course have been impossible without support from their powerful strategic ally. Flouting the Charter and United Nations resolutions  Israel has destroyed thousands of innocent Lebanese and Palestinians. The height of shameless behavior by these contemporary vandals was reached in the mass slaughter of defenseless women  children and the elderly in Palestinian camps.45.	I should like from this lofty rostrum to state that the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the entire Bulgarian people most vigorously condemn what was nothing less than an act of genocide.46.	The racist regime in South Africa has been stepping up its aggressive actionß against neighbouring sovereign States. It is continuing illegally to occupy Namibia  the people of which  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SW/4PO]  has for years now been valiantly fighting to exercise its right to se -determination and independence. Yet Pretoria and its protectors continue their efforts to circumvent the decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and to link the question of Namibia's independence with pre-conditions which constitute flagrant interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign State of Angola.47.	Tension s are growing in Latin America and in the Caribbean. Political and economic pressure is being exerted upon Cuba  Nicaragua and other States  whilst threats to use military force are being openly voiced.48.	An objective analysis of the facts confirms unequivocally that this critical situation in international relations has been brought about by the actions of the most reactionary imperialist forcesóprimarily certain circles in the United States. Having rejected the policy of detente  they have embarked on a course of sharp acceleration of military preparations and over- armament  the aim of which is clear: to upset the approximate military and strategic balance between the Soviet Union and the United States and between the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [M47Y3]  and to achieve military superiority and hegemony on a global scale. In pursuit of their ambitions they are heading for an all-out confrontation with the countries of the socialist community.49.	The use of force has always been an attribute of the policy of imperialism. Characteristic features of its present militaristic course arc its markedly provocative nature  its growing aggressiveness and its increasing reliance on nuclear weapons as an instrument of policy. As a result of this  certain concepts and doctrines are being officially proclaimed which allow for the possibility of launching a ""first nuclear strike""  waging a ""limited nuclear war"" or a ""protracted nuclear war"". These concepts and doctrines are reflected in the large-scale programmes for the general strengthening of the military might of the United States and NATO  for a drastic build-up of strategic offensive weapons and of nuclear and conventional armaments. Everyone is aware of the plans to deploy United States medium-range missiles in Europe. If those plans were to materialize  the threat of outbreak of a nuclear conflict would increase many times over. Moreover  NATO's program for nuclear rearmament  which envisages increasing its arsenals by thousands of weapons  plus ammunition  is also under way. New types of nuclear and other means of mass destruction  such as neutron and binary chemical weapons  are being manufactured and space military systems are being developed. Efforts are being made to drag States from various parts of the world into imperialism's orbit of military preparations.50.	In contradiction to agreements reached  to the Helsinki Final Act and the legal and moral norms of inter state relations  there has been an intensification of crude attempts to interfere in the domestic affairs of socialist countries and to create obstacles to their development. Those responsible intend to use economic sanctions and restrictions on trade with them.51.	The ""crusade"" against the countries of the socialist community  as its initiators call it  includes psychological warfare  as well as political and material support for counter-revolutionary and subversive acts; it has as its objective the destruction of socialism as a socio-political system and ideology. History since 1917 provides examples of a series of such plans. Their ill-fated end is well-known.52.	The hegemonistic actions of imperialism against the developing countries are being stepped up  especially against those countries which are fighting for their national and social liberation and are unwilling to succumb to foreign diktat  defending their right to political and economic independence against those which are rich in natural resources or are strategically situated.53.	It is hard to find a region which the United States has not claimed as a sphere of its ""vital interests""  arrogating to itself the right to ""defend"" those ""interests"" by all possible means  including the use of force. We all know who is maintaining tension in many parts of the world by dispatching military armadas and rapid deployment forces  by setting up military bases in close proximity to the borders of socialist and other democratic countries  We all know who is interfering in the internal aRairs of sovereign States and is supporting reactionary and dictatorial regimes in a number of countries.54.	This policy of seeking a position of strength breeds an atmosphere of particular tension  impedes political  economic  cultural and other ties  strains relations among States and  in effect  poses a strong threat to world peace and security.55.	The outcome of the battle  however  can by no means be decided in favor of militarism and hegemonism. The threat of war is. real; yet war is not inevitable. Peace is threatened but is not doomed. It can and must be preserved. There are forces in the world which are doing a great deal to stand up to the policy of aggression and are honorably carrying out their peaceful mission in the name of life and progress. The countries of the socialist community are in the vanguard of those forces. A significant role is being played by the majority of non-aligned countries and those Western States which cherish peace and value the fruits of detente. This powerful front of peace relies on the will of all peoples to live in peace  as evidenced by the unprecedentedly large-scale anti-war movement.56.	True to their principled and consistent foreign policy  the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the other countries of the socialist community are guided by their firm conviction that there is no more vital task than that of guaranteeing the peaceful development of mankind. Proceeding from this position they consider it their supreme duty to continue  through concerted and vigorous actions  doing everything possible in order to avert a nuclear war and to eliminate even the very threat of it. This means putting an end to the arms race and proceeding to real disarmament in the field of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  as well as in the field of conventional weapons; it means restoring  continuing and deepening the process of detente; it means strengthening confidence among countries; it means consistent and patient concerted efforts  through negotiations  to achieve a solution to the problems which undermine international security and to create a propitious climate for a direct dialogue between the East and the West  to solve the problems of developing countries and promote international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States of different social systems.57.	Evidence of the readiness of the socialist countries to work for the cause of peace and security is their initiatives and proposals.58.	This goal was served by the peace program of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was served by the decision of the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Were the other nuclear Powers to assume the same obligation  that would in practice be tantamount to the banning of nuclear weapons and reducing to a minimum the possibility of nuclear conflict. That cause is further served by the proposal to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. It is also served by the proposal that the governing bodies of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty make declarations to the effect that the spheres of operation of those alliances would not be extended to include Asia  Africa and Latin America. It is served by the proposals put forward from this rostrum two days ago to accelerate the elaboration and signing of a treaty for the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  to declare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions  including those for peaceful purposes and to declare the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities  even by conventional weapons  as tantamount to an attack with nuclear weapons. We support the inclusion of these items in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly.59.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria greatly appreciates the contribution made by the countries of the non-aligned movement to the solution of the acute problems facing the world today. We will continue to expand our co-operation with the non-aligned countries in the struggle against imperialism  for the strengthening of peace and security  for disarmament and detente  for restructuring international economic relations on a just and democratic basis  for consolidating the independence and sovereignty of the newly independent States and for eradicating the last vestiges of colonialism  as well as those of neo-colonialism and apartheid.60.	We respect the positions of those Western statesmen and heads of Government who are well aware that a nuclear war  no matter how well its strategists might plan it or by what name they might call it  will recognize neither frontiers nor neutrality and that such a war would be sheer madness and would mean the end of human civilization. One concrete expression of political realism and common sense is the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe adopted at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly  which emphasizes that States and statesmen that would be the first to use nuclear weapons would commit the gravest of crimes against humanity.61.	It is our profound conviction that the safeguarding of peace can and must be the concern of all. Only through a steadfast struggle with the united efforts and the concerted decisive actions of all progressive forces which possess enormous potential  can peace be guaranteed on a lasting and reliable basis. As Todor Zhivkov  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  recently stated:""Nothing must prevent all parties  organizations  movements and individuals conscious of how grave a peril to mankind a nuclear war can be from finding their place and playing a fitting role in the struggle for peace and against the nuclear threat.""62.	We reaffirm our position that there is no other road to solving any international problem than the road of negotiations. The 1970s have proved that  given the presence of goodwill and realism and with strict respect for the principle of equality and the equal security of countries  it is possible  although not without difficulty  to reach important international agreements on even such extremely complex questions as the limitation of strategic arms. Of course what I have in mind are not talks that would serve to screen the arms race  but rather a businesslike and frank dialogue that could lead to concrete and positive results. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always been in favor of such an approach  and it will continue to support it.63.	Such fundamental present-day issues as peace and security must always be approached with a sense of high responsibility. My country is of the opinion that negotiations currently under way should be intensified so that they may achieve concrete results  and it is our hope that the Madrid meeting will successfully complete its work and adopt a decision to convene a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. For this purpose a constructive approach on the part of all participating States is needed. The same holds true for the talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe  and particularly for the Soviet- American negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe and on limiting and reducing strategic arms.64.	In our view  every possible effort should be made to eliminate sources of tension. It is imperative to reach a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem as soon as humanly possible. It is our view that the plan put forward by Leonid Ilych Brezhnev  with which the basic provisions of the plan that emerged from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in Fez coincide  provides all necessary measures for eliminating that dangerous hotbed of tension. The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the idea of convening an international conference on a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem  with the participation  on an equal footing  of all the parties concerned  including the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.65.	We have repeatedly called for an end to the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran and for solving the disputes between the two countries through peaceful means.66.	My country reiterates its position of principle on the settlement of the Cyprus question in the interests of both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots while preserving the independence  territorial integrity and the policy of non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.67.	We are in favor of granting full independence to Namibia in compliance with the decisions of the United Nations.68.	The vital interests of the peoples of South-East Asia require that we recognize existing political realities  that an end be put to the interference by the imperialist and hegemonist forces in the internal affairs of those peoples and that the attempts being made to pit them against one another be brought to a halt. What the peoples of the region need is peace  stability and co-operation. The constructive proposals of the three countries of Indo-Chinaóthe socialist Republic of Vie' Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampucheaóare designed to achieve that very goal  and it is for that reason that we fully support them.69.	Efforts should be continued to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace in accordance with United Nations decisions.70.	We support the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea.71.	With regard to the problem that has arisen in the South Atlantic and which  its essence  is one of decolonization  in our view a just solution should be sought through negotiations in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly.72.	In stressing the important role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of security throughout the world  we support the proposal of the Secretary-General f*n the convening of a meeting of the Security Council at the highest level to consider ways and means of enhancing its effectiveness in the interests of attaining the objectives of the Organization.73.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always pursued and will continue to pursue a policy of peace  mutual understanding and co-operation among all nations. By way of example  I would mention the program of the Twelfth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party for enhancing detente and promoting good-neighborly relations in the Balkans  and also the proposal of President Todor Zhivkov with regard to turning the Balkan peninsula into a nuclear-weapon- free zone  which is consonant with the purposes of the United Nations.74.	The international situation urgently demands active efforts and concrete actions from all of us to eliminate the nuclear threat halt the arms race  extinguish hotbeds of tension  to guarantee international security and a tranquil future for the peoples  and to ensure peace throughout the world. I wish to assure the Assembly that the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to make its contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to ensure the achievement of these objectives."
"15",708,"BHR",37,1982,"):  I take pleasure in congratulating you   Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your effective contribution to the work of the United Nations and your long service to your country  the Hungarian People's Republic  have won you the confidence of the delegations participating in this session. We hope that your work will be crowned with the success to which we all look forward  so that the resolutions of this session may reflect the aspirations of the inter-national community and deal with the most important questions and issues on the international scene. I am pleased also to pay a tribute to your predeces-80r  Mr. Kittani  for the constructive efforts he made and the ability and great skill with which he led the work of the last session and the special sessions of the General Assembly this year.72.	I take pleasure also   on  behalf of the  State of  Bahrain  in congratulating Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as Secretary-General. His election to this high international position is a recognition of his outstanding skill and experience in the work of the United Nations. I should like here also to commend him on the valuable report he submitted to the General Assembly at this session. It contains a useful analysis of current international relations and the challenges confronting the Organization  and it will assist us in dealing with the questions and issues on the agenda.73.	Since the last session the world has witnessed exceedingly dangerous developments in international relations  where methods of conflicts and confrontation have pre-empted those dialogue and negotiation. Rivalry between the combatant groups has intensified  increasing the number of wars and disputes and undermining international peace and security  as has happened in Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Middle East. Israel invaded Lebanon and destroyed Beirut  the way in the Falkland Islands broke out  the Irano-Iraqi war continues and Afghanistan is still suffering from foreign military intervention. The situation in Kampuchea is still serious and no settlement of the question of Cyprus has been reached. We live today in a world dominated by selfishness and force  the imposition of the will of the victor on the vanquished and the reaping by the aggressor of the fruits of his aggression. This situation constitutes a serious change in international relations  which further intensifies disputes and regional and inter-national crises.74.	In our review at the twenty-sixth session of international events  we referred to the establishment of the Gulf Co-operation Council as a viable and constructive institution for collective regional co-operation to meet the aspirations and ambitions of the people of the region. The six member States have agreed in the Charter of the Council to abide by their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations  to act together to preserve peace  security and stability in the region without foreign intervention  and to develop political  economic  cultural and social relations among themselves and with other States in the world for their benefit and that of the world as a whole. As a result of the continuous efforts and work of the leaders of the Gulf Arab States  the Council has been able  within the short period that has elapsed since its establishment in May 1981  to co-ordinate the efforts and policies of the States of the region in regard to international issues. The unified economic agreement which was concluded in November last year laid down sound bases for economic self-sufficiency among these States and for the co-ordination of their commercial and economic policies with those of other States and other regional economic groups. The establishment of the Council is a living example of constructive regional co-operation and co-ordination based on the common interests of the people of the region  to provide them with security  stability and prosperity.75. The Middle East region witnessed this 'year the recurrence of serious events which threaten to undermine world peace  as a result of the criminal Israeli invasion of Lebanon  which constitutes a dangerous precedent in international relations and takes humanity back to the law of the jungle. Lebanon is exposed now to the ugliest forms of aggression  occupation and destruction. The Palestinian people face- the danger of physical liquidation and mass extermination by unprecedented means.76. Israel  which claims to be a small State surrounded by other States which surpass ~t in number and resources claims that it wants peace with its neighbours. At the same time  it occupies Arab territories one after the other  expelling and killing the legitimate inhabitants in order to annex such territories to its racist settlements. It subjects the rest of the inhabitants of those territories to the worst forms suppression  injustice and torture in an attempt to drive them out and replace them by Zionist settlers coming from the four corners of the world. it builds settlements on the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights  in addition to annexing Arab Jerusalem and declaring it its permanent capital  annexing the Golan Heights and attacking the Iraqi nuclear reactor designed for peaceful purposes an attack contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and many resolutions in this respect We ask the Assembly whether such a policy  based on aggression and expansion  implies in fact a desire for peace?77. The tragedy of the Middle East arises from the denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian question is the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute. A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East region can be attained only by the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  particularly their right to establish their independent State on their national soil.78. The question of Palestine which has existed since the establishment of the United Nations is no longer unknown to anybody in its dimensions and the tragedy of its people. It is the question of a people expelled from its home and land  and denied for more than 34- years the exercise of its inalienable rights. That people  more than any other people in history  is still suffering from homelessnes3  deprivation and mass extermination at the hands of world Zionism. In spite of the recognition by the United Nations of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to their homeland  Israel denies them these rights and ignores all the United Nations resolutions which acknowledge even part of the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.79. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon aimed at the complete subjugation of that peaceful country and the destruction of its independence and sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. We warned from the start of the consequences that such aggression could have on Lebanon and the repercussions it would have on the situation in the Middle East in general  and the Palestinian question in particular. To inform the world public of the dangers of such aggression  the Arab States have contacted all States permanent members' of the Security Council urging them to contain this serious situation  put an end to it and expose its dangers and repercussions. They have asked them to shoulder their responsibilities under the provisions of the Charter for the maintenance of peace and security  and to stop the massacre and acts of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian and Lebanese people. They Have also asked for an international move to' put an end to such unprovoked aggression save the independence of Lebanon and the integrity of its territory. implement Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509  1982  which call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the invading Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories  and support the efforts of the Lebanese Government to exercise its legitimate authority and complete sovereignty within the internationally recognized borders of Lebanon.80. Terrorism has become the overt policy of Israel. as confirmed by the tragic events which have taken place recently in Lebanon. The world public has expressed its deep anger and disgust at the appalling slaughter engaged in by Israel and its followers against the unarmed civilians of west Beirut and the ugly massacres perpetrated against the inhabitants of the Shatila and Sabra camps  causing the death of hundreds of Palestinian families  mostly children  old people and women. This brings back to our mind the massacre carried out at Deir Yassin in Palestine in 1948 by the terrorist Irgun Gang. led by the present Prime Minister of Israel.81.	Israel  acting its violation of the agreement made with the Lebanese government and the three States participating in the multinational peace force in Lebanon  carried out these ugly massacres after the departure of the Palestinian fighters from west Beirut.82.		At this crucial time  we appeal to the conscience of the world  which is represented by the members here  to see to it that the Organization moves from the stage of adopting resolutions of condemnation to that of implementing those resolutions. We consider that it is the duty of the General Assembly to request the Security Council to reconsider the relations of the United Nations with Israel  which is not a peace-loving Member and is bent on aggression and expansionism  are shown by violations of international agreements and persistent breaches of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.83.	Israel claims that peace and security are the reason for its motivation of Lebanon  its annexation of the Golan Heights and its inhuman practices against the inhabitants of the occupied Arab territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  but it is in fact bent on more expansion  aggression and domination. No Member of the United Nations may invade and occupy the territory of another Member on the pretext of strengthening and defending its borders  Israel has made s security the excuse for perpetuating its expansionist policy in Arab territories.84. Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights  in spite of Security Council resolution 497 (1981)  means that it has no intention of withdrawing from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 but is aiming at the Judaization of those territories to serve the ambitions and interests of zionism in the region.85. Israel's occupation of Arab territories does not confer on Israel any sovereignty over those territories however long that occupation may last. Its attempt to legitimize its occupa6:m of those territories i~ in clear breach of the principles of international law  particularly the Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of. War; of 12 August 1949.86. It is indeed regrettable that the world has witnessed the aggressive and criminal practices of Israel in Lebanon  the West Bank and the Golan Heights without the Security Council having been able to carry out its responsibilities and deter Israel from pursuing its aggression. because of the use of the veto by the United States of America time and time again to prevent the Security Council from adopting deterrent measures under Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter.87.	We believe that it is necessary to impose sanctions on Israel  to compel it to respond to the will of the international community. We ardently hope that the General Assembly will urge the Security Council to carry out its duty of maintaining peace and security in the Middle East by adopting the necessary measures under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to compel Israel to stop its aggression and end its occupation of Lebanon and other Arab territories and its annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights. We al50 hope that the United States of America will take a stand in keeping with its great responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Counsil.88.	We support the international call for an investigation of the atrocious crimes committed by Israel against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples and callfor an international trial of Israel for the mass killings and criminal acts it perpetrated by using internationally banned shells and weapons and destroying buildings over the heads of their occupation in one of the harshest and ugliest acts of genocide  which .vas witnessed daily by the whole world through the mass media.89.	The Palestinian people have proved their fighting ability by their heroic stand against the Israeli invasion. They have prove to the world that they are not merely a tiny group of terrorists  as Israel claims but people struggling to retain their legitimate rights. The Palestinian people s heroic struggle  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization has enhanced the prestige of that organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and strengthened the loyalty of the Palestinian people to the PLO.90. Early last month  the leaders of the Arab States held the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. My country was one of those Arab States that participated in the Conference. The Conference issued a unified Arab plan for the solution of the Palestinian question. This plan represents a genuine desire to find a durable solution of the 'Palestinian question and the problem of the Middle East. It consists of eight points  which  in our view  are a good basis for the solution of the problems relating to the situation in Palestine and the Middle East. It is based on international legality as represented by the principles and relevant resolutions of the United Nations  starting with General Assembly resolution 181 (11) on the partition of Palestine.91. The plan ensures respect for international resolutions and guarantees the Palestinian people the minimum of their rights as prescribed in United Nations resolutions  including their right to sovereignty  self-determination and the exercise of their inalienable national rights on their national soil. It guarantees freedom of worship to all religions in the Holy Places.92. The plan consists of the following eight points. First  the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  including Arab Al Quds; secondly  the dismantling of settlements established by Israel on Arab territories after 1967; thirdly  the guarantee of freedom of worship and practice of religious rites for all religions in the holy shrines; fourthly  the reaffirmation of the Palestinian people's right to self- determination and the exercise of its imprescriptible and inalienable national rights  under the leadership of the PLO  its sole and legitimate representative  and the identification of all those who do not desire to return; fifthly  the placing of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the control of the United Nations for a transitory period not exceeding a few months; sixthly  the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al Quds as its capital; seventhly  the guaranteeing by the Security Council of peace among all States of the region  including the independent Palestinian State; and eighthly  the guaranteeing by the Security Council of respect for these principles.93. This plan is in keeping with United Nations resolutions on the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. It strengthens the role of the United Nations in establishing durable peace in the region. It is in line with the? call of the Secretary- General in his report of the work of the Organization to establish a more stable system in the world based on international collective security and to encourage the use of the machinery of the Charter for this purpose. We believe that-his plan provides a good opportunity for ""the solution of a question which has proved difficult to solve during the past three decades-a question which  if it remains unsolved  will threaten the whole world with grave dangers. Therefore  we appeal to all States to support this plan and work towards its implementation  in order to maintain peace and security in that sensitive part 'of the world.95. The Iraqi-Iranian war has now entered its third year  since it broke out in September 1:•80. This war has begun to take on new and more dangerous dimensions threatening to create• an explosive situation in the whole region. There is no doubt that if this war continues  it will spread and drive the whole region into the turmoil of an international conflict.96.	We have on more than one occasion expressed great concern and deep sorrow at the continuation of the dispute between Iraq and Iran and called for a stop to this long and bloody conflict in order to avert more bloodshed and rescue both countries from the ravages and destruction of war.97.	We earnestly hope that these two neighbour States will be able to negotiate a just and durable solution to their dispute  particularly after the withdrawal by Iraq of its forces from the international border and its declaration that it is ready to negotiate with Iran and solve the differences existing between them by peaceful means. We also hope 'ha' the good offices of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the non-aligned countries and the United Nations will succeed in securing a cease-fire between the two countries and finding a solution to their differences by peaceful means. We continue to welcome  as we did before  the response of the sister country of Iraq to the mediation efforts of the Good Offices Committee  particularly its readiness to observe a cease- fire and withdraw its forces to the international border. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will also respond to the mediation efforts of that Committee in the same manner as Iraq has already done.98. The situation in the Horn of Africa is still a source of concern and instability. We hope that disputes and differences in that region will be solved by peaceful means within the framework of the OAU so that a peaceful settlement that will be just for all parties may be reached so that the people and States in that region of the world may be enabled to Jive together in peace  security and amity.99.	As regards Western Sahara  we regret the failure of the efforts of the OAU to settle that question peacefully  and we hope that collective efforts will be made to find a just solution to this dispute so that peace and stability may prevail in the region.lOO. We welcome the efforts for the independence of Namibia made by some Western States in the contact group. We welcome the positive steps taken to implement the United Nations plan for the independence of that country pursuant to Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the proper legal frame-work for the peaceful settlement of the Namibian question. We should like to reaffirm Bahrain's support for and solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO. We appeal to all States Members of the United Nations to put pressure on the Government of Pretoria and to impose sanctions against it under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to compel it to abandon the detested policy of apartheid it practises against the black majority of the people of South Africa and to support the struggle of that majority to regain its legitimate rights to freedom  equality and human dignity.101. Faithful to the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States  the State of Bahrain has called for an end to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. We have made clear before the Assembly our stand with regard to the settlement of the Afghan question. We are still convinced that there should be a political solution to this question in accordance with the United Nations resolutions that ca)) for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan  for respect for Its sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status and for respect for the right of the people of Afghanistan freely to choose their political  economic and social system free from any foreign intervention in their domestic affairs.102. With regard to the Korean question  the State of Bahrain  respecting the will of the Korean people  welcomes the efforts made to settle peacefully the dispute between North and South. We hope these will lead to the establishment of peace and security under a unified State free from any foreign intervention.103.	The world economic situation is no better this year than it was last year. The world economy still suffers from recession and inflation. The gross national product of some developing countries has diminished because of the scarcity of national resources and the decrease of financial aid and loans from developed to developing countries  particularly to those of low income. The global negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order still face difficulties that are caused by the policies and positions of the developed countries. The hopes that were pinned on the International Meeting on Economic Co-operation and Development  which was held at Cancun in 1981  to establish a just and fair new international economic order have been dashed. No tangible Progress has been made in the global negotiations between the developed and the developing countries in narrowing the gap between their policies  although both are equally convinced of the fact of the inter-dependence of interests in world economic relations. We cannot conceive of a just and fair international economic order that would solve the problems and meet the needs of the world without changing current international economic   relations   to   remove   the injustice and. inequality that exist in the present international economic order.104.. It is indeed regrettable that the second special session on disarmament  held last June  ended without any appreciable results in the efforts of the United Nation to adopt a comprehensive programme of disarmament valid to the end of this century. The failure to adopt effective measures at that session is the result  in our view  of the deterioration of the international situation  regional conflicts and the policy of confrontation in the relations between the great Powers  shrouded as they are in suspicion as well as rivalry  the arms race and non adherence to the concept of collective security prescribed in  the Charter.105.	In this context  we applaud the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues prepared under the chairmanship of Olof Palme and entitled ""Common Security-a program for disarmament. That report stresses the Importance of survival  rather than the annihilation that threatens humanity  in objective  impartial and independent way and points out the fatal dangers in the manufacture and trade in arms. It emphasizes the need for confidence among States before an attempt is made to achieve international disarmament.106. We hope that the General Assembly will consider the report with the attention it deserves so that the huge amounts of money spent on armaments may be rechanneled to projects for economic and social development  for the maintenance of security and for affording prosperity to mankind.107. After nine sessions of negotiations and exhaustive discussions  the Third United Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea was able to adopt a comprehensive convention which IS regarded as a great achievement by the United Nations in the field of the regulation and codification of the rules of the law of the sea and the exploitation of the resources of the seas and oceans  which are the common heritage of mankind. We hope that all States participating in the Conference will accept the Convention4 after it is signed at the final session of the Conference.108. In spite of the failure of the United Nations to accomplish many of the purposes and principles for which It was established  particularly those having to do with international disputes and crises  it has been able to do great and positive things in many fields--economic  cultural  humanitarian and others. This emphasizes the importance of its existence and the need to support its principles and activities and to act for the implementation of its resolutions so as to strengthen its role in international life.109. My country's delegation hopes that at this session the General Assembly will adopt appropriate resolutions to strengthen confidence among Member States and to meet the aspirations of the people of the world. I have the honour to state from this rostrum  on behalf of the Government and people of Bahrain  our complete readiness to act in this direction  with the other peoples and States represented in this international forum  for the achievement of peace  justice and prosperity. Bahrain will continue to abide by its obligations to the United Nations and to be faithful to the Charter  for the accomplishment of the goals for which the Organization was established in 1945."
"16",746,"BHS",37,1982,"I should like to begin  Sir  by extending to you my congratulations and those of the delegation of the Bahamas on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will carry out the mandate of your high office with the perseverance  ingenuity for which you are well known. My delegation is pleased to offer you its full co-operation in making this session a successful and constructive one. I take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who held the office during a difficult period. Yet he spared no effort to find solutions to the problems before us  left a clear imprint of patience and skill and displayed exemplary distinction in the conduct of the affairs of the General Assembly. My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the new Secretary-General Car the dynamic  courageous and untiring effort and initiative he has already displayed in upholding the principles and objectives of the United Nations. We are particularly pleased that he is a son of our Latin American region and we pledge the support of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for his continuing efforts in the pursuit of peace and harmony among nations.It is fortuitous that I should be addressing the Assembly today  12 October 1982  the four hundred and ninetieth anniversary of the landing by the intrepid mariner Christopher Columbus en the island now known as San Salvador in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. That event  as we all know  marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the world and of the Americas. The Bahamas is proud of the role which fate destined it to play in the early history of our hemisphere  and it is in this spirit that the Bahamas wishes to place on record its intention to bring before the Assembly at the appropriate time a resolution to commemorate the quincentennial anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the New World.The Bahamas has devoted itself to the establishment and development of a peaceful and stable world order. This is essential prerequisite if progress is to continue towards improving the quality of life of our own people and that of other nations of the world. Yet  as one reviews the international situation over the past year  it is evident that peace and security have been frequently shattered  with very serious consequences  in various regions. A number of conflicts have interrupted international tranquility and resulted in heavy losses of human life and considerable material damage We in the Bahamas are profoundly saddened by the events in Lebanon. We believe in the sanctity of human life in a world seemingly desensitized by violence and murder. We therefore deplore the mass murders  particularly of innocent men  women and children  in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatsla. Those responsible for such atrocities should be held accountable. Unless the United Nations is able to deal effectively with such situations so as to serve as a deterrent to others  then it will indeed become a useless institution.The wishes of the Government and people of Lebanon must be respected and its sovereignty and territorial integrity restored. Accordingly  we urge the speedy withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon We are also deeply disappointed by the absence of full compliance with the series of Security Council resolutions on this matter. The use of force against any nation must not take the place of reason.The right of all nations  including Israel and Lebanon  to exist in peace and security must be respected. There must also be recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination. Recent events in the Middle East give a clear indication that a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East is now more than ever an imperative.It is regrettable that Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran could not resolve their problems except by war. The conflict continues to threaten the stability of the region and  given the interdependence of relations among States  contributes to international economic dislocation.We therefore appeal to the parties to put an end to the hostilities and to arrive at a negotiated settlement in accordance with Security Council resolutions 479 (1980) and 514 (1982). We are profoundly appreciative of the Secretary-General's coordinated mediation efforts aimed at preventing a further prolongation of the conflict and at finding a solution to the differences to the two sides.The South Atlantic has not been spared the use of force  costly in both human and material terms. We would encourage the parties to bring about a formal end to the conflict in order that negotiations may commence with a view to a final and lasting settlement.The Bahamas is concerned by the violation of the fundamental principles on which the Organization is founded  especially the principle that the threat or use of force in international relations is prohibited. This principle is particularly significant for small States and territories with limited resources.The dispute between Guyana and Venezuela owing to the latter's revival of the claim to Guyana's territory is another area of concern in our hemisphere. The Bahamas accepts that a judicial solution to this problem has already been found under international law. We urge that Venezuela respect Guyana's territorial integrity and that the two parties arrive at a peaceful solution in the spirit of the purposes and principles of the Charter and of the agreements concluded between them.We continue to hope for an early  peaceful and comprehensive solution to the situation in Cyprus. We are cognizant of the gravity of the situation and of its implications for the well-being of the peoples involved and for the continuance of their national unity  based on their collective will  unhindered by outside forces. However  we must begin seriously to consider measures for improving the effectiveness of the Organization  for in the Cyprus question we see once again a situation where the decisions taken by the Organization have not led to significant progress.Peace is indivisible. Violations of peace are to be deplored. Indeed  recourse to the use of force is apparently becoming a norm in international relations  to the detriment of countries both large and small. The proscription of the threat or use of force  the principles of sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes are indispensable norms of international life which must be respected by all.The world economy continues to be caught in the most severe recession since the great depression of the 1930s. The per capita gross national product for developing countries as a whole has fallen for the first time since the 1950s. The present downward spiral follows two decades of exceptional growth and development in both industrialized and developing countries. But now there are serious doubts with respect to the prospects of growth during the rest of the decade. The concern of Governments with immediate domestic problems has intensified; protectionist tendencies have re-emerged; recession  inflation and high interest rates in the developed countries have had an adverse impact on tourism and financial and technological resources flows  especially foreign direct investment  in the developing countries.It is hoped that agreement can be reached on the framework and early launching of global negotiations. The asymmetrical nature of the interdependence between States has underscored the need for measures to redress the structural imbalances in the world economy  particularly in the areas of trade  raw materials  energy  money and finance. In our view  recovery and global negotiations should not be regarded as incompatible. The participating heads of Government at the Versailles Economic Summit in June agreed that the launching of global negotiations was a major political objective. That was a positive development. But further efforts in good faith are required to resolve the amendments and counter-amendments to the proposal of the Group of 77 regarding the basis for consultations.Interdependence and the consequent necessity for international economic co-operation are basic principles of international economic relations  as amply reflected in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The uncertainty which has clouded international economic co-operation must be removed. International co-operation must again be set on the track towards world economic recovery and economic development of the developing countries.During the three decades that the General Assembly has been considering the question of apartheid the overwhelming majority of mankind has rallied to the cause of eliminating that affront to human dignity. In this International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa  the international community should continue to take energetic and concerted action in support of the legitimate struggle of the oppressed peoples of South Africa for human rights. The need for collective action is underscored by the continuing designation by South Africa of so- called independent homelands and by threats and acts of aggression against the front-line States of southern Africa.While the case of the violation of human rights in South Africa is a blatant and obvious one  the existence and persistence of human rights violations throughout the world  in States Members of the United Nations  cannot be denied. The United Nations system has developed an increasingly complex network of international instruments and machinery to address the problems of human rights violations. Yet lack of consensus on human rights issues  double standards and a growing trend towards selectivity have undoubtedly impeded the efficiency of this machinery. Unless the United Nations is prepared constructively to utilize existing human rights machinery in a non- political humanitarian manner  universally applicable solutions to problems of human rights violations will not be found.The direct responsibility of the United Nations for Namibia cannot end until genuine self-determination and independence are achieved in a united Namibia. My delegation is aware of reports of continuing mediation efforts by the Western contact group and of guarded progress in resolving the outstanding issues. Nevertheless  we call upon South Africa to desist from defying resolutions adopted by the United Nations for the early independence of Namibia. South Africa should not continue to use extraneous issues as an excuse for delaying or refusing to cooperate in the emancipation of Namibia.At the recently concluded second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the Bahamas stated that the challenge facing us all was how to move from awareness  statements of intent  machinery and procedures to genuine and concrete disarmament measures. The Bahamas also elaborated briefly on how that challenge could be squarely and honestly met. Yet it seemed that we could not resolve the contradictions that existed between motivation  words and action  and that special session ended in failure. Increased militarization  far beyond legitimate security needs  only serves to increase international tension and exacerbate international conflict. Thus  it behaves us all —nuclear-weapon States  militarily significant States  non-militarily significant States—to work collectively towards significant disarmament measures which will restore the confidence of our peoples in the worth and effectiveness of the United Nations.Mankind can no longer justify the enormous resources spent on armaments. The poverty  hunger and underdevelopment that face so many States demand a redirection of those valuable resources. In addition  the potential destructiveness of those modem weapon systems is reason enough to bring mankind to its senses and to the realization of man's true purpose in this universe. My delegation realizes that some progress has been made towards disarmament  but we must register our strong concern at the slow pace of that progress.The problem of drug abuse has come to be regarded  rightfully  as a universal one. It affects every region of the world. Over the past several years  the Latin American region has seemingly become a new focal point for international drug traffickers  as production and trafficking  primarily in cannabis  hashish  cocaine and methaqualone have significantly increased. The Bahamas  once uninvolved in such matters  has become increasingly alarmed by the realization that it has become a major conduit for the illicit traffic moving from sources and supply centers in South America to large and profitable consumption centers in North America and Europe.In this connection the Bahamas was pleased to be elected to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. It had its first opportunity  at the seventh special session  held at Vienna in February of this year  to voice its concern with regard to the illicit traffic in the Latin American region and  in particular  in the Caribbean sub-region. The dilemma of transit States cannot be overstated. They can exercise no control over the illicit production of or the illicit demand for narcotic drugs. As victims of international drug traffickers  they are forced to sacrifice much to control a problem that is not of their making. The Bahamas is therefore grateful for United Nations intervention in the form of a study of the problems of transit States.The strengthening of international response to the problem of drug abuse is vital. The Bahamas therefore views the adoption at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the International Drug Abuse Control Strategy  and the five-year programme of action to implement the Strategy as a significant step. Drug trafficking can affect any State  whether producer  consumer or transit. In this regard it is the hope of the Bahamas that initiatives undertaken to focus  within the context of the Strategy  on the actual movement of illicit drugs will be supported.Only consistency of purpose at the bilateral  regional and international levels will retard illicit production of  traffic in and demand for narcotic drugs. Despite its limited resources the Bahamas will continue  in conjunction with Member States and the United Nations  to play an active role in the struggle against drug abuse.The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has succeeded  after many years of lengthy negotiations  in producing a Convention which is unprecedented in scope and size—a major milestone in international co-operation and a fundamental contribution to international order and stability. A comprehensive document which is in many respects innovative has been negotiated. Compromises have been made to arrive at a generally acceptable convention which constitutes a delicate balance between conflicting interests. Within the United Nations system  the work of the Conference is an example for the international community of what can be achieved by multilateral negotiations.The Bahamas is an archipelagic nation. We are therefore particularly gratified that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea contains provisions for the delimitation of the national frontiers of archipelagic States. This Convention corrects a serious omission in the law of the sea  as the two previous texts did not address the circumstances peculiar to archipelagic States.We had hoped the Convention would receive the unanimous support of the international community  and we continue to hope that it will. It is none the less our sincere desire that those governments that have so far indicated their non-participation will  in the final analysis  come to the conclusion that their national interests would be best secured by participation in the new form of true international co-operation represented by the Convention.The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization raised the central issue of the capacity of the United Nations to keep the peace and to serve as a forum for negotiations. The Bahamas congratulates the Secretary-General on the approach taken in his first report and concurs with his analysis of the factors and circumstances which appear to have contributed to the impaired effectiveness of the Organization. We subscribe also to the view that the present tendency of bypassing the Organization in situations where it should and could play a vital  constructive role is damaging and dangerous for the future of the United Nations.The Bahamas is of the view that a major role should be played by the United Nations in dealing with issues of universal concern and in taking the initiative in the promotion of international peace  justice and co-operation. We reaffirm our commitment to making this body a more effective instrument in bringing about positive changes in the world."
"17",818,"BLR",37,1982,"Mr. President  please accept my warm congratulations on your election to your high office. It is a great pleasure to see the representative of the fraternal Hungarian People's Republic presiding over the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly and we wish you every success in your work.The period since the last regular session of the Assembly has been filled with complex and contradictory events. The peoples have persistently demanded that the threat of nuclear war be averted  the arms race curbed and disarmament achieved  but those in the belligerent circles of imperialism have been accelerating the arms race and pushing the world towards nuclear catastrophe. Mass anti war demonstrations have gained in strength  and we have been deafened by the explosion of the bombs of the aggressors. The national liberation movements have broadened in scope  and the colonialists and racists have mounted ominous plans for suppressing  those movements. Peace loving peoples have won new and constructive victories  while the forces of imperialism and reaction have developed monstrous doctrines and programmes for the mass extermination of human beings and to undermine the process of detente and co operation. In this new tense international situation the peoples of the world are once again realizing that there is no task more important or more urgent today than that of defending peace and averting the threat of nuclear war. That cannot be refuted by those whose statements at this session have constituted merely another routine attempt to distort the real picture of the present day world and to shift all the blame for its troubles from themselves to innocent parties.As has already been noted during this session of the General Assembly  the current aggravation of the international situation and the mounting threat of war are due to the fact that some Western States  above all the United States  persist in policies inimical to the interests of peace. The situation is all the more alarming in that some of those States are permanent members of the Security Council and their policies are totally in conflict with the particular responsibility for international security and the preservation of peace that the Charter places upon them.A close analysis of statements by leading United States officials on the substance of the military and political problems  in the world today and a careful analysis of the goals of the intensive rearmament programme that has been launched in the United States and of the strategic concepts being put forward cannot but show that Washington's present course is by no means peace oriented. We have all heard the frank statement at the 11th meeting by the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Shultz  that the United States is guided in its actions by the principle of the position of force and will be unswerving in its use of it. Is this not an express policy of military and political confrontation  a policy of seizing dominant positions on a global scale is it not making this all part of a fundamental principleIt would be difficult to imagine a political credo in greater opposition to the requirements of the Charter. The policy of discarding in practice the principle of equality and equal security  which  in this nuclear age  is an absolutely vital principle  erodes the mainstays of the structure of relations between States and contributes to the threat of war.The United States is provoking tension and protracting conflicts; it acts on its own behalf and through proxies in order to justify the further buildup of arms and its growing demand that its allies toe the line. The United States is instigating an anti communist crusade and is spreading lies about an alleged Soviet threat and other fabrications in order to impose its latest missiles on the territories of others and to cause an impasse in disarmament talks. Those provocative actions are camouflaged by demagogic utterances about a commitment to peace through strength; to the prevention of wars in general. But the legitimate question arises of whether the authors of those pronouncements did not indeed have an opportunity  for example  to prevent or halt the Israeli aggression in Lebanon.Acting at variance with the commitment to prevent nuclear war they entered into in the 1970s  Washington's strategists are now proclaiming the admissibility and even the acceptability of a nuclear conflict. The world has been subjected to cynical bombast about first  second and subsequent nuclear strikes  about nuclear escalation in doses  about demonstrative and selective use of nuclear weapons  and so forth. Over the past year and a half  the United States has put forward more different concepts of the use of force primarily in a nuclear context than in any preceding decade. They talk about a secured nuclear war  then they talk about limited war  about blitzkrieg  and about protracted war.All these statements and actions are permeated with the idea of the first use of nuclear weapons and an insane reliance on winning a nuclear victory. Such notions are the sheerest adventurism  fraught with enormous dangers for mankind. They constitute nothing but naked war propaganda. There can be no doubt that any use of nuclear weapons will cause a chain reaction. That being so  strategic planning of this kind  in any of its versions  represents in actual fact planning for a nuclear catastrophe. But those so called planners ought to be reminded that planning and preparation for of aggression are qualified in international instruments specifically in the Charter of the United Nations  in the judgment of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal  and in the Definition of Aggression and other United Nations documents as a crime against peace and against humanity. Military political stereotypes inherited from the time of the former monopoly on the atom bomb are now outmoded. In his message at the twelfth special session the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Mr. Leonid Brezhnev  described as indisputable and determinant the fact that nuclear war  should it break out  could  in the current international situation  mean the destruction of human civilization and perhaps  en the end of life on Earth.Such is the harsh imperative of this nuclear age: there can be no security for anyone through nuclear adventurism. A nuclear Power can be secure only if its foreign and military policies pose no threat to any other country. As to notions that one's own security can be strengthened by chasing the phantom of military supremacy  plans to achieve such supremacy simply cannot be carried out  and measures undertaken to that end can only aggravate military nations and lower the level of security for all.While  in this nuclear age  strategic stability based on an approximate balance of forces is an extremely important basis for universal security  it is no guarantee of that security. Mankind can free itself from the deadly threat only by gradually lowering the level of military confrontation  through the implementation of agreed measures on the limitation and reduction of armaments and on disarmament. There is no other way  for security and disarmament are inseparably linked.Today's realities demand the adoption of urgent and effective measures for the prevention of nuclear war. Particular responsibility for that lies with the permanent members of the Security Council which are in addition nuclear weapon Powers. In present conditions. the commitment by each nuclear weapon Power not to be the first to use nuclear weapons would be of key significance for removing the threat of nuclear war. That is the express duty of the nuclear Powers; it is their primary responsibility towards mankind.As is known  the USSR  which takes a. very serious view of its status as a nuclear Power and as a permanent member of the Security Council  has already shouldered that responsibility. The step taken by the USSR is a powerful stimulus for the drastic of the threat of nuclear war and for the strengthening of trust in relations between States. The exclusion from international relations of force in all its manifestations  both nuclear and conventional  would be fostered by early completion of the work on a world treaty on the non use of force in international relations  a draft of which was submitted by the Soviet Union in 1976 for consideration by the United Nations. A set of specific and constructive proposals set out in the memorandum of the USSR on Averting the growing nuclear threat and curbing the arms race  which was submitted to the Assembly at its second special session devoted to disarmament creates possibilities for making progress along all avenues leading to the limitation and radical reduction of armaments  whether nuclear weapons  other weapons of mass destruction  including chemical weapons  conventional weapons  or naval activities. There is no kind of weapon which the Soviet Union would not be prepared to limit or ban on a basis of reciprocity. Further evidence of the readiness of the USSR to reduce the nuclear threat  to curb the arms race and to make our planet safer for life and for constructive work is provided by the proposals aimed at the speedy cessation and total prohibition of nuclear weapon testing; these were formulated with due regard for the views and suggestions of many countries  including suggestions regarding verification and regarding an appeal to all the nuclear Powers to declare  within an agreed time frame  a moratorium on all nuclear explosions  pending the conclusion of a treaty banning them completely.The USSR initiative entitled Intensification of efforts to remove the threat of nuclear war and to ensure a safe development of nuclear energy is also of vast significance. That proposal develops further the work already begun on questions of preventing nuclear war and of nuclear disarmament ranging from a simultaneous freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles to the elimination of existing nuclear capabilities as well as of strengthening the security of non nuclear countries. It is designed to ensure the safe development of nuclear energy for constructive purposes in all countries. Any destruction of non military nuclear facilities should unquestionably be qualified as a nuclear attack  which  in the definition of the United Nations  is the gravest crime against humanity.The aggressive actions of the imperialists and their henchmen even today are leading to bloodshed in many flashpoints on our planet. A typical example of this reign of bloody terror a war of annihilation which is nothing short of genocide is the aggression launched by Israel against Lebanon and the Arab people of Palestine. The tragedy in Lebanon has shaken the entire world and provided yet further evidence that in this latest criminal adventure  in addition to all the others  the strategic allies  Israel and the United States  acted hand in hand.Scores of thousands of human beings and the destiny of hundreds of thousands more  have fallen victim to the most sophisticated American military technology  tried out with the help of Israel in Lebanon. In shamelessly arming the aggressor  which has repeatedly been condemned by the United Nations  and overtly and covertly acting as its accomplice  the United States contrary to its obligations as a permanent member of the Security Council is doing everything possible to establish in that area an order which would enable it and its henchmen to do as they please in other people's territories.However  they should know better than to labor under such a delusion. Attempts to rule the destinies of the peoples of the Middle East from Washington or Tel Aviv are inevitably doomed to failure. The selfless struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the courage and determination of the Syrians and the Lebanese  have clearly demonstrated this. The new plan for a Middle East settlement which has been announced by the President of the United States and widely publicized does not contain anything new. The United States proposals are flawed in their very essence. They fail to provide for the liberation of all Arab territories seized in 1967  deny the right of the Palestinians to create their own State and disregard the PLO  This is nothing but a continuance of the treacherous Camp David policy of acquiescence  designed to enslave the peoples of that region.Our position on the Middle East problem has always been and continues to be crystal clear. The complex problem of the Middle East can be resolved only by the concerted efforts of all the parties concerned  which must certainly include the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine. This problem cannot be resolved without strict observance of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by forces; the recognition and exercise of the right of the Arab people of Palestine to self determination and to create their own independent State on Palestinian soil  which must be freed from Israeli occupation; and ensuring the right of all States of the region to a secure existence and development in conditions of mutual respect for sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  with appropriate international guarantees.This is the only course that will lead to a settlement  as envisaged in the Soviet proposal on the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. The results of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez constitute a constructive contribution to the settlement process. We take a positive view of the principles that were adopted at that Conference for the solution of the Palestinian question and the Middle East problem as a whole.Nowadays it is more necessary than ever before for political leaders to demonstrate common sense  clear sightedness  prudence and genuine realism in their approach to the problems that arise. We should also  of course  be guided always by the fact that international detente calls for peaceful co operation with other States  not military preparations or hostility toward other States. Detente is a conscientious observance in good faith of the norms of international law and the principle of non intervention in the internal affairs of others. It also implies a constant desire to contribute by practical action to curbing the arms race in the world and strengthening security by gradually building up mutual confidence on a just and reciprocal basis. This is exactly what the States of the socialist community are doing. Unfortunately  this cannot be said for the United States and its partners in aggressive blocs.Yet another example of the fact that the Washington Administration adheres to diametrically opposite principles is its policy with respect to Afghanistan  South East Asia and the Caribbean. They are trying to achieve their aim of barring the way to social reforms by staging military adventures against peoples seeking freedom and progress. This is clearly demonstrated by the continuing hostile actions of the United States of America against Cuba  Afghanistan  the countries of Indo China; Nicaragua and other States of the world  and this should serve as a warning. It is also shown by its support for reactionary anti people regimes in Chile  South Korea  El Salvador and other countries.The long chain of irrefutable facts indicative of the dangerous course followed by the foreign policy of the United States  which is a threat to peace and social progress  includes the well known action of that country against the anti colonialist struggle of the peoples of the world. When in August 1981 the racists of Pretoria launched their large scale aggression  which is still going on now  against the People's Republic of Angola  the United States chose to act as a forthright advocate of that naked act of aggression. In the Security Council it vetoed the draft resolution strongly condemning the aggression and calling for its immediate cessation. The veto was in no way accidental; it constituted the implementationof what had earlier been proclaimed the new regional strategy of the United States regarding southern Africa.The basic tenets of this strategy  which in its very essence is a doctrine of recolonization  amount to nothing less than a naked threat to use South Africa to bring about the destabilization of independent African States. As regards the Namibian problem  the so called new doctrine basically encourages the South African racists to retain Namibia as a colony of South Africa and to impose on the Namibian people conditions that are advantageous to Pretoria. The Apartheid regime is allowed to use force in pursuing its colonial policy  to employ the piratical methods of the Israeli militarists in Lebanon  and to attempt to destroy the South West Africa People's Organization and to exclude it from participating in decisions on the future of its homeland. The task of the United Nations is to prevent this and to work for the early attainment of independence by the people of Namibia.Washington is known never to have fulfilled its obligations as regards the developing countries. When the conflict between the United Kingdom and Argentina erupted as a result of the stubborn opposition of the United Kingdom to the decolonization of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  the United States ignored its obligations as far as Argentina was concerned  extended the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to Latin America and took advantage of the situation in order openly to assist in the colonialist plunder and to penetrate the South Atlantic region.A vivid example of the policy of force and blackmail as a means of carrying out imperialist plans on a global scale is provided by the actions of the United States aimed at undermining the regional organizations of the developing countries  nullifying the United Nations decision to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean  opposing the drafting of a world treaty on the non use of force in international relations and refusing to sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The same strategy of force is being carried out by the United States in the realm of international economic relations. It is precisely those in the ruling circles of that country that impede by every means available the implementation of United Nations decisions on the establishment of a new international economic order  obstruct the launching of global negotiations and defend in every possible way the activities of transnational corporations  which are detrimental to the sovereignty and the economies of the developing countries.The policy of blackmail and threats is being employed not only against socialist States but also against those developing countries that have chosen the road of independent development and social progress. Attempts are being made to split the non  aligned movement  to play down its significance as a major factor in improving the international situation. The weapon of coercion is being used also against the developed countries allies of the United States. One recent example of this in addition to the constant demands for an increase in their military budgets  is the unseemly efforts of the United States Administration directed against a mutually advantageous project for a gas pipeline between Siberia and Western Europe. We almost have the impression of hearing a cowboy's lasso whistle over some countries of Western Europe. AU this is a significant lesson for the young developing countries  which should indeed think twice before developing ties  especially economic ties  with the United States.The Soviet Union and other socialist States oppose that policy of diktat and blackmail by a clear and unequivocal policy of developing international economic co operation on a basis of equality and in the interest of all the participants and with due regard for the special interests of the developing countries  at the same time providing them with assistance on a scale greater than that recommended by the United Nations.Given the deterioration in the international situation caused by the policy of imperialism  of overriding importance for the destiny of mankind is the positive implementation of the Leninist strategy of peace  the Peace Programme for the 1980s worked out by the twenty sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and promoted by the Soviet Union  which is celebrating its sixtieth anniversary. The creation and the successful development of the Soviet Union are of undying international significance and an important historic landmark in the age old struggle of progressive mankind for equality  the progress of nations and world renewal.Faithful to the principle of peace and friendship among peoples  to which it pledged itself at the hour of its birth  the Soviet State takes this as the basis of all its activities in the international arena. It underlies all its successes and achievements. Leninist ideals and principles embodied in the decisions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the highest State bodies of the Land of the Soviets and in the Constitution of the USSR determine the approach of the Soviet State to all problems of relations between countries and peoples.The sixtieth anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is clear testimony to the triumph of the Leninist national policy and to the historic achievements of socialism. The workers of the Byelorussian SSR cherish the fact that they belong to the unified family of Soviet peoples. They realize that everything we have done and achieved has been brought about by the concerted efforts of all the peoples of our multinational homeland. We have every reason to be proud of our achievements in political  economic and social development. In this period Byelorussia has become a Republic with a highly developed industry and intensive agriculture. At present our industry produces 30 times more than in the pre war year  1940  despite the fact that it was almost totally destroyed by the Hitler aggressors in the Second World War and that those aggressors murdered a quarter of its population. Education  science  health care and culture have made great strides in the Republic. We live and work in a socialist democracy which guarantees genuine rights and freedoms for every human being. In order to continue their successful and constructive work the Byelorussian people  like other peoples of the USSR and of the entire planet  need above all lasting peace.Deadlocks in the international arena do  not occur of themselves. It is well known that they are created deliberately. This can be said about almost every situation of conflict and outstanding problem the continuing conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  opposition to the peaceful reunification of Korea free from outside interference  and to the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea  the refusal to take part in  or the obstruction of  disarmament talks  the desire to put weapons into outer space and other pressing problems.Let us take as an example the problem of Cyprus. Here again we see who is doing what to impede United Nations efforts to defend the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and to demilitarize the island by withdrawing all foreign troops and eliminating all foreign bases; how attempts are being made to impose on the Cypriots a solution alien to them. In those circumstances United Nations efforts should be directed towards making the intercommunal talks a success  while fully respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Cypriot State and its policy of non alignment.Thus in the final analysis underlying all these deadlocks there are selfish imperialist interests and a reluctance to take account of the real situation in an evolving world and of the will of the peoples.Today political wisdom lies in concerted  persistent and patient efforts to solve the problems threatening universal peace. In that way  even if not all the problems are solved at once  many will be. It is particularly important  of course  to solve the most pressing problems of our time: that of averting a nuclearwar  curbing the arms race and achieving disarmament. If we do not  the wise sphinxes to which the United States Secretary of State recently alluded in justifying Washington's policies will no longer be there.The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR  guided by the testament of Lenin that the Soviet State wishes to live in peace with all peoples and directs its efforts to the building of its own State  will actively promote the preparation and adoption of measures designed to avert the threat of nuclear war  strengthen peace  bring about co operation among peoples and solve other problems on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations."
"18",853,"BLZ",37,1982,"203.	The delegation of the newly independent Central American and Caribbean nation of Belize has listened with great interest to the various statements made in the general debate during the past two weeks. We have heard Presidents and Prime Ministers  heads of governments and Ministers for Foreign Affairs from rich and powerful nations  poorer and less powerful States  and even the poorest and least powerful among us  relate their perceptions of the state of the world today  their blueprints for a better world  and even their anguish and agony at their inability to mandate the necessary changes. One perception is clear to our delegation: it is that we are witnessing in the world today a crisis situation of a political and economic nature almost unparalleled in the history of the Organization. But in the face of this bleak prognosis  the delegation of Belize shares the optimism of our distinguished Secretary-General that ""we now have potentially better means to solve many of the major problems facing humanity than ever before"".204.	In recognition of this great potential of the United Nations to be an instrument for the preservation of peace  stability and security in these troubled times  one of the first acts of independent statehood made by the Government of Belize on Independence Day  21 September 1981  was to apply for membership of the United Nations.205.	The delegation of Belize is pleased to be able to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You represent a country  Hungary  that has been steadfast in its support of Belize's right to exist as an independent nation on its own territory-for which Belizeans will always be grateful. We also pay a tribute to Mr. Kittani of Iraq for his mastery as President of the thirty-sixth session. He presided when Belize was first admitted to the Organization and we hold Mm in high esteem. The delegation of Belize also taxes this opportunity to congratulate our brother Latin American. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on his appointment as Secretary-General. His clear-minded and level-headed approach to the job  as evidenced in his first report on the work of the Organization  encourages us to believe that he will be able to prod the Organization on to achieve its lofty goals.206.	We in Belize share with the Secretary-General his profound concern for the need to strengthen to the fullest the mechanisms of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace and security. Our path to freedom and independence  with the co-operation and support of the United Nations  is an example of the value of concerted action by peace-loving nations  it is therefore of vital importance to Belize  and indeed to most countries  that the system of collective security continue to be given practical and effective application.207.	Our foreign policy is rooted in certain cardinal principles of international behaviour: non-intervention in the internal affairs of States; the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination; and the strict observance of the non-use of force in the settlement of international disputes. Most of the conflicts  injustices and tension that beset us today spring from flagrant and continuing disregard of these important rules.208.	The barbarity of Sabra and Shatila that fills the world with revulsion should not be the price exacted from the Palestinian people for their legitimate right to live in their own State within secure boundaries. Our delegation puts on record Belize's condemnation and revulsion at the cold-blooded massacre of innocent civilians in Lebanon. We record our support for the right of the people of Palestine to determine their own destiny and to establish their own homeland in their own State within defined and secure boundaries. We also support the right of Israel to exist a§ a State with its security guaranteed.209.	The constant attacks on the humanity of the Mack peoples of southern Africa by Pretoria's racist regime and its continued occupation of Namibia and harassment of neighbouring African States are affronts to civilized conscience. We record our condemnation of the apartheid policies of the racist regime of South Africa  and our support for the right of the black majority in southern Africa to determine the governance of their territory.210.	The senseless war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan  military conflict in the South Atlantic  turmoil and destabilization in Central America and the Caribbean -the list goes on. All of those are possible because we ignore the norms of international behaviour to which we all pay lip service.211.	We support the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions concerning Afghanistan with full respect for the independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of that country.212.	Belize also endorses the position of the non-aligned movement in respect of Western Sahara and appeals to the parties to initiate negotiations in order to obtain a fair and lasting solution of the conflict in Western Sahara in accordance with the principles of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  the decisions of the OAU and the principles of the non-aligned movement.213.	We look forward to the solution of the problem of the people of East Timor with due regard to the principle of self-determination.214.	The outbreak of hostilities earlier this year in the South Atlantic between Argentina and the United Kingdom was a cause of grave concern to Belize. Consistent with our principles  we unequivocally reject the use of force in attempting to settle this dispute. Belize calls for a formal end to hostilities and for the negotiation of a peaceful settlement in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  and with the participation and good offices of the Secretary-General.213. War  and the consequences of war  must always remind us that the use of force is never a permanent solution to a dispute.216. In our own region of Central America and the Caribbean  the struggle for peace and freedom and the struggle for development are clearly linked. The social unrest and tension in this part of the world are  in many ways  products of a long history of exploitation and abuses of human rights  aggravated by external pressures and disregard of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference.217 Although we in Belize have embarked on policies and practices designed to prevent exploitation and abuse  we are not unaffected by the problems of the  region. It is incumbent on us to strive resolutely for regional harmony based on mutual respect  and for the elementary democratic right of a people to shape their own destiny.218. In this context  Belize welcomes the initiative of President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and President Herrera Campins of Venezuela to bring peace to the region by way of a political solution. We also endorse the decision of the non-aligned movement to convene an extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau in Managua  Nicaragua  from 10 to 14 January 1983.219.	Because Belize shares the view that direct dialogue among democratic countries is an appropriate mechanism for reviewing the situation in their region  and seeking solutions to common problems  the Mme Minister of Belize  Mr. George Price  met in San Jose  Costa Rica  on 4 October with representatives of Colombia  El Salvador  the United States of America  Honduras  Jamaica  Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.220.	Belize subscribed to the final declaration of San Jose which stressed support for the principles of representative  pluralistic and participatory democracy  and concern about the serious deterioration of the present international economic order and international financial system.221.	The San Jose meeting declared its conviction that in order to promote regional peace and stability  it is necessary to support domestic political understanding that will lead to the establishment of democratic  pluralistic and participatory systems. Such understanding would lead to absolute respect for delimited and demarcated borders in accordance with existing treaties  compliance with which is the proper way to prevent border disputes and incidents  observing  whenever applicable  traditional lines of jurisdiction.222.	The meeting in San Jose also declared respect for the independence and territorial integrity of States  rejection of threats or the use of force to settle conflicts  a halt to the arms race  and the elimination  on the basis of full and effective reciprocity  of the external factors which hamper the consolidation of a stable and lasting peace.223.	Belize  for its part  continues to extend the hand of friendship  and an attitude of good neighbourliness to the Republic of Guatemala. As two sovereign nations  which must inevitably live together with shared borders  we are optimistic that  together  we can work out areas of co-operation for our mutual benefit. We stand ready to take steps to resolve  peacefully  a controversy born in another century. Belize must  however  insist on respect for its independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  and non-aligned character.224.	The refusal  to date  of the Republic of Guatemala to recognize the reality of Belize within its long-established and traditional borders  is in open defiance of-and shows a contemptuous disregard for-the overwhelming support we have received from States Members of the United Nations. For the Republic of Guatemala to assert that they have ""legitimate rights over the territory of Belize"" is to reveal a blatant expansionist policy devoid of any legal  historical  or political merit.225.	No part of the territory that is Belize has ever been possessed or occupied by Guatemala. Belize belongs to the Belizeans. The peace-loving and democratic people of Belize know this. Our other neighbours in Central America and the Caribbean affirm it. The world  through the United Nations  recognizes the sovereign  independent nation of Belize.226.	We reiterate our commitment to find a peaceful resolution of differences with the Republic of Guatemala for the mutual benefit of our two peoples. But the territorial integrity of Belize cannot be sacrificed as a ""quick fix"" solution. Rather  we seek a permanent and lasting peace with all our neighbours-a peace based on mutual trust and respect  conducive to the continuing development of all our peoples.227.	In this same spirit Belize supports our sister Caribbean Latin American nation of Guyana in its efforts to preserve its territorial integrity  and calls on the parties to seek a peaceful solution through an acceptable international forum.228.	If there has emerged one clear consensus in international thinking today  it is that the world is plunging into economic disorder; that the international financial system urgently requires overhauling.229.	More and more men and women who want to work cannot find jobs. Trade is slowing down to a trickle. Commodity prices are falling rapidly exchange rates are unstable and the level of investments is very low. These conditions cause havoc among the poorer nations. Added to this  cruel protective trade barriers deny us a market for our products. The costs of servicing external debts keep soaring  and speculation runs rampant and uncontrolled in the financial markets.230.	In the face of all this  is it any wonder then that the economic struggle for poor countries like Belize is one of sheer survival?231.	The richer  developed and industrialized countries are not encouraging the development of the exports of the developing countries  by their refusal to pay just prices for our commodities  which in the long run would lead to a healthy expansion of international trade for the benefit of all. Instead  they prefer to finance the imports of the third world with loans on exorbitant terms. We are now reaping the bitter harvest of this unenlightened policy.232.	Many third world countries had a higher rate of growth  but it was artificial  because it resulted in an unprecedented increase in their debt burdens. The inevitable consequences now affect us all. Even those countries which had the courage to practice good husbandry and fiscal responsibility are victims of this unjust economic system  which has created the phenomenon of a liquidity crisis and a slow-down in investments. In a situation such as this  no one can win; all will suffer. And because of our vulnerability  the small  poor  developing countries suffer most. Common sense and simple equity demand a change. The cry for a new international economic order can only be stifled at the risk of total economic chaos.233.	We appeal to the industrialized world to implement bold and effective initiatives to strengthen the economic recovery efforts of our countries. We recognize the co-operation of the United States Government in approving President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative  and hope that the measure is a first step in a wider economic co-operation effort. We also applaud the economic co-operation and assistance efforts by the Nassau Group of countries in this hemisphere-Canada  Colombia  Mexico and Venezuela.234. Belize notes with great satisfaction that after 14 years of difficult negotiation the United Nations has finally adopted the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Convention  which has attracted almost universal support  is perhaps the single most important example in recent times of the possibilities for co-operation in an enterprise designed for a better future. It gives us hope that we shall find other formulas for co-operation in other spheres of human endeavour. And what better place to devise such formulas than the United Nations?233. The delegation of Belize feels that the Charter of the United Nations holds the key to the mechanisms to create a better world. The will to use the machinery of the Charter must be consciously strengthened. For this reason  we support the recommendation of the Secretary-General that a meeting of the Security Council be held at the highest level ""to make a serious effort to reinforce the protective and pre-emptive ring of collective security which should be our common shelter and the most important task of the United Nations"". Indeed  the United Nations remains the last best hope for mankind."
"19",900,"BOL",37,1982,"It is a great and significant honour for me to come to this rostrum representing my country before the world.38.	My first words go to you  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of this session of the Assembly. Your unmistakable gifts as an experienced diplomat guarantee the success of our work. It is a pleasure  and not merely a formality  for me to convey the thanks and congratulations of my Government to Mr. Kittani of Iraq for the wise and successful way in which he carried out his duties as President of the thirty-sixth session.39.	Recently the United Nations has seen its mission even further enriched by the appointment as Secretary-General of one of its most distinguished officials  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  a most worthy representative of Peruvian diplomacy. Bolivia reiterates its pleasure at his appointment and its congratulations and best wishes to him  the first Secretary-General representing Latin America  and the brotherly and ancestral ties between Bolivia and Peru and the Andean countries are well known. His presence as Secretary-General is a sound guarantee for the fulfilment of the purposes of the Organization.40.	For years we have been expressing our faith and reiterating our purposes. Every year we come here and repeat our intention to carry out the purposes and principles of the Charter. We announce optimistic outlines for the future and the definite achievement of our aims. However  realistically and objectively I think we must now pause on our way to see whether we have really moved beyond mere statements to concrete achievement.41.	Peace is still an unachievable goal and perhaps  sad to say  a nostalgic dream of Utopia. Colonialism still seeks to broaden its areas of domination  with aggressive and even bloody usurpation; hegemony and the use of pressure by the powerful still persevere and indeed show a disturbing tendency to increase. Inequalities and injustices continue to show their ugly faces. Terrorism and new treacherous forms of aggression  under cover of the advocacy of change  disrupt every form of coexistence. Racial discrimination continues as a flaw of mankind in our time. Territories conquered by force of arms remain in foreign hands.Arms manufacture and the development of new and powerful means of destruction cast gloom over the positive achievements of our civilization  and now there is a real danger that tomorrow  just as the twenty-first century is about to begin  we may find ourselves with a world in ruins unless common sense prevails.42.	These are some glimpses of the realities of today's world  which persist despite the efforts of the Organization. My delegation would like to state certain views on these matters  as an expression of the unswerving Bolivian position on principles and international policies.43.	Bolivia is one of the non-aligned countries  for compelling reasons of principle and also because we advocate the elimination of dogmatic compartmentalization and hegemonic bonds and because self-determination and the inviolability of sovereignty are the proper response to the efforts of the various forms of imperialism to absorb others. The non-aligned countries advocate a role of balance in defence of the rights of the weaker countries in the face of the cold struggle by the great Powers for supremacy.44.	Those who supply raw materials and make great sacrifices in their struggle to achieve their development have their spokesmen in the non-aligned countries. The demands and claims made by many of our peoples have received a positive echo in the voice of the non-aligned countries. That is the case  forexample  with Bolivia's demand for the restoration of its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Only an equidistant position between the imperialist forces  avoiding subjugation and imposed conditions  can grant a country moral authority and consideration in international affairs  and that is precisely the position which the non-aligned countries seek.45.	It is this unswerving support for the principles of self-determination and sovereignty which has led the Government of Bolivia  presided over by General Guido Vildoso Calderon  to apply a policy of a return to democratic institutional rights for our people.46.	In Bolivia we have set in motion the pre-electoral process  with the scheduling of a general election for April 1983. The consensus achieved among the political parties on the basis of the invitation to participate made by the Government without any discrimination has led to the constitution of a National Electoral Court. We have also started on the study of a plan for economic recovery in order to apply emergency provisions to overcome the situation of deficit and the serious crisis inherited by the present Government. As a result of a study  the economic plan was  also on the basis of consultations  brought to the notice of the political forces and the trade unions; a political and economic dialogue thus took place.47.	Giving effect to the general feelings expressed by the political parties and labour representatives  who requested an immediate transition to a democratic system  the Bolivian Government has decided to convene the representative Parliament elected in the 1980 elections  which had been suspended by a military coup at the time  so that that Parliament will  in accordance with the norms of the political Constitution of the State  appoint the new office holders who will have charge of the nation from 10 October next. For them and their arduous task in government we request the solidarity of all nations  particularly on account of the grave economic crisis that my country is experiencing. The new constitutional authorities will have to overcome that crisis and will need all the co-operation that they can possibly obtain from friendly countries-combined  of course  with Bolivia's own efforts-in order that Bolivia may progress.48.	All this process of transition to democracy has taken place within the framework of an unchanging respect for human rights and the prerogatives of the citizens and on the basis of the fulfilment of the treaties and international commitments entered into by Bolivia.49.	On 10 October next the armed forces of Bolivia will restore the political control of the nation to a civilian Government. This voluntary gesture  in keeping with the wishes of the Bolivian people  is worth emphasizing in this international forum.50.	Another subject which I cannot refrain from mentioning is that of the progress of integration. Happily  we are living in a time of integration and economic co-operation  of interdependence. All nations-literally all-need something from others. There is inevitably a need for raw materials  goods and services  technology  credits and assistance of all sorts. What is important is that the prices should be fair  exchanges just and that co-operation have but one aim-to secure the goal of shared development and common benefit. ..51.	In the regional and sub-regional spheres Bolivia has been taking part in all the programmes of integration and co-operation. Its special geographical location in South America and the fact that it is a country with tributaries of three of the four major river basins of the continent has given it a unique status as a signatory country of all the sub-regional agreements as well as the regional treaties of the Latin American Integration Association and the Latin American Economic System. For example  we are a member of the Cartagena Agreement  binding on the Andean nations  and a signatory of the Treaty for Amazonian Co-operation and the Treaty of the River Plate Basin.52.	The Bolivian position with regard to the process of integration is clear. We uphold the need to preserve  expand and improve the machinery of the integration process. Integration and the programmes and actions for co-operation are only a means towards the ends of development and the harmonious progress of our nations. We must also nurture  strengthen and improve those instruments of economic and social progress  whose sole beneficiaries must of course be our peoples and their future.53.	We must also make the North-South dialogue a reality and seek ways to give viable form to the new international economic order. This scheme has so far not had the acceptance  the solidarity and particularly the political will of the industrialized nations  which it needs if its basic objectives are to be met.54.	These problems  therefore  should be seen as part of the struggle for economic  political  social and cultural liberation of peoples who  like those of Bolivia  are currently engaged in their own development. If manifest unwillingness and delaying tactics continue to be shown  it will be impossible to intensify the co-operation which at the international level should promote the development of nations in a setting of justice and equity. We therefore look forward very much to the prompt initiation of the global negotiations.55.	Understanding  co-operation and the processes of integration have another requirement in order to be perfect-the redressing of injustices and inequalities  I must refer once again  before the world community assembled here  to our geographical condition-the fact that we are landlocked  a fact that has been forced upon us for the past 103 years. This reference also derives from the imperative mandate given by my people  who for more than a century have pressed for their rights to return  with sovereignty  to the shores of the Pacific.56.	We all know that when they have the stamp of legitimacy the rights of nations are never exhausted. Therefore  the return of territories which have been usurped in so many latitudes of the world is essential.57.	With regard to the maritime problem of Bolivia  the time of our return to the Pacific Ocean is bound to come. But good faith is necessary for this  together with a clear readiness by the other party to make reparations. We also need action and the encouragement and support of the international organizations  particularly if  as is fortunately the case  we have the firm support of the majority of the world community for our just cause.58.	Humanity has virtually put an end to one of the most degrading and odious systems adopted by man in the past-slavery. But  late in the twentieth century  still other grievous vestiges of the past remain as an affront to mankind-colonialism and racial discrimination.59 Twenty-two years have elapsed since the general  Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Each year we revert to the terms of that declaration and the general  Assembly adopts new resolutions on specific cases. Nevertheless  new forms of colonialist aggression can be clearly seen  not simply disregarding the principles and purposes of the Charter but clearly violating them. A recent example was the case of the Malvinas Islands  with its bloody epilogue  leading to the restoration of colonialism  which should give us food for serious thought.60.	Faithful to its position of principle on the rejection of any form of colonialism  Bolivia supported the Argentine cause and will continue to support the demands for repossession of its territory made by our brother nation of the River Plate  as we have done since 1833  when the President of Bolivia at that time was the first to speak up against the British usurpation of that era.61.	We can never try hard enough in the Organization to put an end to colonialism and all forms of seizure of territories and the imposition of tutelage and foreign rule on peoples. On the day we dispose of these last vestiges of colonialism mankind will be able to take pride in having taken an enormous step towards a world of truly free communities  such as those for which the Liberator Bolivar fought. His bicentenary is to be commemorated next year  and I am sure that the Organization will wish to participate in commemorating that anniversary  thereby confirming the universal nature of Bolivar's thinking and deeds.62.	With regard to racial discrimination and apartheid my country's consistent attitude has been one of opposition and condemnation of thatsituation and system  which are a breach of the elementary principles of equality and human rights.63.	Man holds certain rights even before his birth. if we commit a breach of those rights; we offend God  who modelled our spirit on His image and in His likeness.64.	1 said at the beginning of this statement that peace was an objective that the wortd had not yet achieved. The recent distressing events in the Middle East  particularly those in Lebanon  give some idea of the deplorable situation.65.	I must express here the deep concern of the Bolivian community and its Government over the now long-drawn-out crisis in the Middle East  which has so grievously affected various peoples in the region. We must strive to find there an understanding which  with recognition of the rights of the countries involved  will bring about a return to peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.66.	Violence can only give rise to greater violence and peace is not a free gift; it must be built carefully  with sacrifice and magnanimity.67.	The mission of the United Nations with regard to the problems of the Middle East and of the world in general  is still an arduous one requiring unswerving commitment. We must all be committed to this task if we want to show that man is capable of thinking of the future  using his intelligence to coexist and to build  to reconcile differing views and not to hate  thus overcoming a shameful recent past  which paradoxically encompassed the greatest examples of barbarity and tragedy as well as the greatest achievements of the technological era. The answer to the challenge of the years to come ties within us; it is the possibility of offering the coming generations a world of harmony  peace and justice.68.	These difficult problems concerning peaceful coexistence lead to another major theme of our age. I am referring to the problem of disarmament. A Bolivian writer has said:  Two of the greatest mistakes made by mankind were to condemn Socrates and to manufacture the atomic bomb. The first did violence to  the meaning of justice; the second showed man the road to his own destruction.69.	Instruments have been adopted by the United Nations and at the multilateral and bilateral levels on the need for disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons including resolutions banning test explosions in the atmosphere and under water. In open contradiction with these commitments  however  the arms build-up  the sophistication of weapons and the production of new and menacing means of destruction have continued. Unfortunately  each conflict gives rise to improvements in and new uses for the means of warfare  as was the case in the recent painful conflict over the Malvinas.70.	Perhaps what is needed to stop the arms build-up is in the first place spiritual disarmament: the elimination of hatred and prejudice; the liquidation of barriers of ideological animosity; the promotion of fellowship  bearing in mind that mankind is after all a single entity and that fraternal understanding is possible.71.	The period of multiple crises which mankind is once again experiencing is straining our capacity to face up to the challenge it presents and our courage. The Organization is again being put to the test and we the Members must not evade this tremendous challenge but meet it head on. The principles of the Charter and all the resolutions and declarations generated by the problems of the word form a basic body of norms accepted by all the word. We must now show that we can go beyond the spirit and the letter of those documents and are capable of establishing peaceful coexistence  with freedom  bread and love for all the people of our earth."
"20",947,"BRA",37,1982,"1.	Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of Brazil  I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.2.	I warmly greet the representatives of the Member States gathered together in this Hall. I extend warm greetings o the Secretary -General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar   brilliant diplomat who is a credit to Latin America. I also wish to extend my sincere compliments to Mr. Ismat Kittani  representative of Iraq  who with assurance and ability presided over the work of the thirty-sixth session.3.	At this time  as the general debate begins  I wish to express my hope that this session of the General Assembly will effectively contribute to a just solution of the controversies which are jeopardizing international peace and security and to the removal of the threat to the stability of the world's economy.4.	A few decades ago  an unprecedented economic depression and uncontrolled political tension brought about a catastrophic war. The society of sovereign States decided then  in 1945  to create a vast network of institutions to further co-operation between Governments in order to avoid a repetition of such severe economic crises  promote economic and social development  ease political tension and spare future generations from the scourge of war.5.	Symptoms dramatically reminiscent of the events of the 1930s are reappearing today. A new economic crisis of global dimensions indiscriminately affects countries under different systems and resists orthodox therapies.6.	Paradoxically  the United Nations  which was established in order to examine and resolve controversy between States  has all too often been transformed into a forum for sterile confrontation. We are aware  however  that alternative forms of organizing international life inevitably depend on the arbitrary will of the most powerful States which  at times  runs counter to the cause of freedom and justice among nations and men.7.	Having these considerations in mind  the Government of Brazil renews its pledge to work together with the other Member States in order to make the United Nations a true centre for harmonizing the actions of States. I do not hesitate to call on all Governments represented here to adhere strictly in their international behaviour to the purposes and principles of the Organization. I launch a pressing appeal that we rededicate ourselves to the task of building peace.8.	There is no future—nor can there possibly be one—in that sad  unacceptable substitute for peace which is the balance of terror. We cannot persist in the illusion that world harmony can be founded on an excess capacity for destruction. Decades of talks and attempts at negotiation have not prevented the increase  improvement and diversification of nuclear arsenals capable of destroying mankind in various ways and under various circumstances  several times over.9.	in view with great apprehension the persistence of the Middle East crisis  the major features of which are the conflict between Iraq and Ira a and the consequences of the military action that has engulfed Lebanon  a country with which we have close fraternal relations. The recent massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut has deeply shocked the world public. We are all aware that the question of the Middle East will be solved only when the Arab territories now under military occupation are evacuated and when the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State is recognized  as well as the right of all countries in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within recognized borders.10.	In southern Africa  also  there persist situations of tension caused by the occupation of Namibia and by repeated acts of aggression against independent countries  notably Angola. Brazil cannot fail to condemn racial discrimination  particularly its institutionalized forms  which threaten international peace itself. The success of the on-going negotiations for the speedy independence of Namibia on he basis of United Nations resolutions is the right way to remove the tension which has so terribly frustrated the just aspirations of the peoples in the area to economic development and true independence.11.	My country is deeply troubled by the increasing transfer to the less developed areas of the tension generated by the confrontation between the super-Powers. The policy of prestige and power applied to the third world engenders divisions and seriously affects the prospects for co-operation among developing nations. It is the firm stand of Brazil that such a process should be immediately stopped and reversed  and we are ready to continue our efforts to that end.12.	We cannot accept that  as a result of power- bloc policies  sovereign countries should be occupied  their domestic affairs subjected to interference and their freedom restricted  as is the case in Afghanistan. The principle of the non-use of force should be strictly observed in today's main areas of tension.13.	In Central America  there are recurring symptoms of a deep crisis of historic proportions  with social  political and economic implications. In accordance with the principles of self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  Brazil believes that a political solution to Central America's problems must be found by the peoples involved  free from any overt or covert outside interference. In the economic sphere  one cannot isolate the difficulties of Central America from the world crisis or minimize the responsibility of the industrialized countries to work for the creation of conditions favourable to the resumption of economic and social development. Peace and stability in that region are basic prerequisites for sound hemispheric cooperation.14.	In the South Atlantic  the mechanisms of violence were recently set in motion for a while. My Government has made considerable efforts during the last few months to help find a permanent political solution to the question of the Malvinas  and we are determined to pursue these efforts in the interests of peace  security and harmony among nations. Since the beginning of the controversy in 1833 Brazil has recognized the sovereign rights of the Republic of Argentina over the Malvinas  and it continues to insist on the necessity for negotiations as a suitable means of solving that problem.15.	I wish to stress the importance of consideration by the General Assembly of the question of the Malvinas. An initial step must be the implementation of all the provisions of Security Council resolution 502 (1982). It is time for those who so vigorously condemn the use of force in the solution of controversies to demonstrate the consistency and sincerity of their designs. Negotiations must start in order to avoid the risk of increasing tension in an area naturally inclined to co-operation and prosperity.16.	Brazil lives in peace with its neighbours in Latin America and with all nations which observe the principles of sound international behaviour. Relations between Brazil and friendly countries of Latin America are clear testimony to the success achieved when the path of mutual respect and non-interference is taken with determination and when the search for harmonious and profitable co-operation prevails over controversies or topical divergences.17.	As part of Latin America  Brazil trusts that its neighbours will know how to resolve their differences  including those of a territorial nature  by peaceful and conciliatory means  and hopes that our sister countries in Latin America will strengthen their capacity for dialogue and understanding at the regional level. We must all work to see that our region attains higher levels of development and co-operation and engage in positive actions on the world scene.18.	With sister countries of Africa—our neighbours across the sea  with which we are linked by a common history—Brazil's objective is to develop close  direct and cordial relations. Equally friendly purposes guide our policy of strengthening ties with the other nations of the third world.19.	As part of the Western world  Brazil strives to fulfil its national aspirations with total respect for freedom  democracy and human rights. These lofty values and the Western tradition of pluralism and equality among nations provide Brazil with a framework for action outside the constraints of the hegemony of the super-Powers and of the pressures of opposing ideologies.20.	With the Eastern European countries Brazil seeks to maintain correct relations  particularly in the economic and commercial fields  on the basis of mutual interests and reciprocal respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.21.	For my country  peace and development are not ideals detached from the goals of and action on foreign policy. Brazil is firmly committed to the principles of universalism  friendly co-operation and national dignity.22.	It is the seriousness of the international situation that  for the first time  has brought the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil to the United Nations. Never in the history of the Organization have the risks and threats to the peace  security and progress of nations been so serious. Never have the challenges been so great. I call on the Governments of all Member States to make a determined effort together to tackle the mounting international problems and turn back the tide which leads to despair. It is our common duty to fulfil the expectations of our predecessors  who  having themselves experienced the direct consequences of political disorder  economic depression and war  pledged their resolve  as well as ours  to promote peace and development.23.	There are too many shortcomings in the present international order. It is a picture poor in accomplishments  yet rich in problems  poor in creativity  yet rich in disorder; poor in efficacy and justice  yet rich in waste and imbalances. It is not possible for me to remain indifferent to this picture. I believe it to be imperative to correct the serious flaws that so clearly stand out.24.	The society of nations is essentially a political community. Just as domestic decisions cannot be taken without consulting the interests and yearnings of the people  so it is impossible to ignore in this forum the just and legitimate claims of the great majority of nations  thus preserving vertical structures of international power.' 26. The United Nations has a crucial political role to play in the struggle against conformism  intransigence and ambitions for absolute victories. Only through the Organization can a truly democratic framework of relations among States be created.27. The extraordinary release of productive forces on a world-wide scale in the post-war period wrought within a few decades the intricate patterns of a different world  a complex and unstable world  butalso a diversified and promising one. The interdependence of nations has thus become a historic necessity.28.	Yet the improvements we have been able to introduce in the structures of international life have been few and unsatisfactory. Regrettably  even the efforts towards international co-operation for development  however meagre  are being scaled down. The practice of the interdependence of nations appears at times to degenerate into attempts to reconstruct hegemonistic situations or systems of subordination  which in no way contribute to prosperity  either in the industrialized or in the developing world. As actually practised in many cases  interdependence seems to have become a new name for inequality.29.	The interests of the North and the South are not in contradiction. In truth  there is no crisis between North and South; there is  rather  a profound crisis in the international economic system itself. The same situation affects both groupings. It is a uniquely adverse situation  which can be overcome only through mutual understanding and solidarity  not through a retreat into acrimony and confrontation. The challenges faced by all countries alike is that of adjusting to the new realities of the 1980s.30.	The North must understand to its full extent—and its potential for enriching international trade—the inescapable fact of the definitive emergence of the third world as a dynamic partner  and of its search for a position of greater prominence in the world economy.31.	As for the South  the moment has come for us to give effective expression to the cohesion we have been able to preserve above external difficulties and internal differences. We must move towards the consolidation of a truly solidary interdependence between Latin America  Africa and Asia. We must make it clear  by deeds as well as words  that the diversity within the third world contains unsuspected opportunities for economic complementarity  and is a uniting element  not a fact to be used as a pretext for initiatives—such as the arbitrary discrimination among developing countries embodied in the concept of ""graduation""—which aim at undermining the cohesion of the third world international cooperation for development and North-South dialogue.32.	We must also demonstrate our capacity for seeking  in a serene and constructive spirit  the fulfilment of our claims. However legitimate  our claims should not lead us into rigid and maximalist negotiating postures—lest we weaken our own principles and ideals and exacerbate even further the intransigence which characterizes certain sectors of the developed world.33.	The efforts of the third world to change normative frameworks  decision-making structures and discriminatory rules in institutions such as International Monetary Fund [/MP]  the World Bank and GATT  among others  have been fruitless. Claims repeated for years or even decades clash against the impenetrable wall of the veto power of a few countries  which are in a position to oppose the most obvious considerations of rationality or the soundest requisites of equity. But initiatives multiply whenever the interests of the great powers are at stake.34.	GATT's role should not be diverted towards new normative tasks in areas such as the export of services and investment policies  with a view to creating rules which might hamper access of developing countries to international markets and even hinder their capacity to regulate their own internal markets. By the same token  fundamental questions related to the improvement of GATT and to the satisfaction of the claims of the developing countries should not be neglected.35.	In financial institutions  measures are devised —sometimes adopted against the will of the majority  as a result of inadequate decision-making processes— which restrict the flexibility of operations  add to the requirements of conditionally  and unjustly discriminate against the developing countries. Paradoxically  certain countries endeavour to maintain control over organizations which they appear to condemn  if not to disappearance  at least to insignificance  so great is the disproportion between the growing needs of the developing countries and the financial resources placed at the disposal of those organizations.36.	The principles of free trade must not be applied selectively and arbitrarily to the flow of capital  while the transfer of technology is inhibited and the capacity for action by capital-importing developing countries is restricted. The ideals of free trade cannot be in contradiction with the preservation and even strengthening of the autonomy of the countries of the third world. Interdependence should not be a concept inimical to national sovereignty.37.	The developing countries  which for so long have striven for the principle of permanent sovereignty over their natural resources  today face the new challenge of maintaining sovereignty over their own economic space. That does not mean  however  that the developing countries should oppose or show lack of interest in greater interaction at the international level  with respect to the flows of capital and technology and even operations of multinational corporations. Quite the contrary. It is undeniable that the vast majority of developing countries  beginning with those which have a clear Western identity  such as Brazil  but including others with a different political- economic organization—aim at improving and diversifying their links with the developed West  which is a valuable source of the factors of production necessary for their development.38.	The preservation and strengthening of the national economic space of those countries will not hamper the expansion of the international economic system  but will rather be a factor in the broadening of the global economic space  for the benefit of us all.39.	Although I was unable  for reasons of health  to attend the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  which was held at Cancun in October 1981  I followed that event with interest and hope  and even with emotion. I cannot therefore fail to voice here  on behalf of the Government and people of Brazil  the feeling of deep disappointment at the lack  so far  of any practical follow-up action to the Cancun meeting.40.	We are watching with anxiety the continuous and even accelerated erosion of the instruments and institutions which should bring about a solution tointernational problems. We are troubled to see that there is even more resistance by important sectors of the developed world to what had been the great conceptual achievement of Cancun  namely  the recognition of the fact that the paths to the solution of the present crisis pass also through the South  and should lead towards co-operation among nations  instead of being subject only to the uncertainties of the market.41.	The crisis we face is global in more than one sense: it affects practically all countries and encompasses both the financial and commercial spheres. It is not only broad  but also deep: productive investment is being stifled on a world-wide scale under the impact of high interest rates  and of the uncertainties over the prospects of international trade and finance. It is as if a sudden paralysis of a large economic Power in the developed world had taken place: such is the situation created by the fact that 30 million highly qualified workers are now unemployed in North America and Western Europe.42.	However  the effects of this crisis situation on the countries of the South are even more devastating. The non-oil-exporting developing countries have experienced over the past three years a deterioration in their terms of trade unequalled in history. Their often successful efforts to increase exports have been neutralized by declining foreign exchange revenues  leading to spiralling pauperization Years of patient investment in the creation of an export infrastructure  which made it possible for consumers in developed countries to acquire products from the South on advantageous terms  have been frustrated by insurmountable protectionist barriers. The persistence of high interest rates makes existing long-term investments unprofitable and threatens to undermine the viability of projects which are indispensable for overcoming present difficulties. The high cost of foreign debt servicing has created impossible situations for certain countries  as shown by recent events which have dramatically affected a few of the most promising countries of the South.43.	All this sacrifice could be tolerated if  in return  a restructuring of the international economic order could be seen on the horizon within a reasonable period of time. Regrettably  this is not the case. The present economic policy of the great Powers is destroying riches without building anything in their place. The decreasing fluidity in financial flows and the mounting difficulties in international trade are destroying the prospects for overcoming present difficulties.44.	The circumstances require that we all assume an attitude of reciprocal understanding and flexibility. The North-South dialogue must be urgently reinvigorated. Long-term efforts—for which the launching of the global negotiations is so necessary—must be ' supplemented now by a discussion of the short-term aspects of the crisis.45.	The shaping of the future world economy necessarily requires the overcoming of our present problems. The task of reformulating the international economic system cannot be deferred but  in the present circumstances  we must begin it by an effort to prevent the disruption of the system itself.46.	Therefore it is essential that the major international organizations begin immediately to undertake an integrated and objective examination of emergency measures which can unblock the international flow of trade and finances. It is essential that the developed countries agree to take initiatives in order to liberalize trade  expand international financial flows  adopt a new policy on interest rates  and urgently start revising the international monetary system. The developing countries  because of their structural tendency to deficits in current accounts  cannot be the first to eliminate trade barriers  a measure which would only add to their deficits without creating sufficient momentum towards a recovery in the world economy. The developed countries have to accept the idea that a restructuring of their economies is inevitable. Only when the developed countries give up the protection of sectors which are no longer competitive can the manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from developing countries take their place in international markets  thus benefiting both the consumers of the North and the producers of the South.47.	It is urgent that there be an increase both in the availability of resources controlled by the international financial organizations and in the participation of monetary authorities in the preservation of the liquidity and stability of the international financial system  Only thus will the international community  particularly the developing countries  be freed from the strait-jacket resulting from the simultaneous contraction of trade and of official financial flows.48.	As for the question of interest rates  there need be no discrepancy between the major objectives of the economic policies of the countries of the North and a management of the interest rates compatible with the economic and financial viability of the developing economies. Indeed  it is in everybody's interest to avoid a dislocation of the developing economies which would result in an undesirable destabilizing effect on the countries of the North.49.	Furthermore  it must be recognized that one of the essential conditions for reactivating world trade is the recovery of a minimum of stability in the international monetary system  which must not become a factor of turbulence  left to the whims of unilateral changes in the economic policies of a few great Powers.50.	The solution of the present crisis lies not in aid for developing countries but in ensuring conditions that would enable them to meet their obligations through a fair return for their work.51.	I have come here to express the most legitimate aspirations of my country. I am motivated  above all  by the desire to ensure my people's well-being. We have made considerable efforts towards economic development  with promising results which fill with hope not only the people of Brazil but also all peoples yearning to attain standards of living compatible with human dignity and present-day levels of social  economic  scientific and technological development.52.	It is my duty to seek international conditions propitious for the pursuit of this noble effort by my people  for Brazil will never give up its rightful place in the concert of nations. 53.	I hope that the competition from the South will be understood as a valid expression of the political and economic dynamism of peoples that aspire to development. I hope that this competition will not serve as a pretext for the compliant preservation of unjust and inefficient patterns of exchange but will instead be a motivation for a courageous search for renewal. I am convinced that the most powerful countries will respond creatively to the reality of the emergence of the developing world as an active partner in the many sectors of international life. I have unshakable confidence in the international society's capacity for renewal.54.	Today  however  the climate of conflict among nations in the political and economic fields is reaching threatening levels. It is in times like these that the moral and political imperative of international co-operation has to be fully acknowledged if the destinies of the society of nations are to be rationally assured.55.	The awareness that the international community today faces the broadest challenge to its capacity for action makes necessary bold and urgent efforts in the following areas: negotiated solutions to the tension and disputes which are poisoning international relations  both on the East-West level and in third world areas; greater use of dialogue and compromise and the strengthening of international institutions  starting with the United Nations itself; effective resumption of the North-South dialogue  including the launching of global negotiations  as a token of the will to respond to the expectations of the great majority of nations; concrete and immediate action  without prejudice to the resumption of that dialogue  on the most pressing economic questions which present a short-term threat to the international community.I express my hope that this session of the General Assembly will be most successful. I urge representatives of the Governments assembled here to shoulder to the full their inalienable historic responsibility to live up to the hopes and expectations of those who founded the Organization in 1945 and to build for future generations a broader road to peace and development. We are on the threshold of a new world. May God grant that  thanks to our efforts  it will be a better world. Brazil  I can assure the Assembly  is ready to undertake its share of this task."
"21",991,"BRB",37,1982,"Mr. President  I wish to add my congratulations to those which have already been expressed on your election to the presidency of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. I also wish to express my appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Kittani. It fell to him to preside over the Assembly at a time when it had to grapple with critical issues that threatened and indeed seriously ruptured international peace and security. Those sessions were unquestionably taxing  but as an accomplished and experienced diplomat he always rose to the occasion. We must take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary General. This is the first regular session of the General Assembly that commences with Mr. Perez de Cuellar at the head of the Organization  His first year of office has been a most distressing one in international relations and yet he has been able to rise above last year's crises and to focus in his report on the work of the Organization on the fundamental issues that must be addressed by this world body. In his report he quite rightly identifies the central problem facing the Organization as its capacity to keep the peace and serve as a forum for negotiations. He pleaded for a conscious recommitment by Governments to the Charter. My country concurs with the Secretary General's views. I wish to express the hope that we can  in our deliberations over the next three months  find effective solutions to the difficulties that he has identified. We wish him well as he guides this Organization. In my address to the Assembly at the thirty  sixth session I stated that the decade of the 1980s was probably the most dangerous  certainly the most critical  since the Second World War. I noted then that the world economy was in crisis and that inflation in all countries  rich and poor alike  was out of control. I regret to say that the situation has not improved. Indeed the current international economic recession is deep and pervasive. All countries  industrialized and developing  oil producing and non oil producing  are currently in a state of economic decline  with not a few on the brink of collapse. The economic backdrop against which international relations are being conducted continues to be characterized by recession  restrictive trade policies and high interest rates in the industrialized countries. Weakening demand for their primary products and low commodity prices have depressed the export earnings of developing countries. Increasing debt burdens have contributed to their economic difficulties. The policies so far applied have not been able to avert high levels of unemployment  widespread starvation and persistent poverty in much of the developing world. I share the view of those who are persuaded that recovery of the international economy is unlikely to be accomplished or to be lasting unless the developing countries as a group can return to a period of positive growth and prosperity. Increasingly  it is being emphasized that there is a parallel between the present world economic situation and the recession of the 1930s  but I believe that there is a fundamental difference: there is today a greater understanding of the workings of the international economic system and of the need for economic cooperation. In short  narrow national interests may be attractive  but there is an overwhelming need for all of us to cooperate in order to save the world economy from further deterioration. What is needed now is international agreement on ways to stem the tide of growing protectionism. While protectionist tendencies are predictable in today's harsh economic climate  we all know from the lessons of history and the reality of economic interdependence that  if unchecked  protectionism is at best self defeating and at worst could precipitate the very international collapse we all seek to avoid. There is also a need for international agreement on the rate of creation of new debt and on the role of private institutions  financial and otherwise  in the recovery effort. We now know that the world can never again revert to economic self management  to protectionism and to stalemate in multilateral efforts at financial and development cooperation without giving rise to the danger of international economic collapse. Though it is recognized that the problems with which we are grappling are common to many developing countries  I should like here to draw special attention to the particular problems which confront very small States such as those of my sub region. A month ago the Prime Minister of Barbados addressed the joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Toronto. Speaking on behalf of the member Governments of the Caribbean Community  he pointed to the fact that the relative deficiency in resources and capability implicit in small size imposes greater difficulties on those States in achieving greater self reliance. He stated that the need for concessional resources in so called middle income countries cannot be determined by per capita gross national product alone without giving consideration to the resource endowments and the institutional capabilities within those countries. He also expressed concern about the threatened application of principles based on the new concept of maturation or graduation. That concept would imply the creation of a permanent class of middle developed countries which would never realize their full potential by achieving developed status. It is a matter of deep concern that the problems facing the economies of very small States are apparently still not well understood by those who provide bilateral and multilateral assistance. In this connection  we should like to draw the Assembly's attention to eminent thinkers in this field. On 8 July this year  Mr. William Demas  President of the Caribbean Development Bank  addressed the Economic and Social Council in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee for Development Planning. He pointed out a number of steps necessary for the recovery of the world economy and recommended a more imaginative use of multilateral financial institutions. Specifically  he called for the following: first  the immediate restoration of the resources of the International Development Association to previously agreed levels and their subsequent enlargement  accompanied by a substantial increase in the resources of multilateral development institutions  particularly the World Bank  as well as the creation of an energy facility with a voluntarily subscribed equity base; secondly  the immediate resumption of Special Drawing Rights creation and the enlargement of the resources available to IMF. In addition  IMF should make a greater proportion of its resources available to the developing countries on easier terms and should consult and listen to member States when setting the terms of loans; thirdly  a significant increase in concessional development assistance  including food aid. Barbados supports those recommendations and is convinced that they feature in attempt to deal realistically with the economic problems facing the developing countries. We are also convinced that the United Nations has a vital role to play in the realization of the goals of development. That role may sometimes be limited merely to sensitizing public opinion  but it is important. I come now to the proposed global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development. Barbados is keenly concerned about progress towards a new international economic order. It is that concern which leads us to feel a deep sense of disappointment over the failure of efforts to open global negotiations  for which the 1981 International Meeting on Cooperation and Development at Cancun held out so much promise. We in Barbados think it is deplorable that the search for a solution to the fundamental economic problems of this world should be hampered by lack of action on the part of the industrialized countries. It is even sadder when one realizes that in obstructing global negotiations  those countries are frustrating endeavors to combat hunger and poverty two problems that are endemic to most of the third world and are the natural consequences of the old  unjust order. I believe that the serious obstacles to the efficient utilization of human and material resources for development are a result of the current state of international economic relations. The present economic order must be replaced by one based on equity  sovereign equality  common interests and cooperation. Developing countries  and even some developed ones  have expressed a desire to see the present system replaced. My country would like to see the entire international community summon the necessary political will to cure the economic ills which plague all our countries. I believe that I am on safe ground when I assert that Barbados is not alone among developing countries in regarding the activities of the Organization in the sphere of technical assistance as one of the more satisfactory aspects of its work. UNDP has  without a doubt  established itself over the years as one of the most effective means for delivering technical assistance throughout the developing world. And yet  at the meeting of the Governing Council in June of this year  the Administrator of the Programme produced statistical information showing that the Programme is in grave danger as a result of the declining level of its real resources. The record will show that my country  upon which the hardships of the worldwide economic recession press no less onerously than upon any other country  has not faltered in its financial support for the Programme. The reason for this continued support is that Barbados views the state of underdevelopment as one from which all countries of the world must emerge. If countries mean what they say when they lament the colossal waste resulting from ever  increasing expenditure on weapons of destruction  let them without delay look to those remedies which lie nearest to hand. UNDP is one such remedy  and it deserves the support of countries seeking to achieve the kind of world which we all desire. That leads me to express my country's disappointment at further evidence of the lack of concern by some countries for development initiatives. I refer to the failure of those countries to support the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Barbados participated in the long and tortuous negotiations directed towards solving the problem of the management of the resources of the sea. We expected that the principle of the common heritage of mankind would be accepted and applied. Consequently  we are saddened by the grudging reluctance with which many of the developed States have recognized the. Convention. We are also distressed by the apparently firm intention of stronger maritime Powers to ensure that the most promising aspects of the Convention are stymied by the concerted action of the technologically advanced. It would be worse than folly to repeat the mistakes of the last century  when colonizing Powers carved up vast continental tracts of land. We live today with the legacy of those nineteenth century errors. To allow the vast expanse of the oceans and their resources to be disposed of only among the mighty however bland the contemporary approach would be to fail succeeding generations. Barbados will therefore cooperate with likeminded nations in the establishment of an effective and efficient International Sea bed Authority. Such an Authority has the potential of being a vital agency for the management of and equitable participation in the wealth of the oceans. It therefore deserves the active support of all those who recognize the right of technologically disadvantaged countries to have a fair share of the resources of our planet. We also welcome the decision of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to have the Final Act and Convention signed in Jamaica later this year. This is most fitting  for although the political center of gravity has shifted to other areas  the Caribbean is an area of historical importance  having been a trading center in former centuries. The signing of that multifaceted Convention will have particular significance. On that day we shall reaffirm and strengthen our commitment to a more equitable sharing of the riches of the oceans. We shall  also be pledging ourselves to preserve and develop their living and nonliving resources as part of the patrimony of all peoples. Just as the international community has failed to deal successfully with the inequities of the world economy  it has also been unsuccessful with the question of disarmament. We are all aware that the failure of the Assembly at the recent special session to agree on a comprehensive programme for disarmament has caused grave disappointment. The discussions were important in so far as they provided an opportunity for all countries to focus collectively on the general disarmament process and its objectives. I do not wish to reiterate here the horrifying statistics of world expenditure on arms  for  in the words of the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  under the chairmanship of Olaf Palme  now Sweden's head of Government  they have assumed a sort of deadening familiarity. Effective resolution of the disarmament issue depends primarily on East West negotiations and on the political action of the super Powers. However  all countries  large and small  must lend their voices in support of early action. It is in the common interest of all of us to avoid war. Barbados is convinced that the level of armaments will not be reduced unless hard negotiations are concluded between the super Powers and agreement reached on a mutual and balanced force reduction. We hope that universal awareness of the potentially devastating consequences of the arms race will encourage efforts to bring about effective and conclusive negotiations on this issue Barbados will continue to share the related concerns of the international community on matters of security and development. If the resources released from a cutback in the arms industry were used for social and economic development  then widespread unemployment  hunger and poverty could be abated. But this can be achieved only if nations are convinced that they are serving a greater good than their own narrow interests. Barbados therefore again calls on all nations to respect the institutions they have built and to honor the undertakings they have made. Barbados speaks out again  firm in the conviction that the United Nations and the Charter are the guardians of international morality and the rule of law. Since the last regular session of the General Assembly  recourse has too often been made to the use of arms to resolve conflicts between States. This trend must be condemned. My delegation once more would like to call on all nations to utilize the peaceful means for the settlement of disputes which are spelled out in Article 33 of the Charter. This leads me to the question of the Security Council. The Charter intended that that Council should have primary responsibility for international peace and security. However  far too often  as the Secretary General warns in his report  nations have avoided bringing critical problems to the attention of the Council  or on occasion have submitted them too late for that body to exercise any serious influence on their development and outcome. All members of the Council  both permanent and non permanent  have a duty to examine dispassionately and to search diligently for solutions to issues that are brought before the Council. It is regrettable that the decisions of the Council are far too frequently ignored. I believe that the legal obligation of States to adhere to resolutions and decisions of the Council would be reinforced by the moral authority of a Council that is seen to be impartial. It is only when the States Members of the United Nations carry out the decisions of the Security Council that that body will fulfil the role for which it was conceived. My Government is mindful of the efforts that the Security Council has made over the years to bring peace to the Middle East. Yet today more than ever before the continuing unstable situation there  vividly dramatized by the events in Lebanon during the past two months  threatens global peace and security. My Government believes that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon is a necessary condition for the restoration of peace in that country. The people of Lebanon must be given a chance to seek for themselves a genuine and lasting solution to their problems. Barbados is horrified by the recent massacre of' Palestinian refugees in Beirut. We condemn in the most unequivocal terms the perpetrators of that dastardly slaughter of innocent men  women and children in refugee camps. It is indeed an irony of history that the tragedy of Sabra and Shatila might have been prevented by those who were themselves victims of past atrocities. We note that that barbarous act has significantly alienated support from Israel  whose soldiers were in effective control and occupation of the area where the camps were situated. This tragedy emphasizes the urgent need for more earnest efforts to be made towards a general and lasting peace in that region. In the meantime  the Government of Barbados wishes to endorse calls made by the international community for an investigation into the barbarities in Beirut. Barbados recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self determination; and their latest sufferings underline the poignant need for them to have their own homeland. We also recognize and support the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign and independent State within agreed and recognized boundaries. But Barbados has always been opposed to the use of force to settle international disputes. We believe that acts of aggression in the Middle East will not enhance the chances for a lasting peace in that region. A number of elements now exist in the form of the Israeli Egyptian peace treaty  the plan of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference and the proposals of the United States Administration  along with Security Council resolutions 242 and 338  which could be used to build a permanent and lasting peace in the Middle East. Included in the perennial litany of woe is the yet unresolved question of Namibia. The freedom that has come to Angola  Mozambique and Zimbabwe will  it is hoped  soon come to Namibia. The writing has long been on the wall for the racist regime in Pretoria  but its obduracy persists. In desperation it continues to procrastinate by attempting to make Cuban disengagement from Angola a condition of Namibian independence. South Africa has no right whatsoever in Namibia  and should leave forthwith. A word about apartheid and sports an issue which  because of the prowess of Caribbean nations in many sporting activities  principally the game of cricket  is of more than passing interest to my country. The proponents of apartheid have no shame. They do  however  have an abundance of material resources. By assuming that each man has his price  they have been seeking by wealth and stealth to lure our black sportsmen to parade their skills in South Africa. The South African authorities hope thereby to strangle our sport internationally and to reduce our positions of principle on apartheid to entry. For countries such as the one I have the honor to represent  countries which flinch at tampering with personal freedoms  persuasion in matters of personal conduct and conscience is preferable to coercion. None the less  our cricketers must know that playing in South Africa will disqualify them for selection for our national team. Today I join with those solemnizing the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners in pressing for the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners in South Africa. We hope that representatives here will continue to use every method at their command to isolate South Africa politically  socially and economically. That small States are vulnerable is a truism for which ample evidence can be found in recent events  both in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans an in the Caribbean Sea. It is to the credit of organizations such as this that many more small island States have not fallen prey to the desires of somearrogant  rapacious and stronger neighboring State. We must none the less be constantly vigilant. Today  many small island States face the threat of attack  not by neighboring nations but by mercenaries soldiers of fortune  motivated by personal greed  spurred by racial intolerance  or prompted by some nation State which would fain do its own dirty work  but dare not. We contend that the activities of mercenaries violate international law and constitute interference in the internal affairs of other States. The activities of mercenaries result in breaches of territorial integrity  national sovereignty and independence and violate the self determination of peoples. Such activities pose a serious danger to international peace and security. Barbados is  and will continue to be  in the vanguard of those States which press for the adoption of resolutions and conventions to stamp out the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries. I wish  therefore  to appeal to Member States for whom the elaboration of such a Convention would appear to create problems to present their case in a constructive manner so that solutions may be attempted. Finally  let me assure the Assembly that Barbados holds the view that the Organization presents the best means for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends. It already has many impressive achievements to its credit. However  it must now address other pressing needs that clamor for solution. We fully realize that the transformation of resolutions  decisions and treaties into practical action cannot be achieved except by commitment and dedicated effort by all our countries. Intellectual and moral thinking in the twentieth century has taken a huge humanitarian leap. We have come to accept that peace in our time means more than the mere cessation of war. It connotes the creation and maintenance of conditions conducive to the full development of man's physical  intellectual and spiritual attributes. These conditions cannot exist if the leading military Powers continue in their race to outdo each other in the stockpiling and trading of arms of frighteningly destructive power. Nor can the conditions indispensable to true peace exist where the battlefield is the ready recourse for disputing nations. Nor will the conditions of true peace exist while the millions of the North are blessed with plenty  while dehumanizing poverty and crippling underdevelopment plague the millions of the South. Nor will the conditions of true peace ever exist until the miasma of apartheid is eradicated from southern Africa. These conditions will not exist and be secure until  in word as well as in deed  we begin to live out the true meaning of the resonant exordium of the Charter of this great Organization. There it reaffirms the faith of the founding nations and indeed of all mankind in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small."
"22",1067,"BTN",37,1982,"At the outset  Sir  I should like to congratulate you run your unanimous election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your wide experience and diplomatic talents make you well-suited to confront the tasks that lie ahead of you. I should like also to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  for the efficient and dedicated manner in which he handled the affairs of the last session of the General Assembly. We wish him well in his future pursuits and hope that the international community will continue to benefit from his wise and able guidance.A host of critical issues continue to preoccupy the international community. Because of various factors  several of which the Secretary-General dealt with in his report on the work of the Organization  the United Nations system  particularly the Security Council  was not always able to deal effectively with many such issues. For quite some time now many have felt the increasing inadequacy of the United Nations meaningfully to promote and maintain peace and security—the very objectives for which the United Nations itself was established. Hence  there is a very clear necessity to take steps to make the United Nations system more effective in dealing with international peace and security. It is important for the permanent members of the Security Council to take the leading role in bringing about the required changes. They must place on a higher footing the larger interests of mankind as a whole. My delegation hopes that those countries will come forward and bear the responsibilities that they have agreed to shoulder.The news media worldwide  as well as most of the speakers who have preceded me here  have referred in glowing terms to the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization. We appreciate the frank approach taken by the Secretary-General. We are of the view that the proposals put forward by him should be given immediate and priority consideration. We accordingly welcome the proposal made by Sierra Leone for the inclusion in the agenda of an additional item on the issue of collective security.539At this juncture  I should like also to take the opportunity warmly to congratulate the Secretary- General for the very admirable manner in which he has exercised his functions regarding the affairs of theOrganization despite serious constraints. During the course of the year he has dealt with some very difficult situations in a manner befitting his position and the powers vested in him. In moments of crisis he has displayed rare skill and diplomatic talent. My delegation  which has always had full confidence in him  now wishes him all success during his term at the helm of the Organization.Many issues that confront us at this session have been on the General Assembly agenda since the inception of the Organization. In many such cases solutions continue to evade us. One issue is the crisis in the Middle East. The holocaust that has been visited upon Lebanon in recent months has appalled and shocked the consciences ox all. The massacre of Palestinian refugees in Beirut was indiscriminate and merciless. Those who perpetrated this crime must be counted among the lowest ranks of criminals. We support a thorough investigation to expose the true nature of this ghastly deed.My delegation was equally appalled at the heavy bombing of Beirut by Israel in order to annihilate the Palestine Liberation Organization. This action on the part of Israel caused the loss of countless civilian lives and the destruction of much valuable property. Israel cannot continue to resort to such use of force to settle disputes with its neighbors. Nor will Israel and its neighbors be able to achieve lasting and worthwhile peace in the absence of dialogue and negotiations. It is also the belief of my delegation that the crux of the problem in the Middle East is the question of Palestine. Israel and others cannot afford to ignore the legitimate and genuine cause of the people of Palestine. My delegation therefore Ally supports the plea of the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership  a plea that has resounded countless times in this Hall  for the self- determination of the people of Palestine. In order to achieve this goal Israel will have to withdraw its forces and its settlers from all territories occupied since the 1967 war.Another war that has levied a heavy toll of life and property over the last two years is the one between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. The appeals and the diplomatic efforts of the United Nations  the non-aligned movement and the Islamic group of countries have so far failed to bring this war of attrition to an end. This is an absolutely needless conflict  and the countries involved must  in their own interests  bring the war to a quick halt.A/37/PV.29The Charter very explicitly calls upon all Members not to resort to the use of force in the settlement of disputes. However  during the course of the last few years several nations have attempted to settle their disputes by using force. Whether their cause is right or otherwise  the use of force in the settlement on disputes cannot be justified. The international community should not permit anyone to gain through the use of force. Otherwise the safety and well-being of smaller and weaker nations will be constantly threatened. For instance  in South-West and South-East Asia  military might has been used to intervene in the internal affairs of weaker nations. On grounds of principle  we cannot endorse the presence of foreign troops in the countries of these regions. Such troops must be withdrawn and the sovereign  independent and truly non-aligned status of the countries concerned restored.My delegation had hoped to see a sovereign independent Namibia by now. However  in spite of numerous resolutions of the United Nations  South Africa continues to occupy this international Territory. My delegation now hopes that the Western contact group will soon be able to conclude negotiations and ensure Namibia's independence within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).In South Africa itself  the despicable practice of apartheid  condemned by every nation in the world  still persists. The rights of the majority have been denied. The authorities in Pretoria must soon realize their folly and right the wrongs being done.IL My delegation joins those who have expressed disappointment with the outcome of the second special session on disarmament. The consistent and high- pitched expression of fear of the dangers of the arms race  the tremendous diversion of resources and the massive rallies that we have witnessed have failed to move the leaders of the major countries of the world  particularly the two super-Powers.Despite the serious obstacles that exist  we cannot and must not lose hope in our attempts to achieve general and complete disarmament. There must be a rethinking on the part of those countries that have held back project in this repaid. A way to maintain peace and security on this planet of ours  instead of threatening its destruction  must be found and established.The outcome of nine years of negotiations on the law of the sea was a laudable achievement of the United Nations. It was also a step towards the setting up of the new international economic order. Many potential disputes will now be prevented because of the provisions contained in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is true that not all countries were able to ensure the full coverage of their each and every interest. The landlocked countries  for instance  have had to be satisfied with very little  to put it bluntly. They have withheld many reservations in the larger interest. In view of this  it was disheartening that a few countries which  in fact  had gained substantially  did not see fit to permit the Convention to be approved by consensus.Earlier speakers have all pointed to the dire situation of the international economy. The worst consequences of this state of affairs continue to be shouldered by the non-oil-exporting developing countries. Millions upon millions in the developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America live in practically total deprivation. Though efforts have been made to tackle this problem  they have simply been too little or too late  though well intentioned. What is required to deal effectively with such a situation is an increased flow of resources to these underdeveloped areas and a restructuring of the international economic system. We therefore continue to stress that the present economic order is unfair  unjust and incapable of treating the difficulties that confront it. The longer we delay the launching of the global negotiations and the establishment of the new international economic order  the longer it will take to achieve our goals. My delegation urges those developed countries which have so far failed to endorse the launching of the global negotiations to do so without further delay.My delegation attaches considerable importance to every facet of international economic co-operation. The developing countries  and especially the 31 least developed among them  require a steady input of financial and technical resources to enable them to create the necessary basis for sustained social and economic advancement. Without such sustained and predictable resource flows the least developed countries will not be able to overcome the structural imbalances  lack of basic infrastructure and the poverty that presently characterize their economies. The resources given thus far to the least developed countries  through both multilateral and bilateral sources  though inadequate  have had a beneficial impact on their economies. A detailed analysis of the conditions in these countries and their requirements for assistance was taken up at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in 1981. Serious efforts are now under way to implement the Substantial New Programme of Action that emerged at the Conference. UNDP  UNCTAD and the World Bank have moved  in close co-operation with the least developed countries  to arrange the aid consultative group meetings between potential donor countries and recipient countries. My delegation would like to urge all donors  and particularly the developed countries  to come forth and increase their assistance in keeping with the decisions of the Paris Conference.In this context  we were heartened by the statements of several countries  including the one delivered on behalf of the European Economic Community by the Foreign Minister of Denmark at the 8th meeting of the Assembly. Those assurances and the actions being taken will keep up the momentum generated in Paris towards implementing the Substantial New Programme of Action.In spite of those developments  my delegation has nevertheless been perturbed by the serious decline in real terms in multilateral assistance in general. As members of the UNDP Governing Council  we have particularly observed the serious lack of resources that will confront UNDP in the Third Indicative Planning Figures Cycle. Many least developed countries have come to rely to a major extent on UNDP  UNICEF and other similar assistance for undertaking projects and programmes crucial to their socioeconomic development. A deterioration in this type of assistance would definitely jeopardize their plans and programmes. We therefore once again call upon the international community  and particularly the developed countries  to reinvigorate their assistance through UNDP and other multilateral agencies. The developing countries are now very aware of the benefits of economic and technical co-operation among themselves. The basis for such co-operation has been clearly laid down in the Caracas Programme of Action which was finalized in 1981  and in the programmes outlined by the non-aligned movement.In our region of South Asia  seven countries —Bangladesh  India  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and my own  Bhutan—are in the process of gradually but steadily laying the foundations for enhancing socio-economic co-operation. The initial encounters among these countries have revealed that without co-operation many important and crucial problems of the region cannot adequately be dealt with. Co-operation is required urgently to improve the region's transport  communications and other infra- structural facilities. Health  population  the environment and agriculture are other areas in which the region could profit from increased co-operation. The countries of South Asia  which had either been cut off from or which have been averse to each other because of colonial and other historical factors also need to understand each other's cultural and religious heritage. They must also respect and recognize each other's genuine and legitimate aspirations as sovereign members in joint pursuit of furthering the well-being of their peoples. The fact that all the countries that have joined the South Asian forum are members of the United Nations  the non-aligned movement and the Group of 77 creates a common ground among them to come together. Bhutan attaches considerable importance to this emerging venture of co-operation in South Asia and we are confident that the other countries in this venture will do all in their power to make it a success and to put South Asia on a new path of peace  prosperity and progress.In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm the strong commitment of the Kingdom of Bhutan to the principles and purposes of the Charter. We must take all action necessary to strengthen the Organization  which is universal in character and holds the only hope of mankind for peace and prosperity."
"23",1107,"BWA",37,1982,"The task of congratulating the President on his election to guide this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and Mr. Perez deCuellar on his appointment as Secretary- General is for me a pleasant one. One is never at a loss for words when praising famous men. With his appointment as the fifth Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar joins a procession of illustrious predecessors  each of whom has left a distinctive imprint on some page of international history. The first was Trygve Lie  a direct-speaking  if sometimes emotional  man  whose objective was  through his commitment to peace  to give credibility to the United Nations. The second was Dag Hammarslqold  a man who worked hard to build on the fundamental principles of the United Nations  a peace-maker who saw his position of Secretary-General as providing him with a mandate for seeking and restoring peace and who lived and died in that cause. The third was U Thant  a blunt  straightforward and outspoken individual  .a man of proven negotiating ability; the fourth was Kurt Waldheim  a professional and careful diplomat. We salute them all. The present Secretary- General joins this line of succession in the face of many problems and difficulties  which he has already identified as conflicts between national aims and Charter goals... resort to confrontation  violence and even war in pursuit of what are perceived as vital interests  claims or aspirations"" . We are confident that with his characteristic caution  his mature intelligence and his wealth of diplomatic experience he too stands ready to inscribe his name on the roll of honor. I can assure him that my country  Botswana  will heed his appeal to all Governments for their conscious recommitment to the j purposes and principles of the Charter. We pledge our support for the continued search for solutions to the different problems facing the United Nations and the world.334.	The role of the President of the General Assembly is no less challenging  onerous or noble. We are equally confident that Mr. Hollai will hold aloft the honor of his great country.335.	We are not so presumptuous as to think we have the capacity or  indeed  the capability of commenting on every item on the agenda of the Assembly. We shall therefore confine our remarks to a few only.336.	The scenario of international economic development co-operation remains bleak. There has been a further deterioration  especially since 1981  in the international economic environment. As we are all aware  the economic problems of developed countries are being transmitted to developing countries through a variety channels  and vice versa. The development crisis has deepened throughout the world  and the development process has come to a virtual standstill in many countries. The dynamism of international trade  particularly in products of special importance to developing countries  is no longer assured as a mechanism for growth. The shrinkage in the real flow of external resources and development assistance has considerably jeopardized the growth prospects and opportunities in many developing countries. The spirit of international co-operation has suffered greatly. 337.	In these circumstances  the current world economic crisis can no longer be considered as merely as another phenomenon of poor growth figures. Nor can it be considered in complete isolation from the interests of developing countries. Recent experience has amply demonstrated that the worsening world economic conditions are of a structural  not a cyclical  nature. The establishment of a new international economic order could have greatly facilitated the structural adjustment and strengthened the possibility for economic revival and prosperity of the world as a whole  including the developed countries. However  short- tern. Interests carried the day  and we have missed many opportunities to facilitate structural adjustments and give impetus to economic growth.338.	Commodity issues have emerged as major trade problems for many developing countries. The recent slump in commodity prices  together with the rising tide of protectionism  has led to reduced export j proceeds  increased external indebtedness and a j worsened balance of payments in many developing j countries. My own country  Botswana  is in no different position. The instability in commodity trade might have been minimized  even curbed  had there been a fully operational integrated program for commodities. The convening of the sixth session of UNCTAD  in June 1983 in Belgrade  offers yet another opportunity to act on these issues  which should not be missed this time339.	In spite of the worsening world economic conditions  the international community has succeeded in achieving some successes since 1981. The Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities and the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries"" adopted at the Paris Conference are two such achievements.if these are to be translated into action  there is much the international community should undertake in order to avoid talking about the same issues all over again at UNCTAD.340.	It is equally necessary to remove the considerable uncertainties which currently prevail in the international financial system. Recent developments have caused concern regarding the capability of the international financial system to deal with the effects of the unfavorable .economic environment.341.	We must persist in carrying through global negotiations on international financial issues which restore balance to the system which affects us all.342.	Internal upheavals as well as wars born of external aggression are a common phenomenon in different parts of the world. The irony of the matter is that in many of these situations it is easy to identify the involvement of those Powers to which the custodianship of peace and security has been permanently entrusted by us all. As a result  the principal organs of the United Nations can only chum out innocuous resolutions expressing their grave concern at such interventions and calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops  often without naming them. Such resolutions are quite often frustrated by the non-compliance of the States concerned. The United Nations has thus become a place for the expression of indignation and the trading of recriminations. We have been guilty of diminishing its capacity to deal effectively with issues affecting peace. We ourselves are weakened thereby  as there is no other instrument to which we can turn for the solution of international problems. My delegation therefore supports the Secretary-General in his call to all Governments to recommit themselves consciously to the Charter.343.	Mr. Fayez Sayegh  a Palestinian scholar  says in his book ""The crux of the Palestinian problem is the fate of a people and its homeland. It is the piecemeal conquest and continued seizure of the entire country by military force. It is the forcible dispossession and displacement of the bulk of the indigenous population and the subjugation of the rest"".344.	In its resolution 521 (1982) of 19 September the Security Council unanimously condemned the massacre of Palestinian civilians in their refugee camps. The stench of death continues to hang like early morning mist over west Beirut and the grief of those brutally treated people is immeasurable. Nations severally have condemned this criminal act perpetrated against an unsuspecting and defenseless people. Many searching and pertinent questions are being asked. Was it not enough to have made them the refugees they were and to have thus condemned them to live in squalor and misery? Why murder them? Had they not suffered sufficient humiliation when their leadership was dispersed throughout the length and breadth of the Arab world? Why massacre them? Protestations of innocence should neither supplant nor be a substitute for response to the need to establish the circumstances and the enormity of the crime. For that reason  my country welcomes the decision to hold an independent and impartial investigation. This heinous crime will remain a dark eventin the life of nations  its perpetrators and their collaborators eternal villains. History has not always been benevolent and charitable to Israel  yet the continued occupation of Arab lands by military force provides no justifiable compensation. ""The crux of the Palestinian problem""  says Mr. Sayegh  ""is the fate of a people and its homeland"".45. As long as nations in the area deny one another the right to exist as sovereign and independent entities within clearly defined and secure borders  peace in the Middle East will remain elusive and unattainable.346.	We implore the United States  from the vantage point of its special relationship with Israel  and the League of Arab States to reconcile their peace proposals and to intensify their search for a solution acceptable to all parties.347.	The situation in Afghanistan continues to defy solution. Foreign troops have not yet been withdrawn and the refugee population in Iran and Pakistan has reached the 3.5 million mark. Efforts to bring the parties to the negotiating table have hitherto been of no avail. The intractable nature of the situation typifies the impotence of the United Nations in the face of super-Power Involvement. It is in such circumstances that the words of the Secretary-General stand out in sharp relief  to be quoted and quoted yet again—a recommitment of Governments to the Charter.348.	We appeal to the parties involved to engage in negotiations designed to secure the withdrawal of foreign forces  the elimination of external interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and the facilitation of the return of the refugees.349.	It is almost four years since the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Council supplanted the Pol Pot regime. Attempts to reach a political solution by way of negotiations among the parties concerned have been frustrated by boycotts. The end to three decades of war in Indo-China is not in sight and regional insecurity has become a matter of serious concern for South-East Asian nations.350.	The complete withdrawal of all foreign troops  the cessation of external interference and the unimpeded exercise by the people of its right to elect a Government of its choice is what we desire for Kampuchea. This is our litany.351.	Korea remains a divided country. The North- South dialogue  acclaimed by .many nations as a concrete manifestation of the determination of the Korean people to reunify their divided peninsula  has been suspended since 1973. Proposals by one side are relentlessly spumed by the other side. Notwithstanding this regrettable circumstance  Botswana persists in its view that the reunification of Korea is a matter to be decided by the Koreans themselves in direct ipter-Korean negotiations. It remains for the United Nations to continue to encourage the resumption of those talks without pre-conditions or external interference.352.	Similarly  we support the continuation of the intercommunal talks in Cyprus. We believe that their efficacy could be enhanced by the speedy withdrawal of foreign troops from the island.353.	333. The position of my country regarding the Falklands crisis has already been made dear. It does no harm to reiterate it here. Botswana does not accept the use of armed intervention to enforce territorial claims. Our condemnation of such action by Argentina was therefore without prejudice to the merits or otherwise of its claim. We do not regard the Falklands as an integral part of Britain  some 8 000 miles away. Such a concept belongs to the imperialism of bygone centuries. Our view is that the Falklands is a colony of Britain. The Falklanders  like all colonized peoples  have the right to self-determination without external pressure or intimidation. We resent and resist the change of one colonialism for another in Africa. We maintain the same principle in the United Nations.354.	A year ago the General Assembly met in an emergency special session to discuss the question of Namibia. Volumes of words were spoken on that occasion  as they have been spoken since the international challenge to South Africa's occupation of the Territory of South West Africa in 1946. The general  Assembly was reminded then that the United Nations plan for Namibia remained  after three years  a pious declaration of intent  because nothing had come of it. Ft must be admitted that there has now been some audible shuffling of feet by the contact group and the South African representatives  but there has been no appreciable move forward or dramatic change in the situation; no peace in Namibia. We submit that the validity of the vaunted ""significant progress"" made in the negotiations relating to the constitutional principles and the preparedness of South Africa to move expeditiously to resolve the question of the composition and deployment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is being somewhat neutralized and rendered ineffectual b the unfortunate linkage of the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia and the progress of that Territory to independence with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola  in the name of regional security. We consider this requirement strange  especially as it is the South African and not the Cuban forces which have been guilty of trans-border violations and have intensified their war of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola  even as the Namibian plan is being negotiated.355.	Of equal concern to my delegation is a new plan whereby South Africa seeks to establish a so-called more effective interim Government  reported to be structured on ethnic lines  in Namibia. This plan  coupled with the possible use of Walvis Bay in a ""manner prejudicial to the independence of Namibia ""  in disregard of Security Council resolution 432 (1978)  would not only delay progress towards an acceptable solution but might in fact frustrate all the efforts already made to resolve the problem. A genuine solution of the Namibian problem can be reached  and soon  if South Africa desists from its recurrent invention of extraneous excuses. After many years of war waged by South Africa: forces against the people of Namibia  it is not in their interest that a settlement be further delayed by being subordinated to or coupled with the withdrawal of foreign forces from a third country.356.	My country  one of the front-line States bordering on Namibia  continues to call for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as the generally accepted peaceful means of ensuring the attainment of independence by that United Nations Territory. Negotiations relating to outstanding issues relevant to that resolution have been successfully concluded. The process leading to the liberation of Namibia should be unhindered. My country looks forward with the most fervent hopes to seeing a liberated  free  independent and sovereign Namibia assume its rightful place in the Assembly at its thirty-eighth session.357.	But the accession of Namibia to independence will not in itself bring peace to the southern African region as long as apartheid and racism continue to be the fundamental tenets of South Africa's philosophy of government. For 300 years the South African white has asked himself these questions: Who are we? What is our destiny? What is our divine and appointed role in Africa? His answers to those questions are basic to the theory and practice of apartheid. His answers are formulated in such a manner as to perpetuate his image as the divine messenger to Africa  the torch- bearer of Christian truths and principles. He is in a class apart  the only citizen of South Africa. Thus  after 300 years  the black majority of the South African society remains aliens in their fatherland. The creation for them of crowded  over-grazed and generally denuded so-called homelands  the denial of equal economic opportunities and power sharing  the downgraded quality of their education  their restricted and controlled movement—these and the many other disabilities they are made to suffer have increased their frustration and anger and heightened their determination to secure an equitable deal for themselves by whatever means. This should be avoided  for if the manner of accession to independence by Namibia  whenever it comes  is to provide any lesson at all  it should be in the realization that resistance to orderly and timely change can serve only to condemn even the unborn of all races to future strife and suffering.358.	South Africa is fully cognizant of the ghastliness of such an eventuality and is groping for a solution. Whilst we welcome the reformist initiatives of South Africa  we consider the so-called constitutional dispensation to be hollow. It is hollow because it denies the black majority South African citizenship and relegates them to Bantustans; it is hollow because it attempts to entice the Indian and Colored South Africans away from their traditional identification and solidarity with the other disadvantaged group  the black South Africans  without in any way enhancing their political integration within the South African society. A system founded on injustice is bound sooner or later to collapse.359.	Drawing the Colored South Africans and South Africans of Indian extraction into the plan whilst excluding 70 per cent of the population will only increase the areas of polarization and their ramifications—whites versus non-whites  black South Africans versus Colored and Indian South Africans conservative Colored and Indians versus their progressive compatriots whom they will brand as renegades from the cause of genuine liberation.360.	Moreover  it should be conceded that the avowed objective of converting urban South African Macks into rurai citizens elsewhere is not oniy retrograde but ill-considered and impossible of attainment. To succeed  any p!an or solution for the South African problem must take cognizance of these basic truths. Neither the mercenary invasion of Seychelles nor the sustained aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and the continued occupation of parts of its territory by South African troops neither the support given to the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola [LW/7/1] in Angola  the Mozambican National Resistance in Mozambique or the Lesotho Liberation Army in Lesotho nor that given to dissidents in Zambia and Zimbabwe  all instruments of the destabilization of neighbouring States will silence the call for change within South Africa.361.	Our undying refrain is the continuing call urging South Africa to engage in meaningful dialogue with the recognized leaders of all the citizens of that country and to work out a solution acceptable to all.362.	The relevant exhortation in the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa is still as fresh and as valid today as when it was made some 13 years ago:""... we are demanding an opportunity for all the people of these States  working together as equal individual citizens  to work out for themselves the institutions and the system of government under which they will  by general consent  live together and work together to build a harmonious society."""
"24",1151,"CAF",37,1982,"It is a tradition at the United Nations for its Members to gather at the General Assembly to reflect upon the manner in which they plan to shoulder the responsibilities incumbent upon them in guiding the fate of mankind. However  there is no doubt that such collective reflection can bear fruit only if it is pursued in the light of the goals that have been set. This session  more than any other  is of great importance for the Central African Republic in appreciating the efforts the Organization has made out its mission.I am also very pleased  Mr. President  to convey to you and  through you  to the Assembly  the wishes for complete success from General Andre Kolingba  President of the Military Committee of National Reconstruction and head of State  who  together with the people of the Central African Republic  has a profound trust and renewed faith in the Organization. It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation it is my honor to head  on your important election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.Your great personal qualities will  I am certain  lead to the success of our work.I should like to address my sincere congratulations to the outgoing President  Mr. Kittani  for the dynamism  competence aid efficiency with which he guided the previous session of the Assembly.It gives me pleasure to renew my congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and to assure him that the Central African Republic stands ready to support the efforts he is undertaking with fervor  conviction and courage in the daily accomplishment of his tasks.Lastly  my country wishes to express its appreciation to the former Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his devotion to the cause of the United Nations during his term of office.Although States with different social and political systems may experience certain problems in coexisting within the United Nations  it is none the less true that such diversity clearly testifies to the vitality of the Organization. And although some of those problems  by their very nature  often constitute an outright challenge  the imperatives of the well-being of mankind demand from us a concerted search for ways and means of strengthening the Organization's capacity to act. To that end  the United Nation: should not only be an instrument for making the international political climate more healthy  it should be  above all  an instrument for economic and social development. That twofold wish which  in the view of my delegation  lies at the core of our concerns and forms the framework of United Nations doctrine  has inspired the two themes of the message I have been entrusted to deliver to the Assembly for its consideration.Created at the outset as an instrument for improving the international political climate  as it was of the common will of States that cherish peace and justice  the Organization has unfortunately been constant prey to the harsh daily reality of intolerance and violence. In many parts of the world  particularly in southern Africa  the Middle East  South-East Asia and Latin America  the emergence of conflicts creates hotbeds of tension whose persistence is inimical to peaceful and fraternal coexistence.Some people even today  22 years after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) continue the struggle for their human dignity and freedom. The distressing situation which prevails in southern Africa is a clear example of this.In this connection  my (delegation believes that the accession to sovereignty of territories still under colonial and racist domination can only promote the universality of the Organization. Therefore  the improvement of the political climate requires  first  the elimination of all forms of domination now existing in the world  which today are considered to be contrary to international morality. That is why the Central African Republic believes that Namibia should as soon as possible-and why should this not be in 1983- accede to independence in accordance with the spirit and letter of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).In Lebanon and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  in a period of less than four months this year  the international community witnessed and remained powerless in the face of a tragedy most of whose victims were innocent people. In one case there was aggression by force in an attempt to thwart the aspirations of a people  in flagrant violation of international rules; in the other case there was an express refusal to have recourse to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.In the case of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  my country appeals to the good sense of the interested parties to begin direct negotiations  if necessary with the participation and the good offices of the Secretary-General.Recent events in the Middle East can be described by only one word  horror. The massacres at Sabra and Shatila  despicable acts directed at women  children and the elderly  constitute nothing less than the crime of genocide  which no country that supports the ideals of the United Nations can tolerate. I wish to reiterate from this rostrum my country's condemnation of that abject act which compounds other attempts by the State of Israel to contain the just struggle of the Palestinian people  through the PLO  for self-determination. The life of wandering forced on that people cannot continue. That is why my country continues to support Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as the basis for an acceptable solution to the conflict in the Middle East.Because the United Nations has been paralyzed and unable to act in that region at this critical stage  it has become more urgent than ever  as suggested in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  to strengthen the capacity of the Organization to accomplish its mission. The Central African Republic considers that it is necessary to restore to the Security Council its role as the guarantor of international peace and security and  furthermore  to reconsider the mechanics that govern its operation  because the important changes that have occurred on the international scene since the San Francisco Conference  call for the establishment of a balance in the decision-making process.Improvement of the international climate  as I have said  means  in the final analysis  the maintenance of world peace and security.33. The United Nations  through the organ competent in that area  is frequently called upon in the case of a threat to peace. The unsatisfactory results of sessions devoted to disarmament reduce the chances of consolidating and preserving peace. States continue to devote enormous sums to armaments  while two thirds of the people of the world live in poverty. The struggle for world supremacy  which is called hegemonism  is pursued inexorably  leading to the research into  manufacture  and qualitative and quantitative stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction. This phenomenon  added to everything covered by the key word ""deterrence""  seriously compromises peace and security in many regions of the world. That is why the Central African Republic encourages all new initiatives designed to curb the arms race and help to improve the international climate.36. Although a sovereign State may freely choose a given system  certain Powers continue to interfere in their internal affairs  using the weapons of blackmail and threat. Are we to infer from that that the principles which govern international relations need be observed and applied only by the weak countries? That is the question my delegation wishes to put to the Assembly.Between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  in Western Sahara  in Democratic Kampuchea and in Afghanistan armed conflicts persist which threaten peace in those regions of the world. Nevertheless  the Charter commits nations to settling their differences by peaceful means. We firmly believe in the virtues of dialogue and appeal urgently to the various protagonists in these conflicts to resort to it.With regard to the Korean problem  the North- South joint communique of 1972 advocates direct negotiations between the two parties  free of all foreign interference. That historic document  constitutes in the view of my delegation  a valuable basis on which to seek a just and lasting solution. The Central African Republic welcomes the strenuous efforts made by the parties to the conflict to lay the basis for the constructive  fruitful dialogue which is so sincerely desired so that the question of their simultaneous admission to the United Nations can be considered again  without prejudice to the principle of reunification  in keeping with the wishes of their peoples.The present international situation gives no cause for optimism because the world political order is being challenged by another factor: the unequal development of the members of the international community. This is the second part of my message.The United Nations should devote itself increasingly to the economic and social development of Member States. Indeed  how can we not be moved by the problems caused by the world economic crisis  which is seriously affecting third world countries? These include: increasing balance-of-payments imbalances  the constant deterioration in the terms of trade; the excessive burden of their foreign debts; the insecurity of their food supplies; and the disorganization of the present monetary system. All these factors  which indicate the interdependence of States  should lead the ""haves"" to seek more actively  together with the ""have not""  new bases for a restructuring of international economic relations.On the contrary  however  we are witnessing a very marked re-emergence of protectionism  which seriously penalizes the countries of the South. The illusion of the concept of the transfer of technology in turn compounds their disillusionment. That is why we believe that the ""have"" States  in a spirit of solidarity  should facilitate and support the United Nations in its efforts to establish a new international economic order.These efforts clearly demonstrate the will of the Organization  which is now engaged in ""economic decolonization"". This will is reflected in the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries.The Central African Republic  which falls within the category of least developed countries  would like to see the ""have"" countries devote more effort and sacrifice to the implementation of those measures  in order to establish co-operation between them and the developing countries  to the mutual advantage of their respective peoples.As the Assembly is aware  there was a change of regime in the Central African Republic on 1 September 1981. It should be recalled that the National Army took power following dark years during which the country was on the verge of ruin and security and peace were increasingly threatened. As stated recently by the head of State  General Andre Kolingba  the Military Committee of National Reconstruction set for itself four goals: the creation of conditions of general mobilization through a resumption of work; the reorganization of the State finances; the restoration of a climate of confidence and guarantees of the security of property and person; and economic recovery.The highest priority was given to the correction of economic and financial imbalances. We therefore reduced the budget deficit of the State by almost 30 per cent as compared with that of previous years. That result was obtained as a result of very severe limitations on certain expenditures  a reordering in the area of earnings  a campaign to combat fraud and the financial sacrifices of State officials.The reassurance of investors by restoring a climate of confidence is one of the policies guiding the actions of the Military Committee for National Reconstruction intended to bring about conditions for the economic recovery of the Central African Republic.The plan requires that other demands be met  including food self-sufficiency and growth through increased productive investments  both public and private. However  our present financial situation does not yet enable us to tackle by our own efforts alone other vital tasks  such as the reconstruction of our road system and the creation of social and educational structures. The co-operation of the international community  which we hope will be increased  remains essential in that regard.Thus the accomplishment of the mission that the Military Committee of National Reconstruction has set for itself has not been easy and continues to be limited in terms of time and of objectives. To achieve the necessary results  the Military Committee of National Reconstruction has only one weapon: dialogue  based on the concept the Central African people has of the real democracy that results from listening to the questions in the hearts of the people. The Central African Government has a dynamic view of democracy  which must take account of the developmental aspects of the life of a people capable of reconstructing its national unity  which is a prerequisite for development.As a land-locked country  the Central African Republic has been subjected to serious constraints. The Convention that has just been adopted a§ a result of the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea could make it possible for us to be provided with the necessary trade facilities. That is the fervent hope of my country.We wish to welcome once again resolutions 35/37 of 5 December 1980 and 36/206 of 17 December 1981  in which the General Assembly calls upon all Member States  the specialized agencies and other economic and financial organizations to contribute generously to the reconstruction  rehabilitation and development of the Central African Republic  whose economic situation remains a matter of concern.On behalf of the Central African people  the Military Committee of National Reconstruction and its President  General Andre Kolingba  I wish to thank from this rostrum all the States and institutions which  in spite of their own difficulties  have shown a generosity which we very much appreciate- My country is convinced that this international solidarity  which is based on human awareness  will continue to increase.The Central African Republic hopes  and indeed is convinced  that the Member States  in spite of this period of adversity that the world is experiencing  will make the contributions necessary to make the Organization an instrument for the improvement of the international political environment and of economic and social development. The Secretary-General's report  with the spirit of which we fully agree and to whose author we pay a tribute  is important because it concurs in that idea. The unity and harmony of the international community will certainly benefit from it."
"25",1195,"CAN",37,1982,"Mr. President  may I first associate myself with the congratulations extended to you on your election as President of the General Assembly.92.	I am very pleased to have the honour once again of addressing the General Assembly after an interval of seven years. In an international perspective  seven years is not a long time. Yet in that interval  profound changes have imposed themselves on the world community—changes that have distanced us from the relatively optimistic days of the mid-1970s.93.	Simply stated  the world at present is facing acute economic and political crises. World economic conditions have deteriorated sharply  with devastating consequences on the aspirations of all nations  rich and poor alike. Political upheaval has driven the interna¬tional community towards recurrent instability. And these forces are closely linked. Political crises generate economic consequences and economic dislocations breed political instability.94.	How can we chart a course for our institutions that will bring us through this period of grave economic dislocation and dangerous political tension and serve the interests of all members of the General Assembly?93. When our present institutions  such as the United Nations  IMF  the World Bank and GATT  first took shape  there was hope of maintaining a network of relationships which would match the complexity of post-war interdependence and help us to stabilize it. Today  the need to manage interdependence is even more pressing. But in the present crisis there is a disturbing tendency to discount and discredit multi¬lateral institutions. Because the maze of international problems has become more resistant to conventional solutions  attacks are being made on the institutions through which solutions are being approached. The United Nations  in particular  has been the object of much criticism.96.	We cannot fail to realize that interdependence is a reality that we must accept  for better or for worse  and that no nation can hope to resolve its problems on its own. Multilateralism  whatever its specific form  is our primary hope for counteracting on a world scale political and economic aggression which can only too easily result from a long period of uncertainty and fear.97.	However  let us have no illusions: the credibility and the effectiveness of the multilateral institutions depend on the political will of nations and of their leaders  and on the will to find a collective response to serious national and international problems.98.	Most countries  developed and developing  are now grappling with high rates of inflation. Slow or stagnant growth and international payments imbal¬ances compound already serious debt problems. Record high unemployment in many countries threatens the social and political fabric of our societies and feeds protectionist sentiment. At the international level  the economic crisis is having a devastating effect on growth prospects and on development assistance. Debt-servicing problems have reached proportions that impose considerable strain on the international financial system.99.	The consequence has been an increasing ten¬dency towards economic parochialism. Pressures for short-term relief put at risk the multilateral system and narrow the longer-term prospects for all of us. These pressures must be resisted.100.	The collective response to the current economic situation was extensively discussed at the annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank held recently in Toronto. I was encouraged by the determination of participants at that meeting to treat economic problems as matters of common concern requiring common action.101.	I should like to underline two important themes. First  the magnitude of the financial difficulties many of our countries face makes it imperative that IMF should have adequate resources to ensure that it can continue to play its vital role in promoting adjustment in member countries. That is why Canada supports a substantial increase in quotas during the Eighth General Review.102.	Secondly  the current economic situation has meant that development assistance has become even more essential for a number of developing countries and it is important that bilateral and multilateral flows continue. We welcomed the agreement reached at Toronto to ensure an adequate level of funding through the life of the Sixth Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDAVI).103.	The tendency to turn inward economically is also exerting strain on the multilateral trading system. Protectionist sentiment arising from economic disloca¬tion is difficult for all Governments to deal with  my own included. But it is absolutely essential that we manage these pressures collectively to avoid under¬mining GATT. That organization has been enormously beneficial in promoting world economic growth in developed and developing countries. Any serious weakening of GATT through beggar-thy-neighbour policies would have the ultimate effect of making beggars of us all. GATT can and should be strengthened.104.	Canada will chair the 1982 annual session of the GATT Contracting Parties  which will be held at the ministerial level in November. We regard this session as a significant test of our collective determination to manage an interdependent system.105.	Intense preoccupation with domestic economic concerns also confounds our attempts to persevere with development assistance programmes. What should be our response to the inescapability of shrinking resources? How do we face the difficulties in generating increased development assistance flows?106.	We should all—national donors and multilateral agencies alike—rationalize deployment of available resources for maximum possible effect. The best results can be obtained from this process of com¬pulsory selectivity only if donors focus on areas of special national expertise and resources. Canada has chosen to concentrate its efforts in three particular areas which draw upon considerable national experience. These are the food and agricultural area  energy  specifically petroleum exploration  and human resources.107.	Another response to shrinking resources should be to make full and timely use of every opportunity for enhanced co operation. In this connection  I am disappointed with the lack of progress made on global negotiations since the Versailles Economic Summit in June. Canada believes that the text of a compromise resolution worked out at Versailles represented a significant step in the effort to find a formula for launching global negotiations. I regret that it has not been possible to find a basis for real negotiations.108.	Economic problems are all the more vexing and potentially dangerous because they are bound up with serious political instability. Political instability pro¬duces consequences extending far beyond the imme¬diate region in which conflict has erupted. In a shrinking world local vulnerabilities and tragedies become the common concern of us all.109.	We have witnessed the long agony of Lebanon and  but 10 days ago  the horror of the massacre of Palestinians. These terrible events show us in stark fashion the price that must be paid when one strives to resolve political problems by military means  when disputes among nations and peoples and political factions replace negotiations  when one misuses or disregards the instruments that the international com¬munity has established to settle disputes and prevent human suffering.110.	I should like to stress that Canada staunchly supports the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon  and that it endorses the Security Council resolutions which call for Israel's withdrawal from west Beirut and the whole of Lebanon. No foreign force should remain in that country without the full consent of the Lebanese Government; otherwise that ravaged country will never know stability again.111.	Equally important  efforts must be intensified now to grapple with the problems at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. More than ever the tragic events of the last few months illustrate the need for a just and permanent solution which assures the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a homeland in the West Bank and Gaza  and the right of Israel to exist in security and peace. Important proposals for such a solution have recently been made. The United States proposals of 1 Sep¬tember in particular offer opportunities for progress which should vigorously be pursued.112.	Other arenas of conflict continue to contribute to the generally high level of international tension. Events in Poland remain an object of our particular attention  not only because of concern for the basic rights and freedoms of the Polish people but also because of serious implications for stability in the heart of Europe.113.	In Afghanistan and Cambodia we witness agonizing  protracted and deplorable military occupa¬tions which are in sharp contradiction with the aims and ideals of the Organization and the Charter. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia continue to violate the sovereignty of their victims and to ignore resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. Once again this year draft resolutions are before the Assembly on Afghanistan and Cambodia. I urge all Member States to support these draft resolutions.114.	The Korean peninsula has long been an area of tension and concern. We are encouraged however by the proposals made in January this year by the President of the Republic of Korea seeking dialogue and reconciliation  without conditions  and we hope for the greater integration of the peninsula into the inter¬national community.115.	The extent to which local or regional conflicts draw their energy from mutually antagonistic ideo¬logical systems is also cause for considerable concern. In recent years the breakdown of detente and an increasing anxiety over the unpredictability of events have fuelled public fears of nuclear war. Our peoples fear that everything is at risk: the economic and technological systems which sustain us  the political and social systems which underpin them and the very biosphere which permits the existence of life itself.116.	The world had high hopes for the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. When the session ended and no final agreement on a comprehensive programme of disarmament had been reached  there was much disappointment and frustra¬tion. However  a disservice is done to the special session and to the United Nations as an institution if it is simply dismissed as a failure. Of course the results were disappointing  but then the expectations of many were probably unrealistically high given the prevailing international climate. Moreover  in this climate it is essential that the campaign for nuclear disarmament be waged at the negotiating table. My country strongly supports the present negotiations in Geneva to limit and reduce the level of nuclear arms.117.	Canada has chosen to contribute to the arms control and disarmament process by concentrating on the vital issue of verification. We are doing this through participating in the international seismic data exchange and by substantially increasing research in verification. I would appeal to other Member States to consider how their particular circumstances and resources might be drawn upon to contribute to the arms control process. It is basically the same question as with development: given the need for selectivity  what can you contribute?118.	I have evoked today a set of perplexing and interrelated economic and political problems. What is the United Nations capacity to respond to these? The question is an urgent one  because the United Nations and the specialized agencies address virtually the entire range of human concerns.119.	Within the United Nations  crisis management capacity has been called seriously into question by divisions within the Security Council  by erosion of the constitutional division of authority between the Security Council and the General Assembly and by a cycle of ineffectual resolutions. We have seen an increasing tendency to introduce extraneous polemical issues in the specialized agencies  with adiminution of their effectiveness and credibility. Official spokes¬men of key States Members of the United Nations have expressed scepticism regarding the Organization. To counter attacks on the United Nations from within and without we must more closely bind our policies and our behaviour to the principles expressed in the Charter. We must also vigorously reaffirm the singular contribution that the United Nations has made to the development of international law. As the Secretary-General explained at length and with eloquence in a statement delivered last month in Montreal  the United Nations plays a unique and absolutely essential role in the promotion of the rule of law. It is only the United Nations  with its virtually global scope  which has the capacity to play that role.120.	This year the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea succeeded in producing a profound achievement: a comprehensive constitution for the oceans of the world. The Conference could not have produced such a comprehensive convention without the active support and participation of all nations during the long years of negotiation. We deeply regret that the Conference was not able to adopt the text of the Convention by consensus. No State can remain aloof from the regime  and we must not be swayed by any attempt to undermine it.121.	The United Nations has succeeded in making human rights violations a legitimate subject of interna¬tional scrutiny and it is significant that the Secretary- General has identified human rights promotion as a priority area. Canada will support the Secretary- General in these efforts. Effective procedures must be worked out to deal with flagrant violations of human rights.122.	A role of critical importance for the United Nations is the peaceful resolution of disputes. How¬ever maligned the Organization may be concerning its efforts to resolve disputes  it can achieve notable successes. In Namibia  the United Nations has worked cut a balanced settlement plan which should bring Namibia to independence peacefully  and has obtained for that plan general acceptance. The substantial progress that has been made must be attributed in part to the dedication and constructive approach of the front-line States and the South West Africa People's Organization [SW/1PO]. We hope that remaining problems will be quickly resolved.123.	The appointment of a new Secretary-General has come at a time when the United Nations is facing unprecedented problems and when the need for insti¬tutional reform has become obvious. In his first report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary- General has addressed this need in direct and specific terms. He has put forward several innovative sugges¬tions  in particular directed at a more effective Security Council. He has himself undertaken to play a more direct role in bringing urgent matters before the Council. These specific proposals and the Secre¬tary-General's commitment to administrative stream¬lining are very welcome and should be encouraged. Pragmatic reforms must be made or the United Nations will lose its validity as a forum for interna¬tional negotiations  not only for the promotion of peace and security but also for the shaping of our  economic future.124.	The aims of the institutions we have invented are under considerable and potentially crippling strain. We must rededicate these institutions and the driving force of our determination must be a sense of shared vulnerability.125.	The present crisis demands intelligence and will. Intelligence must lead us to a more profoundUnderstanding of political and economic forces; our will must reside in commitment to those national con¬cessions dictated by our mutual dependency. We cannot  must not  allow mutual antagonisms or self- absorption to divert our attention from the full range of difficulties which we face  and which we must face together."
"26",1256,"CHL",37,1982,"It is the tradition of the General Assembly that its President carry out the important duties assigned to him in a forthright spirit of equa-nimity and impartiality. My Government trusts that this valuable tradition  so well respected by his pre¬decessors  will be maintained during the deliberations that are beginning today.127.	I wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Kittani of Iraq for the dedication and energy with which he discharged his functions during his presidency.128.	This is also an appropriate opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the zealous  devoted and skilful per¬formance of his duties in the brief period of less than a year since he was chosen to shoulder this great responsibility. We must express the deep satisfaction with which we welcomed his election as Secretary- General. This once again highlighted his great personal and professional talents and was a clear demonstration of the confidence which the international community feels in a distinguished representative of Latin America and a worthy son of the Republic of Peru—a factor of particular significance to our region. We offer our warmest wishes for his success and once more reiterate our sincere willingness to co-operate with him in the fulfilment of his important and sensitive responsibilities.129.	Chile comes to the General Assembly with feelings of deep concern about the delicate interna¬tional situation  which is affecting and impairing world peace and the very foundations of the Organization.130.	This recently inaugurated session is taking place while the military occupations of Afghanistan and Kampuchea persist and the war between Iraq and Iran continues. No solution has yet been found for the Namibian situation. Lebanon has been practically destroyed by the war being waged on its territory by foreign nations. The Palestinian people remain without a physical territory in which to grow and develop as a nation. And  finally  the cowardly practice of terrorism  international subversion and foreign intervention to gain political or ideological objectives continues to spread with impunity in Central America and other regions of the world.131.	The armed confrontations and conflicts and the systematic violation of the principles of the Charter and of international law have worsened dangerously  while juridical and political mechanisms remain ineffective  not having the necessary power to impose real and just solutions.132.	Our people note with great disillusionment the inability of world organizations to keep the peace and to create a climate of consensus in order to advance along the road of co-operation and progress. Un¬fortunately  confidence in the international system is waning in a way that could become irreversible  especially in the Organization  which was created to promote harmonious and peaceful coexistence among States. We must face the reality of this situation with vigour  a sense of responsibility and decisiveness and work intensively to achieve the necessary convergence of views  so as to restore the world's faith in the principles and objectives embodied in the Charter. We are facing a situation which demands all our capabilities and efforts since at stake is the very future of mankind  of the international system and of respect for the obligations which all Member States have contracted and to which our respective nations are in honour pledged.133.	We have affirmed in various forums that one of the elements which guide the foreign policy of Chile is its unwavering support for the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and its rejection of the threat or use of force in international relations. Today more than ever we reaffirm our political will to abide by the principles of international law. We call upon the conscience of the world for the abandon¬ment of mere declarations and decisive support for the development of legal instruments that will give these principles the quality of mandatory standard for the international conduct of States.134.	These essential norms  explicitly laid down in Article 2  paragraphs 3 and 4  of the Charter  find their practical application in Chapter VI  devoted to the obligations of the parties to a dispute and the powers and attributions of the Security Council. In a similar manner  numerous later instruments prepared within the framework of the Organization have repeated them and expanded their scope. Outstanding among these are: the draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States  prepared by the International Law Com¬mission in 1949 the Declaration on Principles of International Law con¬cerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  adopted in 1970; the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  also adopted in 1970; the Definition of Aggression  adopted in 1974; and  most recently  the draft Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  finalized by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization at its meeting in Geneva in March of this year.135.	In the American region the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes has been very clearly established in three of the most important documents of the regional system: the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance concluded in Rio de Janeiro in 1947; the charter of the Organization of American States of 1948;? and the Pact of Bogota of the same year.136.	The unrestricted application of the principle and its full doctrinal implications have not been sufficiently developed  especially during the past 30 years  despite the fact that it was contemplated in the documents I have mentioned and in many other documents of a bilateral and multilateral nature. At its current session the General Assembly has the important task of adopting the draft Manila Declara¬tion  thereby giving a strong impetus to the vitalization of the system of the peaceful settlement of disputes.137.	Within this context  I should like to stress before the Assembly the special relevance and priority that my Government attaches to the obligation of Mem¬ber States to settle disputes by peaceful means and the obligation to abstain from recourse to the threat or use of force in their international relations. These two obligations constitute the basic pillars of international relations. Repeated and systematic non-observance by some States has led to the creation of the present turbulent international situation—a situation which is diminishing the credibility of the United Nations.138.	Taking into account these and other norms con¬cerning the peaceful settlement of disputes  we believe that these should be put into treaty form so as effectively to facilitate their practical application. As I have already noted  we believe that the surest guarantee of the preservation of peace among nations would be the existence of agreements and instruments making recourse to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means obligatory under international law  in order to eliminate for ever the risk of a conflagration. What better guarantee could there be for our peoples than the protection afforded by the procedure of peaceful settlement  thus sparing them the constant fear of a confrontation  with incalculable conse¬quences? What better way could there be to demon¬strate dedication to and respect for the law as peace- loving Members of the Organization than by being bound by treaties and agreements which establish the means of effectively preserving peace? We feel that the United Nations  as the supreme body entrusted with the preservation of international peace and security in our time  cannot remain aloof from this noble task.139.	Unfortunately  events of recent years have shown that the failure to apply the norms and pro¬cedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for in Chapter VI of the Charter results in the Security Council's being charged with the responsi¬bility of acting once hostilities have broken out  when the solution becomes much more complex because of the loss of human lives and the natural exacerba¬tion of feelings. In other words  there is no effective and rapid fulfilment of the obligations the Member States assume in accordance with Chapter VI or the functions entrusted to the Security Council under Chapter VII. How much more better it would be if the Organization could carry out the preventive and dissuasive role assigned to it by the Charter  reduce the sources of conflict and guide countries towards a peaceful settlement of their disputes. We are particularly pleased that the Secretary- General  in his report on the work of the Organi¬zation  concurs with the observations that Chile has been making throughout this year  particularly in the Security Council and at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. This task cannot be deferred and we believe that the Organization and the regional systems are especially qualified to draw up and agree upon some procedure for preventive vigilance which could lead the parties concerned in a dispute towards the effective applica¬tion of the means of settlement available  or to pursue the development of a procedure to prevent the frustra¬tion of efforts and the creation of an irreversible situation.140.	A discouraging and disquieting world economic situation has been added to the increase in interna¬tional tension. The common and almost unmanageable problem of inflation has been accompanied by a slow rate of growth  unemployment and governmental budget deficits  to which has been added external indebtedness. This last  which fundamentally comple¬ments the financing of the economic growth of almost all developing countries  has made more difficult the solution of urgent problems  owing to the high cost of money. This is particularly serious in the social sector  since there is a daily increase in the millions of human beings who have been left out of the mainstream of the progress which scientific and technological know¬ledge has brought to much of mankind.141.	The search for easy solutions to the problems has resulted in rising budgetary imbalances in many countries  including the industrialized nations with market economies  and the worsening of their dif¬ficulties over the medium term.142.	The legitimate attempt by some developed States to find basic solutions to their internal problems has caused a slump in economic activity. This in turn has resulted in the reduction of the prices of practically all raw materials  severely affecting the developing countries which are the principal exporters of such materials.143.	The international crisis has buffeted the weakest economies with a force hitherto almost unknown  and few countries have escaped its effects. Its mag¬nitude is such that however forceful internal efforts to combat the problem the effects can be only tempo-rarily minimized and in no case has there been com¬plete recovery and progress for such economies. The international economic co-operation which could have mitigated the effects of this crisis has also decreased with the reduction of the resources devoted to that end.144.	In view of this situation  we must stress that the world economic order must be reformed  in a spirit of co-operation and with complete international solidarity. While recognizing that the present world political climate may not be the most propitious for beginning such an exercise  we believe that the cost of maintaining the present situation would exceed that of initiating global negotiations  even in conditions which  in our view  are not the most desirable from the point of view of the developing countries.145.	The international community has a duty to study solutions within the existing institutions in order to facilitate the efforts and possible modifications that should be made by developing countries deeply affected by the international crisis  a phenomenon not foreign to the Latin American region.146.	In the mean time my Government has well- founded hopes that the forthcoming ministerial meeting of GATT will achieveconcrete steps towards liber¬alizing international trade  and putting an end to existing protectionist measures which  we are certain  can only contribute to further aggravation of current difficulties.147.	We trust  likewise  that the economic co¬operation between developing countries formally begun in 1981 at the meeting at Caracas will begin to bear fruit and permit alleviation of the situation in many of our countries.148.	I cannot refrain at this time from referring to certain specific instances which constitute persistent focal points of world tension and which are dete¬riorating despite resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly.149.	Unfortunately  we have noted that the efforts of the Organization to find a solution to the problem facing the people of Afghanistan have proved sterile  despite the fact that another year has passed since three fourths of the Member States voted in favour of General Assembly resolution 36/34.150.	We again condemn the flagrant aggression from which the people of Afghanistan are suffering and we reiterate our support for those who are struggling to re-establish that country's complete sovereignty. We add our voice to that of the inter¬national community  as we did in commemorating the day of Afghanistan  and demand the immediate with¬drawal of Soviet occupation forces. We likewise wish to express our sorrow over the situation affecting numerous inhabitants of that land who have had to seek refuge beyond their borders in order to escape foreign oppression.151.	A year has also passed since the adoption of Assembly resolution 36/5  insisting on respect for the territorial integrity  independence and right of self- determination of Kampuchea  together with the with¬drawal of invading forces  and that resolution has likewise been flagrantly disobeyed.152.	Chile  which gave its support to the efforts of the /M Roc Committee of the International Con¬ference on Kampuchea to find a comprehensive political solution of the problem  now expresses its satisfaction with regard to the recent formation of the Government headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.153.	The tense and unstable situation now prevailing in the Korean peninsula confirms our conviction that inter-Korean negotiations are the only practical way of resolving through peaceful means and without foreign intervention  a problem that has been dragging on for almost 40 years.154.	The situation in the Middle East continues to represent a threat to international peace and security. During the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth sessions of the General Assembly  I emphasized that our rejection of the use of force as a means for settling disputes  controversies or conflicts is the principle which  for a country like Chile  has necessarily assumed the highest priority. For this reason we emphasize the need for a realistic solution based on the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territories  with recognition of the right of all States of the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recog¬nized borders  and the full exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  including the right to the establishment of a sovereign State—all this in accordance with the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations  especially Security Council  reso¬lutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).155.	The tragic crisis involving Lebanon today has shaken the not always alert sensitivity of the interna¬tional community. We are deeply concerned over the situation affecting that country  with which we are linked by so many ties of friendship and co-operation. The grave problems besetting the Middle East have  unfortunately  resulted in the clashes between the various parties taking place on Lebanese soil and at the expense of its people. We insist on the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon and demand complete respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of that nation.156.	We cannot but express our grief over the base attack upon the President-elect of Lebanon  Mr. Bashir Gemayel. We condemn also most energetically the inhuman and brutal massacre of the Palestinian refu¬gees in the Sabra and Shatila camps. We view with horror the terrorism which has struck down yet more victims  breeding hate and loss of confidence among a people which was naturally longing for peace and prosperity after long years of misfortune and des¬peration.157.	We trust that these reprehensible crimes will not hinder the pacification process of that noble country  which now faces the challenge of starting its own reconstruction in order to seek the good fortune it deserves. We therefore wish President-elect Amin Gemayel the greatest success in his management of the difficult tasks of government that he has under¬taken.158.	Chile  in its dedication to peace and love of justice  has supported all initiatives designed to bring about a just and lasting solution to the complex and delicate situation in the Middle East. In this context we applaud the peace plans of the President of the United States and those of the Arab nations emanating from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. We call upon the States of this disturbed area to consider the proposals which can contribute effectively to the cause of peace and offer hope for the productive development of all its people  in a climate of under¬standing and good neighbourliness.159.	My country  as a member of the Special Com¬mittee on the Situation with regard to the Implementa¬tion of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and of the United Nations Council for Namibia  has participated actively in the process of self-determination and independence that has been developing in recent years. For this reason we note with special attention the negotiations under way to find a peaceful solution that will permit the people of Namibia finally to achieve independence in accordance with its interests. In this regard  my Government firmly supports Security Council resolu¬tions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978). We hope that a solu¬tion will be found to ensure a stable peace in the region and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the zone.160.	Chile is a country with strong feelings of loyalty to the American continent. It is proud to belong to a young and forceful continent which has given proof throughout its history of its genuine spirit of co¬operation and world solidarity. For this reason  we observe with concern the crisis affecting the inter- American system  the result of feelings of frustration and disenchantment among the American nations themselves resulting from the various conflicts and divisions within the confines of our continent.l63. The Government of Chile reaffirms from this rostrum the urgent need for the nations of the con¬tinent to strengthen their regional coexistence on the basis not only of the continent's legal system  but also of an essential political consensus that will enable us to recover an appropriate position in the international community.164.	This year  Latin America was shaken by the outbreak of the Anglo-Argentine conflict over the Malvinas Islands. The deep impact on the hemisphere of this unfortunate confrontation reflects our natural concern about the problems which trouble the Latin American community  especially the loss of faith in the effectiveness of the mechanisms of the inter-American and world systems. Faithful to its tradition of respect for the norms and principles of international law  my Government  together with 19 other Latin American countries  sponsored a request to include an item on the Malvinas Islands in the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly and we make an urgent appeal for the peaceful settlement of the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom under the auspices of the United Nations.165.	Faced with the present uncertain world pan¬orama  it is necessary to continue fighting tirelessly in order to attain the positive goals which will strengthen the Organization. In this respect we attrib¬ute special importance to the development of the new international law of the sea  to the efforts being made on disarmament and on the exploitation of outer space for peaceful purposes.166.	After nine long years of negotiations which established consensus as the method of legislating on international affairs  the Third United Nations Con¬ference on the Law of the Sea has adopted a con¬vention which should be a cause of pride to the world community. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has described it as one of the greatest achievements of the century. The law of the sea Con¬vention  which brings together important institutions and principles  such as classic maritime law  the rules governing the sea-bed and for the peaceful settlement of disputes and other no less significant matters  constitutes the new international law of the sea. These norms are designed to cover the activities of mankind on two thirds of this planet.167.	Special reference should be made to take eco¬nomic zone of 200 miles. This concept  which was originally framed by the Governments of Chile  Ecuador and Peru in 1952  is based on the legitimate right of States to their natural resources for the benefit of their respective populations. Latin America has gradually made this new maritime space its own  to the point of transforming it into one of the pillars of Latin American law of the sea and then into general interna¬tional law.168.	We believe that the significance and scope of the law of the sea Convention make it advisable that all member countries of the international community should participate in it. We must make every effort to achieve this and to avoid looking for alternative schemes lacking legal foundation and validity  and therefore not deserving of international recognition. It is important that the Convention be ready for signature on the date scheduled  that the Preparatory Commission established by the Conference* start functioning and that this decisive instrument enter into force as soon as possible.169.	In June of this year I had the honour of ad¬dressing the Assembly at the twelfth special ses¬sion  the second special session of the General As¬sembly devoted to disarmament [gee 77/Meefwg]. In stating the position of my country on that occasion  I pointed out that Chile  as a peace-loving nation  respectful of the law  condemned the use of force in any of its manifestations. Those principles  I added  constituted the basis of our foreign policy and deter¬mined our conduct in the difficult Held of interna¬tional relations. For that reason  we are concerned over the arms race in which today certain nations are involved  which is increasing tension and the threat of destruction hovering over mankind. Disarmament is closely tied to development and for that reason it will be most difficult for nations to find the path to progress if they have not first established effective and lasting peace. That is why we have supported demilitarization by regions  under the control of the United Nations  supporting valuable proposals  such as that made by the Japanese Government  which seek to neutralize the conventional and nuclear arms races. Chile  moreover  favours the strengthening of IAEA so that  through universal acceptance of its monitoring of nuclear facilities and the comprehensive use of its technical assistance capabilities  nuclear energy can be directed towards those objectives which seek to expand development and consolidate world peace.170.	Among the challenges to the improved develop¬ment of nations is the exploitation and utilization of outer space for peaceful purposes. Its condition as the common heritage of mankind must be safeguarded so that its exploration and exploitation can be conducted for the benefit of all peoples. We believe also that in order to preserve that condition it would be highly useful to have a world authority to administer the resources that may derive from exploitation  ade¬quately channelling applications of technology and indirectly preventing the militarization of outer space.171.	At the regional level  Chile has supported the establishment of a Latin American space agency which could serve to obtain the greatest advantages of the uses of space and improve expectations of well-being. We are happy to see that this initiative was favourably received by the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.172.	Within this context of promising perspectives I believe it would be appropriate to comment on the interesting developments taking place in the area of the Pacific basin. Various indicators have shown that we are in the presence of a process of growing economic interdependence between the coastal nations of that Ocean  where transportation and communica¬tions  trade  investments and the general flow of goods  services and people have been growing more than in any other area of the world during the past decade. As a result of these positive developments  various initiatives  especially from the academic and private business sectors  have been moving forward around a structure of regional integration and co-operation plans. Although this involves a vast basin  with many dissimilar racial  linguistic  religious  political and development factors  they frequently complement each ether and provide incentives  together with the phenomenon of interdependence I have already described  for establishing a course towards a future economic community in the Pacific.173.	Chile  a maritime country which attaches great importance to its diplomatic  economic and cultural activities in the Pacific region  decisively supports such initiatives. My Government therefore upholds the concept of a continuing interchange of ideas and consultative mechanisms for a common Pan-Pacific dialogue and  more particularly  the South-South co¬operation  which is feasible among Latin America  the islands of the South Pacific and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations.174.	The Chilean Government  faithful to its un¬wavering tradition of resolving disputes through peaceful means under international law  and its con¬sistent respect for treaties and international instru-ments  is continuing its attempt to settle its existing differences with the Republic of Argentina in our southern waters. We reiterate our faith in and full support for the noble mission undertaken by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his capacity as mediator. His providential intercession permitted the staving off of a dangerous crisis between our two nations at the end of 1978. The happy initiative of this distinguished mediator has already yielded valuable results which allow us to hope for the final and complete success of his efforts. We are certain that the final agreement to be achieved will contribute to the greater strengthening of the deep historical ties which have joined the two republics together since the dawn of their independence.175.	It is my very pleasant duty to reiterate to the Assembly the gratitude of the people and Government of Chile to a man who  as Vicar of Christ on earth  is engaged in such a noble undertaking in a world convulsed by violence.176.	As I stated at the beginning of my inter¬vention  the Chilean Government brings to the General Assembly a deep concern about the sensitive situation facing the world today. We agree with the Secretary- General when he states in his report that ""We are perilously near to a new international anarchy... one symptom of which is the crisis in the multilateral approach in international affairs and the concomitant erosion of the authority and status of world and regional intergovernmental institutions"". In order to avoid such anarchy  my country considers it essential to deal firmly with the situations which today constitute the principal sources of interna-tional tension  employing the means available to the Organization to ensure that States conform to the principles set forth in the Charter  in particular refraining from the threat or use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes and international co-operation in every area. An act of collective creativity is required which  with imagination and realism  will enable us to find agreed legal formulas to banish the apocalyptic phantom of war and to prepare for a future of world coexistence. To do so  we must not allow the Organ¬ization to become merely a body to which States bring their differences and problems. We must arrive at a sufficient consensus to enable us to avoid the outbreak of armed clashes  because once such a clash begins  it is almost impossible to stop it. To achieve that aim  we reaffirm the need to change the pro¬cedures for the peaceful settlements of disputes  and give them the necessary mandatory character.177.	In the course of this statement  I have stated the fundamental principles upon which our foreign policy is based  namely  respect for the individual and for the law. Our Government  maintaining a clear and consistent position  is applying those same prin¬ciples to its domestic life. With the broad support of its citizens  it is carrying out a process of institu¬tionalization designed to modernize the country in every sphere and to give its people greater oppor¬tunities for spiritual and material development.178.	Chile is prepared to continue along the road of peace and respect for the law  a tradition which is deeply rooted in its national character."
"27",1302,"CHN",37,1982,"First of all  Sir  I should like to con¬gratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.We hope that the current session will be crowned with success under your presidency. I also wish to thank Mr. Kittani for his contribution as President of the thirty-sixth session.76.	On this occasion each year we gather here to review major world issues of the day. We are all concerned about the changes in the world situation as a whole and we all follow the developments in various countries. Before I proceed to elaborate on China's views on current world affairs  I would like to say something about a recent event of major importance in the political life of the Chinese people.77.	As representatives know  the Communist Party of China held its Twelfth National Congress in Bering earlier last month. This Congress was an important milestone in the history of the People'  Republic of China. It summed up our experience in achieving great successes over the past six years. A grand program for China's socialist modernization was put forward and new central leading bodies of the party were elected. China now enjoys political stability and unity and its economy is growing steadily. It has entered a new era in its efforts to create a new situation in all fields of socialist modernization. Under the leadership of the Communist Party  the Chinese people are determined to make gigantic efforts on the basis of self-reliance in order to achieve  step by step  modernization in industry  agriculture  national defense and science and technology before the turn of the century and transform China into a culturally advanced and highly democratic socialist country. We intend to blaze a path of our own and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. We know that this is going to be an arduous task and will be no plain sailing. But we are fully confident of achieving our goal and of the bright future of our country.78.	In his report to the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China  the General Secretary of the Central Committee  Comrade Hu Yaobang  has given a comprehensive and profound explanation of China's foreign policy. We adhere to an independent foreign policy. In developing relations with other coun¬tries  we are always guided by the five principles  namely  mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. More particularly  we will unite with countries of the third world and join hands with all other countries and forces working for peace to combat hegemonism and maintain world peace.79.	Our independent foreign policy proceeds from the fundamental interests of the people of China and the world as a whole. The founding of the People's Republic of China has removed the social causes of China's submission to foreign aggression and those of any possibility that China might commit aggression abroad. In the 33 years of the People's Republic  we have shown by deeds that China never attaches itself to any big Power or group of Powers  nor yields to pressure from any big Power. We Chinese people cherish our own independence and sovereign rights  which we won only after protracted struggles. We are firmly opposed to hegemonism. At the same time  we declare to the whole world that under no circumstances will China seek hegemony.80.	8C. In our international relations we have always abided by the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Conforming to these principles  our Government has established co-operative relations of peace and friendship with a great number of coun¬tries in the past three decades and more  and settled many boundary questions and other issues left over from history. In the future we will continue to be ready to solve outstanding issues in our relations with some countries on the basis of the same principles. The Chinese Government is willing to develop normal relations with any country as long as it truly respects China's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  abides by the principles of equality  mutual benefit and mutual respect  and demonstrates by actual deeds rather than hollow words that it is not hostile to China and does not threaten China's security.81.	Our modernization program is based on the principle of independence and self-reliance. At the same time  we will continue to adhere firmly to our policy of opening to the outside world. We are ready to develop trade ties  economic co-operation and scientific-technological exchanges with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.82.	The people of all countries eagerly desire peace. China's modernization program can be realized only in an international environment of enduring peace and stability. In the common interests of the people of the world  we are ready to work together with all peace-loving countries and peoples for the main¬tenance of world peace and international security and for the advancement of the cause of human progress.83.	There are many pressing issues of universal concern on the agenda. Allow me to state here the basic position and views of the Chinese delegation.84.	First  on the question of maintaining world peace and international security. The international scene is far from being relaxed  but has become more turbulent and tense during the past year. While wars of aggression against Kampuchea and Afghanistan have not ceased in Asia  naked and savage aggression against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples has been going on without let-up in the Middle East. In southern Africa  the racists are wantonly carrying on brutal repression  military occupation and armed provocations. In Latin America  outside intervention has exacerbated the turmoil in the Caribbean region. Even the hitherto relatively calm South Atlantic has witnessed a war of the strong bullying the weak. Wrangling over the deployment of intermediate- range nuclear weapons have intensified the military confrontation in Europe. Faced with a continued economic recession  the developed countries are trying hard to shift the consequences of their economic crises on to others. This has badly hurt the devel¬oping countries and added to their economic woes. Stalemate on the question of global negotiations has seriously hampered the improvement of North- South relations. Disarmament is another issue of universal concern. Here again  no progress could be made  owing to the intensified arms race between the super-Powers. The recent second special session on disarmament has been a disappointment. In short  while the hitherto unresolved old issues of the world have become more complicated  new problems keep cropping up on the horizon. One cannot but feel bravely concerned and disturbed about the present international situation.85.	The menace to the peace and security of the world today originates mainly from imperialism  hegemonism and colonialism. The quest for hegemony by the super-Powers and the resultant global rivalry between them are the main source of the unrest and turmoil in the world. In their contention for spheres of influence and world supremacy  the super-Powers have accelerated the expansion of their armaments and stepped up their strategic deployment. They have openly or covertly subjected other countries to their aggression  intervention or control by direct or indirect use or threat of force. While the focus of their global strategies remains in Europe  the developments in recent years indicate that the main sphere of con¬tention between the super-Powers is in the third world. This fierce rivalry has constantly rocked the world and increased the danger of a world war. Therefore  the overriding task of the people of the world is to combat hegemonism and maintain international peace. The heroic struggles waged by the peoples of Afghanistan  Kampuchea and southern Africa and by the Arab people against aggression demonstrate that the people can  by means of unremitting struggle  upset the super-Powers' strategic plans and land the aggressors in deeper and deeper difficulties. We are convinced that so long as the people of the world are truly united and wage resolute struggles  world peace can be preserved.86.	Secondly  on the question of safeguarding the independence and the right to existence of nations. Word peace and security can be maintained only if the rights to independence and existence of nations are firmly safeguarded. These two aspects cannot be separated. The question of Afghanistan and the question of Kampuchea have not yet been settled and have again been included in the agenda of the current session. This is because the Soviet Union and Soviet-supported Viet Nam have continued to subject Afghanistan and Kampuchea under their respective military occupation and refused thus far to withdraw their aggressor troops there from.87.	Not long ago  the three Kampuchean patriotic forces resisting Vietnamese aggression agreed among themselves and formed the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. This Government enjoys the support of the Kampuchean people as well as international recog¬nition and endorsement. This is an encouraging major development in the Kampuchean situation. The Kam¬puchean people have persevered and won important victories in their war of resistance against Vietnamese aggression  thus landing the aggressors in a deepening quagmire. In order to extricate itself from this predicament  Hanoi has resorted to trickeries. It has launched a new ""peace offensive"" designed to soften and divide the international forces opposing Viet¬namese aggression against Kampuchea. Viet Nam is the aggressor in Kampuchea and the menace to the peace and security of South-East Asia  and yet it has fabricated a so-called China ""threat"" in an attempt to divert public attention and spread confusion. But this is completely futile. The five countries of ASEAN and the great majority of the States Members of the United Nations emphatically call for the implemen¬tation of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea   which demand the total withdrawal of Viet Nam's aggressor troops from Kampuchea so that the Kampuchean people may build a peaceful democratic  neutral and non-aligned State of national union free from any outside interference. This demand is fully justified. Since the question of Kampuchea has resulted from Viet Nam's armed aggression  there can be no genuine settlement of this question until Viet Nam withdraws all its aggressor troops from Kampuchea. Any ""political solution"" that accepts the status quo created by Viet Nam's aggression at the expense of Kampuchea's independence and sovereignty would be contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international relations and  therefore  are inadmissible.88.	The same applies to the question of Afghanistan. The Afghan people have not been cowed by their formidable enemy  but have fought valiantly under the sacred banner of safeguarding their national inde¬pendence and have frustrated the aggressors' cherished plan of bringing the war to a quick conclusion. Soviet armed aggression against Afghanistan constitutes a gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a grave threat to peace in Asia and the world. None of the pretexts put forward by the Soviet Union to justify its continued presence in Afghanistan is tenable. We maintain that the resolutions adopted at three consecutive sessions of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan must be strictly implemented. The Soviet Union must unconditionally pull out all its troops from Afghanistan. The Afghan people should be allowed to determine their own destiny free from any outside interference. Afghanistan must regain the status of an independent and non-aligned State. That is the only feasible way to settle the question of Afghanistan.89.	The situation in Lebanon has aroused serious world-wide concern during the last few months. How the Lebanese situation and the Palestinian question are treated involves respect for a State's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and recognition of a nation's rights to existence and self-determination. This is also a question bearing on peace in the Middle East and international security as a whole. The Israeli aggressors have flagrantly invaded and occupied large tracts of Lebanese territory and attempted to wipe out the Palestinian revolutionary armed forces. They perfidiously entered Beirut again and savagely massacred Palestinian and Lebanese civilians. The United States cannot shirk its responsibility for this since it has always shielded and abetted the Israeli aggressors. China joins all other countries in voicing strong condemnation of the acts of aggression and the inhuman atrocities committed by the Israeli authorities. We firmly support the Palestinian  Leba¬nese and other Arab peoples in their struggle against Israeli aggression and expansion.90.	The question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East issue. Although the Palestinian people have suffered a temporary setback  their forces will never be wiped out because they are fighting for a just cause. The PLO is recognized by more than 100 coun¬tries as the sole legitimate representative of the Pales¬tinian people. Any proposal or formula designed to exclude the PLO from the settlement of the Middle East question would be wrong and unworkable. The plan put forward at the Twelfth Arab Summit Confer¬ence  held recently in Fez  provides a good basis for a fair and reasonable settlement of the questions of Palestine and the Middle East. In our view  to achieve peace in the Middle East  Israel must evacuate the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967  including .Jerusalem; the Pales¬tinian people must regain their national rights  including the right to return to their homeland  the right to self-determination and the right to establish their own State; and the rights to independence and existence of all countries in the Middle East should be respected.91.	The most urgent task now is to stop Israel's aggression against Lebanon. The United Nations and all the countries and peoples that cherish peace and uphold justice should act promptly and take effective measures to compel Israel to withdraw all its troops from Lebanon immediately and unconditionally.92.	In southern Africa  with the backing and con¬nivance of a super-Power  the South African authorities have intensified their racist policies. They have continued their illegal occupation of Namibia and made repeated armed provocations against and military incursions into neighbouring countries  thereby posing a direct threat to the security and stability of the region. People are deeply concerned about the situation in southern Africa and  in particular  about the inde¬pendence of Namibia  which will affect the historical process of the final liberation of the entire African continent. We maintain that  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  Namibia should immediately achieve genuine national independence on the basis of territorial integrity and national unity; South Africa's apartheid system should be completely abolished; and the international community should apply effective comprehensive sanctions against the South African authorities. The Chinese people firmly support -the just struggle of the African people  particularly the Namibian and South African people  until they win final victory 93.	The military conflict over the Malvinas Islands earlier this year also aroused general concern. The question of the Malvinas Islands remains unsolved despite the termination of the war. It is a reminder that although the cause of national liberation has won great victories throughout the world in the post-war period  the process of decolonization has not yet been completed. We support the request of Argentina and other Latin American countries for consideration of the question of the Malvinas Islands at the current session of the General Assembly. Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands should be respected by the international community. Together with other third-world countries  we sincerely hope that the parties concerned will seek a just and reason¬able solution to this question by peaceful negotiations.94.	I would now say a few words about the Korean question. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made important contributions towards a reason¬able settlement of the Korean question and the maintenance of peace in East Asia and the Pacific region. The Chinese Government firmly supports the positive proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. We firmly support President Kim 11 Sung's proposal for establishing a democratic confederal republic of Koryo. We always hold that in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean question the ""United Nations Command"" must be dissolved immediately in accordance with resolution 3390 B (XXX) adopted at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly  all United States military forces must be withdrawn from South Korea  and the Korean Armistice Agreement should be replaced by a peace agreement through negotiations between the parties concerned.95.	Thirdly  I turn to the subject of the economy and development of the third-world countries. At present  many third-world countries are faced with deepening economic difficulties. Certain m or developed countries have tried to shift their own economic difficulties onto the third-world countries and have cut back their development assistance  thus further straining North-South economic relations. The developing countries have pressed for the launch¬ing of global negotiations with a view to improving North-South relations and establishing a new inter¬national economic order. The General Assembly has long since adopted a resolution pertaining to this question and the Group of 77 has also put forward a reasonable draft resolution. AH this has provided a constructive basis for launching global negotiations as soon as possible. The Inter¬national Meeting on Co-operation and Development  which held at Cancun in October 1981  gave expres¬sion to the common desire of the great majority of nations for the launching of global negotiations. At the meeting  Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang gave clear- cut support to the demand of the third world for the establishment of a new international economic order. Owing to obstruction by a major Power  no agreement on the launching of global negotiations has yet been reached. This state of affairs has caused deep disap¬pointment and resentment among developing coun¬tries and also among quite a few developed countries.96.	The international community faces the important task of improving North-South economic relations through global negotiations. The economies of all countries are closely interrelated. The developed countries cannot achieve economic growth without the rich resources  vast markets and economic prosperity of the developing countries. All countries  whether rich or poor  North or South  must abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit if they are to carry out fruitful economic exchanges and co-oper¬ation. The existing unreasonable  unfair and outdated international economic order must be restructured. The developed countries' economic aid to the devel¬oping countries conforms to their own interest and is by no means charity. This has been recognized by more and more far-sighted people in the West. We hope that at the current session the Assembly will surmount obstacles and make real progress towards the launching of global negotiations.97.	While striving to improve North-South relations  the third-world countries also exert great efforts to promote ""South-South"" co-operation among them¬selves. The developing countries have industrious people  rich natural resources and a vast market.they share the common objective of developing their national economies. There are unlimited potentials for developing inner-third-world co-operation. This will be highly beneficial. This kind of co-operation is an important means for the developing countries to strengthen their self-reliance both individually and collectively. It also has the vital strategic role of help¬ing to break down the existing inequitable international economic relationship and replace it with a new inter¬national economic order.98.	The restructuring of the old international economic order is a demand of the times which the third-world countries are bound to raise after they have won political independence. Political independence cannot be consolidated or sustained without economic independence. Regardless of all the obstructions from imperialism and hegemonism  the third-world countries will persist in the just struggle to restructure the old international economic order until final victory.99.	The emergence of the third world in the inter¬national arena after the Second World War is an event of primary importance of our time. In recent years the numerous countries of the third world  united in a common struggle  have effectively defended their national independence and State sovereignty and made major contributions towards restructuring the old international economic order as well as maintaining international peace and security. Their joint struggle has  to a great extent  changed the situation in which the super-Powers could arbitrarily manipulate the destiny of the world. Events show that unity means strength. We are convinced that so long as we third-world countries can seek a reasonable settlement of our own differences and disputes through peaceful consultations in a spirit of mutual understanding and accommodation and of seeking common ground while reserving the differences  and so long as we can close our ranks and work for our common cause  we will be better able to control our own destiny and promote the progress of world history. As a member of the third world  China will continue to play its part by further expanding its friendly co-operation with other third-world countries and peoples.100.	Faced with increasing troubles and turmoil on the world scene  one is entitled to expect that the United Nations will uphold justice and play a greater role in maintaining world peace and inter¬national security and in promoting the  growth of the world economy. However  events over a period of time indicate that the role of the United Nations has been eroding. This is chiefly because certain countries have abused their veto power  bypassed the United Nations on a number of issues or refused to implement its resolutions.101.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has pointed to the problems and difficulties confronting the United Nations and has made some suggestions to uphold the principles of the Charter which merit our consideration. We appreciate and support the efforts of the Secretary- General and also hope that certain permanent members of the Security Council will show a more co-operative approach. We believe that  provided the over¬whelming majority of the Member States make com¬mon efforts to uphold the Charter and wage a resolute struggle against any force that jeopardizes world peace and international security  the Organization will not disappoint the people of the world  but will perform its noble duty of maintaining world peace and pro¬moting human progress  thereby fulfilling the historic mission entrusted to it."
"28",1382,"CMR",37,1982,"  My first words will be words of congratulation to Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the presidency of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. It is a choice which does honour to his outstanding qualities as a person and an experienced diplomat and is also a tribute to his country  the People's Republic of Hungary  whose positive contribution to the work of the Organization is well known. It is a pleasure for me to assure him of my delegation's complete co-operation as he carries out the difficult but exalted task of guiding our work during this period of disarray  instability and violence in the affairs of the world. I take this opportunity also to pay a tribute to his outstanding predecessor in this post. Mr. Kittani of Iraq  for the competence and patience without firmness-which he demonstrated as he carried out the lofty functions entrusted to him during the thirty-sixth session and the special sessions of the General Assembly held this year. Finally 1should like to express my admiration for the Secretary-General for the clarity  courage and competence with which he has been fulfilling for almost a year now the prestigious functions vested in him by the Organization. We find stunning proof of these qualities in his report on the work of the Organization and which raises the vital question for the international community-the future of the United Nations.264. It cannot be disputed that the erosion of the authority of the Organization has for several years now been a source of major concern to the international community. Never indeed has the feeling of such a collapse been so keenly felt in the world. Without respect for the principles of the Charter  there could be no international society that would be peaceful  harmonious and balanced  yet they have been systematically flouted. Instead of those principles the threat or use of force is often resorted to in the settlement of disputes. The revival of the cold war  the hegemonistic rivalries of the major Powers and the self-centred attitude of Member States bring about a situation in which the United Nations is usually bypassed in the search for solutions to the problems which the world faces.265. When it happens that countries turn to the United Nations  it is often for the reason of giving free rein to ideological confrontations for propaganda purposes  or as an alibi. so that only their own point of view prevails. If they do not succeed  they do not hesitate to block the functioning of the Security Council by abusing the right of veto. Nevertheless this right was established in order to serve as an instrument to safeguard the priceless common good of peace and security in the world; it was not meant to be a shield against sanctions that the Organization can apply when there are flagrant violations of the principles of the Charter.266. Moreover  we must feel alarmed at the serious financial difficulties  resulting from the parsimonious contributions of Member States  particularly the most wealthy  in the operations of the specialized agencies  which were established with the noble purpose of promoting the harmonious and unified development of our countries.267. Regardless of what idea one might have of the role of the United Nations  it is the conviction of Cameroon  a former ward of the Organization  that the Organization must remain the single preferred instrument for maintaining international peace and security  the irreplaceable forum for international negotiations and the tribune of the conscience of mankind.268. That is why we have constantly deplored the paralysis and the crumbling of the credibility of the United Nations as a place for the settlement of international disputes during this period of tension and confusion  when it should enjoy authority commensurate with the scope and the complexity of the burning issues of our time.269. Unfortunately the inclusion in the agenda of this session of numerous questions that have faced the world community for decades testifies to the growing weakening of our institution. Among them we must cite  above all  the questions of disarmament. It was a matter of concern for all States even before the establishment of the United Nations  and that concern has been revived by the acute psychosis aroused by the threat of a nuclear holocaust that looms over mankind.270. In spite of long years of negotiation  of recommendations of the General Assembly  and vehement protest on the part of the public  the situation remains explosive because of the absence of the political will among the major Powers  all of which have increased their military expenditures and are continuing to manufacture the most sophisticated and increasingly deadly weapons.271. At the second special session devoted to disarmament  which was held in June in New York  the Assembly did not even manage to adopt a consensus text as it did at the first special session on disarmament in 1978. The sole achievement of that session was the granting of a few disarmament fellowships. That surely proves that the major Powers and their antagonistic military alliances fighting for domination of the world are not yet ready to join in a substantive dialogue that could lead us resolutely towards the general and complete disarmament advocated in numerous resolutions of the United Nations.272. The question of the Middle East  which has been before us since 1947  has undergone more and more tragic developments  which have horrified and alarmed the international community  since the invasion of Lebanon on 6 June of this year. We vigorously condemn the hideous massacres of women children and old people in the Palestinian camps in west Beirut. It is deplorable that the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Security Council on the question of the Middle East  particularly with regard to Palestine  have remained a dead letter.273. As we' have never ceased to state  the solution of the Palestinian problem is the key to any just and lasting overall settlement of the question of the Middle East. This implies that Israel  which  like the other States in the region  has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  must with draw from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 including Jerusalem  and must recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people represented by the PLO  including the right to have an Arab Palestinian homeland.274. The time has certainly come for the intensive efforts at present under way to end the long tragedy being played out in the Middle East to take into account these fundamental facts; otherwise international peace and security will remain threatened in that particularly sensitive region of the world  which could serve as the detonator for a world-wide catastrophe.275. The Namibian crisis and the base policy of apartheid of the racist South Mrican regime constitute in Africa two examples of typical situations whose worsening over the period of three decades constitutes a humiliating defiance of the international community In spite of the various means set forth in the Charter for ending these anachronistic and universally condemned situations  South Africa has not yielded an inch 0 ground  in spite of the numerous statements and the pretences of negotiation repeatedly launched in order to give the impression that it is prepared to co-operate with the United Nations in settling these questions.276. Even though it IS a decolonization question  and even though it is so clearly defined that there can be no doubt about it  the question of Namibia which has been under examination since the first session of the AsseJ1lbly  in 1946  is still on the agenda 36 years later.277. Nevertheless  it is important to recall that the patient and laborious efforts of the international community have finally made it possible to c()me up with a broad consensus  with which South Africa has associated itself  to bring about a solution of the problem within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). While that resolution remains the basis for any peaceful solution to bring about authentic independence for Namibia  the delays arid turnabouts to which South Africa has accustomed us raise §some doubts about the real willingness of the racist minority of Pretmia to release its grip on that international territory.278. The same is true for the inhumane policy of apartheid  which has been unanimously condemned by the General Assembly as a crime against humanity and which has been recognized by the Security Council as being a threat to international peace and security Nevertheless  having been outlawed and banished from the international community  South Mrica continues to evade the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter  and continues to strengthen its repressive machinery against the black majority  which is still denied the most elementary human rights.279. The criminal obstinacy of the racist regime of Pretoria can be explained only by the powerful sup-port it has been enjoying even within the Organization  which it uses to carry out with impunity acts of aggression against neighbouring African States. We condemn those acts  which create and maintain in southern Africa a climate of instability and dangerous tension. We reaffirm our solidarity with the Namibian people in their struggle to regain their independence and to enjoy all their rights under the aegis of SWAPO  their sole authentic representative. We also stand shoulder to shoulder with the front-line African States  which have willingly been making heavy sacrifices so that the liberty and dignity of the black man in southern Africa may triumph.279.	All of us are well aware of the many very clear and firm resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and 'lf the Security Council on other important questions which have not yet been resolved and which give rise to instability  tension and con-fusion  all of which are disturbing the international climate.280.	First there is the question of Cyprus. In this regard we have on many occasions asked for the withdrawal of the foreign troops from that country as a basis for a settlement of this question  and we have reaffirmed the necessity to respect the territorial integrity  the unity and the non-alignment of that State. It is high time the resolutions adopted on that matter were implemented.282.	With regard to Kampuchea  again we must emphasize that the solution can only be a political one and it must not be interfered with from outside in any way. Therefore we wish to reaffirm that the Kampuchean people itself has the right to decide its own .future and its political  economic and social options. Everything should be done to promote the achievement of those objectives.283.	The same is true  of Afghanistan  where the situation still threatens the peace and security of the whole of the region of South-West Asia. Here again  the withdrawal of foreign troops and total respectfor the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country are in our view of .fundamental-importance to the settlement of the question.284. We are deeply troubled by the alarming development of these problems  which are of fundamental concern to the international community.28Sr The difficulties experienced by the United Nations in playing its decisive role in the safeguarding of international peace and security have also prevented I it from effectively fulfilling another part of its lofty' mission-:-to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic and social character. In this regard the delay in the launching of the global negotiations envisaged in General Assembly resolution 34/138 is an obvious example.286. Despite the major concessions that have been made by the Group of 77 and the political will thatwas evident in that Group throughout the consultations that took place during the thirty-sixth session  that resolution remains unimplemented because of the intransigence of some industrialized countries. This blockage cannot but have negative and destabilizing effects upon the fragile economies of the developing countries  because some of the essential objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  such as increased official development aid or the mobilization of resources in favour of the least-developed countries  have not been achieved within the envisaged timetable.287. The balance-sheet of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea demonstrates that with regained and increased solidarity and political will it is possible to attain results that safeguard the basic interests of all States and enhance the prestige of the Organization. Indeed  after eight years of intensive and thorny discussions the negotiations on the law of the sea led to the adoption last summer of a new Convention dealing with all aspects of this problem. How can one not regret the reluctance of some countries to associate themselves with that result? We urgently appeal to them to join in the general consensus.288. The state of the world economy  which is dominated by recession  unemployment  widespread inflation and monetary instability  gives us another reason for deep concern because it affects all sectors of activity in an countries  particularly the counties of the third world  which indeed are the major victims  as is indicated in the reports of all specialized agencies  particularly the World Bank  as well as IMF.289. Indeed  the situation of the developing countries  and particularly the least developed  is extremely critical. Their current account deficits are growing because of the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade and rising interest rates  whereas increased recourse to capital markets and reserves to finance these deficits burdens their external debt further and reduces their development opportul1lities.290.	In the view of my delegation this crisis can be resolved only through implementation of measures on which there has been common agreement within the framework of the new international economic order.291.	We should be wrong if we did not begin to face this problem with a sense of solidarity. It would be useless for us to continue to resort to self-interested measures such as restrictive policies exemplified by increased protectionism and some essentiallymonetarist choices. Indeed the world economy as a whole is taking a dangerous turn  and the aftermath may be socio-political problems that may threaten the very existence of young nations.292. Responsibility for this state of affairs rests basically with the developed countries  not all of which  apparently  are yet convinced that solution of the current economic crisis requires an increasingly global approach rather than simple domestic readjustments that in the final analysis are merely temporarily palliatives. This approach deliberately disregards the true interdependence of all the actors on the world economic stage that has so often been demonstrated by experience.293. So far as Cameroon is concerned  as has frequently been stated by its head of State  there can be no doubt that at this time the launching of global negotiations in the framework of the United Nations is the best way to promote among States the development of just and equitable economic relations. World economic turmoil can be alleviated only within a climate of co-operation  joint effort and dialogue between States and the peoples of all nations. This means that international relations must be organized democratically and it presupposes a real desire equitably to readjust relations between industrialized and third-world countries  in the context of world-wide solidarity.294. The United Nations was created to safeguard certain ideals and principles that would guarantee international peace and security and promote the progress and united development of Member States while respecting a code of conduct whose principles are clearly defined by the Charter. For that reason in the Charter the founding  fathers of the Organization formally enjoined us to practise tolerance  to live in peace in a spirit of good-neighbourliness  to reject the use of force in the settlementof conflicts and to have recourse to international institutions to promote the economic and social progress of peoples.295. A single generation separates us from the solemn proclamation of that commitment. In view of some of the painful  indeed intolerable  situations we have just mentioned  we feel we have largely lost sight of that commitment  which was freely entered into. The discrepancy between the ideals of the Charter to which Member States subscribed and the: actual conduct of those States is a fundamental cause of the crisis besetting the Organization  which  need it be reiterated  is no more than a mirror of our society.296. The expansion of the United Nations with the emergence of young nations has enhanced its universalist vocation and that means that all Member States must reaffirm their loyalty to the Organization so that it can play its full role. This increased universalization  which the law of the majority has legitimized  must be the foundation of international legal order. However  in our view this development has led the great Powers to feel disappointment-so much so that the Organization is largely left to one side in the settlement of the major problems affecting the fate of all peoples. We certainly recognize the particular responsibilities of those Powers in the conduct of world affairs. But  in a world in which the progress of science and technology has accentuated the interdependence of nations  we shall continue to reiterate that no State or group of States  however powerful can in and of itself solve mankind's problems.297. It is therefore a matter of urgency that we return to what inspired the creation of the Organization and strongly support the wise proposal of the Secretary-General that a special series of Security Council meetings be convened at the highest level to seek ways and means to reimbue that essential organ with the effectiveness and authority it needs to discharge the special responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter.298. We are gratified that the Secretary-General has unambiguously raised the question of the very usefulness of the United Nations. What is involved is whether we  the Member States  are ready to let the Organization die a death similar to that of the League of Nations or whether we are determined to revitalize it by ensuring that our conduct accords with the principles and ideals of the Charter.299. For Cameroon  the answer is clear. As Mr. Ahmadou Ahidjo said from this same rostrum more than 10 years ago:""The unity of man's destiny is today more concrete and more evident than ever before. For• the first time in history  mankind is consciously becoming a unified whole. For the first time  man has at his disposal the means of shaping his own destiny  allaying poverty and triumphing over violence.""Is it utopian to ask the United Nations  which  we repeat  embodies our hopes for a better world  to deploy all its resources so as to ensure that our era  which sees a universal civilization taking shape  is the beginning of a reign of genuine brotherhood in the world?.."
"29",1424,"COD",37,1982,"First of all I wish to convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai of Hungary on his elections to the presidency of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His country attachment to peace  together with his statesman-like and diplomatic qualities  as well as his perfect mastery of the major problems of international concern  gives us the certainty that the work of this session will be conducted with competence and efficiency. The delegation of Zaire assures him its whole hearted co-operation. I also express our appreciation to his predecessor  Mr Kittani  for the competence  devotion  tact and efficiency with which he conducted the proceedings of the thirty sixth session  at a particular difficult time of international affairs. I should like in addition to extend once again to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the sincere congratulations of the President  the Executive Council and the Republic of Zaire on his election to the post of Secretary General  to assure him of our whole hearted cooperation and to express our best wishes for success in discharge of his mandate in the ultimate interest of peace security and development in the worldThe delegation of Zaire wishes to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization  in which his lucid and striking analysis confirms the merits  competence and experience of a man eminently aware of our common concern for international peace and security  progress and development through the confident cooperation of nations and peoples. This report is an invitation to all of us to renew our commitment to the letter and spirit of the Charter and to reaffirm our commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security  the promotion of co-operation for development  the easing or reducing of tension in the world  the adoption of measures to increase confidence m international relations  recourse to the collective security machinery provided for in the Charter; in a word  the principles of international law governing friendly relations and co-operation among States.The Republic of Zaire  whose policy has always been guided by the goals and principles of the Charter  attaches the utmost significance to the role of the Organization. Our struggle for the recognition on our right to security  a prerequisite of development  and of our right to development and to a share in world prosperity  and our right to our own identity  stems from a peaceful vision of international relations; the same vision which one can glimpse in the words of the Charter and which fails well within the framework of the general struggle of the peoples of the third world for greater justice and equity in international relations.We have never committed aggression against anyone  nor have we threatened to  and it is our firm intention  as firm as it ever was  to pursue a policy of peace  good-neighborliness  co-operation and openness to all nations of the world  on the basis of mutual advantage  and with respect for our sovereignty  our dignity and our right to a separate identity.All our efforts in Zaire are focused on the building of a democratic  peaceful  modem and prosperous Zairian society  open to the enriching contributions of the outside world  but at the same time profoundly rooted in and respectful of our own authentic valuesOn behalf of the President and Government of the Republic of Zaire  we wish to state that we threaten no one  politically  ideologically  economically  or militarily  and we expect that our partners in the world need commitment on our part. The peace loving nature of our country  open to friendship and internationalism  co-operation  derives not only from its colonial history  which was marked by suffering and depredation of every kind  but also by the incessant struggle in different ways for national liberation. It also derives from our history after independence  one of division and secession resulting from two evils ótribalization and servile adoption of imported ideologiesóbut also one of a courageous struggle waged by the popular movement of the revolution  our party of the rally of the masses  headed by its founder  Mobutu Sese Seko  to regain its cultural identity.We base our struggle for cultural liberation on a policy of a return to our authentic values. It can be defined as a critical and vigilant approach in which  without disregard for the contributions of other cultures  we draw  above all  from our own rich cultural heritage whatever is likely to permit us to affirm our own identity and personality and to achieve our overall objectives in the building of our country  and thus contributing to world civilization. We want to live in peace and friendship with other States. We do so as a country situated in the heart of the African continent  which shares more than 10 000 kilometers of borders with nine other countries  each with its own history  and using as a means of expression the French  English  Portuguese and Arabic languages.This policy of peace  friendship and co-operation followed by Zaire has been demonstrated in each particular case by policies of good-neighborliness  attachment to Africa  and respect for the policy of non-alignment and the principles of the Charter governing relations among various countries.Speaking of peace  what can we see about us today? At the present time  failure to respect commitments  in terms of peace  decolonization  international co-operation  the interdependence of States  human solidarity  the rights of peoples and individuals  and general and complete disarmament under effective international control  are today the major sources of tension  conflict  war and mistrust in international relations  of economic and moral crises and of the failure to attain the objectives unanimously proclaimed in the Charter.If the 1970s ended on a note of bitterness  the prospects for the 1980s hardly seem more promising. political  economic and social matters of major concern  which were the focus of the international community's attention  at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and elsewhere  have remained  in some cases  without satisfactory solutions  and in other cases deadlocked.There is every reason to believe that the international situation will continue to be marked in the immediate future by increasing tension  distrust in relations between States  an escalation of the arms race  interference in the internal affairs of other States  recourse to violence  and difficulties in international co-operation for development  thus jeopardizing peace and  hence  the very survival of mankind.The crisis  at once political  economic and social  which is at present unsettling the world  has severely handicapped the United Nations in awning its objectives. This inability of the United Nations  resulting from the failure of States to respect commitments freely entered into  has had the effect of adding to the complexity of the problems of the world today  and has aroused a general feeling of insecurity.Article 2 of the Charter lays down the principles of Jus Cogens  which has binding force and binds all States in the international community. Unfortunately  however  a number of States  in abusing their power  quite often shirk their obligation not to have recourse to force  not to interfere in the internal affairs of other States  and peacefully to settle their disputes  thus undermining the authority of the Organization of which they are Members. Some go so far as to institutionalize methods of violence  the sole goal of which is to ensure that they continue to benefit from unjust and arbitrary situations.Since the creation of the United Nations 37 years ago  the question of disarmament has been the subject of numerous rounds of negotiations. Resolutions and treaties are concluded and by negotiating bodies  both within and outside the framework of the United Nations  and proliferate. Unfortunately  and this must be said  none of this has served to halt or turn back the arms race. Quite the contrary  the arms race proceeds apace.In spite of the international instruments prohibiting nuclear-weapon testing  we are daily shocked to learn of new developments and improvements in weapons whose destructive capacity boggles the imagination. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  many States have undertaken not to produce or to possess such weapons. Nevertheless  the major Powers continue the nuclear arms race in the name of a so-called balance of power and the dangerous theory of deterrence  each day accumulating ever- greater quantities of nuclear weapons and refusing to give negative guarantees to the nan-nuclear-weapon States.Thanks to the facilities granted it by certain Powers in contravention of Security Council resolution 421 (1977)  imposing an embargo on arms shipments to South Africa  and in disregard of the OAU Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  South Africa's possession of the atomic bomb  places all African States  and its neighboring African States in particular  in a situation of total insecurity.If the nuclear arms race is quite rightly a matter of concern to the international community  the question of conventional weapons must also be the subject of our concern  because they are the weapons that are at present being employed wherever hotbeds of tension exist in the world. The Republic of Zaire welcomed the adoption by the United Nations on 10 October 1980 of the Convention on the Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects  and three Protocols thereto.However  to be more fruitful  subsequent negotiations should examine the most crucial aspects of the problem posed by conventional weapons  namely  their overproduction  their sophistication and their transport towards areas of tension. Responsibility for this state of affairs lies solely with the manufacturers  who are more concerned about the profits they earn from the arms industry than about the danger the dissemination of weapons poses to international peace and security.The Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  aptly laid stress on the need to approach the gamut of disarmament problems from the standpoint of development  because the arms race swallows up considerable resources that could be used to solve urgent economic and social problems. Indeed  in 1981 alone  arms expenditures amounted to $600 billion at a time when UNICEF  to mention only that organization  was drawing attention to the tragic plight of children throughout the world. Only 1 per cent of that figure would have been enough to alleviate their suffering.The reduction of military budgets is something that falls within the context of the goal of halting and reversing the arms race in order to free the resources necessary for economic development  in particular that of the developing countries. Resolutions adopted by the United Nations to that effect have not been implemented because the international community's interest has not been sufficiently aroused. This impotence of the international community has once again been illustrated by the failure of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which was able only to produce a programme for the World Disarmament Campaign.As the President of Zaire recalled at the recent conference of heads of State of France and Africa held in Kinshasa  the tragic events in Lebanon have highlighted the complexity of the crisis in the Middle East  where the situation remains extremely disturbingThe search for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict is on a difficult road. The importance the international community attaches to a rapid settlement of the Middle East crisis emerges clearly from the various peace initiatives or proposals put forward over the past few years. It would appear that the international community has genuinely become aware of the true gravity of the situation that exists in this part of the world that is particularly sensitive  regarding the maintenance of international peace and security.In General Assembly resolution 181 (II)  the United Nations assumed the historic responsibility for guaranteeing the existence in Palestine of a Jewish State  an Arab State and a special international regime for the Holy City of Jerusalem. The Security Council  and the five permanent members of the Council in particular  should envisage the adoption of special measures to guarantee the security  stability and integrity of all States in the region in order to usher in an era of peace  stability and harmony in that part of the world. The Palestinian people have the same rights as do the people of Israel  namely  the right to form an independent State  to a homeland of their own and to live in peace within secure and recognized frontiers free from acts of force.We are convinced that the settlement of the Middle East conflict requires  at the minimum  respect for and implementation of the following principles: first  recognition of the right of each State of the region to live in peace within secure and recognized frontiers; secondly  respect for the territorial integrity  political independence and sovereignty of each State; thirdly  mutual recognition among States in the region; fourthly  respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force; fifthly  recognition of the fact that the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the Middle East problem and  sixthly  recognition of and respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to create an independent State under the leadership of the PLO  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.All these elements can be found in General Assembly resolutions 181 (II) and 194 (III) and in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Taken together  those four resolutions contain all the elements necessary for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem  for they are mutually complementary and provide for a global approach to the various aspects of this problem. It is in that context  in particular  that we welcome the French-Egyptian initiative in the Security Council and the conclusions reached by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. The international community and the United Nations can today find in all those initiatives based on good faith the elements necessary for resolving the conflict.Zaire  a member of the Security Council  has associated itself with all the resolutions adopted by the Council since the outbreak of the Lebanese affair and it will continue to give its support to the effective implementation of those resolutions in the recognized interests of Lebanon. Zaire  whose policy is based on the goals and principles of the Charter and which attaches great importance to the role of the Organization  associated itself with the condemnation of the criminal massacre of Palestinian civilians in the Shatila and Sabra camps and demands that the rights of the civilian population be respected  without any discrimination  while at the same time it censures all acts of violence against civilian populations. We believe that those responsible for these massacres cannot remain unpunished. As was quite rightly stated by the President of the Republic of Zaire in his masterly statement on 8 October 1982  no morality  no pretext of any kind can possibly justify the massacre of innocent civilians.With regard to the problem of Namibia  the position of Zaire has recently been recalled most clearly by the President of the Republic in the aforementioned statement  and we venture to repeat its main points in the Assembly.In terms of the proposed settlement of the Namibian question approved by Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Namibia was to become independent in 1978. But  five years after the approval of that proposal  the transfer of power to the people of Namibia with the assistance of the United Nations has still not been carried out and South Africa is maintaining its illegal occupation and administration of this Territory  in defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and international public opinion.While SWAPO has repeatedly given proof of its constant readiness to co-operate in the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan  South Africa's attitude has been characterized by frequent recourse to delaying tactics and other maneuvers designed to impede the implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) and to postpone for as long as possible the inevitable independence of Namibia.We must all realize that the continuance of the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa  together with the denial of the inalienable rights and fundamental freedoms of the Namibian people  the extension of the policy of apartheid to this Territory and the transformation of Namibian territory into a springboard for attacks and aggression against neighbouring independent African States  in particular Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe and Botswana  constitute a grave threat to peace and security in this region.Furthermore  the injection into the Namibian matter of extraneous factors which can serve only to distort this problem  which is in essence colonial  contains within itself the germs of a grave threat to international peace and security  while at the same time removing the protagonists even further from the climate of tranquility and confidence so necessary for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question.Africa as a whole desires authentic and rapid independence for Namibia. Although we are convinced of the need to take into account certain practical considerations  we believe that resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question that will bring about authentic independence  on conditions acceptable to the Namibian people and hence to the international community.We have been following with keen interest the consultations among the five members of the Western contact group and all parties concerned  and we have noted with satisfaction the constructive approach of SWAPO and the front-line States to the most recent proposals of the contact group. South Africa must adopt a similar approach in its consideration of these proposals and respond to them without delay.I should like to take this opportunity to repeat our firm condemnation of the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and its repeated acts of aggression against neighboring States  and we appeal for an increase in material and financial assistance to SWAPO in its just struggle for national liberation. Aware of its responsibilities towards Africa  Zaire will do everything within its power and its means  together with other members of the OAU and the United Nations  to help Namibia to become independent in 1983.To talk of Namibia is in a sense also to refer to the distressing situation in which the black peoples of South Africa have been kept for decades. To these victims of atrocious humiliation  who are suffering in the middle of the twentieth century  under the shameful yoke of the criminal policy of	we say that Zaire  in unison with all the States of the world that cherish peace  justice  freedom and equality  reaffirms its solidarity in their just struggle for national liberation and the recovery of their rights.The situation prevailing in South Africa has all the characteristics of a typical colonial situation  aggravated by the elevation of racism and racial discrimination to the government policy known as apartheid  an outrageous policy which the United Nations and the whole civilized world have condemned as a crime against humanity. It follows from this condemnation that every State  every member of the international community  is duty-bound to help to ensure the abolition and eradication ofand to refrain from any action that might directly or indirectly give comfort to South Africa in its pursuit of this policy and its denial of the inalienable rights and fundamental freedoms of the black population of South Africa.It is our dearest hope to see emerge in South Africa a genuinely democratic society governed by the majority and guaranteeing the rights of all the minorities without distinction as to race  color  sex or religion.The situation which has arisen in the extremely sensitive area of the Gulf with the persistence of the conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq  two brother countries members of the non-aligned movement  is particularly disturbing. We can only deplore the fact that the efforts which have been made so far within the United Nations and the non-aligned movement  as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference  to bring about the peaceful settlement of this conflict have not proved successful.We should like to appeal once again most urgently to the parties to overcome their differences and co-operate in good faith in a search for a negotiated solution in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. HO. The situation in South-West and South-East Asia is another matter of profound concern for the whole international community. Indeed  at its thirty- fifth and thirty-sixth sessions the General Assembly adopted resolutions which in particular condemned the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan and demand the withdrawal of all foreign forces of occupation from those countries. Unfortunately  those resolutions have not been complied with. Difficulties persist with regard to the implementation of those resolutions and the hopes that their adoption had aroused seem to have been dashed by the hardening of the positions of the parties concerned.In Kampuchea the military conflict continues. The human  material and food situation of the Khmer people both within the country and on its frontiers has not improved.In Afghanistan the foreign intervention and occupation is continuing. That situation is fraught with danger to international peace and security.Only strict respect for the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  particularly General Assembly resolutions 34/22  35/6 and 36/5 on Kampuchea and resolutions 35/37 and 36/34 on Afghanistan can bring about peace in these areas. We therefore appeal urgently once again to the foreign occupation forces to evacuate these countries and leave their peoples to determine their own destinies in freedom.In the Korean peninsula there has been constant tension for 37 years now as a result of the division of the country by the victors in the Second World War. We believe that it is for the Korean people alone to settle the problem by peaceful means through dialogue between the North and the South  in a climate free from any external pressure or interference  in accordance with the principles of the Charter. In the interests of peace and detente  the United Nations should take new initiatives to create favorable conditions for the resumption of negotiations between the two Koreas.Faithful to its policy of non-alignment  Zaire has recognized the two Koreas and maintains with both excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. We believe that the admission to the United Nations of South Korea and North Korea  without prejudice to subsequent reunification  could  as in the case of the two Germanies  contribute to an easing of tension in that part of the world.With regard to the question of Cyprus  the resumption of intercommunal talks appears to us to be the best method of bringing about a just and lasting settlement of the crisis afflicting that country. We believe that the United Nations  through the Secretary- General  should continue its efforts to help the two communities to find a negotiated solution to their differences and create the necessary conditions for the restoration of peace.In the economic field  the international community is facing a serious crisis  a symptom of a profound breakdown in the structures of the present international economic and monetary order. Indeed the present international economic order is widening the gap between North and South and seems incapable of dealing with the problems facing both the developing countries and the developed countries themselves. There are tendencies towards protectionism and impediments of all kinds to international trade. Similarly  the machinery of co-operation is being distorted by prolonging relations of domination and exploitation. In this regard  the situation contains the seeds of a grave threat to international peace and security  particularly because the industrialized countries are continuing to refuse to make the structural changes called for by the vast majority of the States of the world.The various economic summit meetings of the countries of the North in which the countries of the South had placed so much hope have not lived up to their expectations; the multilateral trade negotiations continue to mark time  while the global negotiations remain deadlocked.In the realm of trade  the developed countries continue to be both judges and parties by unilaterally setting prices for primary commodities  to the detriment of the third world countries  for which the increasingly serious decline in the terms of trade  the high rate of inflation  unemployment and the increase in the burden of foreign debt lend dramatic dimensions to the crisis.The negotiations under way in UNCTAD  in the framework of the Integrated Programme for commodities  have made no progress. Of the 18 products on the Nairobi indicative list only coffee  cocoa  tin  natural rubber and sugar have been the subject of agreement. The Common Fund for Commodities which should in particular contribute to the financing of measures for commodity development so as to improve market structures and strengthen competitiveness and the long-term prospects for these products  has not yet been put into effect.We hope that the wealthy countries will demonstrate a greater measure of political will so that the sixth session of UNCTAD  which will be held in June 1983 in Belgrade  can produce better results than the fifth session.In the industrial field  the objectives pursued since the Second General Conference of UNIDO in Lima in 1975 are far from having been attained. We hope that everything possible will be done to ensure the success of the Fourth General Conference of UNIDO  which will be held in Kenya  and we appeal once again for a spirit of sincere co-operation on the part of the industrialized countries.The Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development  adopted in August 1979 s has so far not even begun to be implemented and no agreement has been reached on its financing. The same applies to an international code of conduct for the transfer of technology negotiated within the framework of UNCTAD. I should like to stress the role and the importance which the third world countries attribute to this question of the transfer of technology as a catalyst for development  whether it be within the framework of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade in the more general framework of the establishment of a new international economic order.It is appropriate here to make an urgent appeal to all Member States to embrace a new ethic of international solidarity  without which no progress is possible. At a time of interdependence  we believe it essential that international development aid  technical and financial assistance and all other forms of international co-operation be derived from this new ethic and be based upon the principles of complementarity and mutual advantage. Indeed to be effective the organizing of development aid and technical and financial assistance must take into account the mutual interests of the parties as well as the specific realities and the dignity of the recipients.If there is one thing on the credit side of the balance sheet for this year  it is undoubtedly the adoption on 30 April of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must  however  deplore the fact that it was adopted by a vote and not by consensus and that some States have not felt that they could undertake to sign it. This Convention represents a victory for reason and it is an important step towards bringing about the new international economic order.The results achieved after such difficult negotiations have certainly not satisfied all delegationsómy own includedóbut nevertheless they constitute a basis which will allow for some improvement in the course of the work of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.There remain a certain number of problems  particularly for the developing countries that are land producers of the same mineral resources as those found in the sea-bed and ocean floor  and the Republic of Zaire has already  from this very rostrum  drawn the attention of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to the harm that may be done to land producers  including ourselves  as a result of uncontrolled exploitation of the resources of the seabed and the ocean floor and any disruption of the structure of international markets which may follow.That is the international environment in which economic relations between States are evolving at present. All projection studies indicate that this international environment will continue to be marked by an increase in protectionism on the part of the industrialized countries  their adherence to an outmoded and anachronistic international economic order and the erosion of multilateral co-operation  leaving the way clear for politically and ideologically inspired bilateralism.In the view of my delegation  the time has come for the international community to take specific measures to ensure the launching of global negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations  which is the only appropriate framework for a global  coherent and integrated approach  in conformity with General Assembly resolution 34/138 and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.In parallel with these actions  the developing countries should continue and strengthen their efforts to promote fruitful and mutually advantageous cooperation. We cannot repeat too often that that should be considered a fundamental requirement for the establishment of the new international economic order. It must make it possible for us to constitute a force  not against the North  but to strengthen our own position as equal and full partners in international economic relations.It is in this context that we call upon the international community to support the Caracas Programme of Action^ and the Lagos Plan of Action  the purpose of which is to put into effect a strategy of collective autonomy.Another question which continues to concern the international community is that of hunger in the world. My delegation believes that to build a world system of effective food security  rather than confine ourselves to emergency assistance  the international community should over the long term focus its efforts on increasing agricultural production.I turn now to the questions of the draft World Charter for Nature  which is before us for adoption at this session  and Zaire's particular problems in transport  transit and access to international markets.It will be recalled that in its resolution 35/7 on the draft World Charter for Nature  the General Assembly invited Member States to conduct their activities in recognition of the supreme importance of protecting natural systems  maintaining the balance and quality of nature  in the interests of present and future generations. Last year  at the thirty-sixth session  the Secretary-General presented to the General Assembly the revised draft World Charter  which took account of all the observations made by the vast majority of Member States. Following the adoption of the Nairobi Declaration  which recognized the fragility of the environment  I should like to express the sincere hope that the final version of the draft World Charter will be adopted by consensus.With regard to Zaire's problems in the matter of transport  transit and access to international markets  I remind the Assembly that because of its geographical situation Zaire was placed in the category of semi-land-locked countries by UNCTAD resolution 110 (V)  adopted at Manila in 1979."" That resolution called for studies to be carried out with a view to helping countries in that category overcome their difficulties. Following that  the General Assembly adopted resolutions 34/193  35/59 and 36/139 in 1979  1980 and 1981  and the Economic and Social Council adopted its resolution 1981/68 in July 1981. The Republic of Zaire hopes that at the current session the Assembly will consider concrete measures to accelerate the implementation of those resolutions  on the basis of the Secretary-General's report.That is the substance of what Zaire wishes to say at this session  which  as I have already said  is being held at a particularly difficult time in the evolution of international relations. At the political level  the arms race and the many areas of tension in the world threaten international peace and security. In the field of economics  the developed countries  the beneficiaries of an anachronistic international economic cadre  continue to resist the legitimate claims of two thirds of mankind  while recession  inflation  rising unemployment  the constant deterioration in the terms of trade  imbalances in the balance of payments and external debts are exacerbating the economic difficulties of the third world.In spite of these negative findings and the gloomy prospects  the Republic of Zaire reaffirms its unshakable faith in the ideals of the United Nations and proclaims its devotion to the principles and purposes of the Charter  for  as President Mobutu Sese Seko said from this very rostrum at the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly  on 4 October 1973:""... thanks to the UN and through it  we shall be able to do more to promote co-operation among the inhabitants of our planet in the economic  cultural  scientific and technical fields  for the building of a better  fairer and more just world  in absolute respect for the authenticity of everyone."""
"30",1470,"COG",37,1982,"118.	  Taking part in the general debate as it comes to an end may be a disadvantage  in that one may say things that have already been said and therefore be boring. However  what is important is not to try to be novel but  rather  to reaffirm our belief in principles that we hold dear and to state precisely our position with regard to the state of the world.119.	The annual session of the General Assembly is a high point in the lives of people throughout the world. It concerns everyone  through their delegations  not simply the illusion but the reality of taking part in the management of the world  through dialog  conciliation and the sharing of the ideals of peace  justice  freedom and progress.120.	It is in that spirit that the People's Republic of the Cong< peaks today  thus contributing to the ennobling and lofty work whose purposes and principles are clearly set out in the Charter.121.	Before going any further  I should like to say how glad my country is that Mr. Hollai is presiding over the current session. His unanimous choice by the General Assembly was not only a well-deserved tribute to his country  the Hungarian People's Republic  a friend of the people's Republic of the Congo  but also proper appreciation of his qualities and merits  which are in keeping with his responsibilities in his own country and our happy memories of him when he so worthily represented Hungary at the United Nations. It is a pleasure for me to extend to him the sincere congratulations of the Congolese delegation. We also express our appreciation to Mr. Kittani  our friend and the President's predecessor  for the brilliant way in which he discharged his duties as President of the thirty-sixth session and the second special session devoted to disarmament. I also have particular pleasure in repeating my country's warmest congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who has been Secretary-General for almost a year now  and who has devoted himself to his work with the conviction and dedication that we know him to possess.122.	The human race is living through one of the most turbulent eras of its existence. We have all said this  and we are constantly concerned about it. We must see that matters do not get out of hand. We must stop the dangerous trend of the world's progressing in accordance with a logic that would crush the human race by plunging it into chaos  blindness  confrontation and war.123.	Our international conscience must eliminate the use of force and must condemn those who wish to take advantage of their strength to trample on the law. Arbitrary action cannot be the basis of the law in this world unless the human race abandons its desire for progress and admits that it is retrogressing.124.	When the Zionist State of Israel sweeps through a whole country to invade  attack and destroy a sovereign State and massacre its population; when racist South Africa elevates apartheid into a government doctrine  pillages neighboring independent States  oppresses and slaughters black people blithely and with impunity  then we feel we have been thrown back into the dark night of barbarism and savagery  totally divorced from our own age and from a conscience that only yesterday  with astonishing strength  fought the war against Nazism and other attacks on mankind.125.	At a time when many attempts are being made to challenge the liberation and self-determination movements of the peoples  it is clear that the deprived world  the poor world  the world that is struggling for survival and freedom  needs more than ever before a more effective  more dynamic and stronger Organization. In Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America there is a trend now to challenge independence won at such cost and to deny freedom. The retrograde imperialist forces are competing with one another  with utter contempt for international law and morality  to see who can best strengthen the last bastions of colonialism and racism  employing every method available to them to ensure their control of those regions and their natural resources.126.	In Africa  the exploitation and enslavement imposed from outside the continent is a matter of increasing concern to us.127.	Our first thought is of the gallant people of southern Africa who have been thus ravished; their sufferings are our sufferings; the Congolese people feel deeply all the frustrations and horrors imposed on them so unjustly.128.	The odious regime of apartheid continues to push horror and barbarism beyond imaginable limits. No morality or law can stop it; in the name of a doctrine that dares not say what it really is  in the name of we know not what law  the racists of Pretoria are committing acts of aggression and invading the front-line States because they believe they can do so with impunity.129.	The United Nations has condemned the complicity of the industrialized countries  without which Mr. Botha and his assistants would be powerless.130.	Will mankind continue much longer to let itself be duped? Can we allow such a situation to continue? The international community surely has a duty to consider urgent measures to impose and apply the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination. The Congo believes that the peoples of southern Africa will inevitably triumph over oppression and enslavement  for the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination is an achievement of the human race  and this achievement remains irreversible. It is the sacred duty of the peoples of southern Africa to sacrifice everything  even their lives  to ensure the exercise of their right to freedom and independence. The international community must demonstrate full and effective solidarity with these peoples in their struggle.131.	The fact that we are hoping for independence for Namibia in 1983 should not permit us to forget to place the Namibian problem in its proper context. The future of that country is a matter for the Namibian people and SWAPO  its sole and authentic representative. That has been sufficiently demonstrated by the heroic struggle waged so valiantly for so many years and by the great sacrifices made. The procrastinations of the countries in the contact group  the various deals delaying this long awaited outcome  are pure and simple violations of the right of peoples to self-determination. The terms of resolution 435 (1978) must be respected; there can be no bargaining away or amendment of its terms. The United Nations  as the international organization which has set itself among other objectives that of ensuring the inalienable rights of the peoples  must not tolerate such violations.132.	The situation in northwest Africa  specifically in Western Sahara  must be viewed in the light of that same principle of self-determination. The question of Western Sahara is one of decolonization  and it must be seen as such; any distortion  any policy of annexation or of military occupation amounts to the crushing  the mutilation  the destruction of a people. I am glad(hat the United Nations has avoided any such injustice by its recognition many years ago of the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination. My country is pleased that it is one of the 60 or so States that have recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  thus recognizing its sovereignty in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore any discussion of this problem  any reference to some past happening is merely an attempt to camouflage other designs that the Organization could not countenance. The question of Western Sahara is clear  and there is no room for ambiguity. The occupying forces that are waging this destructive war against a peaceful people should listen to the voice of the heart and the mind instead of continuing with this dangerous and reprehensible adventurism.133.	My country endorses the call for the reconstruction of Chad  a friendly sister country  tom by civil war. But that reconstruction requires the reconciliation of the people of the country  without distinction of race  religion or political view. It also means that there must be no foreign intervention.134.	I cannot refer to the tragedy in Lebanon  and the massacre in Beirut  without feelings of deep emotion. Each one of us can visualize those savagely mutilated bodies piled up under the rubble of recently bombed buildings. It is horror institutionalized; the extreme of barbarism; terrible scenes  anathema to the modem age  but revealing in more ways than one the true nature of that regime that has been condemned and  because of its repeated evil deeds  has now been outlawed by the civilized nations of the world. Not content to pillage by annexation and occupation  the Israeli Zionists are diabolically pursuing the peaceful Palestinian people even into exile. For Israel it was a question of weakening at whatever cost the PLO and its leadership in order to master the situation and impose its will in the Middle East.135.	The Congo pays a tribute to all the members of the Security Council for having spoken in frank and unmistakable terms  in the language of truth  without exception condemning Israel for its crimes in Lebanon. It is highly desirable that that condemnation lead to positive action  that is  the recognition of the Palestinian people and their national rights  in particular the right to return to their homeland.136.	My country's position on the Palestinian issue is well known. The recent events in Lebanon are one stage in a vast plot against the Palestinian people  and they prove once again that our analysis of the situation is the correct one. Peace in the Middle East requires a just settlement of the Palestinian problem. No solution that does not involve the Palestinian people and its sole authentic representative  the PLO  can be effective or lasting. We reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to national existence and the restoration of its inalienable and inviolable rights. Neither weapons nor mass destruction can ever force the Palestinian people to abandon their sacred right  their dignity as a people.137.	I should like to say once again to those gallant people of Latin America  who are struggling for the free exercise of their right to self-determination  that the people of the Congo support them. 138.	I should also like to reaffirm the brotherly solidarity of my country with the peoples of Kampuchea and Viet Nam in their tireless efforts  under their respective Governments  to achieve national reconstruction after so many years of war and destruction.139.	The Democratic People's Republic of Korea  in its legitimate struggle for the peaceful reunification of its great homeland of Korea  also merits our respect and esteem.140.	I have so far been dealing with matters of decolonization  the free exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination  because my country believes that full and final decolonization is a prerequisite for the promotion of peace and relationships favorable to development and co-operation.141.	The profound crisis in the world economy and the inability of the world to apply the necessary remedies give rise in our various States to reactions of self-preservation and protectionism as a result of which the gap between North and South is widening.142.	We are going through a difficult time; everywhere our economies are finding it impossible to keep pace with events. All the reports submitted  whatever economic body they come from  including the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  emphasize the danger into which the world is rushing.143.	Such a danger should make us stand by and support each other  but how many hopes have been dimmed by the ambitions of some and the egoism of others? The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in 1981  aroused more hope  as did the meeting at Cancun  which offered some possibility of a resumption of the indispensable North-South dialog. But unfortunately this is the hour of disenchantment. Global negotiations within the United Nations on the definition of the new rules that should govern international economic relations have reached a serious impasse.144.	The industrialized countries seem to be dealing with the crisis by means of a few palliatives  but the third world countries are weaker and they are increasingly exposed. They are bearing the burden of the economic in-adaptability and anachronisms in a way that is not really justified. The constant reduction in aid  the increase in the food deficit  the limits on access to technology  the deterioration in the terms of trade  and an accumulation of similar handicaps  constitute but one aspect of the ills that afflict us.145.	All these factors urge us to move toward a worldwide dialog  because we believe in the interdependence of the countries of the world. But we seem to be bogged down in the negotiations for the establishment of a new framework for international economic relations. This should make us think about our current practice and devise more flexible and effective formulas. The establishment of regional subgroups such as those recommended for Africa in the Lagos Plan of Action and the search for ways of redefining all our regional economic policies could  we feel  constitute a first approach. However  such aprogram can be carried out only in an international context of peace and security.146.	The Congolese people are peaceful people. We jealously defend our freedom and concentrate on the tasks of development. Our people believe that everything possible must be done to ensure better understanding between peoples and individuals. The unbridled use of force can never be accepted  nor can threats or intimidation become the rules of international life  or selfishness  hatred or prejudice dominate relations between nations  for that would spell our doom.147.	Against the background of the tension and international confrontation prevailing in the world today  the morality and the ethic of nations must be something other than simple complacency or acceptance  indifference to the violations of international law  attacks on the freedom of individuals and peoples  the destruction of innocent lives civilizations and the heritage of man. Rather  more than ever before  we must show extreme vigilance  constant mobilization  solidarity that knows no frontier and clear-sightedness.148.	International peace and security  of course  depend on many factors. These include  in particular  specific measures which will lead to real disarmament. I made this point in my statement last June at the twelfth special session [9th meeting]  the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is unfortunate that that session did not live up to our hopes and enable us to take important steps forward.149.	But the debates did convince us of the need to continue our discussions with the vision of establishing among all members of the international community relations based on trust  mutual respect and the recognition by all Member States of the right of each people to choose its national institutions in freedom  to independence  to security and to peace.150.	We have faith in the future  faith in man and his creative ability  his intelligence and his wisdom. But our faith cannot be a blind faith; it must be supported by constant efforts made by everybody to prevent a catastrophe.151.	We believe that it is possible to avoid a third world war by signing strategic arms limitation agreements and establishing conventions and agreements that would link the nations of the world together through non-aggression pacts.152.	We also believe that it is possible to find some area of agreement among nations to overcome the economic crisis  working for a new international economic order by replacing the present rules of competition by co-operation and co-development.153.	Lastly  we believe it is possible to reduce distrust among nations and political systems and to prevent confrontations becoming inevitable by working towards peaceful coexistence.54. The work of peace  detente and co-operation among nations is a great humanitarian effort  and individuals  nations and peoples that contribute to this deserve our admiration. International bodies such as the United Nations which devote all their energies to this deserve our full support. We should like topay a tribute once again to Mr. Hollai for his contribution to the work of this session.Organization of work."
"31",1517,"COL",37,1982,"I should like first to congratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to the important post of President and at the same time to express the hope that  under his able leadership  this session of the General Assembly will achieve positive results. I should also like to express to his eminent predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our gratitude for the effectiveness with which he presided over the thirty-sixth session. I wish to assure the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  a seasoned diplomat of whom Latin America is proud  of our support in any action that he takes in the interest of the international community. I take this opportunity to commend the sincerity  the vigour and the vision shown in his report to the General Assembly on the role of the Organization in these times of crisis.On behalf of our President  Belisario Betancur  and the people of Colombia  I should like to greet the representatives of States Members of the United Nations and to express our confidence that at this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly we shall be able to work effectively in the search for solutions to the disputes that disturb the peace and threaten the security of our peoples.I represent a country with a population of 30 million-the fourth largest in population in the western hemisphere-situated at the heart of the Americas and sharing land and sea boundaries with 13 Latin American and Caribbean nations. Our unique geographical position ties us irrevocably to the fate of a large part of the continent and obliges us to work in an open and constructive spirit.Colombia is also a country of laws and an unsullied democratic tradition  where political differences are resolved through elections and authority emanates from the popular will. Our newly elected Government has devoted its efforts to the country's economic and social recovery and to a major peace initiative which will surely enable those groups which had resorted to armed rebellion to be reincorporated into civilian life. I have been so bold as to mention these positive attributes of my country  but I shall not dwell further on a point which hold little interest for the news agencies  whose preferred subject-matter is scandals and disasters.My country believes in the possibility and the desirability of peaceful solutions. It defends the application of the principles and norms of international law in the settlement of disputes and advocates nonintervention  self-determination and strict observance of treaties. It none the less believes that justice complements law and it is therefore prepared to consider with an open mind all those intrinsically just causes that  for this very reason  warrant the attention of the international community.The United Nations  created under the noblest of auspices to save the world from the scourge of war  to promote more equitable conditions and standards of living for the peoples and to ensure a stable economic order and harmonious development  has all too often been prevented from fulfilling its noble mission. In the view of many it has even become ineffectual. To a large extent this view is correct: purely political controversy has invaded all United Nations forums. Agencies designed to promote social progress  economic recovery and technological progress have become arenas of bitter polemics. The spirit of co-operation is gradually disappearing; selfish interests predominate and the policy of blocs is expanding. Against the backdrop of this kind of Tower of Babel  the imminent danger of universal cataclysm emerges as the only reality.It is not surprising that  in this atmosphere  the arms race should have intensified. What until recently was a phenomenon exclusive to the great Powers has spread like a malignant growth to moderately developed States and even to poor countries. Often it is the industrialized nations themselves that encourage this trade in death.Military and economic might create conditions of dependence. The world's backward countries must sacrifice their dignity to necessity and their conceptual independence in the face of threats. The will to survive leads to a servile pragmatism which destroys ideals and fosters resentment. This concentration of the factors of power explains the formation of the major blocs and the humiliating situation of those nations that have been forced to submit to one or another sphere of influence.It would be unfair to overlook the ideological motivation surrounding some of the decisions of the great Powers. This ideological confrontation is becoming increasingly rare  however. Above all  what we have is a power struggle which threatens to engulf the entire world community. As long as the system of major blocs persists  peace will be impossible.Colombia is profoundly concerned about this state of affairs. In the past year  far from decreasing  the causes for concern have actually increased. The number of situations which disrupt world peace is growing  the economic crisis's becoming increasingly complex and the imbalance among nations is becoming increasingly marked Colombia is concerned by the constant violations of the principles and norms of international law. We cannot countenance the illegal occupation and annexation of territories by force or other forms of intervention that perpetuate a state of permanent anxiety.Like most countries  Colombia has condemned Israel's military action in Lebanon. It advocates withdrawal from the Arab territories now under military occupation and recognizes the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State.Colombia believes that the various formulas now under consideration with regard to the Palestinian problem must be reconciled as soon as possible. New negotiating machinery which is binding on the parties to the conflict and on the third countries involved is probably needed. We believe that this vital step does not conflict with recognition of the State of Israel and the latter's right to live in peace within its own borders.We note with interest and satisfaction all efforts  such as those undertaken by the Korean people  tending to re-establish national unity.We have voiced our opposition to the possible exclusion of any Member State from the various organs of the United Nations. Despite all the risks  we believe that the principle of universality  which is fundamental to the survival and historical impact of the Organization  must be maintained.Unfortunately  the latest acts of aggression and violence in the Middle East are not the only ones suffered and repudiated by the international community. We have also condemned the military occupation of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the persecution of the trade union movement in Poland. In all these cases clear-cut norms of international law have been violated  resulting in the irreparable loss of human life and considerable material damage.We are deeply concerned at the situation in Central America and at the risk that this region so near to us geographically and so dear to our hearts might become a new arena of international confrontation. The nations of Central America are struggling  each in its own way  to strengthen democracy and promote social change. In that process  which should occur peacefully as a result of self-determination  there has in recent times been resort to the perilous course of ideological extremism  arms buildup and foreign interference.We cannot stand by and let the countries of Central America become a prey to international ambitions and their weak political and economic structures be suddenly threatened by violence and civil war. It is essential to restore peace and  by means of a constructive dialogue  to create the conditions for' peaceful coexistence and development. In achieving these objectives  it would be most useful to eliminate the pernicious influence of the military apparatus that in one way or another has become involved in Central American politics.At the beginning of October  Colombia participated in a meeting of Foreign Ministers organized by the Government of Costa Rica with the aim of finding common ground and discussing specific actions which would permit a return to normalcy. As a result of that important meeting  it was agreed to create a body which would work for peace and democracy: a peace based on mutual respect and a democracy which would guarantee free political expression in each country. At Colombia's request  the Foreign Ministers meeting in San Jose proposed the removal of all military and security advisers from the area  in particular from El Salvador  Honduras and Nicaragua.We hope that the goodwill mission entrusted to the Foreign Minister of Costa Rica will help to broaden the regional dialogue and will be well received in those countries which for various reasons did not participate in the first round of talks. My country will co-operate fully in achieving the objectives set.Colombia does not advocate and has never advocated the use of force to resolve conflicts. It therefore deplores the fact that  in the case of the Malvinas Islands  the protracted absence of a peaceful solution and the persistence of colonialist practices let to the de facto situations and that all efforts at conciliation to avoid an armed conflict failed.We are now faced with the consequences: the loss of 3 000 human lives and damage estimated at over $1 billion. But this tragic outcome is not the only cause for concern. The truth is that as a result of the armed conflict the possibility of a stable solution for the islands now appears more remote than ever.The United Kingdom  having gained a military victory  refuses to discuss the question of sovereignty over the islands. Although explicable in the light of recent events  this position will prove untenable in the long run. The anti-colonialist determination of the vast majority of countries  Colombia among them  will finally prevail.In order to obviate the risk of further conflict and avoid a prolongation of the harmful consequences of this confrontation  Colombia proposes that the Malvinas should immediately be made neutral and their administration entrusted to a multinational authority until a way is found of reconciling Argentina's rights with the legitimate interests of the islands' inhabitants.The conduct of the United States in this unfortunate incident warrants special comment. That country's decision to abandon its initial neutral position and to afford economic  political and military support to the United Kingdom aroused justified indignation in Latin America. That episode has given rise to the feeling throughout the continent that the United States cares little of the fate of its neighbours. The United States attitude none the less had the salutary effect of uniting the peoples of Latin America for the first time in their entire history. We must seize this opportunity to create effective machinery which will make possible a joint response in moments of crisis.The impact of this conflict on the continent's political future cannot be ignored. Europeans and North Americans will in the short term be able to correct many of the decisions taken during the war  but it will take a long time for the wounds to heal. Clearly  Latin America is not a priority on the great Powers' list. At the centre of the armed confrontation in the South Atlantic the question of colonialism appears as a last remnant of a world which has faded into history but the vestiges of which will continue to cause constant irritation and potential conflicts for years* to come. Practical problems arise in this decolonization process  including that of how to ensure that newly independent territorial entities  many of them small  avoid the dependence forced on them by their limited economic resources. Faced with the danger of new forms of domination  these young nations will have to seek  with the support of the international community  systems of association that enable them to defend their own independence successfully.In analysing the factors which contribute to disturbances of the peace we are also concerned at the discouraging results of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We see the problem as one not only of nuclear weapons butalso of conventional weapons. It is not enough for the great Powers to declare their willingness to refrain from the use of nuclear weapons. A decision must also be taken drastically to reduce conventional weapons and to agree to absolutely trustworthy verification procedures.In Colombia's view peace is not and cannot be a precarious balance between heavily armed nations but rather the result of a just international order. Pope Paul VI made this abundantly clear when he stated in his encyclical Populorium Progressio many years ago that development was the new name for peace. The Pontiffs historic maxim becomes dramatically relevant in a world where opportunities are dangerously concentrated in the hands of a few and three quarters of mankind continues to be excluded from a development which would make justice feasible and freedom attainable.It was this time bomb which prompted the international community a decade ago to seek a new international economic order which would make it possible to correct imbalances and bridge the gap between rich and poor. Without wishing to belittle the initial efforts that were made  we must agree that the situation is not encouraging and the prospects of establishing such an order are increasingly remote  above all in the midst of one of the worst economic crises to face the international community in three generations.This crisis  which is probably both the cause and the effect of the chaotic situation in which mankind is living  is the result of numerous factors  including theoretical dependence on rigid models which for a long time now have failed to take into account the whole purpose of economic management for the advancement of man and have become worn-out concepts which  at the political level  point the way to failure.The peripheral countries that traditionally revolve around these systems are often used as testing grounds. The all-out free enterprise of the so-called Chicago school on the one hand and the rigid self- management and planning  with total State intervention  advocated by the current Marxist school  on the other  are the most recent examples of how blind adherence to economic theories whose origins are purely political is doomed to failure.Another no less important  cause of this far- reaching crisis is the rapidly growing indebtedness of the developing countries and of those countries with a so-called centrally planned economy. Between them  these countries are fast approaching a foreign debt amounting to the extraordinary sum of $800 billion. Two circumstances aggravate this phenomenon: on the one hand  the growing involvement of private lenders-calculated at 50 per cent-to the detriment of financing through international development agencies which are finding it increasingly difficult to open the coffers of their rich members; on the other hand  the all too frequent use of foreign loans for sectors other than infrastructure or social welfare.In practice  those resources have become volatile material and there are difficulties in repaying loans because production has not increased in proportion to indebtedness. There are  of course  exceptions but in the end only those countries that have exchanged foreign currency for progress will be successful and it will be difficult to find a remedy for those which exchanged loans for prestige or used them for ill-planned investments to find a way out of their difficulties.The external debt problem has reached such insane proportions that what formerly generated dependence today engenders mutual fear between debtors and creditors. The entire financial problem must be approached in new terms before this fear degenerates into political confrontation.Colombia is not subject at present to the pressures of a disproportionate foreign debt. Its foreign debt amounts to over $7 billion  but to a large extent this figure represents development loans whose short- term impact is manageable. The annual debt service takes up barely 15 per cent of our foreign trade earnings. International reserves stand at over $5 billion. We are not therefore  pleading our own cause but rather speaking  out of an elementary sense of solidarity  as advocates of those countries which need rapid and effective support. To this end we support the preparation and implementation of a short- term emergency plan as a first step in the process of global negotiations.The economic crisis also has its mots in the policies of the industrialized countries. The restriction of demand in order to control inflation has caused a drop in the growth of price indices and more recently in that of interest rates  but at the high social cost of slowing down growth and increasing unemployment.This affects international trade  which is the basis for the growth of most of the developing economies  and thus exports unemployment  the social and political consequences of which are felt far more acutely in the third world than in the industrialized world. Protectionism has taken hold of the major markets  with obvious consequences for trade but also with the distressing result that the developing countries  seeing the deterioration in their trade balances and balances of payments  try to save themselves and are in turn accused of protectionism  of violating free trade agreements or simply of being trade terrorists who  by stimulating exports  attack the world economy.Another aspect that we must mention here is the deterioration of the situation with regard to commodities. Producer countries were used to products enjoying good seasons bad seasons  and one usually cancelled out the other. Now there are only bad periods because of the recession affecting the main purchasers  and especially because of the irresponsible  selfish and disastrous policies of groups of developed countries which  as in the case of sugar  have brought prices down to absolutely ludicrous levels.The countries that uphold this sugar policy of subsidies  increased production and the imposition of quotas cannot expect us to be grateful  to cooperate and to let them participate in our development plans. In my country the sugar sector generates considerable employment and foreign currency  and it would be inconsistent of us not to respond forcefully to seeing our international earnings reduced as a result of unilateral policies.Almost all the Powers could be accused of this kind of policy with regard to other commodities. The sale of strategic reserves  the stockpiling of others by mining multinationals  the unilateral fixing of quotas for access to markets and the use of foodstuffs as a political weapon are only some of the many aberrations against which the international community as a whole will have to fight.We should  however  also mention  within this bleak commodity situation  the success just achieved in London in connection with the International Coffee Agreement  of which my country has always been and will continue to be an ardent supporter. This agreement to protect the market reached between producers and consumers in the same forum is an example which I should like to mention here and which would not have been possible without solidarity between the two interest groups.This already long list also includes the affront constituted by military spending. According to United Nations calculations  at 1978 prices the world spends $1.2 billion a day on armaments  $900 million of which represents the combined military budgets of the United States  the Soviet Union  China  France and the United Kingdom. This daily arms expenditure is equal to the sum total of the annual budgets of UNDP  the World Food Programme  UNICEF  UNRWA and UNFPA.And  one further comment  compared with the over $380 billion spent each year on military budgets  the $21 billion in direct aid  the $80 million from the World Bank  the $24 million from the Inter-American Development Bank and the $67 million from the International Monetary Fund seem paltry amounts. The $825 million of United States financial assistance to the Caribbean and the Soviet Union's $1 856 million to Cuba  North Korea and Viet Nam are even more insignificant. These figures speak for themselves.The subject of the North-South dialogue is perhaps one of the few on which we all agree: we have failed miserably. Since 1973  the year of the oil embargo and the floating of the principal currencies  the United Nations as an institution  its Members and the decade's most eminent personalities have reiterated the need to restructure fundamentally the economic relationship between those that are the most prosperous and those that are still the poorest. Then came the General Assembly resolutions on the new international economic order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. The latter could figure in the book of world records as the instrument most frequently violated.The same happened with the 1974 Paris Conference  which throughout its three long years brought nothing new to the solution of world problems; with the various meetings of UNCTAD; the ministerial meeting of GATT; the Conference of Science and Technology for Development; the Tokyo Round; the annual rite of the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and FAO; the proposal of the non-aligned countries on global negotiations; the Brandt report; the Cancun summit and the New Delhi and Oslo meetings.These comings and goings of officials  diplomats  economists and politicians have achieved little. Generosity has run out; these are difficult times; such are the phrases we read in foreign ministry reports. We of the South say that the North lacks the necessary political will; those of the North say that we of the South do not know what we want. There is nothing new; every possibility  including hope  has vanished.The argument that we must wait for the world economy to return to normal and regain its health is not convincing enough for us to postpone indefinitely the initiatives with regard to the North-South dialogue and the global negotiations. The illness has to be treated; the solution is in the hands of those present here-developed or underdeveloped  with or without a colonial past. It is a question of political will and of clearly identifying our goals and procedures.There is light in all this darkness: co-operation among developing countries. This South-South relationship is one of the few multilateral successes of recent years and must therefore maintain its momentum and continue its identification of areas in which co-operation is possible and fruitful.It is true that the developing countries enjoy only 28 per cent of the wealth of our planet  but it is no less true that they represent 80 per cent of the world's population. This tremendous sociological reality will make itself felt in the end and the developed countries realize this. Unfortunately  they neither act nor allow others to act. Years ago there was a proposal  which was never put into practice  that the rich countries should earmark a minimum percentage of their gross national product for programmes of international co-operation. The proposal never got off the ground.The only alternative is to strengthen the South- South relationship. It is a question of seeking and offering support  encouraging exchanges  pooling experiences and developing new technologies. These are some of the goals. Although Colombia is not an economic Power  much less a military one  it understands and accepts its obligation to contribute to those goals and has tried to do so in its own area.One result of my country's decision is the Andean Pact or Cartagena Agreement  an interesting experiment in sub-regional integration that has managed to survive for over 10 years. Another example is the plan for economic  trade and financial cooperation which Colombia is promoting with the countries of Central America and the Caribbean. These are specific examples which prove that a stable and fruitful relationship is possible among developing countries.If it is not possible  as we have seen  to institutionalize the North-South dialogue and render it operational  then let the General Assembly at least offer effective backing to the agencies that promote South-South co-operation.In the midst of so many disappointments  there is another very important and positive element in the work of the United Nations which shows that it is possible to find universally acceptable solutions to problems affecting the international community when the spirit of consensus prevails and multilateral negotiating machinery is properly used. I am referring to the adoption on 30 April last of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the culmination of nine years of difficult negotiations and six years of careful preparation.The new regime for the sea recognizes and develops for the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction a principle already formulated 150 years ago by the great Latin American legal expert Andres Bello  according to which there are assets which can remain common property for the benefit of all and belong to the indivisible heritage of mankind and cannot be marked with the seal of ownership. With regard to maritime spaces under State jurisdiction  the Convention represents not only a complete legal framework  but also an instrument for the economic and social development of our peoples.Colombia was one of the 130 countries to vote in favour of the Convention and hopes that at this session the General Assembly will provide the Secretary-General with the necessary means to take on the responsibilities assigned to him.The Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  which was held at Vienna in August  enabled the United Nations to review the conquest of space  and the developing countries to call the attention of the technological Powers to the need for more effective and systematic international co-operation. For Colombia  an equatorial country  it was significant that several of the recommendations of the Conference stressed the urgent need to plan and regulate the use of the geostationary orbit  a limited natural resource which can be over-exploited by its appropriation by the technological monopolies. Since 1975  my country and nine other equatorial States have been demanding a special regime for the geostationary orbit. In Vienna  all the developing countries  within the framework of the Group of 77  turned our demands into a dire necessity. We reiterate to the Assembly today that technological development must be regulated by international law and that consequently the free consent of countries below the orbital arc must be a prerequisite of any such regulation. We really believe that the prior consent of receiving and monitored countries must be obtained before direct television broadcasting by satellite or remote-sensing activities are carried out.I could go on at length on many other topics of concern to my country  but I see no practical usefulness in doing so. Each country must act within the limits of its possibilities and in relation to the questions which concern it directly. I should like  however  to share a number of closing observations with the members of the Assembly. These refer to the search for a lasting peace which would guarantee the survival of our species. If we are to achieve such a peace  we must replace confrontation by balance. This balance does not arise from the strategic parity of the super-Powers  however  but is born of the tactical unity of medium-sized and small nations in seeking to dismantle the whole threatening apparatus of war.It has been proved time and again that the United States and the Soviet Union are not in a position to offer mankind the good news of effective disarmament and that they will probably pursue their intensive political  economic and military rivalry. Colombia has thought carefully about these and other facts in relation to its own international position. For years  influenced by our dedication to a set of principles and consistent with a tradition  we have on occasion been regarded as a dependent country. We believe that the time has come to clarify our position. Not so that we might disown an honourable past  much less abjure principles that are deeply rooted in our people  but simply so that we might better serve the cause of mankind. We believe that the prospects for peace will be improved if countries able to do so adopt more independent positions. This is also valid in view of the aspirations to establish a new  more just and equitable economic order.These are the main reasons for Colombia's decision to apply for admission to the non-aligned movement. We are well aware that this movement was  at the outset  made up principally of countries from other continents. We believe that the time has come for the countries of Latin America also to join in a process which  if well directed  can make a decisive contribution to the cause of peace. Some have already done so and others  like Colombia  hope to do so in the near future."
"32",1558,"COM",37,1982,"  Before beginning my statement  I should like to express on behalf of my delegation our most sincere congratulations to Mr. Hollai on the occasion of his well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His qualities as a skilled diplomat  together with his long experience in the Organization  as well as the high posts that he has held in his country  all constitute a guarantee that our work will progress well and our debates serenely  at a time when the Organization is called upon to deal with an endlessly growing number of complex problems of international scope. We there¬fore wish him every success in the exercise of his difficult responsibilities.176.	Please allow me also to pay a heartfelt tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the competence and dedication with which he exercised the presidency of the last session. We also express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in the service of world peace since he was elected almost a year ago.177.	As we meet once again in the Assembly to assess  as is traditional  the work done by the United Nations since our last regular session and to review the international situation  we must observe that  in spite of our legitimate aspirations for a better world  the balance sheet is once again negative. How else could we describe it when a large number of coun¬tries  especially the weakest among them  live in the daily anguish of inexorably mounting dangers?178.	In fact  the noble and sacred principles inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations are trampled underfoot and sometimes willfully violated. Inter¬national relations  both political and economic  are deteriorating at a rapid pace and are taking an increasingly disquieting turn. Here and there  might prevails over right and the fait accompli replaces dialogue and agreement.179.	That being the situation  we believe that efforts must be made more than ever before in order to seek ways and means of overcoming the problems and in order to safeguard the future of mankind. Hence the primary and decisive role that the Organization must play in this troubled world. It is therefore time that the purpose for which it was created  that is  the safeguarding and maintenance of peace be at last respected. The time has come to restore its credibility  as millions of people place their hopes in it. For many of them it is sometimes their only resort.180.	The many dangers that I have just mentioned find tragic illustration in the grave events that occurred in Lebanon a few days ago. An appalled and angry world learned through the television screen of the abominable crime  the gratuitous massacre of hundreds of children  women and elderly persons in the Palesti¬nian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut. That odious crime is horrible beyond all imagination and recalls a bloody page in the recent history of the world which we believed to be a thing of the past. It is all the more unpardonable and unjustifiable as it was committed against innocent  defenseless victims.181.	In my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  the massacres of Sabra and Shatila were felt with great sorrow by the entire population. A day of national mourning and of prayer in memory of the martyrs unjustly assassinated was decreed by the President of the Republic  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane who  at the same time  forcefully con¬demned those who perpetrated and facilitated that dastardly deed.182.	On many occasions in the Assembly my country has expressed its views on the problem of the Middle East. There can be no doubt  as we see it  that it is Israel's intransigence  together with its annexationist and expansionist designs  which make it impossible to find a lasting solution to this problem  nor can there be any doubt that it is the vast financial and military means made available to Israel that make it possible for the Zionist entity to continue arrogantly to defy the many decisions and resolutions adopted by the Organization.183.	Mankind cannot remain indifferent to the genocide in west Beirut; otherwise it will lose its very dignity. The guilty and their accomplices must be found and punished. In our view one thing is clear  and that is the direct responsibility of Israel in this mass assassination. It is time for the international community at last to react firmly in the face of the policy of extermination of the Israeli Government. That Government must withdraw its troops  not only from Beirut  but from all of Lebanon and comply with the relevant resolutions of the Organization  especially those of the Security Council.184.	We welcome the results of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  devoted to the problems of the Middle East. We feel that the decisions that were adopted during that Conference constitute clear progress in the search for a just and lasting solution to the problem that is tearing that region apart. We strongly condemn Israel's attitude  aimed at systematically rejecting the peace plan.185.	It was more than a generation ago now that the Palestinian people was driven out of its country  forced into exile  robbed of its lands and compelled to wander from one refugee camp to another. Israel can no longer continue to ignore the Palestinian fact  the right of that people to self-determination  and to establish a free and independent State on its own land.186.	I should like here to express our admiration and respect for the head of the PLO  Mr. Yasser Arafat  for his exemplary courage and  indeed  the heroism that he demonstrated during the siege of west Beirut by Israeli forces. I also take this oppor¬tunity to reaffirm once again the unassailable and constant support of the Comorian people and its Government for the just struggle of the Palestinian people and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO.187.	It is on the basis of that same sacred principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and free¬dom that my country once again issues a pressing appeal for the foreign troops to withdraw from Afgha¬nistan  making it possible for the people of that country freely to choose the political system it considers best for its future. It has been three years now since a foreign army occupied that country  which was formerly non-aligned  compelling a large part of the population to choose the course of exile.188.	My country has witnessed with profound sad¬ness the continuation of the war between Iraq and -the Islamic Republic of Iran  two non-aligned Moslem States. In spite of the mediation efforts undertaken by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the non aligned movement  that absurd and fratricidal war continues to exact thousands of victims on both sides  not to mention the sizeable material damage it causes. We therefore once again solemnly appeal to the two belligerents to cease their hostilities imme¬diately so that hatred and intransigence can yield to wisdom and conciliation. In fact  that conflict not only constitutes a threat to peace in that region  but bears the insidious seed of overall conflagration  given the highly strategic nature of the region.189.	The problem of Cyprus is still on the agenda of the Assembly. We are pleased  however  at the progress  limited but real  that has been achieved this year in the framework of the intercommunal talks in the quest for a just and lasting solution that would preserve the peace  unity and sovereignty of Cyprus. We encourage the two Governments  Greek and Turkish  to continue their negotiations so that a prompt and satisfactory solution can be found  one likely to safeguard the interests of all those affected by the problem. In this respect  we wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the efforts that he has constantly made to find a solution to that problem.190.	In respect of Kampuchea  we cannot fail to express our deep disappointment at the fact that the decisions of the General Assembly demanding the immediate unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that country have been ignored. The people of Kampuchea  just like all other peoples in the world  have aright to peace and freedom and it is time for their martyrdom to end. The direct action of a neighbouring Power which keeps many divisions of its army in Kampuchea endangers not only the peace of the region by creating an atmosphere of constant destabilization but also constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.191.	The situation in the Korean peninsula remains deadlocked. Nevertheless  we do take note of the statement by the leaders of the two States indicating that they wish to arrive at a peaceful solution making it possible for their divided homeland to be reunified. We must encourage and support those good intentions  because a united Korea is a guarantee of peace and stability in that part of the world.192.	The question of Namibia continues to be of the greatest concern to my Government. A11 Africa places its hopes in the Organization  but the United Nations will lose credibility if it is unable to guarantee to the peoples of Namibia and South Africa the freedom and justice to which they naturally aspire. There can be no doubt that it is thanks to the assistance of certain industrialized Powers that South Africa is able constantly to defy United Nations decisions and to continue to exploit through the odious system of apartheid millions of Africans in their own land and illegally to occupy Namibia.193.	It is only through the prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 433 (1978) that it will be possible to achieve the peaceful decolonization of Namibia by prohibiting any attempt to amend that resolution or blur its details  because this would just be playing the game of the South African racists.194.	The efforts made thus far by the contact group to induce Pretoria to comply with resolution 435 (1978) have met with the delaying tactics of the Pretoria regime  which ceaselessly resorts to subterfuge  going so far as to interfere in the internal affairs of neigh¬bouring countries in order to impose its illegal policy in Namibia. Today  the South African army is in constant violation of the southern territory of Angola  killing hundreds of innocent men  women and children by indiscriminate bombings.195.	Regarding its evacuation of Namibia  Pretoria seeks to impose unacceptable conditions on a sover¬eign country  Angola. All these measures and these delays are aimed at gaining time to make it possible for Pretoria to train and place its puppets at the head of the forthcoming independent Namibian Govern¬ment. It is now up to the international community  to the Organization  to take enforcement measures to compel the Pretoria leaders to respect United Nations decisions.196.	I take this opportunity to reaffirm the total solidarity and unfailing support  both moral and material  of my Government for SWAPO  the genuine representative of the Namibian people in its just strug¬gle for the liberation of its country. I should also like to express here the unshakeable determination of my country to lend support to the national liberation movements of southern Africa.197.	As regards Western Sahara  my country endorses the resolution adopted at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Govern¬ment of the Organization of African Unity  held at Nairobi  in June 1981 and remains convinced that a satisfactory solution to this serious problem  which could threaten our pan-African organization with collapse  is to be found through the full application of the resolution relating to the organization of a referendum on self-determination for the people of that country. We hope once again that African wisdom will manage to avoid a prolongation of a dispute  which has incalculable consequences. As far as we are con¬cerned  we are ready to support any initiative aimed at safeguarding our organization  a symbol of the strength and unity of our African continent.198.	Another no less pressing problem threatening us directly is of concern not just to my country but also to many others in the same region  since it relates to the further strengthening of the foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean. The root of this mili¬tarization of an erstwhile peaceful zone is the rivalry between the major Powers  who are involved in an arms race as frantic as it is absurd. This state of affairs is giving rise to an explosive situation of con¬cern to all the coastal countries. It has also led to a sharp deterioration in the climate of security which used to reign throughout this vast region. Thus it is with great disappointment that my country has wit¬nessed the many obstacles which have arisen to prevent the convening of the conference which the Organization was to have held at Colombo in order to study the methods of implementation of the Declara¬tion of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).199.	My country  like others wishing to preserve peace and security in that region  unreservedly sup¬ports the idea of creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and sincerely hopes that the conference which is to discuss this matter will finally be able to meet. We support the position of the non-aligned countries in favor of holding it in Sri Lanka.200.	The gloomy picture of the international political situation which I have just sketched is unfortunately reflected in the serious economic imbalances to be found in the world today. We all more or less agree on one point  namely  that this crisis does exist. It has struck hard at all countries with few exceptions  but it has affected the developing countries most  particularly the weakest among them  those which are called the least developed.201.	The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  which is among the latter  is feeling even more pain¬fully the harmful effects of this crisis  because of the problems arising from its special geographic characteristics. Because of its island character  the Comoros Islands must cope with structural problems: isolation due to distance from major international communications routes and lack of adequate infra¬structures  although considerable efforts have been made in this area by the Government and many projects are now in progress. But we continue to come up against financial problems; in fact  the Comoros like most of the non-oil-producing devel¬oping countries  has suffered for several years from a growing deficit in its balance of trade caused by worsening exchange rates.202.	Although our country has a virtual monopoly of the production of certain cash crops  such as ylang- ylang and vanilla  nevertheless it is subject to the risks of a market controlled by people who  com¬fortably installed in their offices somewhere in Europe  decide on the prices according to criteria which they alone are privy to. Because of this we frequently have to sell our export products at a loss.203.	An obvious result of this is a considerable drop in our export revenues  resulting in a lack of resources which leads to budgetary deadlocks and their corollary  inflation. In order to cope with this we unfortunately have to resort to loans  which add to the burden of our indebtedness.204.	Faced with this problem  my Government makes an urgent appeal  based on General Assembly resolu¬tion 36/212  to the international community  inter¬national financial institutions and developed countries which are able to do so to give us assistance in 3he development process of our country.205.	In this context  it is a pleasure for me to announce from this rostrum that  pursuant to the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries for a round table of the major lenders will be held in our capital  Moroni  in March 1983 and will bring together all those who are willing to respond to this appeal and to participate in financing our development projects. I fervently hope that this appeal will be heeded.206.	If  each time we are given the opportunity  we demand new measures and constantly call for global negotiations  a new international economic and monetary order and increased assistance to the most disadvantaged countries  that is not mere rhetoric but a call for justice. The major rich industrialized coun¬tries frequently take pleasure in proclaiming with a certain pride the major principles and values of de¬mocracy  freedom and justice  which in their view are the unique characteristics of their civilization  but national pride and the facts contradict them.207.	However  a great hope was born last year during the International Meeting Co-operation and Development at Cancun in October 1981. The peoples and countries of the third world saw in that meeting the beginning of an awareness among the rich coun¬tries of the problems and difficulties facing the devel¬oping nations. Unfortunately  today our great disap¬pointment is equaled only by the hope which that meeting engendered. We are witnessing the progressive and accelerated erosion of the instruments and institutions which were justly established; infer o/w  to find solutions to the problems of the poor coun¬tries. The present economic situation can be improved only if concerted action is taken at the international level to correct the harmful and perverse effects of the present economic and monetary situation. Of course  that requires the good will and loyalty of all countries.208.	It is in that context that the Government of my country supports the efforts undertaken to launch global negotiations  considering that both North and South must make some sacrifices. Only at that price will the world find a way out of the existing morass of economic and financial crises.209.	I should like before concluding this rapid review of the political and economic situation prevailing in the world to mention once again a question of which the Assembly is well aware and which for us Comorians is of prime importance; it is a subject of constant concern since it is the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte. I do not think it would be useful to repeat the background of this question here  since several debates have been devoted to it at earlier sessions and since it remains on the agenda and thus will be the subject of a specific debate  when we shall have the opportunity to speak on it. Today I shall limit myself to recalling the resolutions adopted by the United Nations  OAU  the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement  all of which affirm unequivo¬cally the territorial integrity of the Comoros as a country made up of four islands  including Mayotte  over which the sovereignty of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros should clearly extend.210.	It was on the basis of those resolutions and under the aegis of the OAU that anv4d Committee of Seven of the OAU  specially entrusted with follow¬ing the developments of this problem  met in Moroni  from 9 to 11 November 1981. During that meeting the Committee took note of the question and adopted certain recommendations advocating  inter alia  direct contact between the French and Comorian Governments in order to find a just solution to this problem through negotiations.211.	Since then  several meetings at the highest level have taken place between the two countries  par¬ticularly between the President of the French Repub¬lic  Francois Mitterrand  and the President of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane. During those meetings  which were frank and friendly  as relations are between France and the Comoros  the French President expressed his Government's desire to reach a satis¬factory solution to this problem.212.	Taking note of that commitment  the Comorian Government reaffirms its will to continue through negotiation and in accordance with the relevant decisions and resolutions of international organiza¬tions  to take all the necessary steps to regain its territorial integrity  that is  the return of the island of Mayotte to the Comorian group of islands.213.	This peaceful struggle which we are carrying on is not ours alone: it is that of all peoples and all countries which respect the Charter of the United Nations and international law. For its part  the Comorian people remains determined to pursue its legitimate claims  sure of its right  which is recognized and supported by the entire international community through its varies organizations. Thus we expect France and those who lead it today to respect their past and present commitments and the law so that we may find a just solution to this problem.214.	The United Nations was created to carry out a noble mission  that of safeguarding and maintaining peace and security in the world. The many hotbeds of tension which have flared up throughout the world are likely at any time to plunge it into a new war  with unimaginable consequences. In a world that has lost its way  it is time that the Organization regained its main vocation. Of course that will be possible only if each of its Members  whatever its power  scrupulously respects the principles of the Charter. For its part  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  faithful to the great principles of peace  liberty and justice  will continue to make its contribution  however modest  to strengthening the effectiveness of the Organization and helping it to regain its noble reputation. This is very survival of mankind depends upon this."
"33",1598,"CPV",37,1982,"I have great pleasure  Sir  on behalf of the Government of Cape Verde  in carrying out the pleasant duty of extending to you our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your well-known statesmanlike qualities and your experience in the diplomatic arena are an earnest of the positive role which we are confident you will play during your term of office. We wish to express to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our great appreciation of the manner in which he carried out the onerous duties involved in guiding the proceedings of the thirty-sixth session  which dealt with problems crucial to the future of the world. We should like to take this opportunity also to wish Mr. Perez de Cuellar every success in the performance of his difficult task and to express to him our appreciation of the efforts he has made since taking office to reduce world tension  strengthen the credibility of the Organization and consolidate its foundations.The decades which followed the founding of the United Nations may be described as decades of struggle for the application of one of its fundamental principles: the right to self-determination and independence of colonized countries and peoples. It has been a titanic struggle  on the scale of whole continents  a struggle of whose results the United Nations can well be proud.The present international situation  marked by a proliferation of sources of tension and armed confrontation and also by a gradual return to force as the primary instrument in international relations  contains elements which pose a threat to peace and impede the economic and social development of peoples. The refusal to accept the inexorable evolution of international relations towards the strengthening of the links of economic interdependence between the various parts of the world and between different social and political systems is undeniably the outcome of the perpetuation of that situation. This interdependence  which presupposes a global effort to overcome the existing condition of crisis  cannot be said to be compatible with the specific interests of a particular country or group of countries. More than ever before the moral conscience of the peoples of the world demands that relations of domination be replaced once and for all by relations of co-operation  force by dialogue and the risk of confrontation by stability  security in international relations and  finally  peace.The Government of Cape Verde  for its part  is sparing no effort to ensure the achievement of these objectives  not only because they are in keeping with the wishes of the people of Cape Verde but also because it is convinced that to do so is in the interests of the whole of mankind and in accord with humanity's aspirations. The Government of Cape Verde therefore bases its actions on stubborn defense of the principles of non-alignment and the Charter  the search for fruitful co-operation with all peace-loving nations and States which respect international law  the promotion of domestic economic and social development and the defense of all its prerogatives of sovereignty and independence of thought and action.The African continent  which over the past few decades has gradually found its way back to sovereignty and independence  is today in the grip of profound upheavals due to the delicate stage in the evolution of its society and the emancipation of its peoples. Those upheavals  while reflecting an unshakeable will for change and a persistent effort to meet the requirements of the times  are nevertheless accompanied by inhibitions and uncertainties  indicating the limits and weaknesses of this movement  which is on the rise  which is in progress now and which should allow Africa to develop its potential and guarantee its peoples the realization of their most legitimate aspirations.The economic crisis  which is particularly affecting our continent  has made political instability more likely  and this undermines the basis of coordinated and integrated economic development at the regional and sub-regional levels. Situations of war or confrontation between States of the continent undermine confidence between our peoples  jeopardize African unity and facilitate external interference  threatening our sovereignty and independence  which were won at such cost.Among the crucial problems affecting the southern part of the African continent  the question of Namibia and the persistence of apartheid in South Africa have an important place  because of their implications for Africa and for the world. In spite of the persistent efforts of the international community  reflected in the many Security Council resolutions and in the positions taken by the non-aligned movement and by the Organization of African Unity  Namibia continues to be occupied by South Africa. Recent initiatives to promote the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) have encountered difficulties of all kinds  including delaying tactics by South Africa  intended not only to create conditions favorable to a conditional independence but also to destabilize neighboring sovereign States. We hope that the current talks on the question will soon produce results  finally permitting the Namibian people to be masters of their own destiny and to occupy their proper place in the Assembly.The independence of Namibia is the collective responsibility of all the States Members of the United Nations. We should therefore substantially increase our support for the South West Africa People's Organization  for the valiant Namibian freedom fighters and for the front-line States—particularly the People's Republic of Angola  which has spared no effort and has shrunk from no sacrifice—so that our duty and responsibility towards the Namibian people shall not be thwarted by South Africa.The final declaration of the recent conference of heads of State of Angola  Cape Verde  Guinea- Bissau  Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe  held in Praia  Cape Verde  on 21 and 22 September this year  stated that making Namibia's independence conditional on the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola constituted flagrant interference in the internal affairs of a State Member of the United Nations and was contrary to the spirit and the letter of resolution 435 (1978). Similarly  destabilization measures taken against the front-line States  designed to deter them from giving decisive support to the liberation of Namibia  undeniably reflect a desire to perpetuate colonial domination over that Territory.No one can any longer doubt that South Africa is directing  financing and materially supporting a large-scale destabilization operation against the whole southern region of the African continent  with particular emphasis on the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique. Since its independence in 1975 the People's Republic of Angola has never known peace. Its wish to bring about its development and its efforts to reconstruct the country have been systematically thwarted by the criminal actions of the troops of the South African racist regime  which have been invading and destroying that country on various pretexts.We flatly reject the avowed encouragement of  and support for  the armed gangs that operate on Mozambique territory in order to create a climate of permanent instability. That action constitutes a flagrant violation of the most elementary norms governing coexistence between nations.The inhuman system of apartheid is becoming ever more arrogant and aggressive. Acts repugnant to the conscience of mankind continue to be carried out under it  and its constitutes an intolerable defiance of the repeated decisions of  and constant appeals from  the United Nations system.In North Africa a fratricidal war is still going on. Apart from its destruction of human life and property  it threatens  by its very scale  peace and security in the region. I am speaking of the conflict between the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco. In spite of the difficulties in resolving the conflict within the framework of the OAU  the need to bring about a cease-fire and to bring the two parties to the negotiating table  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations  has become urgent. The fact that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic is today recognized by almost a third of the members of the international community shows the justice of its struggle and the international support enjoyed by the Sahraoui people.The situation of the OAU today well illustrates the dangers now threatening international organizations which serve as instruments for the liberation and emancipation of peoples. The paralysis of and the explosive situation in the OAU are reflections of the deliberate offensive undertaken by forces which are counting on splitting Africa and thus weakening it  with the obvious goal of consolidating foreign interest in the continent  strengthening the apartheid regime and impeding the consolidation of the independence of African States.However  we are convinced that the moves at present being undertaken will bring about a resumption of dialogue and the beginnings of a solution which would preserve the cohesiveness and effectiveness of our continental organization  because the survival of the OAU is without any doubt of capital importance for all the African States and peoples.The problems that must be confronted by the OAU have a varying impact  but they also have an effect on the collective security of mankind and on other international organizations  including the United Nations itself.We note with apprehension the undesirable tendency to relegate the United Nations to a secondary role in the resolution of conflicts and when it is a matter of defusing tensions which endanger world peace and security. Indeed  the resolutions and recommendations of the supreme organs of the Organization have been systematically ignored; instead  what we have seen are accomplished and the use of force. Acts of this kind impede the just and final settlement of conflicts by keeping them latent  and this in turn makes them chronic and periodically explosive. The United Nations and the principles on which it is founded are the fruit of the undeniable moral progress of mankind and therefore provide the appropriate and reliable framework for the just solutions of the conflicts which plague us.The Secretary-General  in the thorough and courageous report on the work of the Organization  devoted a large part of his text to an assessment of the functioning of the Organization and the denunciation of situations and attitudes which reduce its effectiveness. His analysis should give considerable food for thought to all Member States which believe in the unique and irreplaceable role of the United Nations in the defense and promotion of international peace and security. For small countries like my own whose military capacity is merely symbolic compared with the vast destructive power accumulated by the great Powers  the effectiveness of and strict respect for international law and United Nations decisions are of vital importance  because our survival depends on recourse to dialogue to resolve conflicts between States.In this sense  and in keeping with the concern expressed by the Secretary-General in his report  my Government supports all initiatives designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations  which is the forum par	for concerted work and collective action for the maintenance of peace and security.Over the past few months we have witnessed unprecedented exacerbation of the Middle East crisis because of the aggression against and occupation of Lebanese territory  as well as the massacre of civilians carried out by Israeli troops in a vain attempt to drown the Palestinian people in blood and crush their heroic resistance. We reaffirm our conviction that it will be possible to reach a final solution only when Israel withdraws from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and with the participation of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  on an equal footing with all the otherparties concerned  in all negotiations on the solution of the Middle East problem.We wish to pay a sincere tribute to the progressive forces in Lebanon and the freedom fighters of the PLO. Through their heroism and their sense of dignity they have increased the stature of the Arab nation and proved  with the blood of its martyrs  t'<at peace in this region will be possible only when the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable national rights  including the right to establish their own State.The United Nations  in keeping with the initiatives of the non-aligned movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference in particular  should persist in its efforts to put an end to the Iraqi-Iranian war  promote the establishment of peace and bring stability to this area.Similarly  in South-East Asia  efforts must be made to establish a climate of peace and good-neighborliness.In East Timor the occupying Power has not succeeded in stifling the aspirations of the Maubere people to independence and dignity. We remain convinced that the international community cannot tolerate a situation in which the politics of accommodation is raised to the status of law  and will assist the heroic people of East Timor in its struggle for self- determination and independence  under the leadership of the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente  its sole legitimate representative.The international community  and in particular Portugal  as administering Power  should continue their efforts to mobilize all possible resources to ensure that the Indonesian occupation forces withdraw immediately from the Territory of East Timor. The international community should not tolerate a situation in which selfish interests and agreements replace honor  morality and law  thus denying by force of arms the political and cultural identity of a whole people which has proved that it is ready to make the supreme sacrifice to liberate its homeland.The persistence of other crisis situations in the world in no way contributes to the attainment of the noble goals of the Organization in Cyprus  we still await a solution which would preserve the rights of the two communities and the unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty of that non-aligned country.In Afghanistan  respect for the right of the Afghan people freely to choose its own destiny should promote the restoration of stability and permit that people to continue its work of building a prosperous society.The situation in the Indian Ocean region continues to arouse the greatest concern  particularly among the coastal countries. Everything possible should be done within the United Nations to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  in keeping with the aspirations of these countries and the wishes of the international community at large.Similarly  the heroic Korean people has been persevering in its efforts to bring about the peaceful reunification of its country. To ensure the exercise of this legitimate right concrete measures must be taken  in accordance with the principles and recommendations of the non-aligned movement  in particular those concerning the replacement of the armistice agreement by a peace agreement  non-interference in internal affairs and the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Korean territory. We believe that these conditions must be met if the peaceful reunification of Korea is to be achieved and true national unity established.In Central America there continue to persist alarming situations which contradict the most elementary norms of international law and constitute defiance of the objectives of the Charter.The arms race  which is reactivating the policy of confrontation and tension  and which engendered the cold war  is undermining the principles laid down in the Charter and its noble ideals of peace  justice and progress. At its twelfth special session the General Assembly found that the development of the situation since 1978 had not met the hopes aroused at its tenth special session. Indeed the Programme of Action contained in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly remains largely unimplemented. Although some progress has been achieved in negotiations  we cannot but note that the arms race  and in particular the nuclear arms race  has assumed dangerous proportions  and military expenditures have increased considerably. We subscribe whole-heartedly to the conclusions of the twelfth special session on disarmament and support the comprehensive programme of disarmament drafted by the General Assembly at that session  which constitutes an important step towards general and complete disarmament under international control.If they are to be lasting  international peace and security cannot be built upon the accumulation of arms; nor can they be maintained through the precarious balance of deterrence or doctrines based on strategic supremacy. We continue to believe that the creation of conditions favorable to disarmament and the strengthening of peaceful coexistence  together with a global development effort  are the key to the collective security of the world.Cape Verde  whose foreign policy is based on non-alignment  will continue to work for the implementation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations  an essential task of the present time that is the responsibility and indeed the duty of all States represented here.The various elements of the international situation are so closely interconnected that a realistic analysis of the present situation must be global in nature. In any ease  the concept of peace cannot possibly be dissociated from the equality of nations  the independence and sovereignty of all States and the right to the social and economic development of the world's peoples.We cannot claim to be working for peace in the world as long as there are people living under subhuman conditions. It is in this context that we wish to express our concern at the evolution of the international economic situation marked by a generalized crisis which further exacerbates the present injustice of the international economic order. Inflation  high interest rates  protectionism  unemployment  the reduction and indeed the dislocation of economic growth and economic activities are all factors that have a dangerous impact on developing countries.Although the present situation entails a serious risk of driving the international economic system towards uncontrollable imbalance  there are some who see in this an additional reason not to embark on genuine negotiations  sartorially or globally  with the developing countries and thus disregard the interdependence of the economies of the North and the South. Furthermore this fails to take account of the fact that collective security can be achieved only through an adequate response to the unjust situation created by current international economic relations and the persistence of a framework of economic relations dating from colonial times.No one can remain indifferent to the international economic crisis—certainly not those who are suffering most severely from its effects and whose development has been severely thwarted by this crisis. That is why we note with apprehension the delay in opening global negotiations and implementing the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The wish of the developing countries to start global negotiations in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/138  which was adopted by consensus  stems from the fact that for them these negotiations are by no means futile initiatives. On the contrary  they have to be reflected in tangible results  in an improvement of their standard of living  particularly with regard to food  health  education and culture and the restructuring of international economic relations.Recently we had occasion to note with great concern the undermining of the conditions for the realization of the objectives of international economic cooperation for development. We should like to stress particularly the relative decline in the level of contributions to financial institutions within the United Nations system  especially UNDP  an agency that makes an important contribution to developing countries. In this regard we would recall the recent appeal made in the Final Declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 on the imperative need to make a firm start on the strengthening of multilateral economic co-operation.Economic co-operation among developing countries is an important factor in international economic relations. This co-operation  which cannot be viewed as an alternative to North-South co-operation  was strengthened by the meetings in Arusha  Buenos Aires and  most recently  Caracas. We welcome the additional momentum given to this co-operation through the Caracas Programme of Action and at subsequent meetings.One year ago we expressed the wish that the last scheduled session for negotiations on the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea should really be the final one. Today  after several years of difficult negotiation  the Conference has succeeded in adopting the Convention it drafted. The adoption of the Convention by a great majority of countries is an important victory for the international community and also represents an important step towards the establishnent of a new legal regime governing the oceans.We believe that the Convention protects the interests of all countries and represents an instrument of justice  peace  development and co-operation among States. Despite the complexity of the subject- matter and of the various interests involved  the text of the Convention was negotiated by consensus and is the result of the balance that proved possible among the interests of each and every one. That is why we hope that all countries will be able to sign the Final Act and  if possible  sign the Convention itself at the session of the Conference that is scheduled for December.We deplore any unilateral or multilateral initiative aimed at exploiting the resources of the sea-bed outside the framework negotiated at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.Cape Verde belongs to the group of least developed countries  which was the subject of the Conference held last September in Paris. At that Conference the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries was adopted. We believe that the Conference was a significant stage in the difficult process of dialogue between the countries of the North and of the South  and we welcome the objectives set forth. The achievement of those objectives will be a response to the problems facing the least developed countries  whose economic situation has deteriorated in comparison not only with the rich countries but also with the developing countries.We hope that the strengthening of selfish nationalism and the deterioration in international economic relations will not become serious obstacles to the implementation of the decisions of the Paris Conference.Cape Verde  with the support of UNDP and pursuant to the decisions of the Paris Conference  organized a round table with its partners in development from 21 to 23 June  at Praia. This meeting helped not only to reconcile my country's needs with what its partners could offer  but also to explore procedures making possible a tangible improvement in the effectiveness of official development assistance for Cape Verde.The head of Government of the Republic of Cape Verde  in opening the discussions at the round table  established a framework for this work and described our concept of development  in the following terms:""The option of development in independence and dignity is a strictly national option. We are sure that the people of Cape Verde alone can provide the driving force for their own progress and we are determined to take up our self-imposed task in a responsible and consistent manner.""Nevertheless  in view of the scanty means available to us for remedying our difficult economic situation  it would be impossible for us to overcome our current problems and build a viable economy without the firm and programmed support of the international community.""Accordingly  we do not perceive external aid merely as a means of alleviating the tragic burden of the colonial legacy  or mitigating the effects of recurring crises  or binding our wounds in emergencies. We see it  at the present stage of our economic and social development  as something stable  programmed and rationalized  adjusted to the imperatives  arising from the process of establishing viable productive structures for our country.""It is within this framework of mutual responsibility  not to say collective responsibility  that we believe that actions to permit our people to enjoy their right to food  education  health and justice should find their proper place.Consequently Cape Verde attaches great importance to dialogue and co-operative efforts  with due respect for the choice of each of us in resolving problems connected with official development assistance which  in our view  must be predictable  guaranteed and adapted to the real needs and development options of our country.We think that the international community should concern itself with improving the modalities of assistance  in order to facilitate disbursements and to make external aid a real support for the efforts of our peoples to transform the harsh circumstances they have to overcome. Apart from the adverse effects of the international economic situation  Cape Verde must also deal with a series of unfavorable circumstances  such as the lack of productive structures  and the existence of such natural handicaps as the fact of being an island with a mountainous terrain and  above all  drought  which this year again has left my country severely stricken and led to the loss of almost all our crops.I should therefore like to take this opportunity to thank  on behalf of the Government and the people of Cape Verde  all those who continue to help relieve the heavy burden of underdevelopment inherited from the colonial period and worsened by natural catastrophes.Cape Verde attaches particular importance to the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  of which the President of the Republic of Cape Verde  Mr. Aristides Pereira  is the current Chairman. The efforts of the member countries of this Committee to fight against the scourge of drought are well known to the international community. Nevertheless  we must recognize that these efforts are not sufficient  in the light of the disastrous effects of natural catastrophes  particularly in terms of the steady deterioration of the soil of a group of countries which are regarded as among the most impoverished on our planet. Consequently we are confident that the international community will not neglect to strengthen its assistance to the peoples of the Sahel  who are involved in an arduous struggle to safeguard their food and their development.Despite the deadly conflicts  endless crises and continuing supply threats afflicting mankind  we can see real progress in some areas. That fact  together with our confidence in man and in his capacity to overcome his weaknesses  give us the hope and the conviction that the international community will find ways and means of eliminating the nuclear threat  transforming the system of unjust relations which prevails today in the world  enabling the most impoverished to achieve their aspirations  and bringing peace and progress with justice.It is therefore a matter of urgency that the ability of the United Nations to take action be strengthened and that the implementation of its decisions and recommendations by all Member States be assured. Relations among peoples  based on a new concept of moral  political and legal phenomena  will be increasingly in keeping with mankind's ambitions  will make a contribution to its emancipation and will guarantee the ever-growing role of the United Nations system. In conclusion  we should like to express our hope that the work of this thirty-seventh session will fulfil the expectations of the international community  and especially of those whose right to live in freedom and dignity has been infringed."
"34",1642,"CRI",37,1982,"Mr. President  I am pleased to join in the expressions of pleasure at your election. Your brilliant record makes you well qualified to occupy your lofty post and skilfully to conduct our complex proceedings. I am also very pleased that a Latin American has been called upon to be the Secretary-General. His fame is well earned. His election not only crowns a life devoted to the common good and to harmony among nations but also heralds a new current sweeping through Latin America which suggests that the people of our area will play a more fruitful  vigorous  Imaginative and co-operative part represented in world affairs  particularly in the United Nations. What the Secretary-General has accomplished in a short time is new and encouraging. His report on the work of the Organization speaks directly of matters of high importance with clarity and precision  and it contains sharp  frank and very valuable observations.The leadership provided by the Secretary-General goes precisely in the direction that my Government feels the United Nations should move in. In order to restore much of the faith in the Organization which has been lost  especially that of the common man of the Member States  the United Nations must participate more directly and in a more decisive and inventive manner in order to prevent serious conflicts and to resolve them when the violence which has been unleashed requires that we reiterate in a dramatic manner the commitment to peace with States made when they signed the Charter.Violence makes it impossible to achieve peace by means of persuasion  good offices and mediation. Member States must make a special effort  based on good faith and corresponding deeds  to see that the machinery provided by the Charter is used to prevent and resolve conflicts. Moreover  they have a duty to; do so  a legal and moral duty. Repeated failure to respect the purposes of the Charter only causes profound disenchantment with the United Nations at precisely the time when action by the Organization is needed to moderate the conduct of its Members. Those Members seen to be in the grip of atavistic forces that have stigmatized the twentieth century. But the twentieth century should be remembered as one of the most significant centuries in the history of mankind because of its dazzling achievements  which should be used to move man forward in the constant  ceaseless effort to reach a higher level and to live in peace.My Government is aware  of course  of the difficulties which stand in the way of the achievement of this goal  especially at the present time  which is dominated by exacerbated nationalism instead of by the noble  visionary  universalist purposes and principles of the United Nations. There can be no doubt that each and every one of us must make an effort  an outstanding effort  to halt the devastating wave of violence which has shaken the world  in spite of the existence of an impressive system of international organizations  the center of which is the United Nations  devoted to the promotion of international harmony.To some extent the peoples of the world are being deceived when they disregard the United Nations in the frontal assault on war  guerrilla warfare  terrorism  torture and foreign intervention in the internal affairs of States. Also  the peoples of the world are in fact being thwarted when the United Nations is not allowed to stop repression of democratic movements which seek changes in unjust economic and social structures by peaceful electoral methods.Violations of human rights  violations of civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights must receive priority attention by the United Nations. More vigorous action is needed  for we have gone beyond the stage of mere declarations which proclaim and define those rights and now an effort must be made  realistically and with a keen sense of urgency  to perfect and put into practice the international instruments which have been created to promote the fundamental freedoms of every person everywhere.In this connection it is fitting to stress one of the most impressive of the revolutions that have occurred in the past three decades  but one which has gone largely unnoticed by the majority of the peoples of the world. I am referring  of course  to the fact that it has finally been recognized that the individual is a subject of international public law and can resort to the appropriate jurisdictional bodies on human rights when domestic means of protection have been exhausted  do not exist  or have serious imperfections. Within the United Nations  the Human Rights Committee must be strengthened and  above all  the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must be ratified. Both instruments must be signed and ratified by all Members of the United Nations  because that would benefit the man in the street in all nations and be a victory of far-reaching consequences.The average citizen of the nations represented here trusts the good judgment of those who govern to ensure the well-being to which he is entitled  but which he may not obtain because he is not aware of the new machinery which could be used and cannot bring pressure to bear on his Government to abide by the commitments entered into when it signed the Charter. Human rights were not in the Charter  then the Organization of United Nations  it should be remembered  are indissolubly linked  their primary characteristic  which makes it different from any other organization created before 1945 and which makes it possible for it to fight against the scourge of war.We must take a similar stand on other international instruments relating to the protection of human rights  such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  in particular	and also the procedures used by the Commission on Human Rights  of which Costa Rica is a member  must be improved. The Commission must be freed from political interests and influences which all too frequently disrupt and even obstruct its work and thereby prejudice the interests of the thousands of individuals who look to that body as a last resort to protect them from arbitrary action by their rulers.The Government of Costa Rica applauds the decision to convert the Division on Human Rights into a Centre and we think that this is a decision that reflects a desire better to protect and defend all freedoms by perfecting existing instruments and designing new ones on the basis of experience. For example  before assuming my present post I had the honor of being appointed by the Commission on Human Rights and by the Secretary-General to act on two recent occasions in an African country as rapporteur and as an expert  respectively  while collaborating with the Government in the improvement of institutions protecting fundamental freedoms after that country had suffered under a cruel dictatorship. Fortunately  very positive results were achieved. I mention this because it makes it quite clear that the Commission can find new courses of action to carry out its important task and because this sheds new light on Costa Rica's initiative as regards the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Experience has shown that when United Nations procedures are particularly flexible and diverse in carrying out its essential mandate to promote and protect human rights those rights can be better protected and more people understand what the Organization is for and what it is all about. People also then feel encouraged and cope more vigorously and perseveringly with adversity  anguish  humiliation and the kind of pain that they experience on a daily basis as they strive to ensure that those that govern them respect their dignity.Of course all human rights are important. Without them international peace is an illusion. At the moment  however  I want to refer to the right to vote  the right to work and the right to life. And I want to make a general comment on economic and social rights  which also play a major role in the important task of creating a community of nations more free from tension and combating the present erosion of efforts in support of peace.The right to vote ensures the right to political participation in all areas at all levels. It makes it possible for the people of the world to be the true forgers of their destiny instead of this being done by minority cliques and those that have seized power and the representation of the majorities on the pretext of the alleged inability of those that know what is best for the development of the personality of the nation and how to contribute intelligently to the common well- being. The right to vote for government. By means of the vote the right to self-determination  embodied by the United Nations in a number of most important documents  is exercised.For this purpose nothing can replace free periodical and fair elections. The use of violence  such as terrorism and guerrilla warfare  can certainly not replace the right to vote. The former is a blot on modem society  although it has a long history. Among some totalitarian forces there is a tendency to exalt terrorism as a means of social struggle. But fortunately  mankind has reacted vigorously against any justification of this kind of political and social action. Mankind supports instead a democratic struggle for the dignity of all human beings and particularly those that have been excluded from the productive mainstream of society. We must take advantage of this healthy universal reaction to perfect national and international juridical means of dealing with this very serious threat to peace. The latter  guerrilla warfare  which also has a long history  has become a very important factor nowadays. There is sometimes a great deal of ambivalence about guerrilla warfare. When it is a question of peoples exercising their right to rebellion  it is often a last resort in defending their fundamental freedoms. On the other hand  when the right to vote is a possibility and when there are other ways of ensuring the smooth functioning of democracy  guerrilla warfare appears to be a totalitarian weapon which disrupts society in a profound and often irreparable manner. It is thus an ally of anarchy which destroys any effort to bring about the common good.Therefore  in order to replace bullets by votes  it was decided  at the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 4 October in San Jose  Costa Rica  to create a body to promote and advise on the subject of democratic elections  the purpose of which would be to ensure an electoral system throughout the continent  promote and foster this process in the Americas and provide advice on the practice of the system to countries requesting it.The recent tragic events relating to the courageous trade union  Solidarity  in Poland have aroused world public opinion regarding the subject of the right to work. Costa Rica believes that the United Nations should promote days of study on work and other rights related to it  such as the freedom to create trade unions independent of Governments. My Government suggests that the United Nations arrange a seminar with high-level participation to consider in depth the admirable encyclical of His Holiness Pope John Paul II as a contribution to peace. The encyclical will arouse the awareness of the peoples and may ensure that Governments reach appropriate decisions which will mitigate the tension that leads to social injustice and endangers peace. In the hope that this idea of a seminar will be accepted by the United Nations  the Government of Costa Rica takes this opportunity of offering its capital as the headquarters.We should bear in mind the basic thinking of His Holiness  or at least this essential part: in particular  makes possible pluralist participation in the choice ""Commitment to justice must be closely linked with commitment to peace in the modem world.""This is linked to the role of work and the worker in the quest for peace:""... human work is a key  probably the essential key  to the whole social question  if we try to see that question really from the point of view of man's good. And if the solution-or rather  the gradual solution-of the social question  which keeps coming up and becomes ever more complex  must be sought in the direction of 'making life more human'  then the key  namely human work  acquires fundamental and decisive importance.""Furthermore  another cardinal principle enunciated by John Paul II should also be stressed here-the ethical value of work""which clearly and directly remains linked to the fact that the one who carries it out is a person  a conscious and free subject  that is to say  a subject who decides about himself.""And here the Pope of the workers pauses to emphasize the subjective dimension of work  rising from its dignity:""... the basis for determining the value of human work is not primarily the kind of work being done  but the fact that the one who is doing it is a person.""114. Equally enlightening are some other thoughts which I shall now sum up. First  rejection of ""materialistic and economistic thought""  which equates work with goods and is the source of unheard of  inhumane exploitation  even today  when the concept of capitalism at any cost has been tempered. Hence  a different approach must be adopted-one which comprehends the working man:""... in accordance with the true dignity of his work-that is to say ... as subject and maker  and  for this very reason  as the true purpose of the whole process of production.""Secondly  the strengthening of worker solidarity  not only because there are many different kinds of work and because there are still many injustices which derive from the liberal socio-political system  but also because:""On the world level  the development of civilization and of communications has made possible a more complete diagnosis of the living and working conditions of man globally  but it has also revealed other forms of injustice  much more extensive than those which in the last century stimulated unity between workers for particular solidarity in the working world. This is true in countries which have completed a certain process of industrial revolution. It is also true in countries where the main working milieu continues to be agriculture or other similar occupations.""Thirdly  work  at the same time as it promotes a hierarchy of duties  is:""... a source of rights on the part of the worker. These rights must be examined in the broad context of human rights as a whole  which are connatural with man."" His Holiness also defends the right to association for the defense of the vital interests of ""those employed in the various professions"".The right to life  furthermore  has aroused and continues to arouse considerable polemics in all countries  in regard to the question of the death penalty. The United Nations has not remained on the sidelines of that important discussion  as is shown by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In order to shed new light on the subject of capital punishment and to link it  as it must be linked  to the struggle for the protection of fundamental human rights  the Government of Costa Rica has convened a world congress to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the death penalty in Costa Rica. My Government and the people of Costa Rica hope that many will participate in the conference. We wish to create a climate which would lead to the abolition of such a drastic punishment  which is so prone to error and arbitrary use. Costa Rica would be greatly honored if the Secretary- General would be present at the opening of that congress in December this year. My Government also supports the efforts of all countries which advocate abolition of the death penalty and particularly the efforts by the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and Sweden.As I have already stressed  economic  social and cultural rights are no less important and deserve our full attention. The comparison between those rights and civil and political rights-a comparison that was valid in an earlier time for the purpose of stressing the former  is outmoded. It is today generally recognized that the enjoyment of social justice in liberty is indispensable. But if economic  social and cultural rights  enshrined in the International Covenant  are to be enjoyed  there must be transformations in the structures of States  which is much more difficult to achieve than changes needed to bring about the enjoyment of this other set of rights. Such structures are the heirs to odious privileges of the few  which have been prejudicial to the rights of the many dispossessed. They also represent cruel forms of repression  perhaps more ruthless and inhumane than those generated by lack of respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of men and citizens  because they intensify the pain and despair of the weakest. Moreover  the changes that are needed to bring about the enjoyment of economic and social rights require more time and more financial and technological resources  as well as a degree of national and international consensus that is much greater and more solid in nature. For that reason  the United Nations must concern itself with showing Member States that here  too  there are real causes of discontent that affect world peace in a direct way and with devastating force. Governments would thus be' come more interested in the social reforms that arerequired.The Government of Costa Rica is also concerned about other problems that tend to work against peace. With greater eloquence than mine  representatives have referred to the catastrophic developments in the world economy  which have had a devastating effect on the development and political stability of the vast majority of States Members of the United Nations. Today I should like to add my voice to the powerful voices that have spoken out in alarm and protest against this state of affairs. In particular I should like to highlight the situation in Latin America.The year 1981 was one of the worst of the post-war period from the economic standpoint. All the indices suggest that there will be a greater deterioration in the immediate future. The stagnation of our economies  the galloping inflation which characterizes most of our economies  the deterioration in the terms of trade and the serious disequilibrium in the balance of payments which accompanies it disrupt social peace and make it more difficult to find democratic political solutions to the serious problems besetting many countries.Our region has seen its external debt doubled in only three years  and today it exceeds $240 billion. This is the result of an attempt to replace a lack of dynamism in exports  brought about to some extent by the weak demand of the developed countries  by an influx of capital  with increasingly higher interest rates.In the circumstances  it is disappointing that today there is not the necessary political consensus to ensure a take-off in global negotiations. Recognizing the structural problems which characterize international economic relations and emphasizing that a global discussion of these problems is necessary  we share the opinion of those that say it is urgent that short-term action be taken to prevent the complete collapse of the weaker economies.For this reason it is necessary that we start work on an emergency programme encompassing  infer a//a  the following actions: first  initiatives to increase the flow of trade by means of eliminating barriers to the exports of the developing countries and by means of greater South-South exchange; secondly  the creation of compensatory funds to reduce the impact of the deterioration in the terms of trade; thirdly  better promotion of joint investment by the industrialized and developing countries in the latter; fourthly  the increase  on a generous and disinterested basis  of the flow of resources towards multilateral financing bodies and technological co-operation to improve the liquidity of the developing countries; and  fifthly  the promotion of greater understanding and tolerance in those bodies as regards the implementation of economic measures in such a way as to ensure a better balance between the objectives of reactivation and of stabilization.We should like to stress that the adoption of a programme such as the one just mentioned should not be seen as a substitute for greater efforts leading to the creation of a new economic order. We believe  however  that these measures are in keeping with the spirit of the new order  that they would help to establish a climate more conducive to the success of initiatives concerning the structural change that we desire and that they would create necessary conditions-although perhaps not all the conditions-for the peace and security which our peoples deserve.In this respect  the meeting of Foreign Ministers held at San Jose on 4 October drew""... the attention of the industrialized democratic countries to the need to increase co-operation with the democratic countries of the region  with bold and effective initiatives which will contribute to the efforts to ensure recovery and economic and social development which are being made by the countries of the region concerned"".In addition to those that I have mentioned  there are  of course  many other reasons why the general picture of present international relations so gloomy. The situation in the Middle East requires that we dedicate ourselves  free from the heavy burden of prejudices  obstacles and past events  to the search for peace for that tormented region. My Government hopes that all the States of the Middle East will make the changes and reach the agreements necessary  for an honorable lasting peace that will guarantee the sovereignty  security  peace and well-being of all the States of the area. This applies in particular to the noble people of Lebanon  who deserve to be allowed to return to the condition of their glorious past. At the same time  the Government of Costa Rica is confident that the long-suffering and noble people of Palestine will in the not too distant future see the end of their present precarious existence. Then Palestinians will be able  like all other nations  to enjoy peace  work and respect for their dignity  in harmony with their neighbors and with universal recognition of their many virtues.For the subjugated peoples of South Africa and Namibia my country hopes that the hour of liberation will soon come. To this end  the increasingly active participation of the international community  encouraged and guided by the United Nations  is essential.My Government feels great satisfaction at the constructive efforts being made by the Government of the Republic of Korea to bring about the reunification of that country on the basis of its recent proposals. Whatever is done must be in line with the aims and purposes of the United Nations regarding the reunification of Korea. Costa Rica recognizes the peace-loving and hard-working nature of the friendly and noble people of the Republic of Korea.Costa Rica welcomes the fact that the dear sister Republic of Argentina has taken the initiative in pressing its just claim to the Malvinas Islands in this United Nations forum and hopes that the negotiations will prove fruitful. The association of the Secretary-General with the dialogue  in accordance with a proposal of which Costa Rica was a sponsor  is a guarantee that the parties will reach an honorable and peaceful final agreement.Costa Rica shows the concern expressed in this Hall at what is happening in Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where situations in violation of the principles of the Charter continue.I should now like to take up the subject specifically referred to by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. I refer to what he has called ""the prevailing convulsion of Central America"".More than four decades ago we  the democratic sectors promoting social change and freedom in Central America anticipated the present crisis in the area. Our predictions were based on the existence of economic and social structures and systems of military government which legalized them. They constituted forms of oppression whose inevitable end result would be the rebellion of peoples fighting against the lack of social justice and for freedom. Today the explosion of popular wrath has assumed a virulent form as a result of that anti-democratic record.But what was perhaps not anticipated was the international circumstances prevailing during the final confrontation between the peoples and the dictatorships. We did not anticipate all the implications of this global confrontation today between democracy and totalitarianism  a confrontation that would thoroughly disrupt efforts to adapt these new forces to present realities in Central America. What was particularly unexpected was that  on behalf of freedom  social justice and democracy  an effort would be made after the predictable rebellion to establish another unanticipated form of totalitarianism  thereby flouting the very ideals which impelled the forces of change. Yet that is precisely what is happening today. This other form of totalitarianism  bolstered by open intervention by forces outside the Central American area  has only sharpened the conflict  polarized political ideas and created new formidable obstacles to democratic  representative and pluralistic government devoted to social justice  without the need for the bloodshed and confrontation now rending the peoples of the Central American nations apart.In an effort to produce a realistic way out of the present crisis besetting Central America  the President of Costa Rica  Luis Alberto Monge  on the very day he assumed power on 8 May of this year  began to put into practice what he had advocated in his electoral campaign  namely  a broad alliance of democratic forces and Governments in order to confront the totalitarian offense and promote the values  machinery and goals of representative  pluralistic and participatory democracy for clearly social purposes. For this purpose  infer in a joint declaration of the heads of State attending the ceremony of the transfer of power on 8 May  it was agreed  on Costa Rica's initiative  that there would be created a good offices group which would have as its special mandate the study of the various peace initiatives that had been presented by various Governments in order to bring about the relaxation of tension in Central America  as well as other proposals that might be presented for the same purpose in the future. Ever since  my country has stressed the need for this kind of machinery or one similar to it that would make it possible for the parties directly involved in the conflict to sit at the negotiating table. And so it was that the Government of Costa Rica decided to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of countries interested in the pro-  motion of democracy in Central America and in the Caribbean whose Governments have been legitimized through elections.On 4 October  at San Jose  at the invitation of the Costa Rican Government there met representatives of Belize  Colombia  the Dominican Republic  El Salvador  Honduras  Jamaica  Panama  the United States and Costa Rica. The Governments of Mexico and Venezuela were also invited. Panama and theDominican Republic participated as observers  and the latter signed the Final Act. At the conclusions of the deliberations on the main factors obstructing democratic processes in the area  faith was reaffirmed in representative  pluralistic and participatory democracy and the foundation was laid for the promotion of democracy and peace in our area.Regarding that democracy  the participating ministers declared:""Their faith in and acceptance of the principles of representative  pluralistic and participatory democracy  which thus understood constitute a way of life  thought and action  with room for differing social and economic systems and structures  but having a common denominator  namely  respect for life  personal security  freedom of thought  freedom of the press and of religion  and the right to work and to proper remuneration  just living conditions  the free exercise of the right to vote and other human  civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights.""As regards the promotion of peace in the area  the Ministers stated""Their conviction that in order to foster peace and regional stability it is necessary to promote internally political awareness leading to the creation of democratic  representative  pluralistic and participatory systems; the establishment of machinery for multilateral and permanent dialogue; absolute respect for borders defined in existing treaties  respect for which is the best way of preventing border disputes and incidents  with due account being taken  where necessary  of traditional lines of jurisdiction. There must also be respect for the independence and territorial integrity of States; use or threats to use force to settle conflicts must be rejected; the arms race must cease and  on a full basis of reciprocity  external factors obstructing a lasting and stable peace must be eliminated.""In addition  the ministers felt that it was necessary to emphasize certain actions of particular importance which were essential in formulating a realistic  viable peace plan. For this reason  they stated that:""... it is essential for a peace plan that each country  in the region and outside of it  carry out the following actions: first  to create and maintain institutions of government which are truly democratic  based on the popular will as expressed in free and untainted elections  based on the principle that the Government is responsible to the governed; secondly  to respect human rights  especially the right to life and security of person  and fundamental freedoms  freedom of expression  information  assembly and worship  and the right to organize political parties  labor unions and other groups and associations; thirdly  to foster national reconciliation wherever profound divisions within society have occurred  by extending opportunities to participate within the framework of democratic institutions and procedures; fourthly  to respect the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the right of peoples to self-determination; fifthly  to prevent the use of the territory of a country to support  supply  train or supervise terrorists or subversive elements acting in other States  putting an end to the traffic in weapons and materials  and refraining from direct or indirect support for terrorists or subversive or other activities designed to bring about the violent overthrow of the Government of another State; sixthly  to limit weapons and the scale of military and security forces to levels which are strictly necessary for the maintenance of public order and national defense; seventhly  to ensure  in accordance with reciprocal and fully verifiable terms  international control of all ports of entry and other border areas which are of strategic importance; eighthly  to effect withdrawal  on a fully reciprocal basis  from the Central American area of all foreign military and security advisors and personnel  and the banning of imports of heavy weapons of an obviously offensive nature in accordance with procedures which ensure proper verification.""These actions represent an integrated framework in each State which is essential for the promotion of regional peace and stability.""As already stated  it is  of course  quite clear that without appropriate means or machinery to analyses this peace plan and other proposals with the same purpose  they all run the risk of being ineffective  and that would be tragic. For that reason  at the San Jose meeting which I have referred to  the ministers agreed ""to set themselves up as a Forum for Peace and Democracy""  a forum which could be extended through the inclusion or the collaboration of other democratic States. The Forum could recommend specific actions to representatives of participating countries  and they should report on the results and transmit the final act of the meeting to other States  so that they can present any appropriate comments and views.The representatives asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica to transmit the final act  on behalf of the participating Governments  to the Governments of the region and to other Governments concerned  in order to obtain their views on the principles and conditions for peace set forth therein.They decided to convene a new meeting as soon as possible in order to assess the progress being made in implementing the aims of the declaration.The Forum for Peace and Democracy is an expression of a common will; it does not constitute an official body  and therefore has the necessary flexibility and dynamism to carry out its great task. The nucleus of the Forum is made up of Belize  Colombia  El Salvador  Honduras  Jamaica  the Dominican Republic  the United States and Costa Rica. Whatever democratic countries from the area wish to become members of the Forum may do so  and a second group can be made up of democratic countries which wish to co-operate with the Forum without actually belonging to it. Here I should like to stress that the Forum was created so that there might be the participation in it of all countries involved in conflicts in Central America that disrupt peace  so that they could explain their views and make peace proposals; and this has already been done by Nicaragua  Honduras  Mexico  the United States and Panama individually  and by Mexico and Venezuela jointly  apart from the eight other countries that met at San Jose and created the Forum and proposed the aforementioned plan for regional peace.As part of the mandate assigned to me at the San Jose meeting  I have already circulated its final act and I am now taking the steps required to enable the Forum to be used as a practical instrument for waging this great peace offensive of the democracies. We hope that  with the support of those peoples who desire peace  democracy  freedom and social justice  this new initiative of the Forum for Peace and Democracy will meet with a warm response and understanding  because we believe that this is the broadest  most comprehensive and most viable means of achieving the ends we all so much desire.Costa Rica is a country with long diplomatic traditions; we are peace-loving and unarmed. We neither want nor are able to become involved in any armed conflict in Central America. But neither can we refrain from contributing to peace efforts in Central America. Costa Rica's security depends on security and peace in the region. For this reason Costa Rica has sincerely and eagerly devoted its efforts to convening the meeting of foreign ministers concerned for peace and democracy in Central America and the Caribbean  whose Governments are the result of the electoral process. As I have already stated  that meeting took place on 4 October in the capital of my country. For that reason also  Costa Rica  on 8 May of this year  proposed the creation of the Forum for Peace and Democracy  which began to function at that San Jose meeting.For the first time ever  there is now a procedure whereby all parties concerned can sit down together and  without any delays or excuses  engage in a frank  constructive dialogue. If any party does not avail itself of that opportunity  one can only conclude that  essentially  there are elements more interested in seeking violent confrontation. I am confident  however  that this peace initiative of ours and the machinery to implement it will be accepted by everyone. The peoples of the region  which yearn for peace  security and democracy  have their eyes turned to us to see how we  the leaders of their Governments  fulfil our lofty duties.On this glorious anniversary of the discovery of America  I conclude my statement with a tribute to Spain and to its extraordinary people which has given us its values and taught us  through the centuries  how to overcome all adversity in the persevering quest for the dignity and happiness of every human being."
"35",1688,"CSK",37,1982,"Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you on your election to your high office at this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your election reflects both an appreciation of your personal abilities and an expres¬sion of the wide international prestige enjoyed by the people of your country  whose contribution to the strengthening of peace and international security is well known. We wish you and the Secretary- General full success in your responsible work.92.	This is the second time in the last four months that we have met to consider developments throughout the world and seek ways of joining forces as effectively as possible for the implementation of the noble prin¬ciples of the Charter. However  this time again it is with a feeling of considerable concern that we are forced to note that the current international situation con¬tinues to be alarming and complex. We are deeply convinced that this cooling of the political climate did not have to occur at all. There are not nor can there be any rational grounds for it. The policy of detente  after all  has asserted itself as a clearly demonstrable historic achievement of nations.93.	Unfortunately  for certain circles of imperialism and reaction the departure from such a generally beneficial policy and attempts to return to the practices of the cold war have become virtually a line of policy. What inventions they manage to come up with Just as in the years of the witch hunts  today  again  their agents are trying to resurrect the specter of com¬munism  looking for its long arm in everything bad; and  not unlike inquisitors  they are accusing the socialist countries of all the deadly sins  with the absurd intention of getting them to the stake reserved for heretics. They are doing their utmost to disrupt the military-strategic balance—that basis of stability in today's world—and to shift it to their benefit. They are constantly launching new rounds of the arms race. They are inventing monstrous concepts of a preventive nuclear strike  or the so-called limited or protracted nuclear war  which they even assert can be - won. They are also reviving the discredited policies of embargoes  boycotts and sanctions. They are using methods of pressure  blackmail  force  aggression  barbarity and genocide wherever circumstances still permit them to do so.94.	The deterioration of the international situation is therefore not the result of forces beyond our control. It is determined by quite concrete deeds of quite concrete Governments  h is consequently the duty of every Member of this world Organization to do everything possible to safeguard reliably and effec¬tively the most fundamental human right—the right to life. The possibilities in this respect are great and the will of the peoples to live in peace is indefatigable. That is why the policy of detente  thanks to the deep and strong roots it has taken  especially in Europe  can and must go on and must continue to bear fruit. This assertion is supported by demonstrable facts.93. First  all the commitments embodied in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki in 1975  remain in force  and to their full extent. They are in no sense archival documents  as some might prefer. On the contrary  they continue to serve as a living code  tested in practice  and as a reliable compass for the policies of the majority of European States.96.	Secondly  important bilateral and multilateral agreements are being carried out. These form a time- tested international legal basis which is an irreplace¬able factor in the construction of a peaceful Europe. Among them let us in particular recall the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union  Poland  the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia with the Federal Republic of Germany  and the four-Power Agreement on West Berlin.97.	Thirdly  the political dialogue between East and West continues in an effort to strengthen the infra¬structure of both European and international detente. The mechanisms established to seek a reduction of military confrontation and to strengthen mutual understanding and confidence in the interest of more reliable stability and security continue to function.98.	Fourthly  the wide-ranging and time-tested mechanism of consultation on each other's positions  which at first sight sometimes are apparently irrecon¬cilable  is being consolidated and expanded in order to preserve and further activate the spirit and letter of the Helsinki Final Act.99.	Fifthly  despite all artificial obstacles and dis¬criminatory measures  Europe-wide commercial and economic co-operation continues. The implementation of the gas-pipeline contract  the biggest project of this century tackling the energy problems of Europe  is the latest example of that co-operation.100.	Sixthly  the dialogue in the fields of culture  education  information and human contacts continues.101.	Seventhly  the anti-war and anti-nuclear move¬ment is becoming a dynamic factor in the European political climate.102.	It can thus be noted with satisfaction that those who are trying to devalue detente have not been successful and are not succeeding now. This valuable asset can undoubtedly be further enhanced qualita¬tively and expanded geographically if responsible statesmen display sufficient political will to do so.103.	The great profitability of the policy of detente and the fact that it is beneficial for all are  after all  best attested to by the example of Europe  that obviously most stable region of our uneasy planet. Thanks precisely to detente  some remarkable and salubrious changes have occurred in Central Europe  where Czechoslovakia is located  in that ancient critical area which has been the epicenter of two destructive world wars. Above all  there is a new awareness that  for the first time in European history  the peoples of our continent have seized the historic opportunity of creating practical conditions for peace  security and peaceful co-operation  and have done so despite all existing political  economic  philosophical and social differences.104.	Czechoslovakia  too  has contributed its share to the creation of this accomplishment  which histori¬cally is completely new. As was already observed at the Helsinki Conference by our President  Gustav Husak  it has helped to create an important element of stability which is in such sharp contrast to the pre-war history of constant conflict and tension  in particular in the central part of Europe.105.	The normalization achieved between Czecho¬slovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany and the continuing fruitful development of mutually advantageous relations based on it have become an important factor in the system of European security. This is true also with respect to the normalization of relations with Austria: since pending questions have been resolved  a rich structure of mutual con¬tacts  including political contacts at the highest level  has been created and peaceful co-operation on our continent has thus been strengthened. Our com¬prehensive co-operation with Finland represents a logical implementation of the Final Act. Our joint search with France for new ways of developing relations also offers hope. Our relations with Greece  the Republic of Cyprus and Luxembourg are unde¬niably of benefit to detente.106.	After many years of negotiations with other signatories to the Helsinki documents—the United States and the United Kingdom—negotiations began immediately after the Helsinki Conference  the question of Czechoslovakia's monetary gold has been resolved. Agreements were signed last January between Czechoslovakia and the United States and between Czechoslovakia and the United Kingdom on compensation for claims and the settlement of financial issues which had encumbered our relations with those countries since the end of the Second World War. In February part of the 18.4 ton gold treasure stolen during the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Hitlerites was returned by Washington and London to Prague. Thus one of the last outstanding issues remaining from the time of the Second World War was resolved and a serious obstacle removed from the path to the normalization of our relations  in particular with the United States. In this  too  we see confirmation of the fact that  given good will on both sides  there are no insoluble problems.107.	In the past we have constantly pointed out the mutual benefits resulting from what we have come to call the materialization of detente. This is borne out by facts. Suffice it to mention that there has been a more than six fold mutually balanced increase in trade between the socialist and the capitalist States in the last 10 years. Czechoslovakia's share in this useful exchange with advanced capitalist countries repre¬sented a trade turnover last year of more than $6 billion.108.	A similar picture is to be seen in cultural  educational and scientific contacts. We have maintained from the very beginning that progress in this field contributes to mutual cultural enrichment and growing mutual confidence. The number of these projects places our country in the top ranks of the participants in the Helsinki Final Act. In the last 10 years our cultural exchanges have doubled in volume. Last year  for instance  this represented 100 000 persons—55 000 of them travelling from Czechoslovakia abroad and 45 000 foreigners visiting Czechoslovakia on the basis of more than 70 existing cultural agreements. We have been organizing numerous prestigious international cultural projects in our country  such as the ""Days of Culture"" of Finland  Belgium  Mexico and Tunisia  or the recent successful ""Days of Culture of the Federal Republic of Germany in Czechoslovakia""—the first such project in the history of the two States—or the ""Days of Culture of Austria in Czechoslovakia"" that are being prepared for next year. In this way we can say that virtually every day the culture of some of the Western participants in the Helsinki Conference is present in Czechoslovakia. Of course  all those are but a few examples of the viability and future- oriented nature of the policy of detente.109.	In the conditions of the nuclear age there is no other reasonable alternative to peaceful coexistence in relations among States. There can be no doubt about the truth of this conclusion. A return to the cold war  confrontation or a flight from the nuclear threat into stone age caves are certainly not Mason- able alternatives. This is the main motive of the search for answers to the key questions of today and tomorrow: How can war be eliminated from the life of society? How can a nuclear catastrophe be averted? How can we assert and develop what we have in common and not what divides us? After all  the high¬est values are at stake here  and Hamlet's ""To be or not to be"" is appropriate  in the sense of whether the most basic conditions necessary for life on this planet will be preserved. In the historic answer to these questions we must not admit a shadow of doubt. Let us therefore answer unequivocally  definitively and resolutely.110.	As was said from the rostrum of the Assembly at the twelfth special session  the second special session devoted to disarmament  the preparation of a nuclear war must be stepped. We therefore fully support the commitment made by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  a commit¬ment contained in the message of the highest Soviet representative  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  addressed to the Assembly at that recent session . We value this highly as a truly historic deed which  if emulated by the other nuclear Powers  would free the world from the danger of the use of nuclear weapons. It is this attitude to nuclear war which we consider to be a decisive criterion when judging the degree of responsibility with which individual States—4n particular the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty organization [NATO] and  above all  the United States—approach the safeguarding of peaceful life on our planet.111.	As for the allegation that this obligation ignores conventional weapons  let us recall that it is precisely the authors of these objections who from the very beginning have been blocking the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations  a proposal which has been on the negotiating table for a number of years.112. Czechoslovakia is emphatically in favor of a complete and definitive liquidation of nuclear weapons  of eliminating without delay the causes of the development of new types and systems of such weapons. We are against their proliferation. Figura¬tively speaking  to eliminate the causes and thus to eliminate in time the risk of destabilizing the strategic situation means in practical terms to do away in the first place with the testing of nuclear weapons. That is why we welcome and fully support the proposal for the speedy conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests sub¬mitted from this rostrum several days ago by the Soviet Foreign Minister  Mr. Gromyko. The conclusion of such a treaty would undoubtedly be facilitated if all the nuclear Powers were now to declare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions  including peaceful ones.113.	We value equally highly yet another new Soviet proposal for invigorating the efforts of States to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and safeguard the secure development of nuclear energy. The General Assembly should qualify the deliberate destruction of a peaceful nuclear facility  even if carried out with conventional weapons  as a nuclear attack and thus  in keeping with the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe this would be qualified as the gravest crime against humanity.114.	We attach exceptional importance to the successful conduct and positive outcome of Soviet- American negotiations on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe. As a central European country directly threatened by existing—and even more so by the Pentagon's envisaged—nuclear missile systems for NATO we believe that it is necessary to follow up the sincere expressions of good will with which the Soviet Union has so significantly encouraged the talks so far.115.	We hold the view that the question of whether progress will be achieved in nuclear disarmament and whether peace can thus be strengthened depends largely on whether Soviet-American agreement is reached on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. That objective can be attained only on the basis of full respect for the principles of equality and equal security  while preserving everything positive that has already been achieved by the two sides in negotiations so far.116.	We are also profoundly disturbed by the devel¬opment of binary and other types of chemical weapons of mass destruction  as well as by the unprecedented  plans of the United States for their deployment in previously unheard-of amounts to the west of the borders of our Republic. The prompt achievement of a ban on these dangerous weapons in the spirit of the Soviet draft of the basic provisions of a con¬vention on the prohibition of the development  pro¬duction and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction is  in our opinion  one of the most urgent tasks of all.117.	We advocate the preparation without delay of a convention prohibiting the deployment of any weapons in outer space  and we fully support the draft con¬vention submitted by the Soviet Union last year/ Further  in the Geneva Committee on Disarmament  negotiations should be intensified on other disar¬mament issues  including the prohibition of neutron and radiological weapons  and agreement should be reached on further concrete measures of disarmament.118.	Sincere and fruitful co-operation among all States in the solution of disarmament questions is today more necessary than ever before. We therefore believe that the consistent implementation of the Declaration on International Co-operation for Disar¬mament  adopted on the initiative of my country at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly remains highly timely and relevant. It is a document which urges States to participate actively in disarmament negotiations and to do so constructively  with initiative  to demonstrate a sincere political will to achieve tangible results in such talks and  last but not least  to conduct those talks on the basis of strict respect for the principle of equality and equal security  to refrain from developing new trends in the arms race and not to misuse disarmament negotiations as a screen behind which to add new spirals to the arms race.119.	As a direct participant in the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe  we have literally a vital interest in their successful progress and  above all  tangible results. We believe that the best way to achieve progress is to proceed without delay with the drafting of the text of the agreement. We are convinced that the proposal submitted by the socialist countries last February provides an equitable basis for that task. We regret that our Western part¬ners are frustrating our efforts by persisting  even in their most recent proposal  in the old so-called asymmetrical model of reduction  which is motivated by an endeavor to gain considerable unilateral military advantages at the expense of the security of the Warsaw Treaty States.120.	We expect that the forthcoming resumed Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will also have important things to say with regard to the solution of the burning issues of disarmament and the reduction of the danger of military confrontation. We wish to emphasize from this rostrum our interest in that meeting and our feeling that it should be conducted in the spirit of a constructive dialogue  should reaffirm the continuation of the process of detente and should reach a success¬ful conclusion as soon as possible by adopting a substantive and balanced final document  including a mandate for the convening of a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. We believe that a positive role in that respect can be played by the constructive proposals of the neutral and non-aligned countries. We very much hope that the results of the Madrid meeting will strengthen the prerequisites for the continuous expansion and creative development of the European initiative in Helsinki.121.	However  we wish to express our concern that the success of the meeting is being jeopardizedby efforts to revive the policy of dealing with the socialist countries from a position of strength and of undermining the very foundations of East-West economic co-operation by heavy-handed and unscru¬pulous sanctions.122.	We have followed with great concern the deterioration of the political climate in various hotbeds of tension. Czechoslovakia firmly denounces the further manifestations of Israeli aggression in the Middle East which are shielded by Washington's political  military and economic support within the framework of the agreement on so-called strategic co-operation.123.	We feel profoundly indignant at the gross intervention against Lebanon which culminated in the recent gory massacre of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians in west Beirut. As one of the members  along with Bolivia  Denmark  Panama and the Philip¬pines  of the former United Nations Commission on Palestine which was established by resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 and which was called upon to supervise the termination of the British Mandate in Palestine and the establishment of independent Arab and Jewish States on its territory—a resolution as yet regrettably unimplemented—we state with the utmost clarity that Israel must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops beyond the internationally recognized borders of Lebanon. The sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and political independence of Lebanon must be strictly respected  as is required by the decision of the recently resumed seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly.124.	As for the overall solution to the situation  the only possible way to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is the consistent observance of the prin¬ciples which correspond to the general norms of international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. These demand the return of all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including east Jerusalem  the implemen¬tation of the inalienable right of the Arab Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State on the territory of Palestine  free from Israeli occupation  on the West Bank of the Jordan and in the Gaza Strip  the safe¬guarding of the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homes or to receive appropriate compensation for the property which they have abandoned  the safeguarding of the right of all States in the region to a secure and independent existence and to development  and the preparation and adoption of international safeguards for the settlement  which could be guaranteed by the permanent members of the Security Council or by the Council as a whole.125.	We note with satisfaction that this position of ours is substantially in accord with the conclusions of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference. These objectives  however  cannot be attained through the compromised Camp David deals  but only by multilateral collective efforts  preferably by an international conference on the peaceful settlement of the situation in the region  with the participation of all interested parties  including the PLO  the sole legitimate repre¬sentative of the Arab people of Palestine.126.	Our indignation continues to be aroused by the anachronism of the policy of apartheid  which has been repeatedly and unequivocally condemned here  as well as by South Africa's continuing acts of armed aggression against Angola  Mozambique and other front-line States; and furthermore by the attempts to hamper  through neo-colonialist maneuvers  the settle¬ment of the question of Namibia on the basis of the full implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. We express our solidarity with the Namibian people in the struggle they are waging under the leadership of SWAPO for self-determination and independence.127.	The proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan are viewed by us as a constructive contribution to a peaceful settlement of the situation in that region. We also highly value the efforts undertaken in this respect by the Secretary-General. In addition  the set of proposals by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People's Demo¬cratic Republic  including the initiative proposing the convening of an international conference to consider the situation in South-East Asia  constitute in our view an important step towards changing South-East Asia into a region of peace  stability and co-operation.128.	We see the withdrawal of a part of the Viet¬namese troops from the People's Republic of Kampu¬chea as an expression of good will and a desire to resolve the situation in that region by peaceful means. We declare once again  most resolutely  that the seat in this Organization rightfully belongs to the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and to nobody else.129.	From the very beginning we have held the view that the continuing senseless conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran can and must be terminated as soon as possible by peaceful meant with respect for the legitimate rights of both parties. We have on several occasions expressed our position on the matter to both sides. We support the peace mediation efforts by the countries of the non-aligned movement.130.	We hold unswervingly to the position that the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and to decide independently on their own fate must be fully respected in Central America and the Caribbean region also. The threats by American imperialism against Cuba  Nicaragua  Grenada and other States of Central America and the Caribbean  like the ruthless suppression of the struggle of the patriotic forces in El Salvador  have no other result than the exacerba¬tion of tension and the endangering of peace in those regions. We sympathize with the efforts of the Carib¬bean States to transform the region into a zone of peace  independence and development.131.	We advocate the settlement of the decoloniza¬tion problem which came to a head this year in the South Atlantic—by means of negotiations on the basis of United Nations resolutions and of the deci¬sions adopted by the non-aligned movement  parti¬cularly the conclusions of the Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Countries  held from 31 May to 5 June 1982 at Havana .132.	We resolutely support the efforts of the Govern¬ment of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea and the with¬drawal of United States troops from the southern part of the country.133.	We continue to favor the solution of the question of Cyprus in the spirit of the well-known United Nations resolutions on the subject. That is the only way to ensure the restoration of the sover¬eignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus  its independence and non-aligned status.134.	We are in favor of settling existing conflicts peacefully and averting potential conflicts. In that context we support the Soviet proposals for negotiations on confidence-building measures in the Far East and the strengthening of peace and security in Asia and the Persian Gulf  and the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion by the States of Asia and the Pacific of a convention on the mutual non-use of force that applies also to the proposals for effective measures to enhance secu¬rity  particularly in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions. The timeliness of those initiatives is underscored by the fact that they are designed to restore health to the international climate in these important regions of the world and thus to strengthen peace in the world as a whole.133. Czechoslovakia values highly the activity of the non-aligned movement against war and for disar¬mament and social progress. We are convinced that by proceeding consistently on the basis of progressive  peaceful and anti-imperialist positions the non-aligned movement can play a significant positive role  parti¬cularly in the current complex international situation.136.	Proceeding from positions of principle  we shall continue to extend our support to the efforts of the developing countries aimed at overcoming the con¬sequences of colonial and neo-colonial rule and bringing about a substantive restructuring of inter¬national economic relations on an equitable  equal and democratic basis.137.	Czechoslovakia  as a socialist State and a member and a strong integral part of the defense alliance of the socialist community of States in the Warsaw Treaty Organization  remains unswervingly faithful to the ideals of peace.138.	We are ready to co-operate with all delegations to ensure that the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly fulfils the hopes which humanity has placed in it and contributes to finding ways of limiting the arms race  halting the dangerous exacer¬bation of international tension  developing detente and building confidence among States with different social systems. in this way alone will it be possible to strengthen and enhance the role of the United Nations in interactional relations and enable it consistently to implement its ideals  thus fulfilling its mandate and meeting the expectations of nations."
"36",1711,"CUB",37,1982,"On 8 October 1967  exactly 13 years ago  revolutionaries and freedom fighters all over the world learned with both grief and indignation that Commander Ernesto Che Guevara  the heroic guerrilla  had been murdered in Bolivia. Today  from this rostrum  where he spoke as a representative of the Cuban revolution  we should pay him the only tribute he would accept  that of following faithfully his example and struggling to achieve true independence for our peoples and to repulse any attempt to rob us of the rights that we have already won. May he continue fighting wherever the children of our oppressed peoples are struggling for freedom and keep working wherever creative efforts are paving the way to development.The Arab peoples have waged a long struggle to win recognition of their right to govern in their own land. As early as 1881 Jose Martel said The brilliant Arabs should at all costs return to Arabia  as though avenging their centuries old oriental drift. He was then referring to the rebellions against European colonial domination and movingly praising the spirit that the Arab peoples brought to their fight. Few struggles  however  have attained such heroic heights and mobilized all the people young and old  women and children as the one that we have just witnessed in the long days of the Palestinian people's struggle against the genocidal Zionist imperialist invasion of Lebanon.At the meeting of the Co coordinating Bureau of the Non Aligned held in Nicosia  during the unforgettable moments of the defense of Beirut  the non  aligned movement  that powerful  independent force grouping nearly 100 States  declared that it was necessary to recognize the Palestinian people's right to establish their own State and return to their homeland. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference expressed itself in much the same terms  and it also insisted on the necessity of recognizing the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The non aligned countries call for the immediate holding of an international conference on Palestine  with the participation of the PLO and all States interested in finding a real  permanent solution to the situation in the Middle East  where the nub  the first step  must be recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.By entering west Beirut  in a gesture of utter disregard for world public opinion and for Israel's pledges to respect the peace agreements  Israeli troops created the conditions for Haddad's murderous gangs to take cowardly advantage of the honorable withdrawal from Beirut of the heroic Palestinian leaders and fighters a withdrawal designed precisely for the purpose of avoiding the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and fall like bloodthirsty savages on the defenseless Palestinian camps. In doing so they relied on the collaboration of Israel  which had responsibility and which set the scene for them and facilitated the carrying out of the slaughter. Hitler would have had much to learn from the madness of Messrs. Begin and Sharon.HO. The Zionist genocide in Beirut is the direct result of the United States Government's policy of force  violence and oppression. Nobody has failed to notice the direct connection and manifest complicity between the crimes committed in Lebanon and the continual United States vetoes in the Security Council  which have convinced the criminal Tel Aviv authorities that they are immune to any political or moral limitations that the United Nations should have placed upon them a long time ago.In his denunciation of this situation to the United Nations contained in a letter addressed to the Secretary General  Fidel Castro  President of the Council of State of the Republic of Cuba and Chairman of the non aligned movement  asked:How long can mankind and all decent and sensible Governments endure this brutal and merciless genocide? What new horrors will be necessary before the aggressors are stopped and their bloody hands stayed? Is not this proof that Israel's rulers are preparing to continue  in defiance of all  to eliminate the Palestinian people  annihilate the patriotic Lebanese resistance and extend their aggression to other Arab States?In the name of the non aligned movement  whose indignation I voice; in the name of the Cuban people  whose feelings of grief and staunch solidarity I represent  I join in the universal demand that the murderers and those who set the tragic scene for them and facilitated this abominable action be punished. It is indispensable that there be at least a political and moral exemplary sanction of all those guilty of the Beirut crime. For crimes against humanity such as this  for a murderous and racist philosophy such as that which motivated these deeds  the criminals at Nuremberg were seated in the dock and sent to the gallows.The time has come for the United Nations to act  and only exemplary  prompt and energetic punishment of those who committed the genocide and their accomplices will save the honor and respectability of our institution before the coming generations and the inexorable judgment of history.The Palestinian leaders and fighters have withdrawn honorably from Beirut  but only to continue the fight for the Palestinian people's inalienable rights until victory is won.Mr. President  we should like to say how pleased we are that you  Mr. Hollai  an outstanding son of the heroic Hungarian people  are presiding over this thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We should also like to express our appreciation for the exemplary work done by the former President of the General Assembly  our friend Ismat Kittani. We greet the Secretary General  the first Latin American to occupy such a high post of responsibility  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tenacious efforts aimed at strengthening and reinforcing the Organization. We are living in a world characterized by a sharpening of tension in international relations  due to the acts of provocation and the policies of arms buildup and nuclear blackmail advocated by United States imperialism. The danger of a nuclear war that would wipe out all the work of mankind grows constantly and hangs like an ominous cloud over man's right to live in peace.All attempts to hide from the peoples the real consequences of a nuclear conflict and make them believe that such a conflict could be limited to a specific geographic area or instil in them the idea that it is feasible to start such a war with the possibility that some Power may emerge victorious  is exceedingly dangerous and incompatible with the vital interests of all mankind. Therefore  it is necessary to continue mobilizing public awareness of the dangers posed by nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction.The arms race has continued its upward spiral  and imperialism keeps on trying to impose policies from positions of strength. In spite of the fact that negotiations have started on strategic weapons  on nuclear weapons in Europe and on the reduction of weapons and military personnel in Central Europe  the United States shows no willingness to negotiate and tries to hide its militaristic plans from the world public and impose them upon its Western European allies.The second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  held midway through this year  was an example of the lack of political will of a group of States to negotiate seriously and constructively to find solutions for the problems of disarmament.The unbridled arms race that some countries are practicing a race which includes attempts to install 572 medium range missiles in Europe  the production of neutron bombs and the establishment of interventionist rapid deployment force constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security and to mankind's very survival.The arms buildup policy is closely linked to the imperialists' plans to impose their dictates in various parts of the world. Thus  on the one hand  imperialism is obstructing the negotiations on disarmament and  on the other  is encouraging and providing political and military support for the reactionary forces all over the world.Thus  besides the concerted aggression of Israel and the United States against Lebanon  other trouble spots are present in the explosive Middle East.Unfortunately  the war between the peoples of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq still continues. As chairman of the non aligned movement  Cuba has made tremendous efforts  together with other countries  to help find a peaceful  just and honorable solution to the conflict. We take this opportunity of addressing this important forum to reiterate our hopes and renew our offer of services to help bring the war to an end for the benefit of both peoples  of other peoples in the region and to prevent the spread and worsening of the conflict.This is also a good occasion for expressing a most energetic protest against the direct and indirect aggressions which United States imperialism has perpetrated against the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and other peoples in the north of Africa engaged in peacefully building their destinies.Concerning Namibia  the United States is ignoring Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as well as General Assembly resolution 36/172 B  proclaiming 1982 the International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa  and is not using the means at its disposal to pressure South Africa into accepting a negotiated and law abiding solution based on the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. In fact  Washington is playing the game of Pretoria which seeks to rob the Namibian people of their victory and true independence.The racist regime of South Africa and its United States allies are insisting on linking Namibia's independence to the presence of the Cuban forces in Angola as an essential prerequisite for arriving at a negotiated solution. But they will not be able to hide the truth of the fact that Angola's independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty have made and are making an important contribution to Namibia's independence. The Cuban internationalist fighters went to Angola to help defend Angola's independence and prevent the spread of the apartheid regime beyond the borders of Namibia; for no other reason.If the Yankee imperialists and partners of the Apartheid regime have been forced to talk about the independence of Namibia  it has been because of the armed struggle of the heroic sons of the people of Namibia  because of the actions headed by SWAPO and because they have failed in their attempts to prevent the independence of Angola.In 1976  the Governments of Angola and Cuba decided to begin withdrawing the Cuban military forces that were in Angola and the number of Cuban personnel was reduced by more than one third. New threats against Angola interrupted this process and even made necessary the return of new forces to replace those which had already left the noble Angolan soil. Other aggressions; by South Africa frustrated similar attempts another occasions. Now  when the racist troops of the Pretoria regime have been occupying a part of the territory of southern Angola for more than a year and are threatening to invade other provinces  the United States Government seeks to present a demand that the Cuban forces should  withdrawn from Angola as a condition  a prerequisite  for the withdrawal of South   African troops from Namibia  as something that would contribute to Namibia's independence.That is why the front line States  at their recent meeting in Lusaka  resolved categorically to reject any attempt to tie the Cuban presence in Angola to the process of decolonization in Namibia  reaffirming in their final declaration that that matter concerned only the Governments of Angola and Cuba.Cuba and Angola stated in February this year that Cuban military co operation with Angola constituted an absolutely sovereign and legitimate act by the two countries and as a result was completely unrelated to the problem of Namibia. They also pointed out that if the selfless struggle waged by SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  and the demands of the international community succeeded in bringing about a real solution to the problem of Namibia  based on strict compliance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and it resulted in truly independent rule and to the total withdrawal of the South African occupation troops to the other side of the Orange River  which would considerably reduce the danger of aggression against Angola  then the Angolan and Cuban Governments would consider the renewal of the implementation of the programme for the gradual withdrawal of the Cuban force within a period of time determined by the two Governments.We can consequently reaffirm here  in the General Assembly that when the Governments of Angola and Cuba so determine  the withdrawal of the Cuban forces stationed on Angolan territory will be effected by virtue of the sovereign decision of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola once all or any possibility of an attack by an armed invading force has disappeared. In this regard  the Government of Cuba reiterates that it will unhesitatingly respect any decision that the sovereign Government of Angola makes concerning the withdrawal of those forces.In view of the evident closing of options for negotiation  SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  has the right to continue the armed struggle to achieve Namibia's independence  with full respect for its territorial integrity  including Walvis Bay  and without the presence of South African troops on its soil.The struggle of the African peoples will inexorably bring to an end the vestiges of colonialism and racism on that continent. The Pretoria regime knows that historically it is doomed. The growing rebelliousness of the black South African masses  led by the African National Congress  shows that the exploited majority is advancing inexorably towards the liquidation of the power of the exploiting white minority. We endorse the decisions to support the ANC adopted by the heads of State at the frontline States at their Maputo meeting in March this year.In Latin America  after nearly a century of imperialist domination  the situation could not be more hopeless for tens of millions of human beings subjected to the most dreadful poverty. Compulsory witnesses of the profits of the local oligarchies and of the transnational corporations  the peoples of Latin America will be carrying on their shoulders a foreign debt which  by the end of this year  will reach the astronomical figure of $300 billion  without counting the $30 billion they will have to pay annually in interest. The indices that measure the living standards of the popular sectors in the vast majority of the countries in our region are falling alarmingly without any restraint. It is precisely this state of permanent inequality that is the main cause of the social revolt that is shaking Central America today.Blinded by stupidity and lack of realism  Mr. Reagan's Administration has rejected dialogue and a negotiated political solution in this explosive area and is preparing the conditions for an armed intervention that would prevent a revolutionary triumph in El Salvador and drown the Nicaraguan revolution in blood. Such is the spirit of the Symons Amendment  passed recently by the United States Senate  preparing public opinion for the United States President's use of all means  including the use of troops  to oppose an alleged Cuban threat in Latin America.The United States Government is engaged in using the armed forces of Honduras as a spearhead against Nicaragua and the Salvadorian patriots  with the aim of legalizing a probable direct intervention by United States forces. The entry of Honduran army personnel into El Salvador and of former Somoza supporters into Nicaragua from camps in Honduras unquestionably means dangerous and definitive steps towards the spreading of armed conflict throughout the Central American regionThus far the Reagan Administration has not contributed to the moves directed to apolitical solution to the tensions in the region. A few days ago  President Lopez Portillo of Mexico and President Herrera Campinas of Venezuela made new proposals which Cuba hopes will produce positive results.If the United States intervenes militarily in El Salvador or Nicaragua  it would lead to the appearance of a new Viet Nam in Central America  because the peoples of Farabundo Marti and Augusto Cesar Sandino will defend their national independence and their right to be Ate until they defeat their enemies.President Fidel Castro pointed out in the letter he sent to Jose Lopez Portillo  President of Mexico  in February this year that:If the Government of the United States the source of all the problems which affect Latin America and the Caribbean today pledges not to attack its neighbors  if it ceases its constant threats  if it stops using its weapons and finances to back genocidal regimes and if it puts an end to its subversive activities  all these being acts which have absolutely no legitimacy  Cuba is willing to co operate in the noble efforts you outlined in Managua to bring about the atmosphere of peace  mutual respect and necessary change in the region  to which we also aspire.Cuba today reiterates its full support for Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. Hard  concrete  stubborn facts have convincingly shown who is who in our continent. When forced to show its true colors the United States  the self appointed arch  defender of Latin America and dedicated architect of the Rio Treaty and of the myth of hemispheric unity against dark extra continental forces  dropped its so called pan American vocation and shamelessly joined forces with England to fall  as Marti would say  with so much greater force on our Latin American lands. At the moment of truth  the institutions built on hypocrisy went down in the Atlantic without the dignity of the crew members of the General.Now  a new awakening of Latin American awareness is the order of the day; a deepening of anti imperialist feeling is spreading through our continent; the peoples are learning daily from history in the making  from the blows they receive and from the experience they acquire; and no propaganda  however sophisticated or subtle  can change or twist the historical positions taken on the facts relating to the Malvinas.Cuba also reiterates its unswerving support for the legitimate struggle that the fraternal people of Puerto Rico are waging to attain full independence and sovereignty. Nothing can keep the peoples from travelling the destined path of their history; like it or not  one day the free Latin American people of Puerto Rico will themselves sing the beloved anthem of their homeland and they themselves will raise their flag with the lone star  free of hypocritical trusteeships and master of their destiny. There will remain in our continent tyrannies that every day spill blood on the road that will lead these peoples to the freedom to which they are and for which they are waging an exemplary fight.We reiterate our firm solidarity with heroic Grenada  which  with unparalleled efforts  is laying the foundations for a new exemplary resistance against the imperialists' attempts to destabilize its economy  subvert domestic interest and frustrate the revolutionary process rooted in that Caribbean island.Cuba supports the aspirations and desires of the Panamanian Government and people in their struggle for implementation of the Canal agreements.We support the right of Bolivia in its historical and just claim to recover its outlet to the sea.Cuba's position is well known on the subject of the negotiated settlement of disputes. We hope that  in the spirit of the necessary strengthening of the relations among the peoples of our continent  the differences over the border limits between Guyana and Venezuela will be settled peacefully  by means of mutually accepted formulas.Cuba supports the independence  territorial integrity and non alignment of Belize.We must also struggle to guarantee peace and stability in South East Asia. The Sixth Conference of Indo Chinese Foreign Ministers was held in July this year; it announced that a summit meeting of those three countries would be held in December and that the withdrawal of a number of Vietnamese troops from the territory of the People's Republic of Kampuchea had been initiated in late July. This shows the three countries' good will in trying to ease the tension in the region through political means. A climate of understanding  mutual respect and security must prevail in South East Asia  and the efforts to begin a constructive dialogue between the parties in conflict should continue.My delegation reiterates its support for the legitimate aspiration of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful reunification of its homeland for which it is absolutely necessary that interference in its internal affairs should cease and that the United States forces of intervention withdraw from the southern part of the Korean peninsula.We support the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in its legitimate rights to live in peace and take its rightful place among independent States. We support the aspirations of the Comoros to regain their sovereignty over Mayotte  the restitution of Madagascar's rights over the Malagasy Islands of Gloheuses  Juande Nova  Europa and Bassas da India  and the just claim of Mauritius to recover Diego Garcia island.The United States continues to increase its presence in the Indian Ocean and to enlarge its military installations in the area  as is the case with the Diego Garcia base  and to block the holding of a conference for making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. This policy is detrimental to security in the region and exacerbates tensions by constituting a threat to the Governments that are striving to lend their national interests.We support the Cypriot people's sustained efforts to preserve its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity in a united and non aligned republic.The efforts and actions that various agencies and the international community are carrying out with regard to the peoples' legitimate demand for a stable  lasting peace cannot be consolidated if we do not devote ourselves seriously and frankly to the constitution and practice of a new system of international relations whose main aspect is the implementation of a fair and equitable new international economic order that does away with the abysmal differences between the poor and the rich countries. This is not a question of alms or privileges; we demand the help of the developed countries so that  by combining our efforts  we may eliminate the differences that separate us.133. The insistence on dealing from positions of strength  from positions of military superiority  is leading the present Republican Administration in the United States to plan increases in its military budget for l983 that come to the astronomical sum of more than $260 billion. By 1986 military spending will exceed $372 billion  or 35.2 per cent of the total United States budget. This harmful trend of the United States Government towards increasing its military spending at an explosive rate will for other States to increase their budgets for the defense of their territories.154. The world is sitting on a powder keg  without any guarantees of security  and the danger increases when the means for exploding it are in irresponsible hands  as unscrupulous as those that led the world of the conflagration of the 1940s. Therefore the struggle for peace is no mere slogan of enlightened forums or Sunday clubs; it is a pressing necessity for the survival of all mankind. We mean by that a peace that is equal for all  in whatever part of the globe they may be. We are constantly striving for those aims  and guided by those criteria. Cuba has made the struggle for peace a fundamental part of its Constitution  and the struggle to preserve peace  to contribute to easing the hotbeds of tension and to prevent the worsening of the international situation is one of the main elements of our international action.The preservation of peace and the struggle for development are component elements of a single ideal  for what peace can there be without development? What peace can there be when the people are hungry and have no pillow to lessen the weariness of their despair? What peace can there be when their children are hungry  and there is no light in their eyes and no future before them?The countries belonging to the non aligned movement and all the other underdeveloped countries have constantly urged that the preservation of peace and the pursuit of development should be aims to be sought simultaneously. We recall that the 1979 Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Arusha  in the United Republic of Tanzania  stated its conviction that real peace was not merely the absence of war but should also establish the conditions for political freedom  sustained and accelerated development for the developing countries and the promotion of the methodical development of the world.Today the situation is much more serious than it was then. Imperialism's aggressive  expansionist and exploitative posture has worsened. The recent events in Lebanon  the conflict in the South Atlantic and continual threats of aggression and armed intervention in the Caribbean have been dangerously added to the use of economic pressures as a weapon of political coercion against the underdeveloped countries that aspire to an independent  honorable life and seek the path of development. At the same time  we note with alarm that never before has the situation of the third world countries been so desperate as it is today  when inflation  monetary instability  blatant protectionism on the part of the industrialized countries  unparalleled indebtedness and the systematic lowering of the prices the third world countries get for their primary commodities are not only endangering their real prospects for advancing towards development within a more or less acceptable time span but posing an immediate threat to the lives of millions of people and the very future of dozens of nations.The United States is maintaining an attitude of clear opposition to the launching of the global negotiations  which are an important instrument for enabling the international community to face in an appropriate manner the serious problems of the world economy.Cuba supports the efforts exerted by the Group of 77 to obtain the launching of global negotiations  which would spur the development of the backward countries  but would also be an effective means of enabling the developing economies to emerge from the constant recession in which they have been for several years.Everyone knows that Cuba has always held the firm opinion that there can be no development without peace and no peace without development. Fidel Castro has reiterated that on several occasions  including here in this Hall during the thirty fourth session of the General Assembly. Therefore  we call on the General Assembly to devote itself to sustained hard work that will contribute to an ever greater extent to making the United Nations a real participant in the process of building the future of the peoples  rather than a mere spectator  watching from the sidelines. Cuba has presided over the non aligned movement during three years filled with complexities  tension and conflicts in international relations. In the midst of the stubborn struggle waged by imperialism and international reaction to paralyze the action of the international agencies and to prevent the third world countries from concerting their plans and positions  the non aligned movement has emerged from those trials as an even more united  more independent and stronger force.Ever since the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries  held at Havana in 1979  our movement has been engaged in active efforts in the most diverse spheres  developing various initiatives of special significance; noteworthy among them are its efforts to mediate in disputes between member countries. During those three years  the movement consolidated a broad programme of co operation  extending the scope of co operation and exchanges of views among our countries.Many meetings were held in the movement's various branches and spheres of action. Noteworthy among its activities were the extraordinary meetings of its Coordinating Bureau at the ministerial level on Namibia  held in Algiers; on Palestine  held in Kuwait; and on the situation in Lebanon  held recently in Cyprus; as well as the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in February 1981; the Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau held this year in Havana; and the meetings of Ministers and Heads of Delegation of the non aligned countries attending the sessions of the General Assembly  for the purpose of coordinating actions and setting priorities among those countries.In spite of the obvious efforts to divide the movement and to boycott the work of its organs especially its Coordinating Bureau and in spite of the direct pressure brought to bear on many of its members  the non aligned movement has given proof of its cohesion  maturity and strength. The tireless struggle for peace  disarmament  an end to the arms race  a new international economic order  respect for the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of other States  renunciation of the use of force in international relations and solidarity with national liberation movements have been important battles fought daily by the non aligned movement.History  as always  has made sure that deceit has been unveiled. Those who declared that in Cuba in 1979 the movement would be split are brought face to face with today's reality: that our movement has increased its dynamism  preserved its original principles and its unity  and extended its action  its strength and its influence in the international arena.Within the framework offered by the present session of the General Assembly we advanced our preparations for the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries  which will be held at New Delhi in March of next year. Fidel Castro  Chairman of the movement  has had to make special efforts to overcome the obstacles that arose concerning the holding of that conference  efforts that brought out the movement's capacities  cohesion and unity  and the outstanding qualities and wisdom of the heads of State or Government of our member countries.The present international situation presents enormous risks for man's survival. We must tackle that situation with determination and firmness: the same determination and firmness with which the heroic Palestinians defended Beirut  the same determination and firmness with which the Vietnamese people defeated imperialist aggression and the same determination and firmness with which the courageous Sahraoui fighters are waging their struggle.The imperialists must abandon their policy of confrontation  threats and aggression. They must know that they will not succeed in intimidating the peoples  which have learned now that firmness is the position of principle to hold in the face of the imperialists.On 26 July 1982  President Fidel Castro stated thatWe are not in favor of wars. We are in favor of peace  in favor of solutions. We are well aware of the consequences a war would have for the world. And the dangers really exist. We are in favor of solutions  and we have said this repeatedly concerning the various hotbeds of tension: solutions for the war between Iran and Iraq; solutions in the Middle East; solutions in Central America  solutions in Angola and in South Africa. Therefore  our attitude is not that of promoting conflicts. However  we are not going to step back even half an inch before the imperialist threats and aggressions not even half an inch."
"37",1757,"CYP",37,1982,"I should like at the outset to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to the high post of President of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly and to assure you of our full co-operation and support. Having known you personally for a long period of time and being in a position to appreciate your outstanding qualities  I am confident that under your most able leadership the Assembly will conduct fruitful deliberations and that it will successfully pursue the many important issues which are pending before it. In paying a well-deserved tribute to you on this occasion  I recall the excellent relations we maintain with your country  Hungary.2.	At the same time I should like to express our sincere feelings of appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  for the exemplary way in which he presided over the deliberations of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and the resumed and special sessions.3.	Almost four decades ago  following the deliberations at Dumbarton Oaks  representatives of 50 countries assembled in San Francisco to draft the Charter of the United Nations  an organization which was established with the objective of saving future generations from the scourge of war. As a culmination of man's historic yearning for peace and justice and having just witnessed the ravages of the Second World War  the founding fathers manifested a new spirit of unity and co-operation in their noble pursuit of upholding mankind's lofty ideals of peace  freedom and justice.4.	As we approach the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the peoples of the world would naturally expect us to renew our commitment to the letter and spirit of the Charter  which should guide our thoughts  our deliberations and above all our actions. A total  unequivocal and unconditional commitment by all States to the principles enshrined in the Charter would undoubtedly contribute to the strengthening of the effectiveness of the United Nations which is so much needed  particularly as regards the paramount goal of promoting international peace and security.5.	It is in this spirit that the Republic of Cyprus is participating in the deliberations of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. We strongly believe in the United Nations and  in spite of its present weaknesses  we trust that the day will come when its principles will prevail all over the globe. We regard the principles of the Charter as the cornerstone of our political credo and the main shield of our security  for we hold that the only assurance of peace and survival is freedom and justice.6.	Beyond the pledges of dedication  however  each new session also gives an opportunity to take stock of the world situation. The attention of the world community is focused on the major problems which are debated here  especially in these days when international peace and security are in serious jeopardy owing to the confrontations and hostilities which we have witnessed this year. The situation is grim and the prospects ominous. Never before since the coming into existence of the United Nations has the world slid into such a predicament.7.	We are in the midst of such a depressing deterioration of the world political and economic situation that the possibility of general conflagration looms menacingly on the horizon. Detente is not nowadays a feature in the international situation. It is the opposite that now prevails. We are living in a world characterized by continuous insecurity and crises  where the use of force is the order of the day. And what is even worse is that aggression  violation of human rights and terrorism remain unpunished and unremedied because of the failure of the Members of the United Nations  and in particular those that are members of the Security Council to give the Council the necessary means for the enforcement of its resolutions. The failure of the United Nations to deal effectively with world problems causes a serious crisis of confidence which erodes the very usefulness of the organization.8.	The remarks of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization are very pertinent  he said:""Certainly we have strayed far from the Charter in recent years. Governments that believe they can win an international objective by force are often quite ready to do so  and domestic opinion not infrequently applauds such a course. The Security Council  the primary organ of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts and its resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so. Too frequently the Council seems powerless to generate the support and influence to ensure that its decisions are respected  even when these are taken unanimously. Thus the process of peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Charter is often brushed aside. Sterner measures for world peace were envisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter  which was conceived as a key element of the United Nations system of collective security  but the prospect of realizing such measures is now deemed almost impossible in our divided international community. We are perilously near to a new international anarchy.""9.	The dismal performance of the international community in the execution of its duty to respect and honour the Charter is portrayed very aptly and clearly by that statement of the Secretary-General. And although the findings of all of us  as set out in speeches before the Assembly  are identical with the conclusions of the Secretary-General  those who wield power do not appear to be willing to take the necessary remedial action.10.	That crisis of confidence was recently further accentuated by the failure of the twelfth special session  the second special session devoted to disarmament  to call a halt to the ever-escalating arms race  and to conform to the directives of the Pinal Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly for the creation of an effective collective international security system  concurrently with disarmament. The Final Document is emphatic and clear in asserting that ""Genuine and lasting peace can only be created through the effective implementation of the security system provided for in the Charter of the United Nations and the speedy and substantial reduction of arms and armed forces"".11.	It has all along been our position that disarmament cannot be achieved in isolation  without simultaneously setting into motion the system of international security through the United Nations. Only after collective security establishes confidence and States are no more victims of aggression  can disarmament be effectively dealt with. Such confidence is at present lacking and  as a result  the arms race continues unabated. The world lives constantly under the threat of a holocaust. Mankind is confronted with new  more sophisticated and more destructive weapons  posing an unprecedented threat of annihilation and extinction.12.	The colossal amounts laid out on armaments is an additional important element of strain and also a continuous drain on the economies of nations. A considerable part of mankind  living under conditions of deprivation and starvation  is compelled to watch helplessly while vast amounts and resources are diverted to the accumulation of deadly nuclear weapons. Thus we have the paradox of man adopting and fostering the means of destruction in his effort to survive.13.	The nuclear arms control talks between the two super-Powers  which were resumed last week in Geneva following their two-month summer recess  justifiably attract the attention of all peoples in all continents  for upon their outcome lies to a considerable extent the greatly desired return to detente and consequently to the securing of conditions for the peaceful solution of international problems. Their success would be a major contribution to peace. That is why Cyprus joins all peace-loving countries in urging that the utmost effort be exerted for their success.14.	The present bleak picture dictates that the state of world affairs cannot and should not remain unchecked. It has consistently been the position of Cyprus that the Security Council should be given the means for enforcement action for the maintenance of peace and security through the availability of a United Nations force  as called for in Article 43 of the Charter. Such a development would act as a catalyst to the arms race and would make the decisions of the United Nations binding in a real sense. We have maintained all along that we should concentrate not merely on the adoption of resolutions and declarations  but also —which is certainly more important—on their implementation. This is an absolute necessity if the United Nations is to perform the task entrusted to it by humanity. Let us listen to the voice of our Secretary- General and commence without further delay the process towards remedying the situation. If we fail to do so  we will not be doing our duty and the very future of the United Nations will be at stake  with the net result that anarchy and chaos will continue increasingly to prevail in the world instead of the rule of law and the principles of the Charter.15.	Recent debates on the question of Palestine and Lebanon brought to the foreground and demonstrated in a crude and tragic way the inability of the Organization to fulfill its paramount responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Ten Security Council resolutions went unheeded whilst the tragic siege of Beirut and the indiscriminate bombing and shelling were going on. The Organization stood literally helpless while the Palestinians were targeted for extinction.16.	In expressing my deep concern in this respect  I made a proposal for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to deal with the question of the implementation of United Nations resolutions. Developments since then  as boldly and clearly elaborated upon in the report of the Secretary-General  have strengthened my conviction that it is imperative that the General Assembly should  as a matter of urgency  consider this question in depth with the aim of producing definite and positive results. While repeating my proposal for a special session  for which consultations may commence  I today propose formally the inclusion in the agenda of this current session of a separate item entitled ""Implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations"" and I have instructed the delegation of Cyprus So enter immediately into appropriate consultations in this respect. I urge the General Assembly to accept the inclusion of this item and to attach to it the importance it deserves. I am confident that a full and constructive debate on this item will result in setting in motion the proper process for finding the right answer to this extremely serious and outstandingly significant issue.17.	The contradictions between the expectations of mankind and the performance of the United Nations are also illustrated by the absence of any meaningful progress in the North-South dialogue for a more equitable distribution of wealth. It would not be an exaggeration to say that ours is a civilization of opulence and abundance and at the same time of famine and deprivation  a civilization of ""haves"" and ""have nots"". While about a tenth of the population of developing countries is exposed to starvation  a quarter suffers from malnutrition and the rest lives in deprivation and destitution  others can spend lavishly and live comfortably. The International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun in 1981  unfortunately failed to remedy that disparity and socio-economic injustice.18.	The perpetuation of the North-South dichotomy  of the highly unbalanced distribution of wealth  not only is a stigma on our civilization but also poses considerable obstacles to any efforts to deal with related political issues confronting the world.19.	Interdependence  which is one of the main traits of the political and economic international life of today  reinforces the need to define the content of the new international economic order and of reaching an acceptable agreement. Our commitment to international peace and security and to the uniform progress of mankind makes us even more determined to work resolutely towards the establishment of the new international economic order.20.	The failure to get the global round of negotiations off the ground so far is disappointing. Despite the fact that certain areas of agreement have been identified  it has not proved possible to reach agreement on basic pre-conditions. But I repeat: we all share a responsibility towards mankind  towards future generations. We cannot let them down. And the responsibility of those who can afford to make concessions to ensure the success of this objective is even heavier. We must redouble our efforts  brushing aside the disappointments and bitter experiences of the past  and strive even harder for success. It is neither simple nor easy to reach solutions based on principles. On the other hand  only such solutions will be lasting and effective.21.	Once again we reiterate our belief that the principles of non-alignment are becoming even more relevant today than when they were first formulated and disseminated. In the light of the realities of today's international situation  the principles of non-alignment provide small countries with the foundation upon which they can build a structure of positive relationships with all countries without being drawn into bloc rivalries.22.	Cyprus  one of the founding members of the movement  is today  21 years later  proud to note that non-alignment has contributed positively to the promotion of peace and to the prevalence of the principles of justice and freedom. The role of the non- aligned movement in international affairs has been consolidated and there can be no question as to its significance. In fact  the purposes of non-alignment as regards detente and the peaceful solution of international problems and its goals of freedom  justice and lasting peace in the world are the purposes and goals of mankind. We Shall consistently follow the policy of non-alignment and shall continue actively to participate in the efforts and the activities of the movement as we have been doing since its inception.23.	Equally  I wish to stress the significance of the continuation of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the application of all the principles and provisions of the Helsinki Final Act  to which Cyprus reaffirms its commitment. Together with the other neutral and non-aligned countries of Europe  we are doing our utmost for the success of the follow-up Conference to be reconvened in Madrid in November  which will substantially contribute to genuine detente in Europe and will enhance the prospects of peace throughout the world.24.	The Middle East crisis continues  confounded and bedeviled as never before  and it will not be solved without the withdrawal of Israel from all the territories it has occupied since 1967 and without the solution of the Palestinian question with the participation on an equal footing of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We hold the view that the Middle East problem is one of the most serious problems facing the world today and threatening international peace  and at its core is the Palestinian question. The inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to dignity and freedom must be recognized. And the aspirations of the Palestinians to the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State must be realized.25.	That has been our consistent and principled position on the Middle East and we shall keep striving within the context of the United Nations  along with the other members of the non-aligned movement to contribute to a just and lasting solution to that problem. It was in line with this brotherly solidarity with the people of Palestine  Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic and the non-aligned movement that we acted as host from 15 to 17 July in Nicosia tothe Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the coordinating Bureau of Non-Aligned Countries on the question of Palestine. In the same spirit  Cyprus participated in the Ministerial Committee formed at that meeting which had a number of constructive contacts aimed at the promotion of the rights of the people of Palestine.26.	We reaffirm our full support for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity of much- tormented Lebanon. The abhorrent massacre of Palestinian civilians  women and children  has appalled and brought unparalleled shock to our people and has underlined the need for effective measures for the protection of all the population in Lebanon.27.	The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran continues unabated  causing much loss of life and property to two countries in the non-aligned movement. This is another tragic example of the inability of the Organization to meet its primary objectives of maintaining peace and security and ensuring the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.28.	There is hardly any other issue in international relations in regard to which the world community has been able to arrive at a higher level of understanding and agreement than the imperative need for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and in particular of its worst manifestation  namely  the odious doctrine of	Yet this abhorrent doctrine is still alive  and so are other practices of racial discrimination  emanating either from internal oppression or from foreign aggressive designs. South Africa  most notably  persists in its defiant attitude towards the United Nations by flouting and ignoring the decisions of the Organization  by denying every single tenet embodied in the Charter and by failing to respect the basic principles of the equal rights of individuals and the self-determination of peoples without distinction as to race  religion or sex.29.	I wish to reiterate once again our solidarity with the people of South Africa  and indeed all oppressed peoples under colonialist regimes and foreign domination who continue to struggle for freedom  equality and justice. We also reiterate our whole-hearted support for the people of Namibia and express our conviction that their just struggle will succeed. To this end it is necessary that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) be strictly and urgently implemented as a whole  to enable the people of Namibia to take its rightful place as an independent State. We also voice again our solidarity with the front-line States in southern Africa and condemn South Africa's acts of aggression against those countries  which are shouldering a major part of the struggle for the eradication of the evil of 	Mf.30.	Despite the formidable achievements and the concerted efforts continuously exerted to bring about decolonization  there are still territories under colonial or neo-colonial rule. I take this opportunity to declare once again that Cyprus fully supports all the efforts of the United Nations for the eradication of the last vestiges of colonialism in various parts of the world  as well as for the adoption of measures aimed against the revival of colonialism.31.	In that context I would mention the case of Western Sahara  where the principle of self-determination has not yet been applied. Contrary to the numerous General Assembly resolutions on this subject  the Sahraoui people have not yet been allowed to exercise their inalienable rights.32.	I do not propose to refer specifically to the many other cases of destabilization  conflict  dispute and Confrontation which are scattered all over the globe. The increase in their number  extent and intensity simply points to the fact that man's future is in the balance.33.	Perhaps in no other United Nations activity do we observe such a degree of discrepancy between the resolutions we adopt and the realities we witness as in the Held of human rights. It is really frustrating and saddening to note the ever-increasing gap between rhetoric and real human attitudes and action. Even more saddening is the helplessness or passivity with which the international community watches mass  flagrant and horrible violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms  unable or unwilling to do anything decisive and effective about it. That is why we should concentrate on ways and means to ensure effective and strict respect for human rights. That is why we should welcome and strongly support the trend which has appeared in recent years towards conventions which have a built-in machinery for the implementation of their provisions. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  are such cases  and they must be followed by others.34.	Cyprus has consistently supported the need for all to collaborate in the establishment of a new world information and communications order based  inter alia  on the free circulation and wider and better balanced dissemination of information  guaranteeing the diversity of sources and free access to information. We maintain that it is imperative to change the dependent status of the developing countries in the field of information and communication  which is an integral part of the development process.35.	We salute the agreement reached on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ' despite some negative votes  after eight years of intensive consultations and negotiations  to which Cyprus made its modest contribution. The importance of this achievement can hardly be over-emphasized. It marks the advent of a new era in which the nations of the world  old and new  rich and poor  from the entire political spectrum  have agreed to set the rules that should govern the use and exploitation of the resources of our common heritage in the seas and oceans. The successful completion of the Convention  which also regulates the many other aspects of the law of the sea  enhances the prospects for international co-operation and makes a very necessary contribution to the prestige of the United Nations.36.	The problem of Cyprus continues to be one of the most serious international problems  threatening peace and security in the sensitive area of the eastern Mediterranean. This situation is yet another example of the inability of the United Nations to act by implementing its own resolutions. Eight years have elapsed since Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and occupied more than 36 per cent of its territory; eight years of agony  after the devastation and pillage  in which all human rights have been and continue to be violated by Turkey; eight years of the crude act of occupation.37.	Cyprus has come through many tribulations during its proud 7 000-year history but has never before experienced such a sinister operation: an operation whereby the occupation is coupled with the systematic attempt to change the demographic character of the occupied part; an operation whereby the indigenous population of the occupied territory was savagely ousted from its birthplace. A birthplace does not belong to any given generation of people. It is perennial in character; it belongs to history. So the aggression of Turkey against Cyprus is not only a present-day violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity: it is also a sacrilegious trespass on one of the oldest recorded histories of the world. The Turkish aggression and occupation brought upon Cyprus many scars which cannot be healed as long as the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity persists  as long as the Turkish army of occupation is on our territory.38.	Eight years have elapsed and we are still trying to trace the fate of more than 1 600 persons  missing since the invading forces set foot on Cyprus. In spite of unflagging efforts  in spite of a number of resolutions adopted by the Assembly  no progress has been made on this purely humanitarian issue. We call upon the international community to make its voice heard more clearly and loudly in Ankara  so that a workable arrangement may be achieved to trace in a proper manner the fate of the missingpersons.39.	I stand at this rostrum once again to convey to the Assembly the protest of the people of Cyprus at the continued Turkish occupation and  in general  at the contemptuous way in which Turkey has been treating the resolutions of the United Nations on the question of Cyprus  and to reiterate our demands for their strict and full implementation. The words of the Secretary-General in his report  which still reverberate in this Hall  were really scathing and severely censorious of those who failed to comply with United Nations resolutions and of those who try ""to win an international objective by force"".40.	The facts with regard to Cyprus are well known to the Assembly. Although we are victims of aggression and occupation  we have mustered all good will in the quest for a lasting solution and permanent peace. The intercommunal talks  which have been going on in Cyprus for a long time  have produced no results of any substance due to the intransigent and negative attitude of Turkey. It is incumbent upon the international community  and particularly those who possess the necessary influence  to make Turkey remove its forces of occupation from  and abandon its sinister designs against  Cyprus and comply fully with the resolutions of the United Nations.41.	Together with my assurances that we for our part shall continue to strive hard for a peaceful solution in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations  I must categorically state once again that under no circumstances shall we accept the results of the crime committed against Cyprus or any solution which directly or indirectly might lead to the division and partition of Cyprus or amount to the abandonment of the inherent rights of the people of Cyprus  such as the right of the refugees to return to their homes and properties. We envisage a completely independent  sovereign  territorially integral  federal  united  demilitarized and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus  in which all citizens  whether Greek Cypriots or Turkish Cypriots or Maronites or Armenians or Latins  will be able to enjoy fully their human rights and fundamental freedoms and co-operate for a happy and prosperous future in peace and freedom for generations to come. Our aspiration is to turn Cyprus Rom a place of conflict into a place of peace  something which would be a significant contribution to the cause of international peace and security. We aspire to turn Cyprus into a bridge of understanding and co-operation between three continents.42.	I have no doubt whatsoever that  if foreign intervention and interference cease and the unity of the country and the people is restored  there would be no problem which could not be overcome. In a genuine desire to ensure lasting peace in our much tormented country  I put forward some time ago the proposal for the total demilitarization and disarmament of Cyprus. I declared that we would be prepared to agree to the stationing in the Republic of Cyprus for as long as necessary  of an international United Nations police force which would supervise a united mixed Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot police force composed in accordance with the population ratio. I reiterate once again my proposal. The Greek Prime Minister  Mr. Papandreou  offered to withdrawfrom Cyprus the small Greek contingent stationed under the 1960 Treaties  provided  of course  that all the Turkish troops are withdrawn  in which case Greece would be prepared to pay for the additional expenses for an increased international force of the United Nations. We support this generous proposal of the Greek Prime Minister  which was set out before the Assembly again in the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece [//f%43.	The time has really come for the international community to act resolutely in order to give effect to its own verdict in regard to Cyprus. This unacceptable situation cannot go on indefinitely. It is because of the lack of any progress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem and because of Turkey's continuous disregard of the relevant United Nations resolutions that we have asked for a new debate on Cyprus by the General Assembly in an effort to employ ways and means and take any steps and measures necessary to promote the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. I call upon the Assembly to act effectively so that a potential source of danger can be removed in the interests of peace and international security and for the sake of the most sacred principles for which the United Nations stands.44.	I fervently hope that mankind will come to its senses before it is too late  before the ""international anarchy"" to which the Secretary-General referred in his report becomes a way of life on this planet with all the grave implications this would entail for the very survival of humanity. We trust that  under the guidance of the United Nations leadership  a new mentality will prevail and that  with the full support and co-operation of each and every Member State  a new era will dawn  not of anarchy and conflict  but of peace  justice and international legal order in accordance with the principles of the United Nations. To this noble objective we for our part pledge our dedication and full support."
"38",1825,"DDR",37,1982,"26.	Comrade President  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you very cordially on your election to your high and responsible office. I am particularly happy about that because your country and the country that I represent have close and brotherly ties with each other. I wish you  as well as the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  every success in the performance of your respective duties. At the same time we wish to convey our thanks to the President of the thirty-sixth session  Mr. Kittani  for the great deftness and prudence with which he discharged his responsibilities in an undoubtedly difficult international situation.27.	The present international situation must give the peoples cause for profound concern. Never since the Second World War has peace been threatened more seriously than today.28.	The policy of confrontation and arms build-up has affected all spheres of life. In many countries  the state of the economy and  consequently  the living conditions for millions of working people  have been rapidly deteriorating  and unemployment and poverty have taken on mass proportions. In situations like that  as history has taught us  there is an increasing temptation to seek a way out of the crises that shake the capitalist system by embarking on military adventurism. It is commonly known by whom wars have been instigated—no matter where and when: by the same forces which today are engaged in an unbridled expansion of military might and the fomenting of conflicts.29.	Sanctions boycott and trade war not only set the development of international economic relations back dozens of years but also thwarts all efforts aimed at restructuring those relations democratically and on the basis of equality. The protagonists of such a policy are out to undermine confidence and destroy all the bridges of co-operation built with great effort as a result of the policy of detente. Worse still  they are sowing distrust  impeding or preventing political dialogue  causing strains in the conduct of international negotiations and disrupting the normal development of international relations.30.	Under the banner of anti-communism they are waging a crusade against all realistically-minded forces in all spheres and by all means. And they stop at nothing to achieve their ends  not even the use of force  prohibited though this is by the Charter of the United Nations.31.	What they are aiming at is hegemony and world domination. And  while both of those goals are illusory  they are fraught with mortal danger  for any attempt to achieve them in practice is bound to push the world closer to the abyss of a nuclear inferno.32.	It stands to reason  therefore  that millions of people in all the continents are joining in the cry for peace and the instant cessation of the maniacal drive for arms. They call for the continuance of detente  based on the beneficial results attained in the 1970s  and they expect the United Nations  too  to meet its great responsibilities in this context by playing its proper part in the preservation of international peace. The German Democratic Republic subscribes to the view that it is necessary to reinforce the protective and pre-emptive ring of collective security which should be our common shelter and the most important task of the United Nations.33.	The challenge flung down to all peace-loving mankind by those bent on militarization must be answered with firmness and determination. The United Nations has a clear obligation to contribute in all its spheres of activity towards the development of peace¬ful relationships conducive to the welfare of the peoples. The Organization offers unique opportunities for States to come to terms with one another. It is legitimate to expect all Member States to make use of those opportunities in the spirit of the Charter. Regrettably  those in certain quarters  including permanent members of the Security Council  have  especially in the most recent past  been making attempts to exclude the United Nations from the settlement of acute problems and to shirk their moral and legal responsibilities under the Charter. The efforts by the Secretary-General to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the Organization on the basis of the Charter are therefore very timely.34.	It is the objective of the German Democratic Republic to help ensure that all the possibilities provided by this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly are used to stem the danger of a nuclear war  end the arms race and achieve agreements on arms limitation and disarmament; to put a stop to ideological subversion and psychological warfare and ensure renewed acceptance of constructive dialogue and peaceful coexistence as the dominant trend in international relations; to defuse international con¬flicts and settle them in a lasting way  that is  on a just basis and by peaceful means; and to overcome the politics of trade boycott and destruction of treaty relations and promote ties of propitious and mutually advantageous co-operation among peoples.35.	The two mutually opposed trends discernible in international relations today manifested themselves with particular clarity at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.36.	The majority of States regard the removal of the danger of nuclear war as the highest priority in inter¬national politics. The numerous proposals of the socialist countries are directed precisely towards this goal. The solemn pledge of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics not to be the first to use nuclear weapons is of historic significance. Could a more convincing demonstration of good will and  indeed  determination to establish peace be imagined?37.	It is not sophistical arguments  but simple yet effective steps such as this that will banish the night¬mare of nuclear annihilation. The unilateral under¬taking of the Soviet Union testifies to the seriousness and continuity of a policy which it has followed ever since its foundation 60 years ago. It is a policy which is inherent in socialism and which inspires the peoples with hope and confidence at this time of tension also.38.	Together with the overwhelming majority of States and in keeping with the aspirations of all the forces of peace  the German Democratic Republic calls upon the other nuclear-weapon States to make analogous pledges. This would be understood and appreciated everywhere in the world as a sign of genuine readiness to head off the danger of war.39.	Such action would in fact be decisive in initiating the adoption of joint measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. Unfortunately  the necessary readiness is so far lacking. And  while many of the participants in this year's special session on disarmament were trying hard to identify ways of achieving concrete disarmament measures  the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  just as they did in Washington at the time of the first special session on disarmament  decided at their summit in Bonn to strengthen their military potential even further. They are pushing ahead with preparations for the deploy¬ment of United States medium-range missiles in Western Europe from 1983 on and speeding up the implementation of their long-term arms program. The line followed by a number of States at the second special session on disarmament reflected that policy -small wonder  since those who on the Potomac River are busily adopting plans for the achievement of military superiority can hardly be expected to agree at the same time on the East River to measures to outlaw war.40.	At the present session the General Assembly can draw on a large number of concrete proposals which were put forward by socialist and non-aligned coun¬tries at the special session on disarmament. The German Democratic Republic feels that there is a pressing need for the adoption without delay of measures to freeze nuclear weapons  put a compre¬hensive ban on nuclear-weapon tests and prohibit the neutron weapon.41.	At the same time  it emphasizes that doctrines on the feasibility of fighting  limiting and winning a nuclear war are inhumane and hostile to the very concept oflife. Such doctrines are designed to accustom the public to the concept of nuclear war and war generally and to make it seem a legitimate means for achieving political ends.42.	On 8 February of this year it was decided in Washington to escalate further the build-up in the chemical weapons field and to start the manufacture of new systems  such as binary weapons. In the light of this development  an instant and comprehensive ban on all types of chemical weapons is an imperative.43.	The German Democratic Republic advocates the speedy drafting of a relevant convention along the lines of the basic provisions of a convention for the prohibition of the development  production and stock¬piling of chemical weapons and on their destruction  proposed by the USSR at the second special session on disarmament.44.	One point  though  should be stressed here. The heavy responsibility for the preservation of peace forbids such negotiations being abused  for instance as an excuse to escalate the arms drive.45.	In my country  therefore  the public reacted with indignation when it was reported on 20 July of this year that the United States had gone so far as to formalize its decision not to participate any more in the trilateral comprehensive nuclear-weapon test ban talks in Geneva. The German Democratic Republic proposes to the General Assembly at this session to take a step in the direction of spurring progress in the Held of disarmament and arms limitation by reaffirming the political and legal duty of States to negotiate on these vital issues for mankind in an honest manner and in good faith. And here I repeat something that has been said before: in our contemporary world  peace requires not lip-service but actions which must be concrete and have the support of all States.46.	The German Democratic Republic is open to  and will back up  any proposals  no matter by whom provided only that they can help achieve substantive progress.47.	Flourishing international economic co-operation is advantageous for all parties involved. It enhances international security because it is the basis of a shared interest in calm and stable relationships. The start of economic warfare  on the other hand  destroys not only the fabric of international economic co-operation but it destroys the structure of international relations generally. The losers on this policy of sanctions  which is contrary to international law  are  not least  those who are—more or less compliantly—helping to put it into effect.48.	It is a task for the General Assembly to stimulate constructive co-operation in all areas  to combat neo- colonialist practices and to strengthen the economic independence of States. It is equally necessary to prevent colonialist exploitation  in whatever guise  being used to shift the burdens entailed by the arms build-up and the crises on to the peoples.49.	No forum is more suited than the United Nations  by patient effort and on the basis of equality  to discuss and determine global economic problems affecting the interests of all. Likewise suited for this would be the proposed round of global negotiations on international economic questions.50.	It can  at the same time  be instrumental in the democratization of international economic relations as provided for in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States adopted by the Assembly in reso¬lution 3281.51.	The German Democratic Republic welcomes the fact that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea this year has been able after nine years of undoubtedly difficult negotiations  to complete and adopt the Convention on the Law of the Sea.52.	The German Democratic Republic regards the earliest possible signing and ratification of the Con¬vention by all States as a duty which should be fulfilled in the interests of stabilizing the rule of law on the oceans as well as for the sake of peaceful co-operation and detente.53.	The consequences of the imperialist arms build¬up leave no region of our globe unharmed. In Europe  detente and the proved policy of searching for reason¬able compromises are to be replaced by fomentation of tension and expansion of the whole range of means for waging cold war and a shooting war.54.	However  the future of the European peoples  like that of all other peoples  can be made secure only if military confrontation is lessened and the concept of a peaceful synthesis of interests accepted as the rationale of political action.55.	A few weeks from now  the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is to resume its proceedings. The German Democratic Republic believes that it will be both necessary and feasible for that meeting to wind up its work with results that are aimed at preserving and reinforcing the basic elements of European security and co-operation. My country is a reliable partner in the steadfast pursuit of that objective. That is why the German Democratic Republic was quick to express support for the call by the foreign ministers of Europe's neutral and non-aligned States that fresh efforts be made to ensure a successful conclusion of the Madrid meeting. The convening of a conference on confidence- building and security-building measures and disarma¬ment in Europe is still the primary task; in fact  it is a test of the readiness of the participating States to carry on and lend fresh momentum to the process mapped out in the Final Act of Helsinki of 1975. Those who have already shown that they have deserted the road of Helsinki  no matter under what pretext  and who are bent on increasing the intensity of con¬frontation still further by provoking a failure of the Madrid meeting  are taking a heavy responsibility upon themselves.56.	The solemn signing of the Helsinki Final Act by the heads of State or Government of the participating countries came after years of negotiations conducted with a great deal of patience. Time and again divergent interests had to be reconciled and mutually acceptable solutions ironed out by way of consensus. Should all this hard work have been in vain  and should this whole process  the fruitfulness of which has been recognized by the peoples  be sacrificed for the selfish interests essentially of just one country?57.	Attempts are being made to give the impression that a conference as authoritative and representative as that of Helsinki was an everyday affair. It is perhaps fit and proper to recall the great input of effort in the 1970s  for especially now in a time of acute interna¬tional tension much depends on whether  at the dividing line between the two social systems and their military coalitions  peaceful co-operation  in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act  that is co-operation in the interest of life itself  can continue.58.	In this context  the relationship between the two German States is  no doubt  of significance. By working consistently for normal relations between the two German States  on the basis of the relevant agreements and in strict respect for sovereignty and equality of rights  the German Democratic Republic contributes towards stable security on the European continent.59.	The meeting which the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic had with the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany in December 1981 has confirmed the accuracy of the following conclusions. First  especially in a time of political tension  the conduct of businesslike dialogue  based on the pursuit of a peaceful synthesis of interests  is not only necessary but also feasible. Secondly  if such dialogue is to yield results  it must be based on the principle of sovereign equality and on strict non¬interference. Thirdly  if such dialogue is to benefit the people  the interlocutors must focus their efforts on the paramount issue of our time—the guarantee of lasting peace—and  of course  political dialogue presupposes realism and a sense of proportion. Fourthly  and finally  political dialogue also requires the awareness of the parties that good-neighborly relations cannot prosper in the shadow of new missiles intended for use in a nuclear first strike.61.	It would be of great significance for European security-because of the resulting encouragement-if the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe could at last be crowned with success. The German Democratic Republic and the other socialist participants have expressed readiness to reduce their forces in Central Europe and also their respective weaponry  on the basis of reciprocity. The NATO countries object to that. As has been mentioned here earlier  even unilateral advance concessions like the withdrawal of 20 000 Soviet troops and 1 000 tanks from the German Democratic Republic have been answered by the other side with a build-up of its military potential and the announcement of plans to move the United States troops in the Federal Republic of Germany still closer to my country's border  that is  to the dividing line between the Warsaw Treaty and NATO countries.62.	Whether in Vienna  Geneva or elsewhere-the proposals of the Western side are invariably aimed at gaining unilateral military advantages. This approach is a careless one  but ignoring that attitude would be even more careless.63.	The policy of strength and the intensified arms build-up have resulted in an exacerbation of interna¬tional conflicts and encouraged aggressors to flout the right of peoples of self-determination.64.	In the Middle East  another sovereign country  Lebanon  has become a victim of the aggressor. The Palestinian people and their legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  are to be physically destroyed. It would be possible to put a stop to the genocide in Lebanon  to the still con¬tinuing systematic extermination of the Palestinian people patterned after the worst Fascist atrocities  quite simply by forcing Israel to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions. In actual fact  however  the aggressor is receiving political and military support under an agreement on so-called strategic co-operation.65.	Intrigues  lies  cynicism  brutality and terror -one would not believe it  but that is what makes up the internal posture of that regime. It is to be wel¬comed also that among the Israeli people themselves more and more forces are speaking out against this. Israel's leaders and those who support them here also at the United Nations cannot by any means absolve themselves from their guilt.66.	The German Democratic Republic demands the immediate withdrawal of Israel's troops from Lebanon and from all other occupied Arab lands. Its support is for the Palestinian people who  under the leadership of the PLO  are fighting so courageously for self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign State of their own.67.	The latest pertinent proposals of the Soviet Union point out the path towards a lasting solution of the Middle East conflict. They accord with the points considered by the Arab States at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in Fez to constitute the elements for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.68.	The time has long been ripe for compelling South Africa to end its illegal occupation of Namibia and to cease its aggression against Angola. AH relevant decisions of the United Nations  in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  must be complied with. At the same time  it is necessary-and the majority of States in the Organization will watch carefully- that effective steps be taken against all attempts to despoil the Nairobian people of their independence and their right to self-determination by means of neo-colonialist maneuvers. The German Democratic Republic is committed to a policy of steadfast solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization and the Namibian people. As regards the People's Republic of Angola  which is the target of persistent acts of aggression by South Africa  my country is maintaining close links with it in accordance with a treaty of friendship and co-operation.69.	Inside South Africa  the regime is intensifying its terrorism against the majority of the population Cannot be reformed. In the interests of humanity and peace  its roots must be tom out completely  so that it will disappear for ever. This calls imperatively for the immediate cessation of any kind of support-political  economic or military- extended to the South African regime by some Western countries and transnational corporations.70.	States in the region of the Indian Ocean have been making great efforts to achieve the establishment of a zone of peace in that region. The German Democratic Republic is committed to a policy of promoting those efforts.71.	On the other hand  the expanding imperialist military presence  the greed for bases and the im¬perialist war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan are making ^he situation still worse. The convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean must not be delayed any further if peace and security in that region are to be strengthened.72.	In South-East Asia every attempt is being made to call in question the right of the Kampuchean people; to determine their own political status and to choose their own road to development. The methods employed range from direct intervention and economic and political pressure to the setting up of a so-called coali¬tion Government ' outside the country. This contrasts with the constructive proposals which the States of Indo-China have made for strengthening peace and co-operation in South-East Asia and which have our full approval.73.	The German Democratic Republic also supports the proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the solution of the Korean question  including the demand for the withdrawal of the United States troops from South Korea.74.	In the Caribbean and in Central America  on¬slaughts by imperialist forces on the freedom and independence of the peoples of that region are on the increase. In particular  a vote in the United States Senate of 11 August 1982  which is designed to open up possibilities for the use of military force against socialist Cuba  a member of the non-aligned movement  has resulted in a dangerous deterioration of the situa¬tion in the region and endangers world peace. The German Democratic Republic supports the efforts and constructive proposals by Cuba  Nicaragua and Mexico  made with a view to normalizing the atmo¬sphere in Central America and the Caribbean  and believe that they can lead to a more stable peace and enhanced security.73. As regards the conflict in the South Atlantic  the German Democratic Republic favors a settlement based on the Charter of the United Nations and the resolution adopted at the Ministerial Meeting of the Co-coordinating Bureau of Non-Aligned Countries in Havana in June 1982.76.	The German Democratic Republic reiterates once again from this rostrum that it feels strongly about the need to solve the question of Cyprus in accordance with the Charter and the pertinent United Nations resolutions aimed at maintaining the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. Indispensable prerequisites for such a settle¬ment are the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and the cessation of all kinds of interference in the island country's internal affairs. A representa¬tive conference on Cyprus under United Nations auspices could  no doubt  help pave the way to a life in peace for the people of Cyprus.77.	A world in which peoples can live together in peace needs the fostering and propagation of the great humanist ideas of international understanding. But warmongering and hatred against other peoples or races have already reappeared and are once more poisoning the international atmosphere. In fact  as a result of the politics of threats and resort to force  they find ever new breeding ground. If  as the Charter requires  such Fascist and neo-Fascist activities imperiling world peace are to be brought to an end  as they must be in the interest of peace  effective action by both the Organization and its Member States individually is imperative.78.	So it is evident that the present international situation must worry the peoples. The danger of a thermonuclear war which is facing mankind lends ever greater urgency to the task of implementing the Soviet proposal to call a special series of meetings of the Security Council at the highest level.79.	All States will have to make a choice. To opt for the policy of peaceful coexistence is to make a choice for life  for progress and for a peaceful future for man. This policy corresponds to the interests of the people of the German Democratic Republic and they will not deviate from that course. The German Democratic Republic will unswervingly continue the building of a socialist society and make every effort within the framework of the community of socialist States to advance the cause of peace  detente and international co-operation."
"39",1843,"DEU",37,1982,"I convey to the President Mr. Schmidt's and the Federal Government's congratulations on his election. At the same time  I should like to thank the President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly for his good work during that session.100. The Federal Government also conveys its best wishes to the Secretary-General. He is faced with great and difficult tasks. As we have seen  he tackles those tasks with great skill and resolution and with a sense of reality which also embraces an awareness of the great influence that an international organization like the United Nations and the Secretary-General are able to exercise on political events. During the first year of his term of office  he has already rendered great services through his exemplary dedication to the cause of strengthening the image of the United Nations and preserving peace worldwide.101. The conflicts throughout the world have not become fewer but have increased. They have become fiercer and more Moody and a greater threat to world peace. Thousands of people have become the victims of military and internal confrontation in Lebanon  Afghanistan  the Persian Gulf  southern Africa  South Asia  the South Atlantic and Central America.102.	Hunger and want are growing in a word in which nation’s economies are feeling the impact of a con-tinuing recession—to the limits of their capacity and no small number of them—even more seriously. Every day people lose their jobs; people in North and south  in East and West alike  are increasingly concerned at how things are to continue. This  too  poses a great threat to international co-operation  not only to domestic harmony but also ultimately to international peace.103.	At the same time  armories are overflowing with deadly weapons of an inconceivable destructive power. The arms spiral appears to be never ending  and many people fear that it could turn faster and faster and finally get completely out of control. In 1981 world-wide spending on arms and other military equip¬ment fbr the first time exceeded $600 billion. This corresponds to 6 per cent of the world's total gross national product. It amounts  per capita of world population  to expenditure of over $100 per annum  yet many people in the world do not even possess $100.104.	In 1980 expenditure on arms production world¬wide was many times greater than the total value of all official development aid provided by the indus¬trialized nations  and  according to estimates by the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co operation and Develop¬ment  the members of the latter spend about 10 times as much on armaments as on development aid and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance countries even 100 times as much. These facts prompt one to question the sanity of the international community. Through our conduct we are all involved in this collective insanity; we must all try to master it.105.	The second special session of the General As¬sembly devoted to disarmament became the mouth¬piece of the fears of our nations. Its voice was heard  but it has still not carried far enough.106.	Governments must indeed face up to the question of whether they have until now lived up to their responsibility for world peace. They have to accept the urgent and very anxious question of whether the weapons systems that are accumulating can ultimately be controlled by man; they must also face up to the question of how they intend to justify annually increasing investment in arms in view of the hunger and want existing in the world  and in view of the growing hardship caused 6y the economic crisis.107.	As Chancellor Schmidt said at the 10th meeting of the twelfth special session  the second special session devoted to disarmament the driving force that has become apparent in the unrest of many of our fellow citizens must be regarded as a motivation and a moral obligation for us.108. It is not sufficient to ascertain the causes of the threat to peace  nor is it sufficient to develop mere ideas on how to eliminate them. What is also needed is a firm and resolute will and ability to reach agree¬ment on better ways and means of safeguarding peace.109.	As Pope John Paul II said in his peace message at the beginning of 1980:  Without the readiness for a sincere and lasting dialogue there can be no peace.  The safeguarding of peace is a never-ending task. It is an illusion to believe that peace is a condition that can be arrived at once and for all and then preserved and to believe that the causes of threats to peace can be eliminated permanently everywhere. These causes become more numerous every year. Our constant and unflagging efforts are needed to limit them  to try to defuse them  to establish effective rules for co-operation and hence prevent the interna¬tional community from relapsing into self-destructive anarchy.110.	People speak of crisis management. By this they mean the attempts to detect as early as possible individual major or minor crises  to curb them resolutely and effectively and  if possible  eliminate them completely. This is indeed a necessary  sincere and undoubtedly highly difficult task  serving the purpose of safeguarding peace.111. We must not content ourselves with this  how¬ever. We do not need just crisis management; what we need is a realistic peace strategy. For this we require a return to the principles of the Charter  to the norms of international relations which the United Nations has established and to which we have all committed ourselves.112.	We must take seriously the precept of the renunciation of force or the threat of force in interna¬tional relations. This comprehensive proscription of force  enshrined in the Charter  outlaws any form of attack and applies to the use of all types of weapons. Our aim must be to prevent all conflicts and to renounce the use of all weapons. In its declaration at the summit meeting on 10 June 1982  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [M4 TO] reaffirmed that none of its weapons world ever be used except in response to an attack.113.	We must create peace through respect for the independence of all countries  respect for genuine non-alignment and respect for the right of all nations to self-determination.114.	We must create peace by establishing greater security for all countries. If we see security policy as a policy for world-wide peace  as indeed we must  we must also realize that security cannot be established through rivalry  by constantly satisfying exaggerated security needs through further arms build-up  by aspiring to supremacy  or by provocative and ulti¬mately dangerous gestures to indicate one's strength. AH this simply results in an expansion of the armories on all sides.115.	Greater security for all countries will exist only if we  by collaborating across alliance frontiers and ideological barriers  strive for agreed security  for codified equilibrium at the lowest possible level.116.	An arms race cannot lead to equilibrium and stability; only agreed arms control and disarmament are conducive to that goal. They must be supple¬mented by a policy of dialogue and co-operation among States  both regionally and worldwide. For precisely that reason  existing links and contacts must not be disrupted but must be maintained  particularly in difficult times. A lack of communication leads to mis¬interpretations of the other side's intentions and hence to wrong action being taken.117.	But peace can be lasting and dialogue and co¬operation have substance only if our own interests are defended with moderation and restraint  if the other side's interests are perceived and acknowledged as well and if calculability and reliability prevail. Further¬more  peace in the world can be safeguarded in the long run only if the gap between the rich and the poor does not become even greater and we try to eliminate it through genuine partnership between North and South. To this end  one of our most important tasks is to prevent the world economy from falling apart  which would not only result in the poor becoming even poorer but also constitutea threat to peace  perhaps even as great as the accumulation of weapons threatening human life.118.	When the then Federal Chancellor  Mr. Willy Brandt  addressed the General Assembly  at the twenty-eighth session  as the first representative of the Federal Republic of Germany he said  we have come to assume our share in the responsibility for world affairs on the basis of our convictions and within the framework of our possibilities . We have honored that commitment over the years.119.	Located in the heart of Europe  we have many neighbors  in East and West  in southern Europe and in Scandinavia  and we want to be a good neighbor to all of them. As a member of the European Community and as a partner in NATO we are helping to preserve and strengthen peace and stability  par¬ticularly in Europe.120.	We declare our full support for what the Danish representative  speaking as its President  stated at the 8th meeting  on behalf of the European Community. The European Community and the way its member States live and work together will always provide con¬vincing proof that a lasting peaceful order based on the closest co-operation and partnership is indeed feasible  even in a region where for centuries there have time and again been rivalry  confrontation and war.121.	The European Community and NATO are based on firm  shared interests and on identical concepts of democracy and freedom. A policy of good-neighborliness  however  must be effective also beyond ideo¬logical  military and strategic frontiers.122.	Germany is a divided country at the interface between East and West. Confrontation between East and West harms us Germans most of all. Co-operation with the Soviet Union  Poland  Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and the treaties concluded with them have been beneficial to us and others. They have created a modus Vivendi that has rendered the situation in Europe stable and made peace there more secure. This policy was made possible only by the existence of NATO and its defense capability and by the Federal Republic of Germany's contributing fully to NATO.123.	We intend to adhere to that policy of co¬operation  but we have to admit that East-West tension has increased. The reasons for this are the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  the events in Poland and in particular the Soviet arms build-up. In particular  the Soviet build-up of intermediate-range nuclear weapons poses a deadly threat to us.124.	Afghanistan  a small nation  has now been holding out for three years against a highly armed invading army. The continuing fighting has exacted a high toll of lives. Over 20 per cent of the Afghan population has now fled its home country. The situa¬tion in Kampuchea is similar. We demand an end to the use of force and an end to the suffering; we demand peace and self-determination tor the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples.125.	The Federal Government has been following the developments in Poland with very deep concern. We expect Poland to settle its internal affairs on its own without external interference and to return—as pledged by the Polish leaders themselves—to a situation without martial law and without internees and par¬ticularly to a dialogue with the trade unions. There can be no stabilization in Poland while the present deadlock continues.126.	I should like to add this. Germans and Poles have both endured much suffering in the past. They have not always treated each other justly  and we Germans know that the Second World War started on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland. Both sides have nevertheless—or perhaps precisely for that reason—shown courage and a readiness for under¬standing. The Warsaw Treaty in particular and the agreements of 1975 are testimony to this. I am both pleased and proud that this readiness for understanding is quite clearly not confined to the Governments  for millions of Germans has expressed in a tangible manner and on a very large scales their heartfelt readi¬ness to help. Although the treaties were initially an important act between Governments  I feel that now especially the Polish people  in the oppression they are suffering  have become conscious of our desire for reconciliation.127.	Precisely at this time when East-West rela¬tions have become more difficult we want to do every¬thing possible to ensure that there will not be a policy of confrontation. For us Germans in particular there can be no such confrontation. Our purpose is  as the Bonn Declaration of NATO of June 1982  states   to develop substantial and balanced East-West rela¬tions aimed at genuine detente .128.	Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and General Secre¬tary Erich Honecker  at their meeting at Lake Werbellin on 13 December 1981  reaffirmed their conviction that war must never again originate on German soil. But Germany also must never again be devastated by war. All Germans are  therefore  particularly aware of the obligation to help preserve peace in Europe. At a time when East-West relations have become difficult  German-German relations must not give rise to addi¬tional strains. We shall therefore endeavor to keep these relations in as good a condition as possible and to improve them wherever feasible.129.	The Federal Republic of Germany  which urges respect for the right to self-determination everywhere in the world  demands this right for the German people as well. It therefore remains our political aim to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self- determination. We realize that this goal cannot be attained in the short term. It is therefore all the more important to seek improvements in our relations through dialogue and negotiation.130.	The policy of concluding agreements has also proved valuable for Berlin. Detente and conflict management have had a positive effect in this context in particular. Strict observance and full application of the Quadripartite Agreement of 2 September 197 P remain the most reliable guarantee for a continuance of its stabilizing effects.131.	The Federal Government continues to regard economic co-operation with all countries of the world as a major factor of international stability  also and in particular in relations with the East. A continuous trade war waged to achieve political goals would be both unwise and ineffective. It is of special concern to us in this context to be and to remain a reliable party to agreements. Existing agreements must be honored also in difficult times for which they are intended as well.132.	In about a month's time the deliberations of the follow-up meeting in Madrid to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will be resumed. We attach particular importance to that meeting. For us  the process of that Conference remains an essential facto: for shaping East-West relations and for pro¬moting disarmament and security in Europe. The people in Europe have derived tangible benefits from the Helsinki Final Act/ although their hopes have by no means been fully met. Setbacks can occur in a long-term policy for safeguarding peace. They are a bitter experience for those affected. But precisely then it is essential to use the instruments available and try to return to a policy of reason. Implementation of all parts of the Final Act  as we demand  can make a major contribution towards improving East-West relations and stabilizing peace in Europe. In Madrid we are aiming at a precise mandate for a conference on disarmament in Europe as part of a balanced final document.133.	A decisive step for safeguarding peace in Europe was taken last November when the dialogue between the two super-Powers was resumed and talks on intermediate-range nuclear forces commenced at Geneva. Let me add a remark in this context. In the present difficult phase of East-West relations  it would be good—of this Chancellor Schmidt is con¬vinced—if the two leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union could have direct talks with each other.134.	The Bonn Declaration of NATO reaffirmed the central elements of our security policy  namely  deterrence and defense capability  on the one hand  and disarmament and arms control  on the other. Disarmament and arms control are vital issues and an integral part of our security policy serving the cause of peace. It is essential to give our peoples the con¬fidence that our security policy can indeed safeguard peace. It is not sufficient to talk about disarmament. People in East and West alike want to see tangible results at last.135.	In his recent state of the nation address  Chancellor Schmidt quoted General Rogers  the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe  who said:  I am convinced that the only pathway to a future for the kind of world we want leads to the negotiating table. We must negotiate on disarmament and arms control  on all kinds of forces and weapons. This is the only way to stop the arms race on both sides.136.	On the basis of the comprehensive proposals on arms control and disarmament negotiations made to the Soviet Union by the United States of America at the NATO meeting in Bonn  we support the idea of purposive  persevering and intensive talks aimed at achieving concrete results. First  we want a genuine reduction in strategic nuclear weapons in East and West. The American proposals for substantial reductions in the Soviet and American arsenals of strategic weapons by means of strategic arms reduction talks have aroused new expectations worldwide of a turning-point in disarma¬ment policy. We welcome the fact that those two coun¬tries are endeavoring at Geneva to negotiate not only on limitations but also on substantial reductions of their intercontinental weapons.137.	Secondly  we want land-based intermediate- range nuclear missiles to be eliminated. The proposal made to the Soviet Union by the United States at the Geneva talks that both sides completely renounce a category of weapons regarded as a particular threat by them holds out the prospect of a major first step towards disarmament and hence of eliminating the threat felt by us in Europe owing to the build-up of Soviet intermediate-range missiles. These negotiations which are being resumed in Geneva today are especially important to us.138.	By ratifying the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons resolution 2373  we Germans have undertaken never to possess nuclear weapons. The Federal Government therefore feels all the more justified in demanding time and again that the nuclear Powers  too  honor their commitments under the Treaty.139.	Thirdly  we want a codified comprehensive ban on all chemical weapons. My country  which for years now has committed itself to this question with particular dedication  recently submitted realistic and acceptable proposals for reaching agreement on reliable means of verifying compliance with a treaty banning chemical weapons. I appeal to all Members of the United Nations to examine those proposals carefully.140.	Fourthly  we want the force levels in Central Europe to be reduced. Europe has the world's largest concentration of mutually opposed conventional armed forces. Progress at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduc¬tion of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe is therefore of particular impor¬tance to us  living as we do at the centre of this region.141.	Furthermore  a conference on disarmament in Europe must agree on confidence-building measures for the whole of Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals  which serve to make military potentials and activities in Europe more transparent and help to reduce in the long term not only mutual fear but also the danger of unintentional military escalation.142.	Our special responsibility in Europe  in the European Community and in NATO does not mean that the Federal Republic of Germany can remain indifferent to crises in other parts of the world. On the contrary  we know that  just as developments in Europe would quickly have effects on other regions of the world  problems in other parts of the world  how¬ever distant  can also have direct repercussions for us. We not only witness these repercussions but we also feel them physically  especially in view of the fate of the people directly affected.143.	The Federal Government is following the developments in the Middle East with particular concern. The assassination of the Lebanese President-¬elect  Bashir Gemayel  and the horrifying massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps have once again rendered the achievement of peace in the Middle East more difficult. The Federal Government  like itsEuropean allies  strongly condemns these criminal acts  ft demands effective measures to protect the civilian population  as well as an independent inquiry. It hopes that the renewed deployment of a multina¬tional force will help to put an end to the violence and murders. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country must be restored as quickly as possible  along with its constitutional institutions. This requires the swift withdrawal of all troops stationed in the country against the will of the Lebanese Government. The Federal Government also hopes that all political forces in Lebanon will unite to reconstruct the country and that  by exercising restraint; further acts of violence can be prevented.144.	Peace and stability in the Middle East can be ensured only through a comprehensive  just and lasting peace settlement. Such a settlement requires the participation of all parties in the region  including the PLO. It must be based on the principle of security for all States in the region  including Israel. It must be based on justice for all peoples  including the Pal¬estinians  who are entitled to self-determination. Finally  it must be based on mutual recognition of all the parties concerned.145.	The Federal Government therefore welcomes the new initiative by President Reagan as an important step to reconcile the rights of the parties concerned. The Federal Government has also noted with satisfac¬tion that at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  almost all Arab countries for the first time agreed on a policy founded on peace between all countries in the region. The Federal Government appeals to every¬one concerned to seize the opportunity for a new start and make every effort for a comprehensive peace settlement.146.	The policy of suppressing the black population in South Africa and of racial discrimination is not only a grave violation of human rights. It could also lead to internal confrontation with destructive effects for the country and the entire region.147.	Namibia must at last acquire its independence in 1983 through free elections on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Lasting peace in Africa can only be expected if the countries of this continent are able to determine their lot on their own and free from pressure by alien Powers. The presence of foreign troops impairs any efforts to resolve conflicts by peace¬ful means.148.	The Federal Government welcomes the pro¬posals by the President of the Republic of Korea to reduce the tension h his divided country through dialogue and negotiation and to bring about the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea.149.	The Federal Government urged a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the South Atlantic from the very outset. We welcome the first constructive steps aimed at normalizing relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina. A permanent solution to this dispute can be found only through political dialogue and political negotiations.150.	One of the prime goals of the Federal Govern¬ment continues to be to maintain its long-standing  close and good relations with Latin American coun¬tries. The Federal Government feels that the forth¬coming admission to the European Community of Portugal and Spain can help strengthen the Com¬munity's relations with Latin America even further.151.	We strongly support efforts to ensure that all countries respect the principle of non-alignment. We seek to promote and safeguard non-alignment through our development policy based on partnership. The Federal Republic of Germany encourages regional co-operation in the third world which serves to strengthen stability  independence and peace.152.	The Federal Government also fully supports efforts designed to secure world-wide implementation of the principle of the renunciation of force and of curbing the arms race  as well as agreements on confidence-building measures. It also directly backs up such efforts with initiatives of its own. We hope that the United Nations will take up and develop further our proposals for a code of conduct on confidence-building measures  which we submitted at the second special session devoted to disarmaments We expect the international symposium on confidence- building measures scheduled to be held in the Federal Republic of Germany next year to provide further impulses for the development of such measures  which constitute an instrument of peace policy of world¬wide importance.153.	Since the beginning of the last session of the General Assembly many thousands of people have had to flee their home countries or have been expelled from them. We must not permit a situation in which millions have to leave their countries temporarily or even permanently to seek refuge elsewhere. The basic consensus on the need for suitable preventive meas¬ures achieved at the last session represents i first step towards improving co-operation between coun¬tries and international institutions to avert new flows of refugees. We should preserve this consensus. The Group of Governmental Experts on International Co¬operation to Avert New Flows of Refugees should take up its work as soon ac possible.154.	In view of the numerous violations of human rights throughout the world  it is not sufficient to profess good intentions. We must continue to work seriously and with perseverance to improve the international protection of human rights. The Govern¬ment of the Federal Republic of Germany deems it necessary to establish an international court of human rights for this purpose  and we attach particular importance to our initiative on the world-wide abolition of capital punishment. We know that  owing to dif¬ferent legal traditions and religious convictions  many countries may view this question different^. We advocate  however  that countries which desire the abolition of capital Punishment should say so  also internationally  and they should say it clearly and in a way that binds them.155.	The world economy is in poor health. This poses a grave threat to stability and peace. At the same time  the prospects of eliminating hunger and want are more unfavorable than ever. Against the background of high interest rates there is a continuing recession in industrial countries. Unemployment rates are rising as a result. We are also witnessing a decline in interna¬tional trade and growing protectionist pressure. These developments are detrimental to us all  particularly the countries of the third world.156.	As a result of lower commodity prices  a con¬tinually high burden caused by the cost of oil imports and high  fluctuating interest rates  developing coun¬tries' opportunities for borrowing are limited. High debt-servicing charges are a strain on their economies  stretching them to the limits of their capacity  or even beyond in some cases. Industrial and developing coun¬tries must co-operate in a spirit of partnership in order to restore stable growth and development in the world economy. The existing international organizations  such as the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and the Word Bank must be kept effective.157.	Another major task will be to preserve free trade and capital flows. No country should ignore the commitments it has assumed under GATT. Anyone who jeopardizes GATT aggravates the world's eco¬nomic depression.158.	Furthermore  in view of falling commodity prices we need a world-wide system to stabilize export earnings.159.	We shall of course seek to increase our official aid further within the limits of available funds. Despite the difficult economic situation  considerable bud¬getary problems  a decline of 0.3 per cent in its gross national product and a high deficit on current account  the Federal Republic of Germany provided official aid worth 7.2 billion deutsche marks in 1981  or 0.46 per cent of our gross national product—its biggest amount yet.160.	However  in this situation the developing coun¬tries will themselves have to make even greater efforts. Economy  a prudent use of available capital and a cautious debt policy are called for. Develop¬ment policy will have to be focused on particular fields  above all the promotion of agriculture in the third world  since this is the sector that determines the economic growth and the food supply of many third world countries.161.	Emphasis must also be placed on the energy sector. For many developing countries the costs of energy supplies have become an almost intolerable burden. Consequently  this is a priority area of develop¬ment aid afforded by the Federal Republic of Germany. It is in our view also a contribution to the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and uti¬lization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy  adopted by the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy.162.	Environmental protection must also be seen as an important area of co-operation and we must prevent man from destroying the basis of his own existence by recklessly polluting the environment and exhausting valuable resources. Much important work has to be done in this respect.163.	Finally  we must not forget that the growth of the world population can overtake and nullify all our efforts to ensure greater international economic stability.164.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has made an historic attempt to develop an international regime for the use of the world's oceans. The Federal Government played an active and constructive part in this. Admittedly  the results have not lived up to our expectations in every respect. In addition to certain satisfactory provisions  there are arrangements on future deep-sea mining which make it hard Mr us to decide in favor of signing the Con¬vention. We find it most regrettable that the Con¬ference was not able to produce results capable of commanding a consensus. The Federal Government will take a decision on whether to sign the Convention after careful consideration and close consultation with other participants in the Conference.166. It is of decisive importance for co-operation in good faith between industrial and developing countries that the dialogue between North and South should not be disrupted. We have unanimously decided to conduct global negotiations on the subjects of raw materials  energy  trade  development  monetary matters and finance. Together with its partners in the European Community  the Federal Republic of Germany urges that these negotiations be started now. At the economic summit in Versailles a constructive position on a resolution on the commencement of global negotiations was formulated and has since been endorsed by all the member countries of the Organ¬ization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Agreement must now be reached on the early com¬mencement of global negotiations167. All too often in past decades the hopes placed in the United Nations have not been fulfilled. But we must not overlook the fact that the United Nations can be no stronger than the political will of all its Members to work together responsibly in the spirit of the Charter. Those that prefer voting on short-term goals and one-sided resolutions instead of endeavoring to achieve compromise and consensus are blocking the way to genuine negotiations in this forum168.	I welcome the spirit of bold candor and realism with which the Secretary-General described the state of the Organization in his report. I also welcome his constructive proposals for improving the work of the United Nations and the part played by the Security Council. My Government will actively support efforts to that end.169.	One of the central tasks of the United Nations is  as before  to make an effective contribution towards safeguarding world peace. Its capacity to do so must be enhanced  and better use must be made of the existing instruments for this purpose.170.	The foreign policy pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany is and will always be a policy for peace. We follow this policy in collaboration with our partners in the European Community  which is an outward-looking association alive to its responsi¬bility in the world  as well as in the alliance with the United States and Canada.171.	Our peace policy is one of continuity  based on the conclusions we have drawn from our own history and conditioned by our situation as a divided country at the interface between East and West. This peace policy enjoys wide and broad support in all sectors of our population. It cannot be discarded at will. Our paramount task is to preserve peace. It is not enough to dispel fear. We must also counter the dangers threatening us worldwide. As the German philosopher Immanuel Kant said  Peace is not a natural state; it has to be established and worked on continuously.  To do so  we must make full use of our powers of reason  of our political and moral responsibility and of our determination. We must not believe that what is true is on one side of the mountain and what is false is on the other  as Pascal put it. Since the threats are global  global rules of conduct must apply. This is the spirit that imbues the Charter of the United Nations. Only by acting in this spirit will we be able to pursue an effective strategy for the safeguarding of peace."
"40",1881,"DJI",37,1982,"I take great pleasure in congratulating  on behalf of my delegation  the President on his election to preside over this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his qualities as an experienced diplomat and his deep faith in the principles and purposes of the Charter will enable him to direct the work of the Assembly successfully. I should also like to pay tribute to the President's predecessor  Mr. Kittani  of the fraternal country of Iraq  for the outstanding way in which he led the work of the last regular session as well as of the special sessions. I also take great pleasure in paying a particular tribute to the Secretary-General for his constant efforts to promote international peace and security. My delegation is pleased to express to him its appreciation of his struggle to preserve the principles of the Charter and to strengthen international solidarity for the progress and development of mankind.229.	The thirty-seventh session of the general Assembly is being held at a time when the international situation is steadily deteriorating. The harmful world conditions that we are experiencing encourage the super-Powers to acquire zones of influence and make their rivalries ever sharper. The super-Powers are using their economic  scientific and technological advances to achieve their objectives and designs.230.	In this atmosphere of constant tension we remain concerned and alarmed at the escalation of tension which is creating several flashpoints in many parts of the world  especially in the third world.231.	In spite of the constant efforts of the international community in the quest for peace  we are every day confronted with increasingly sophisticated wars  wars of attrition and of the annihilation of nations. Never before in history have there been so many wars in third world countries  with such great human  financial and material losses. It is as if by some master plan they are intended to exchange the natural resources of developing countries and prevent them achieving their economic take-off.232.	It is an act of treason towards that part of mankind living in wretched circumstances to tolerate the useless waste of incredible quantities of financial  scientific  technological and human resources  when two thirds of the world's population are doomed to live in dire poverty  suffering grave economic difficulties and social imbalance. Moreover  there are a large number of refugees on all the continents  half of them in Africa. Those refugees often come to an environment where they still have to struggle to satisfy their most basic needs-food  medical care and shelter.233.	What human wisdom can allow for such waste  whose only purpose is the destruction of all the best that world civilization has been producing for the good of mankind? We cannot separate acts leading to the waste of such immense human and material wealth from those which are delaying the establishment of a new international economic order.234.	International economic relations are experiencing in our time a grave crisis  which is becoming an obstacle in negotiations between the rich and poor countries  a number of which-the least developed countries-are living in precarious conditions. It is up to us to exchange new ideas and co-ordinate our efforts with a view to striving together towards a better life.235.	After eight years of hard work the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea achieved its objective. The adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea constitutes a land-mark in the history of mankind. The success of the Conference has enhanced the prestige and credibility of the United Nations  which can be an effective framework for dealing with all questions of vital importance to all States and the international community.236.	The political climate and security in the Indian Ocean area has gravely deteriorated recently. The littoral and hinterland States are worried about the increase in tension in the area  as a result of the rivalries of the great Powers. There is an extremely urgent need to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  pursuant to resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 12 December 1971. The situation of insecurity and instability prevailing in the Indian Ocean requires the speedy holding of the relevant conference in Colombo.237.	Since its independence the Republic of Djibouti has expressed its devotion to international peace and security. The objectives that it has set itself are national unity  equality and peace.238.	In accordance with our foreign policy  based on dialogue and co-operation  we have chosen to live in peace with our neighbours  with absolutely no interference or intervention. Our neutrality is reflected by a policy of non-alignment  good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence. We urge our neighbours to settle any disputes peacefully  for we remain convinced that peace and stability alone can guarantee the emancipation of peoples. Moreover  we urge all leaders in the Horn of Africa to struggle for the creation of the right circumstances to foster tolerance  understanding and confidence among the peoples of the region.239.	We attach great importance to regional and interregional economic co-operation  and we are prepared to take an effective part in those efforts  in accordance with the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Development of Africa' and the Charter of National Economic Action  adopted at Amman.240.	In spite of its economic difficulties and its meagre resources  the Republic of Djibouti takes in a considerable number of refugees. The situation has worsened because of the devastating consequences of a prolonged drought  which has displaced a third of our population who have lost all means of subsistence.241.	The Republic of Djibouti has embarked on comprehensive programmes of revitalization and modernization of existing sectors of the service economy as well as on the creation of a sound basis for a productive  diversified economy through the development of new sectors in industry  agriculture  animal husbandry and fisheries.242.	My Government  which has decided to use every means available to extricate itself from its socioeconomic difficulties  appreciates the assistance and aid of friendly countries to help in achieving those objectives.243.	After 34 years of bloody wars  34 years of sacrifices  34 years of tireless and uninterrupted efforts  the international community has just reaffirmed its support for the Palestinian cause  by declaring that no just and lasting solution can be achieved without recognition of the legitimate  inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. It is with that in view that concrete proposals for an overall peaceful solution have been formulated.244.	Unfortunately these peace efforts are still pitted against the political ambitions of the Zionists  who wish to relegate the Palestinian cause to historical oblivion so as to promote their expansionist policy. The Zionists do not wish to accept or tolerate any talk of national rights for Palestinians; they wished to bury the natural aspirations of an entire people under the ruins of Beirut. In order to do that the Zionist war-lords unleashed the most devastating and the most bloody aggression against Lebanon  using the most sophisticated weaponry  with the avowed intention of annihilating the Palestinian people  of liquidating the PLO and destroying its organizational structure.245.	For more than two months Lebanon has been subjected to the most merciless destruction. Beirut  besieged  deprived of water  food  electricity and medicines  constantly bombarded from land  air and sea  has undergone an ordeal which no city has experienced since the Second World War.246.	During the first half of this century the Nazis  in their wanton campaign for racial superiority  arrogated to themselves the right to determine who should live and who should be deprived of life. They institutionalized terror and mass killing as means of achieving that goall.247.	In the second half of this century the Zionist neo-Nazis have espoused a similar concept  although more limited in scope. They wish to eliminate the Palestinian people from the land where they have always lived. For the Zionists  Palestine was a land without any people awaiting the arrival of Jewish settlers to colonize it. History has been falsified; the physical characteristics  the demographic composition and the institutional structures of the occupied territories are being altered so as finally to leave no trace of the Palestinian heritage.248.	In spite of that and in defiance of the aims of the Zionist plan  the Palestinian reality asserts itself more each day  because the Palestinian people  under the aegis of the PLO  its sole  legitimate representative  has shown its unshakable determination to struggle for the life of its cause.249.	Strengthened by that determination  Arab Kings  Sovereigns and heads of State were at one in making it crystal clear to the world that just and lasting peace has always been their objective  an objective that Israel has rejected and continues to reject  wishing to deprive an entire people of its existence and of its identity.250.	In Fez  the Arab leaders agreed on concrete and realistic proposals aimed at restoring a just and lasting peace in the region. These proposals  contained in what is now called the  Fez Charter   have created a legal framework which  without the slightest doubt  has aroused hoper in the international community  which is determined to find a solution to this painful problem.251.	As usual  Begins response was to order the massacre of children  women and old people. Once again  in defiance of international public opinion  Israel has revealed its true face. Once again Begin dashed the hopes of all peace-loving countries and peoples by organizing the genocide at Shatila and Sabra. These Zionists have unfortunately made us relive a tragedy which history wished to bury at Nuremburg and which we thought had been removed from our memories for ever.252.	In the face of this situation which threatens international peace and security  in the face of this genocide which definitely could not have been carried out without the  assent and support of a great Power  in the face of this holocaust of which the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples are that victims  we reaffirm that a just peace cannot be established without the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  without the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the borders of Lebanon as well as from the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem.253.	Lebanon  whose only crime was to grant asylum to the Palestinians who  because of Zionist terrorism  had had to flee from their national land  must never again be the scene of these wars and massacres. The international community must help Lebanon to regain its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and in its reconstruction.254.	We note with deep concern the continuation of the Iraq-Iran war  in spite of the efforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  by the non-aligned movement and by the United Nations.255.	We hail the positive initiative taken by the Iraqi Government in withdrawing its forces to the internationally recognized borders as a sign of a desire for peace and we appeal to these two countries to settle their dispute peacefully.	'256.	The situation in South Africa and in Namibia remains of concern. Tensions and confrontations will not be eliminated nor will peace be established in that region so long as apartheid is not dismantled and the black majority in South Africa is not liberated. Apartheid must be condemned without hesitation  and all political  diplomatic  moral and material means must be provided to the liberation fronts. The peoples of South Africa and of Namibia are entitled to use all means-including armed struggle-against the practices of segregation  racism and racial discrimination  genocide and exploitation.257.	We strongly denounce the policy of baniustanization being carried out by the Pretoria regime. We condemn also the criminal acts of terrorism and the acts of armed aggression against independent neighbouring countries. We state that the front-line countries have the legitimate right to protection against the repeated acts of intimidation and aggression perpetrated by the South African regime  whose sole purpose is to destabilize those States so as to weaken their moral and material efforts to assist the peoples of South Africa and Namibia and their national liberation movements.258.	The Pretoria regime has clearly demonstrated its belligerence by accumulating arrangements and other means of oppression  by acquiring a nuclear capability and by continuing political  military  economic and cultural Collaboration with Israel.259.	It is regrettable that South Africa  despite repeated appeals by the international community  continues to practise apartheid in defiance and flagrant violation of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.260.	The question of Namibia remains unsolved because of the illegal occupation by the South African regime  which is denying the Namibian people the exercise of its inalienable rights to self-determination and independence  in spite of United Nations resolutions. This gravely threatens international peace and security.261.	Through its political  economic and military activities the racist Pretoria regime is trying to delay Namibia's accession to independence. The policy of collaboration with the apartheid regime of South Africa can only harm and betray the legitimate struggle of the Namibian people to obtain its freedom.262.	It is up to the United Nations to ensure that its decisions are respected by South Africa. The United Nations must alert the international community to South African manoeuvres designed to upset the peaceful initiatives under way for Namibian independence.263.	We applaud the initiatives taken by SWAPO  the sole representative of the Namibian people  to facilitate the negotiations under way  as well as its constant readiness to take part in free and fair elections in Namibia in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.264.	The Republic of Djibouti believes Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to be the only acceptable basis for negotiations on Namibia's peaceful transition to freedom and independence. We  sincerely hope that all the parties concerned will make a concerted^ co-operative effort to ensure implementation of that resolution.265.	As regards the issue of Western Sahara  my Government supports the efforts of the OAU to promote a just and lasting solution and also welcomes the measures taken to organize a referendum to enable the population of Western Sahara to express itself freely and democratically in the exercise of its right to self-determination.266.	Although we support the principle of self-determination for the Sahraoui people  we assert that the decision of the heads of State and Government of the OAU taken in Nairobi is the only authentic one.267.	Without unity  Africa beset as it is by economic difficulties and social instability-will remain a prey to foreign influences  political blackmail and economic exploitation. Lack of un ty will lessen the ability of the independent countries of Africa to assist those which are still under the sway of colonization.268.	For a long time now Chad has continued to be the scene of fratricidal wars that have destroyed its human and material resources and endangered its unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We therefore urge all the forces concerned to enter into a constructive dialogue and to make a common endeavour. We believe that to be the only way that hostilities can be halted and order  peace and security restored. We hope that the United Nations and the OAU will work together to achieve that goal and will help in the reconstruction of Chad.269.	As regards Afghanistan  my Government expresses its great concern over the military occupation of that country despite the repeated appeals of the international community for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces. We reiterate our appeal for an immediate and total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan so as to enable its people to exercise its right to elect a government of its choice. We advocate an overall political solution based on full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.270.	The situation in Kampuchea is a problem of concern to my Government  which is firmly opposed to foreign armed intervention and to the presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea. The presence of foreign troops makes it impossible for the Kampuchean people to express its will through free elections. We therefore reaffirm the imperative need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. '271.	With reference to the question of Korea  my Government firmly believes that inter-Korean negotiations constitute the only political means of solving all the problems that have arisen out of the political division of that country. The earliest possible resumption of the dialogue is essential to deal with the urgent need to reduce the climate of tension  renew mutual confidence and establish lasting peace in the Korean peninsula  which might finally lead to a solution acceptable to the Korean people.272.	We are convinced that the United Nations remains the most appropriate forum for voicing our ideas  because all of us here share the same concern and undertake the same efforts to preserve the noble ideals of the Charter  indeed  to defend the Charter of the United Nations is to defend the cause for which millions of people have perished; it is to defend the cultural and political expression of human dignity.273.	Unfortunately  at the present time the world is beset by grave crises which  if not solved  could threaten peace and security. The crises are especially dangerous because they seriously diminish the United Nations system's ability to act; moreover  they challenge the ideals on which the Charter was based.274.	We have in mind here the Shatila and Sabra massacres;	which has been made into a political alternative; and the occupation of countries by force. Is not threatening and shooting innocent people in camps and treating people as subhuman the sort of thing that prompted the creation of the Organization on the morrow of the last world war?275.	In conclusion  I wish the Assembly every success at the thirty-seventh session. Members may be assured of my delegation's positive contribution. For my part  I remain convinced that all the nations represented here will fulfil their responsibility by responding to the hopes of the millions of people who are looking to us."
"41",1946,"DNK",37,1982," I have the honor of addressing the Genera Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its Member States  in this capacity I take pleasure in con-gratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of this Seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.37.	I should further like to express the Community's appreciation to the outgoing President for the leadership he has shown en so many occasions during the past year38.	The 10 Member states of the European Com¬munity also wish to congratulate the new Secretary- General  now attending his first regular session of the Assembly. His tireless efforts in pursuit of peace during his first year in office have already—and justly— brought him worldwide attention. The Secretary-General's strong committee  to upholding the pur¬poses and principles of the United Nations is brilliantly demonstrated in his report on the work of the Organ¬ization  which is thoughtful and thought- provoking. We  the countries of the world  would do well to heed his advice that as an important first step we should consciously recommit ourselves to seeking negotiated solutions to the world's many problems by adhering strictly to the Charter of the United Nations.39.	The world today presents a bleak picture. It is becoming increasingly difficult to remain optimistic about the future. Grave conflicts have continued to take place in many parts of the world in the period that has elapsed since the thirty-sixth session. The threat remains that local and regional conflicts will escalate to the global level. The world is in the grip of the worst economic recession in decades. All nations  and in particular the developing countries  risk jeopardizing the hard-won achievements made through international co-operation. Fundamental human rights are being increasingly violated in many parts of the world. This combination of challenges which the international community is facing today calls for determined action and constructive co-operation. The situation requires something more—and something other—than each nation working to solve its own problems. Wisdom and statesmanship are required if we are to meet these challenges. We must admit that interdependence inescapably characterizes the world today. We must learn  as the Secretary-General so rightly puts it in his report  ""to differentiate between short-term advantage and long-term progress  between politically expedient positions and the indispensable objective of creating a civilized and peaceful world order"".40. The United Nations provides the framework and the forum for accommodating and reconciling our interests if we accept the implications of our inter¬dependence. We must make a determined effort to use the opportunities available to us. We must seek peace¬ful settlement of the disputes that divide us. We must employ the available international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. And we must devote ourselves to the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world.The European Community and its 10 member States pledge their full co-operation in achieving these fundamental goals. We believe strongly that we have a role to play and a contribution to make in this great endeavor. We wish to make our contribution in fruitful participation in collaboration with the nations of world. We understand and support their desire to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also re-organize that genuine non- alignment r an important factor in maintaining interna-tional stability and can make an important contribution to bringing about political settlements of the conflicts which threaten the world.42.	The European Community also strongly believes that through co-operation and partnership we can come to grips with the problems of inequity which plague the world economy. We shall pursue our efforts in these fields with vigor and look forward to building the partnership based on mutual trust which is neces¬sary to achieve these important goals.43.	Serious setbacks in East-West relations have been a major element in the deteriorating international situation during recent years. The past years have brought new and disturbing violations of the prin-ciples on which the United Nations is based. The continued occupation of Afghanistan  with the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to pursue its aims by use of its massive military potential  has contributed to the creation of a climate of distrust and tension.44.	The tragic events in Poland since last December  which have taken place under pressure  have also had a major negative impact on overall East-West rela¬tions. These events  taking place in the heart of Europe  cause deep concern among the Ten. The Ten have repeatedly called for the lifting of martial law  the release of those arrested and the restoration of a genuine dialogue with the Church and Solidarity. The Ten will continue to urge the Polish authorities to live up to their declared intentions of re-establishing civil liberties and the process of reform in Poland as rapidly as possible.45.	To halt the present negative trend and develop substantial and balanced East-West relations aimed at genuine detente  the causes underlying the negative developments in East-West relations should be removed in order to restore respect for the principles of the Charter and the Helsinki Final Act to ensure mutually advantageous co-operation through dialogue and negotiations. We have already shown our readi¬ness to contribute to a positive development of East- West relations and we urge the Soviet Union to demonstrate a similar inclination.46.	There is at present much popular concern about world tension  the use of force by some countries in contravention of die Charter and the imbalance in both nuclear and conventional weapons. This situation creates international mistrust and public anxiety. The latter manifests itself in many ways States where freedom of expression is guaranteed. The Govern¬ments of the Ten recognize arid understand these concerns. We have no doubt that similar concern is felt by the peoples of States where  regrettably  open expressions of popular feeling about the build-up of armaments and the consequent burden on faltering altering economics have so far been suppressed.47.	A few months ago the Member States met for the second special session devoted to disarmament. Governments and peoples all over the globe had looked forward to this event in the hope that it would lead to a fresh impetus in the process of disarmament and thereby to the reduction of armaments and to huge military expenditures. The results of the session were disappointing. However  the Ten consider it very important that the consensus principle was upheld. Furthermore  the session unconditionally confirmed the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly the first such special session  in 1978. The views presented at that session will form a useful basis for future dis-cussions and negotiations. It is also noteworthy that at the second special session devoted to disarmament the Assembly agreed to continue the process initiated at the first special session.48.	The member States of the European Community will make every endeavor to help accomplish this important task. They will continue to support all constructive proposals which lead to reductions in armaments and to the banning of certain types of weapons  and which enhance confidence and assure the security of all nations. In this respect the Ten strongly support efforts of a substantial and realistic nature made in the sole negotiating body  the Geneva Committee on Disarmament  and in other forums.49.	The Ten welcome the negotiations initiated this summer between the United States and the Soviet Union on mutual reductions of nuclear strategic arms. These negotiations will undoubtedly be difficult. We hope  however  that they will result in an early agree¬ment on substantial reductions of these weapons.50.	We welcome also the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate- range nuclear forces  negotiations which are taking place within the framework of the strategic arms reduction talks. It is well known that these weapons are of special concern to us. We hope that the negotiations will lead to concrete results in the near future.51.	Parallel with arms control and disarmament in the nuclear field  substantial reductions in the con-ventional field must be pursued vigorously.52.	As regards central Europe  efforts to establish a real balance at a Cower level of forces between East and West have been pursued in Vienna since H73  but progress has been slow. However  the Ten note that in the view of Western participants the prospects of an agreement have increased following the presentation of new and concrete proposals in Vienna. Their implementation would lead to significant reductions and thereby contribute to a more stable relationship between East and West and to the strengthening of peace and security in Europe.53.	Furthermore  the Ten have declared themselves in favor of a conference on disarmament in Europe on the basis of a precise mandate to negotiate in a first stage militarily significant  binding and verifiable confidence-building and security-building measures applicable to the whole of Europe.54.	Efforts at improving East-West relations should not be restricted to arms control. There is an equally great need for a comprehensive East-West dialogue on other subjects  both political and economic. The process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a most important channel for this dialogue. The Ten sincerely hope that it will be possible  when the Madrid follow-up meeting within the CSCE process reconvenes in November of this year  to reach agreement on a balanced and substantial concluding document. Such a document should mark tangible progress within the human dimension of the Conference and contain a precise mandate for a con¬ference on disarmament in Europe. In the opinion of the Ten the draft submitted by the neutral and non-aligned countries remains a good starting-point for the negotiating process in Madrid.55.	Since the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and following events in Lebanon  which are only the latest element in a chain of violence and counter-violence in the area  the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated further. During the last few months problems relating to that situation have occupied the Security Council repeatedly  as well as the General Assembly. The danger to international peace must be evident to all of us.56.	The Ten recall their vigorous condemnation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. We are horrified by the terrible suffering and damage which have been inflicted upon Lebanon and its civil population. A large number of innocent men  women and children have been killed or wounded. Many thousands have been made homeless. We are especially shocked and revolted by the massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut. The Ten have strongly condemned this criminal act. An authoritative inquiry into the circumstances of this incident is clearly necessary.57.	The Ten reaffirm their solidarity with a friendly country whose population has suffered so cruelly and whose fragile stability is dangerously threatened. They are confident that the Lebanese people will be able to bring about national reconciliation. The presence of certain of their members in the multinational force established at the request of the Lebanese Government in line with the objectives of relevant Security Council resolutions bears witness to the attachment of the Ten to the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government. They renew their offer to assist in the relief and reconstruction of the country."
"42",1991,"DOM",37,1982,"I should like first to express to Mr. Hollai on this occasion my sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the distinguished office of the President of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly and also to extend our congratulations to the other members of the General Committee. The presidency of the General Assembly constitutes a singular honour to the Member State that occupies it  as well as to its regional group. My delegation also congratulates Mr. Kittani  who presided over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with great success. My delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose experience and hard work in the service of the United Nations have already been clearly demonstrated  and represent for the countries of the American continent a source of legitimate pride and satisfaction. The report which he has submitted to the General Assembly is brilliant  and is proof of this; of the many documents that the Organization produces  only a very few are as important as this call to reflection. His words not only enumerate the great problems that oppress the world  but also propose solutions to these grave and multiple problems. With the sincerity and emotion essential to the task of considering the fate of peoples  the Secretary-General has made recommendations that do not shrink from criticism of and alternatives for the action of bodies within the United Nations itself  such as the Security Council. His considered and valuable presentation has won the support and general approval of world opinion  and my delegation supports it fully.The Dominican Republic is conscious of the complex and serious problems affecting the international community that are being debated at this session  and of the fact that those problems require measures commensurate with their seriousness and urgency  We are confident that within the framework of the law and the principles of the Charter will be possible to adopt the measures that can lead to a better and more just international order.It is for me a source of great satisfaction to participate in the Assembly as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the new constitutional Government of my country  inaugurated on 16 August of this year. The Government headed by President Salvador Jorge Blanco assumed office in the Dominican Republic through the free and sovereign will of our people  expressed in free elections.This Government is the result of the institutional strength of a country that has been fulfilling its democratic vocation through constant struggle and great sacrifice. During the last 20 years we have not only removed the obstacles that checked our democratic development  but we have also overcome situations that affected our standing as a sovereign nation.The Dominican Republic is now enjoying a period characterized by the consolidation of its political democracy and is facing the urgent task of promoting economic development and social justice. At this time  within our institutional framework and with full respect for human rights  ideological pluralism and absolute freedom  the Government intends to make those changes and reforms that are necessary to strengthen our economic democracy  one of the most legitimate aspirations of developing countries.We consider it appropriate to point out those accomplishments because we firmly believe that the continuous and strengthening exercise of democracy in a small country such as ours  belonging to the group of third world nations  is an example to be proud of and strengthens our national purpose to achieve our own destiny without interference.The political stability of Dominican Republic has created conditions which enable us to increase our effective participation in international relations  and to that end we offer our full co-operation in the search for peaceful solutions  strictly adhering to the principles of international law and of the Charter  at a time when great conflicts and tension are shaking the international community. This activity will be exercised within our sovereign rights  without prejudices  inflexible positions or hegemonic constraints.The strengthening of the traditional bonds of friendship that join us to certain countries will not be an obstacle to the substantial broadening of our frontiers in the vast and complex field of international relations  in as far as this is required by our national interests. Above any other consideration  the unchangeable norm of our conduct in the international community will be absolute respect for and adherence to the legal and moral principles sustained and supported by the nations which together with ours form the Organization.In his inaugural speech as constitutional President of the Dominican Republic  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco outlined the attitude of his Government in international affairs in the following words: ""We declare ourselves men of America  an essential part of an international community full of heroic deeds  an integral part of the new world searching daily for a collective existence  of the union of wills and efforts dedicated to the defense of social justice  to the struggle against underdevelopment. ""In these difficult moments for the countries of the third world the solidarity of the people of America is necessary and urgent and requires mutual support to help them overcome their pressing problems of subsistence and their terrible economic and political problems. In these difficult times  America  our Magna Patria  as it was called by Pedro Hennquez Urena  should be a spearhead to thwart the constant menaces of a world holocaust and should be a bulwark of equilibrium in the concert of nations of the world."" Within this new spirit  the Dominican Government has decided to exercise further its traditional vocation for peaceful action and to participate as an active element in the search for solutions to the conflicts presently afflicting our brother countries of Central America  and we are also prepared to collaborate in alleviating the international tension that affects other nations in the Caribbean basin.This attitude on the part of the Dominican Government is reflected in the decision to offer our immediate support for the purposes expressed jointly by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela in a letter they addressed to the President of the United States of America  to the Council of Government of Nicaragua and to the President of Honduras  expressing their concern over the tense situation existing between the latter two countries.In this instance the Dominican Government did not confine itself to simple support but expressed its willingness to participate  in whatever useful way it could  without detriment to the principle of non-intervention  in any effort to normalize relations between those two brother countries.This position on the part of my Government had already been expressed in the joint declaration issued in Santo Domingo on 16 August last by the heads of State of Venezuela  Costa Rica  Nicaragua  Belize and the Dominican Republic  on the express initiative of my Government  in which those distinguished statesmen ratified their support for the fundamental principles of international law  which include the sovereign equality of all countries  respect for their independence and the territorial integrity  respect for the principle of non-intervention  non recourse to threats or use of force to resolve international conflicts  ideological pluralism  the self-determination of nations and respect for and faithful compliance with international treaties.The declaration emphasizes: ""within the framework of the different proposals for peace in the Central American region and the mechanisms to implement them  rejection of violent solutions  negotiations and dialogue are necessary for the solution of this crisis  a solution which must be the exclusive product of a common will and effort  with a view to promoting democracy  economic development and social justice.""Moreover  we also made a cordial appeal to those democratic countries interested in the establishment of peace to apply their best efforts to achieve that end. For my country that declaration forms part of a profound commitment. We must help to stop the present bloodshed and thus avert the possible danger of cruel and extended confrontations. For our brother nations of Central America we desire the full exercise of human rights. We consider it just and urgent that these countries be able to choose freely their own destiny and to devote their energies to full economic and social development.We must emphasize that there is perhaps no other region as cohesive in its geography  its history  its ethnology  its economy and its culture as the Caribbean. This region is characterized by the coexistence of traditional and emerging States. However  due to causes alien to the interests of its peoples  interchanges among the countries of the region have not been achieved to the extent that we would desire and welcome. The Dominican Republic has special characteristics which make it an ideal bridge for the realization of such exchanges among Caribbean countries  especially at a time when we are strengthening our relations with the region's new States.For the Dominican Republic it is not Utopian to believe and to say that the Central American and Caribbean region must become a zone of peace  of balance  stability  pluralism and the total rejection of military solutions.This year there occurred in the South Atlantic a deplorable event that disturbed the region but brought about solidarity in support of the just territorial claims of a brother nation.An invariable aspect of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic is our opposition to all forms and vestiges of colonialism in any part of the world. This has been a firm and consistent position expressed on innumerable occasions and in different international forums. Within the Organization  from the very outset  the Dominican delegation has constantly supported all anti-colonial recommendations and measures and has with clear determination contributed to the worthy process of decolonization that has been realized by the United Nations.Throughout its history the Dominican Republic has been a peace-loving country. This position is unchangeable and is universally recognized. We believe that peace is the common goal of all mankind  the highest of social values  the indispensable norm for a harmonious and civilized life within each country and internationally.We therefore address a cordial appeal to the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume within the framework of the United Nations the necessary negotiations that will through dialogue and understanding permit a dignified  honourable and permanent solution to the conflict through the peaceful mechanism available to sovereign States under the Charter of the United Nations and international law.We consider it appropriate to point out that this deplorable experience has deeply affected public faith in the effectiveness of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance  signed at Rio de Janeiro in 1947  as a proper instrument for the preservation of peace in our hemisphere and has once again demonstrated the urgent need to enrich and strengthen the system of collective security in that part of the world with the same firm will and resolve manifest in Bogota when the Organization of American States was founded there.The Dominican Republic expresses its deep concern at the grave economic crisis affecting the international community  which is characterized by a reduced rate of economic growth  a deterioration in the terms of trade  the stagnation of trade  a decrease in the prices of raw materials  high interest rates and increasing protectionism by the industrialized nations  together with the reduction of international economic aid and co-operation. To give just one revealing example  the increase in the gross national product barely reached 1 per cent in the industrialized countries for 1980 and 1981  and it will probably be at zero in 1982. This has produced a considerable increase in unemployment and thereby a drasticreduction in the demand for the products and raw materials on the export of which the existence of the third world depends.Although this problem affects all countries  it is undeniable that the countries within the underdeveloped group that do not produce oil are those that suffer most as a result of the present international economic crisis. In fact  in real terms  the prices of our commodities have reached the lowest level recorded in the last three decades and are substantially lower than those that prevailed during the recession of the mid-1970s. The most important consequence of this situation for the underdeveloped countries that do not produce oil is that in most of tl.cm real per capita income has been drastically reduced for the first time since the Second World War.This situation has created a grave imbalance in the external sector of our economies characterized by high deficits  for which we have been compelled to compensate with unprecedented increases in our foreign debt. This high level of debt today constitutes one of the most serious threats to the financial stability of many nations. We want to use this international forum to request the flexibility that the international banking community must show as regards the repayment of those debts  because it must be remembered that they have been caused by a very unusual economic situation.We support the conclusions set forth at the recent meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Toronto stressing the enormous responsibility now facing the main industrialized countries as regards the recovery of their economies  the reduction of present interest rates and reversal of the present isolationist trend so as to bring about closer and more generalized international co-operation.We also propose the study and identification of proper recommendations to curtail the increasing protectionist trend in industrialized nations  which manifests itself in the establishment of unjustified trade barriers that obstruct international trade and limit the expansion of markets for the products of the third- world nations.In other words our delegation considers that the North-South dialogue must be awakened from its present stagnation and be activated as an instrument for frank discussions concerning the contradictions between the developed and the developing worlds. The present condition of the international economy reveals symptoms similar-too similar to be ignored- to those that existed before the world depression of the 1930s  whose disastrous consequences we all know.Let us pledge that during the current decade  through global negotiations within the framework of the Organization  those indispensable measures required for the achievement of the much awaited new international economic order will be taken and make it possible for us to live in a more secure and just world.As we examine the problems that affect the international community  we cannot forget the danger posed by the policies of increasing armaments pursued by the super-Powers. Our concern increases when we observe with anxiety and frustration the paralysis of negotiations on disarmament and the fact that we cannot foresee the establishment of a new order that will give peace to the world. It is a paradox that while the great nations argue over formulas to reduce the tremendous power of their forces of mutual destruction new installations with nuclear missiles of incalculable efficiency are being set up on their territories. If this latent menace became reality  it would imply the total destruction of the world that we live in. The danger becomes greater with the outbreak of limited conflicts in sensitive areas of the world  conflicts that could easily become uncontrollable and result in a nuclear holocaust.In this situation of extreme danger to all mankind  there is an urgent need for all Member States to act together to create the proper climate for constructive dialogue between the big world Powers.One of the dangers is the explosive situation of increasing violence in the Middle East which during recent decades has been a negative factor for the prospects for balance and peace in the world. The seriousness of the situation has been made tragically evident by the recent horrible massacre of Palestinian refugees in the camps of Lebanon  a dreadful act of genocide that has shaken the conscience of the entire international community. Our Government has publicly emphatically condemned that horrible massacre  and has demanded that international bodies prevent its repetition and determine responsibility for it.Our voice has joined those of other nations clamouring for an effective guarantee of the integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon  an unfortunate country with which we have very cordial relations. We are aware that the problems in that area of conflict have demonstrated that the Palestinian question is one of the decisive factors in the crisis. We believe that no permanent  serious solution can be reached if we do not provide a mechanism that assures the Palestinian people the exercise of its inalienable right to self- determination  which has been recognized by the United Nations.Similarly  we reiterate our policy that any serious attempt to achieve peace and coexistence in that tormented region must take into account Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which  among other things  affirms the State of Israel's right to exist.We regard as timely and essential to the peace effort the proposal made by the Secretary-General to convert the Security Council into a world forum where ""all the parties concerned"" in the problem of the Middle East may sit at the same negotiating table.The Dominican Republic feels closely linked to the Arab world by the strong connections created by the historical emigrations to our territory of Syrian  Lebanese and Palestinian citizens  who have enriched the cultural  social and economic heritage of our country over the years. Consequently  my Government has affirmed its determination to establish or strengthen political  economic and other ties with many of the countries of the Arab world  within the framework of international law and the principles of the Charter.The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  an unfortunate confrontation between two Moslem countries  is a cause of deep concern to us. We hope that a solution will be found in the near future  one restoring peace and making possible a policy of good-neighbourliness  with the full guarantee of reciprocal rights-within the framework of the United Nations  of course.Fundamentally  the composition of the Dominican people is the product of an interracial union of Indians  whites and blacks. The result of this ethnic mixture is a mixed race of which we are truly proud. The Dominican Republic reiterates in this world forum that for us any kind of discrimination or segregation  any attempt to separate the population on racial  religious or other lines  is a crime against humanity. Therefore  we reject the policies and practices of apartheid. We take this opportunity to affirm that the Dominican Republic condemns without reservation violations of human rights in whatever circumstances and wherever they occur.Our profound conviction on the matter and our resulting firm rejection of such attempts have a special meaning at this particular time  when we have just inaugurated in the city of Santo Domingo a monument to Brother Antonio Montesinos. A magnificent work architecturally and sculpturally  the monument is a gift from the Government of Mexico to the people of the Dominican Republic. Brother Antonio Montesinos proclaimed in a sermon in our island in 151l ""By what right and with what justice do you keep these Indians under such horrible servitude? Are they not men? Have they not rational spirits?"" That was his cry of concern from Santo Domingo  the first act in defence of human rights in the new world.On 12 October  Hispanic Day  our President  at the inauguration of the monument  recalled that pronouncement and its far-reaching consequences when  in the presence of President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico he said: ""The rights of man  which  under another name  Brother Antonio Montesinos fought for  have been a permanent guiding light for the Dominican people. Even in those dark days when liberty was denied to us  the pursuit of freedom became the principal motive which unified our wills  criteria and actions. Only time has separated those historic moments of the struggle for liberty and democracy in our country. Our political democracy  today fully achieved  may be the great answer to those struggles and to a full awareness of them  and the role this plays within our continent.Geographical differences do not prevent us from recalling the struggles of other peoples  however distant they may be from the Antilles. We support the efforts of the people of Namibia to regain its independence. We also express our concern about foreign interventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We hope that through peaceful dialogue and the use of the machinery provided by the Charter the Korean people may be able to secure their desired unification into one sovereign State.At this time  when territories are the source of still-unresolved conflicts and problems  the seas may contribute to the well-being of the world. We are now witnessing the humanization of the seas through the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that declared the sea-bed to be the common heritage of all mankind. The Conference was one of the great successes of the General Assembly and proof of this body's effectiveness within the United Nations. Since 1973  when the Conference on the Law of the Sea began  it has been working with a new vision of international law and co-operation and is laying down rules that would satisfy our aspirations to abolish privileges  to protect the environment and to achieve peaceful coexistence. The new Convention on the Law of the Sea  in establishing a new and fruitful reality  is an example of the infinite possibilities inherent in negotiation  good will and mutual understanding.Among the social items on the agenda of the Assembly  the Dominican Republic considers as being particularly relevant those related to the rights  evolution and development of women as well as to their participation in the political  social and economic life of their countries. In this connection  the new Dominican Government has set up an office for the advancement of women within a Ministry of Social Welfare as a first step towards integration of the different aspects of human advancement. We express our deep satisfaction at the fact that our country has been selected as host to the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women  whose formal installation will take place early next year in Santo Domingo and for which the Dominican Government has already made a substantial appropriation.We are confident that the report the Secretary- General will submit with regard to this matter  which has already been endorsed by the Economic and Social Council  will prompt other Member States to contribute to the support of this Institute and thereby assure the fulfilment of its important functions.Under the present difficult international circumstances  cultural co-operation-widely debated and defined at the World Conference on Cultural Policies  known as MONDIACULT  organized by UNESCO in August-is evoked to strengthen the ties that exist between peoples. There can be no argument that all cultures have the same dignity and equality; that freedom is necessary to all intellectual and artistic creation; that all patrimonies  be they architectonic  written or oral  need to be protected and that those values are the bedrock of an interdependence freely assumed but carefully preserving identities and receptive to new sources of enrichment.The Dominican Republic  which suffered for a long time from cultural isolationism  now wishes to develop communication in education  science  literature and art  provided such dialogues between cultures are established on a basis of respect and reciprocity  of recognition and a receptiveness that assures interchange in the true meaning of that word. We wish to strengthen regional ties  the mutual recognition of cultures  the resources and unique expressions of the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean. To this end  the Dominican Republic has proposed the celebration of the First Biennial of Visual Arts in the Caribbean  to be held in Santo Domingo  a recommendation that was approved by the General Assembly of MONDIACULT.However  this wish for a greater closeness to the countries of our region and Latin America does not diminish the lively interest of the Dominican Republic in extra-continental cultural co-operation and the recognition of great historical events of the past that still loom large today. We refer to the fifth centenary of the discovery of America  and we are grateful to the Spanish Foreign Minister for mentioning in his statement the Dominican Republic's initiative in proposing that the United Nations General Assembly declare  in a universal context  that 1992 be proclaimed the Year of the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of America.The United Nations was founded on the ruins of that great catastrophe that history has called the Second World War. The Organization was conceived to guarantee international peace  to develop friendship among peoples  to assure self-determination and to promote  through international co-operation  their social  economic and cultural development. The Organization was conceived in support of human dignity  on the basis of respect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of all mankind without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion. The Organization was conceived to prevent the third-and probably the last-world war.We often forget that the founders  our predecessors who signed the Charter of San Francisco  did so in the name of peoples  not in the name of States or Governments. This is not a semantic artifice  nor is it a legal subtlety. It is simply the living expression of a deep longing for peace and solidarity that was born in the universal conscience in those dark days. I believe that many of the problems arise or worsen because Governments sometimes ignore the real aspirations of their peoples. People have among themselves spontaneous affinities  natural and pure  that are deeply rooted in their cultural origins and common ideals. Those affinities transcend the boundaries of circumstantial antagonisms that are characteristic of the strict exercise of government. AH Governments  regardless of ideology or of geopolitical location  would render a great service to the Organization's vocation for peace should they decide to stimulate the development of those affinities  whose roots are found in the very depth of human awareness. A simple examination of the agenda of the Assembly  a mere study of the multiple conflicts that divide the international community  the anguish expressed by the brave declaration of the Secretary- General in his memorable report  will surely prove that we have not yet reached these ideals. However  those harsh realities must not frustrate us to the point of losing faith in the Organization  for if we have not been able in many cases to prevent or to solve conflicts  we have at other times had successes that constitute true triumphs for mankind.In this connection  it should be pointed out that if the fear of a nuclear holocaust is still the gravest threat to mankind today  there is no better hope of preventing it than that offered by this exalted forum  open without discrimination or prejudice to all the peoples and nations of the world.The imperfections of the Organization must not shatter our faith in it. On the contrary  they Should inspire us to overcome them  thus strengthening our confidence in its capacity to fulfil its objectives. This is the best contribution we can offer to the future of mankind."
"43",2038,"DZA",37,1982,"First of all  I should like to address to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of the Algerian delegation on your accession to the important position of President of the General Assembly. We are particularly glad to see you assume this difficult responsibility because you represent a country  Hungary  with which Algeria has established excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. You have succeeded Mr. Kittani  who for one year placed his great experience and ability as an accomplished diplomat at the service of the Organization. I should also like to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar for the dynamism he has shown in discharging his mandate since his election to the high post of Secretary-General.The Assembly is faced from one session to another with the same challenge of how to build a truly universal peace. The fact that this is almost a permanent challenge might lead one to believe that the United Nations can only continue to wish for beneficial achievements which would give full significance to the concepts of convergence and harmonization on which this assembly of nations is based.In the statements made since the opening of the general debate the same concern has emerged over the crisis in international relations as a whole and the serious problems facing our world. There have been two points that we have all been obliged to make: first  the lucid analyses that from year to year have highlighted the primary causes of the critical state of our world and the dangers for the future of mankind; secondly  the international community's inability resolutely to tackle these primary causes and prevent these dangers.But promoting true peace requires that we go beyond simply being aware of the dreadful realities of international life; nor can it simply be reduced to diagnosing  however correct our diagnosis may be. What is certainly needed is a break  a change  in attitude and conduct which have broadened tension and insecurity. Unless we have such a break  such a change  the international community will not be able to put an end to systematic violations of the principles of the Charter.In these circumstances  we can hardly be surprised that the picture of our world today is one of anarchy where the unleashing of unbridled force crushing the elementary principles and values of law shows the failure of policies based only on power plays and relationships of force. The tragedy of the Palestinian people is the most dramatic illustration of this. Indeed  the Palestinian problem  which has dominated international affairs and the work of the Organization this entire past year  is the most significant and disturbing example of the crisis of the world today. The denial of justice to the Palestinian people has made this issue a major crisis of our age  one that leads to the most serious dangers for international peace and security.The crime against humanity which was perpetrated in Beirut and witnessed by the entire world was committed when a situation had lasted for too long  one in which an entire people's right to live was denied. That crime was perpetrated because of constant encouragement and unlimited resources given to the Zionist policy of aggression. Can we add to that horror by emphasizing the fact that it was only after the departure of their defenders that thousands of women and children were massacred?Is there any need for me to recall that the Palestine Liberation Organization decided on withdrawal of its armed forces  not because it was reluctant to sacrifice its fighters  but precisely out of respect for a civilian population which had paid with its blood a noble ransom of solidarity. What a contrast  what a significant contrast  between infamy and respect for human life. The PLO thus gave us proof of its ability to use well its considerable political and military resources to advance its cause. In leaving that theatre of operation the PLO at the same time broadened the strategic base of its action and its hold on the people.In the resolute struggle waged by the Palestinian people under the leadership of thePLO  its sole legitimate representative  the Beirut battle symbolizes both the stubborn resistance and the spirit of responsibility which prove the authenticity of a national liberation war. Therefore it would be wrong to expect a solution in the Middle East without the Palestinian people or against them. More than ever before  the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  above all their right to establish a State in their homeland  is essential to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.This is moreover  the very substance of the international community's consensus on a settlement of the crisis in the Middle East. It is the duty of the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities and make possible the implementation of this consensus  thereby ensuring a return to peace in the Middle East. It must react with specific action and bold decisions that at last ensure justice for the Palestinian people.The plots hatched against the Palestinian resistance  like  those we see in other parts of the world  force us to say that there seems to be a planned policy for destroying solidarity  a strategy for splitting regional and other political groups  in order to turn back the tide of history and re-establish imperial domination in the third world countries faced with many problems and trying despite a thousand difficulties to find solutions in keeping with the aspirations of their peoples.Against this background certain actions against the Organization of African Unity are of particular concern to us. Its very birth bore witness to the victories won through the struggle of the African peoples in the decolonization process  and OAU was from the outset a means of completing this liberation of the continent in all areas and a bulwark of African freedom a has to its credit constant action in solidarity with all freedom fighters and determination to go on until it succeeds  it has inevitably become the target of attempts to crush it.Therefore  after all kinds of political  economic and military pressures have been brought to bear on it  attacks are now directed  through that organization  against the very basis of unity and solidarity in our continent. But the crisis of OAU  although an African matter  is not exceptional in nature and must be overcome by the efforts and the determination of its members. However  although these difficulties are transitory  that does not lessen the responsibility of those that caused them  and cannot be used as a pretext for considering it less necessary to search together  as in the past  for solutions to the problems facing Africa  the most important of which remains that of eliminating colonialism and racist domination.The tragedy being played out in the southern part of Africa becomes grimmer with each passing day. The policy of Apartheid universally condemned as a crime against humanity  is also constantly being expanded. The illegal occupation of Namibia continues and is being consolidated  while brutal aggression against African States in the region is intensifying. This situation demands that the international community continue to mobilize in support of the cause of the South African people  their emancipation and freedom to determine their future. It also demands the imposition of a total embargo and comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. Only such a response can put an end to the policy of defiance and aggression of the Pretoria regime.As regards Namibia  it is time for the international consensus on the inalienable right of the Namibian people to independence and the legitimacy of its struggle  under the leadership of its sole representative  SWAPO  to be given practical effect. It is time for the Western Powers that have the duty and the means of influencing the policy of the Pretoria regime to do what is incumbent on them and to shoulder their responsibility  because they have a commitment to the international community concerning the process of independence for Namibia.In north-west Africa the conflict between the people of Western Sahara and the occupying Power  the Kingdom of Morocco  has been a matter of constant concern to the international community since 1975. It is thus natural that OAU and the United Nations should have attempted to find a just and definitive solution to this problem some of the sidetracking of the process that should have led to. the decolonization of Western Sahara. The Organization  aware of the justice and legitimacy of the struggle waged by the people of Western Sahara  led by the POLISARIO  has thus constantly called for the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of their right freely to determine their own future  and in General Assembly resolution 36/46 called for negotiations between Morocco and POLISARIO.OAU  for its part  aware of the dangers of the continuing conflict in the region  has made a responsible attempt to find ways and means of moving towards a solution consistent with its charter and principles. Since OAU It is thus encouraging to see that one of the two parties to the conflict  the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  continues to demonstrate a high sense of responsibility to the cause of peace and of Africa by expressing its willingness to seek a political settlement. It simply remains for us to hope that the voice of reason  or simply common sense  will end by triumphing and that there will be victory for a national liberation cause that has been recognized as such by the international community and that this will make it possible to marshal all enemies and exploit all wealth for the greater benefit of the fraternal peoples of the region  united by the same historical experience and a common future.Disturbing trends in international affairs  in the form of hotbeds of tension in the third world  are also to be found in the serious barriers to promotion of a true international dialogue. Whether it be disarmament or international economic relations  we can see a paralysis in the channels of negotiation  a disruption of the machinery of consultations.Against this background  the recognized failure of the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament reveals the difficulties and the infernal logic of this kind of confrontation. While the international community came to the lofty conclusion that security cannot be achieved by a build-up of arms  and while there has been a tenfold increase in destructive potential of the arsenals of the nuclear Powers to destroy the entire human species  the opportunity of moving forward in international negotiations on disarmament  getting us out of the rut of the discussions of the past  has not been seized. However  on this vital issue where the data is perfectly clearly established  there was some hope that the rivalry in the unbridled arms race would eventually yield to rivalry in announcing concrete and effective measures for disarmament.However  it must be recognized that the call to reason and the expectations and hopes of our peoples have met no response. Furthermore  the conceptual edifice patiently built in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  of 1978  has on occasion been challenged in the principles and priorities it established  and this shows that there has been a move backwards in political commitment to true disarmament. This serious regression was naturally accompanied by increased activity on the part of imperialism and by geo- strategic maneuvers in the third world. This activism was reflected 	by obstacles being increasingly placed in the way of the national liberation struggle of the peoples  an increase in policies of intervention and destabilization  the reactivation and opening of military bases and a frantic search for military facilities for interventionist purposes.The Indian Ocean was proclaimed a zone of peace by the United Nations  and yet there is military competition and unequalled rivalry there and also in the Mediterranean  where we have the same foreign presence against the wishes of the non-aligned coastal States. Even Cyprus  a peaceful island  is living in a situation that is simply incompatiblewith its own nature as an open-hearted meeting-place for civilizations and as an independent and non-aligned country.Throughout the third world  in Africa  in Asia and in Latin America  there is an increase in the number of attempts being made to stifle the forces of progress by resorting to intimidation and destabilization techniques  and denying the peoples' right freely to choose their political system and their own path of development.In international economic relations  the present situation is extremely disturbing. Inseparable from the deterioration in the international political environment  the world economic crisis is deepening and worsening. The international economic system  a source of inequality and a privileged area in terms of continuing relationships of domination  is now prey to major upheavals. The disruption in the world economy highlights the intrinsic limits of an order that is doomed because it has not adapted to the development needs of two thirds of the human race. The haphazard measures that have been advocated by the developed countries simply do not work  and this is additional proof that the order is collapsing.Against this background  it is hardly surprising that the economic situation of the developing countries should have continued to deteriorate. When we look regularly at the balance sheets  we can see that there has been a continued increase in poverty and the ravages of hunger. Under development of two thirds of the human race is one of the main features of the world ted ay  and the gloomy prospects in view of continuing trends over the years and decades to come are indeed threatening.This precarious world economic situation highlights more than ever before the need for a fair restructuring of this anachronistic framework and of the unequal rules that currently govern international relations. In that connection  the developing countries have spared no effort to prelaunch the dialogue with the developed countries—a comprehensive  responsible dialogue taking account of the realities of the developing world and of the growing interdependence of the world economies; a dialogue covering all the major issues simultaneously and in a consistent  interrelated way; a dialogue which  with universal  democratic participation  would presage our final objective of democratizing international economic relations.Those were the bases on which the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77 conceived the initiative of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development—an initiative that won the consensus support of the international community with the adoption in 1979 of General Assembly resolution 34/138. At a time when the Second United Nations Development Decade was ending on a strikingly unproductive note  the adoption of that resolution sparked hopes that the developed countries would finally evince the political will to launch a significant common effort for the benefit of one and all. Throughout the past three years the Group of 77 has demonstrated flexibility and has been open t^ dialogue; it has played a dynamic and constructive role in the search for a commonly acceptable basis for the launching of those global negotiations.In 1980  at the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  devoted to economic issues  the Group of 77 contributed act national community. Since then several proposals have been made  with due regard for the requirements of the minority that did not join the consensus. Thus the Group of 77 took the initiative of putting forward a proposal with three options  with a view to making possible the urgent launching of the global negotiations. Unfortunately  the three options were not accepted—although there was no real negotiation at all. Despite that rejection  the Group of 77 once again demonstrated a constructive spirit by taking another initiative in the hope of removing all doubts weighing on the launching of global negotiations. The industrialized countries  however  felt it necessary to submit four amendments to that proposal  the productof tremendous compromise. The Group of 77 carefully and responsibly studied those amendments  thus demonstrating again its willingness to co-operate fruitfully  and decided to accept two of the four amendments proposed. However  inasmuch as the other two proposed amendments questioned resolution 34/138 as the political framework for the global negotiations and called into question the delicate balance between the central role of the General Assembly in the conduct of the global negotiations and the particular role of the specialized agencies  the Group of 77 was unable to accept them. Hence we venture to hope that the compromise proposals of the Group of 77 will eventually be accepted.During this period of deteriorating international economic relations and given the impasse in the North-South dialogue  South-South co-operation takes on particular importance. As a parallel and supplement to the efforts at a North-South dialogue  South-South co-operation is part of the major project of establishing the new international economic order. It is in that context that the developing countries have traced a framework and defined the operational instruments for the constant strengthening of their individual and collective autonomy. The Group of 77  aware that its strength lies in unity among its ranks and in cohesion in its approach  thus offers a new basis for reinforcing its solidarity. A year after the adoption of the Caracas Programme of Action  its implementation has begun with the faith and determination that nurture great hopes.It is in that international atmosphere that Algeria  having survived more than a hundred years of darkness  celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence. Having fully recovered its attributes as a State  Algeria undertook to consolidate its political independence by meeting the requirements of economic independence. Eager to preserve its dearly reconquered sovereignty and desirous of mutually beneficial international co-operation  Algeria opted for a foreign policy governed by principle and molded in the common destiny which is based on its belonging to the Arab world  the African world  the Moslem world and the third world. At the same time  it codified in its national charter and Constitution the fundamental principles of a diplomatic policy which sets peace and development  so intimately related  as its objective  and the principles of the United Nations as the inviolable guide of its conduct. Having rediscovered the benefits of peace  Algeria undertook to promote in good faith  at the sub regional level  a policy of positive good-neighbor-liness which embodied the principle of the inviolability of frontiers and called for political harmonization and broad-ranging co-operation. This approach was also reflected in our strong belief in the ideals of Arab unity and African unity  and all efforts to consolidate the basis of our effective solidarity and the harmonious working together of the two groups.Lending our voice to the community of the oppressed  within which we forged our deep beliefs and well-tested friendships  and the world of the deprived  whose situation and aspirations we share  Algeria is working to establish international relations free of any tinge of domination or exploitation. We are doing this with perseverance within the United Nations and within other groups to which we belong.Algeria is a founding member of the non-aligned movement  and we have elevated non-alignment to a clear commitment and a system of values  a reference system which inspires our conduct and determines the positions we take. We believe in a great future for this movement  whose relevance in today's world confirms its importance and the correctness of its doctrine. We thus express our deep belief that the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  to be held at New Delhi  will help to strengthen the cohesion and capacity for action of this movement and strengthen its role in the international arena.Algeria's assessment of the role of the Organization is based on that same premise and arises from the same outlook. It is undeniable that the United Nations has played a globally positive role  due account being taken of the limits imposed on it both by its very nature and by the will of the States of which it is composed. Its movement towards universality is proof that it is viewed as a unique forum for reconciling views in order to seek solutions to the problems of our world.However  the many shortcomings that have led to the paralysis of the Organization call for a responsible consideration of its future  and indeed this; something that the Secretary-General invites us to do in his report on the work of the Organization. The call for the democratization of international relations and the legitimate desire to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to lift the Organization to the level of its responsibilities  particularly in the field of international peace and security  can no longer be ignored.The Secretary-General has highlighted the deficiencies of the Organization  and thereby emphasized the correctness of the political position taken by a great majority of Member States  and of our work on the present functioning of the United Nations. World public opinion can be harsh to the United Nations  but we should think about it carefully  because the United Nations is in fact based on a profession of faith of our peoples  which it would be dangerous to treat lightly.Foremost among the factors that have immobilized the Organization  while dangers are mounting and all eyes  of the veto in the Security Council  which demonstrates the great gap that now exists between the spirit of the rule of unanimity and the use made of it are fixed on us  is undoubtedly the abuse In view of this development  which is increasingly prejudicial to the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations  it is urgent that the international community reconsider the way in which the Security Council functions and subject it to a strict review in the light of political ethics so as to restore to that body its original purpose. The vitality of the United Nations and its ability to hold high those principles that establish its moral strength could then be demonstrated by its ability to establish and preserve real universal peace.If this session were to lead to a real determination on the part of Member States truly to make the United Nations the center for the harmonization of the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends  and if the most powerful of them were to reflect that determination in a change of attitude and conduct  then we would have reason to encourage our peoples' belief in the great future of the Organization."
"44",2085,"ECU",37,1982,"  Sir  I would ask you to transmit to Mr. Hollai  President of the General Assembly  the greetings of my country  together with our best wishes for complete success in the conduct of the work of this session of the General Assembly  a success assured by his prestige and experience in the Organization. I also greet the Secretary-Genera)  who comes from our Latin American region  elected last December to the elevated responsibility that the international community has entrusted to him  for the furtherance of peace and the strengthening of the United Nations. I also wish to place on record our profound gratitude to and praise for Mr. Kittani  the esteemed President of the thirty-sixth session. His efforts during the prolonged work of the thirty- sixth session will always be recalled as an example of selfless devotion to the cause of the United Nations.138.	World problems have worsened considerably in the midst of an atmosphere laden with growing tension  constant collective insecurity  aggressions that are neither punished nor stopped and an acute inter¬national economic crisis. The world panorama has darkened over the past year as a result of the dangers that confront peace  while the measures adopted by the Organization to alleviate this state of tension and insecurity have not brought about the expected results. The realization of the noble purposes of the United Nations has  as at no time before  eluded the reach of the peoples  who anxiously contemplate the permanent weakening of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the non-implementation of the decisions of the Security Council. Let us recall that mankind put its trust and its hope in the United Nations in order to for save succeeding generations from the scourge of warfare . If the Organization shows itself ineffectual in attaining that objective  the perspectives will become increasingly distressing.139.	For that reason  Ecuador urgently appeals to the Governments of Member States  and prin¬cipally to the great Powers  to act in compliance with their responsibilities and display the political will needed to give substance to the measures adopted by the Organization. That political will is an essential requirement for the restoration of a climate of inter¬national understanding and the removal of the dangers that loom over the future of mankind.140.	To face up to those perspectives  Ecuador comes to this new session to reaffirm its position of adherence to the basic principles of its international policy  outstanding among which are those relating to the sovereign equality of States  non-intervention  the rejection of the threat or use of force in international relations  the non-recognition of territorial conquests obtained by force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  international co-operation  respect for human rights  and the rejection of racial discrimination  apartheid  colonialism and neo colonialism.141.	The joint declarations of the President of Ecuador and the Presidents of Brazil  Venezuela and Colombia on the occasion of the visits made in the course of 1982 by the Ecuadorian President to those brother countries  as well as the declaration signed by nine heads of State from Latin America and Spain on the occasion of the recent transfer of power in Colom¬bia  reaffirm adherence to those principles and indicate the guidelines of Ecuador's international  policy.142.	In the firm belief that peace is possible only through the observance of those fundamental prin¬ciples of the legal system of the United Nations  Ecuador continues to call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces from territories that do not belong to them  in Afghanistan as well as in Lebanon and all of the Middle East  and in Cyprus  Kampuchea  Namibia or any other territory where forces of occupa¬tion are to be found.143.	Ecuador has condemned the aggression against Lebanon as well as the execrable massacres of hun¬dreds of Palestinians that recently occurred in west Beirut  and it has requested that an appropriate investi¬gation be made in order to determine responsibilities. It has demanded the immediate withdrawal of the invading forces as well as the cessation of hostilities in order to put an end to the loss of human lives and the destruction of that martyred country. The Lebanese people must remain free from any foreign interference so that they may decide their own destiny in a sovereign and democratic manner and so that their intrinsic and inalienable right to live in peace is respected. Similarly  Ecuador reiterates the basic need to find a solution to the problem of the Palestinian people  who have the right to establish themselves in their own territory  a right to self-determination and a right to participate on an equal footing with the other countries of the region in international negotia¬tions aimed at finding a just  definitive and compre¬hensive solution to this serious situation.144. In this respect  Ecuador has considered with interest the new proposals aimed at the full recognition of the basic rights of the Palestinian people and the need to give effect to United Nations decisions  particularly those of the Security Council. In fact  and in accordance with the latter  the search for practical measures that would meet the just claims of the Palestinians and reaffirm respect for the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of all States in the region continues to be the urgent aim of the international community in the Middle East.145.	Ecuador lives within a democratic system with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as laid down in its Constitution and in relevant international instruments. My country upholds the need for universal respect for human rights without the selectivity as to their violations that leads to covering up in certain regions what is criticized in others. It also maintains that it is proper for each State member of the international community to report of its own accord and in such international forums as this on the observance of those rights within their borders.146.	In this regard  the Constitutional President of Ecuador  Mr. Osvaldo Hurtado  stated at the opening of the session of the Ecuadorian Parliament this year thatfor ... the Government has scrupulously respected public freedoms in such a manner that it can proudly report that in the course of the past year no act tending to limit them has occurred. The political parties  the trade unions  the chambers of commerce and the information media have been given the widest guaranty’s for the exercise of their activities.147.	The Charter of Conduct signed at Riobamba in 1980 by the Presidents of the countries of the Andean Group  as well as Panama  Costa Rica and Spaing reaffirms the commitment by which respect for human  political  economic and social rights constitutes a fundamental norm for the internal conduct of States  and notes that joint action in the defense of such rights does not violate the principle of non-interven¬tion. It also reiterates the need to promote the settle¬ment of disputes among the countries of the Andean Group  or between them and third parties  by peaceful means  and it provides for a subregional and regional process which  inspired by the premises contained in the 1974 Ayacucho Declaration/for constitutes an effective contribution to general and complete disarm¬ament and thus makes it possible to release resources for economic and social development.148.	The multiple world problems and the disputes of every kind that exist in various regions  including those of a territorial character  seriously affect world peace and security and are consequently of interest to the community of nations.149.	In the specific case of the American continent  the territorial problems that sail exist in Central and South America which  we could assert  involve almost all States of the region  hamper the co-ordination of an international policy that would make it possible to attend to a)l existing problems and to obtain the co-operation required to solve them.150.	There exists a serious territorial problem between Ecuador and Peru  dating back to the time when our peoples acceded to independent life. The problem was aggravated when  by force and by the occupation of Ecuadorian territory  the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro  was imposed on us  By virtue of which Ecuador was deprived of the Amazonian territories to which my country is entitled in accordance with unimpeachable legal titles.151.	Ecuador has always advocated and will not cease to seek a peaceful and honorable solution of justice and equity to that problem  one that recognizes its Amazonian rights. That is why it renews from this rostrum its invitation to Peru t& lend its loyal and effective participation to establishing as soon as possible the climate indispensable for understanding between the two countries and for the initiation  as soon as such a design is consolidated  of negotiations aimed at the earliest and definitive solution of the dispute that separates them  without conditions that might prejudge the results of the negotiations and with the assistance of the countries that are most closely linked to the preservation of peace and the search for harmony between the parties. This neces¬sary atmosphere for negotiation has been seriously disturbed by the warlike events of January and Feb¬ruary 1981 and by other later incidents  but the full re-establishment of such an atmosphere is hampered above all by the acts of appropriation of the territories under dispute that Peru has since that time been intensifying and by which it is attempting to pass off the territorial dispute it maintains with Ecuador as having been resolved in favor of its own unilateral pretensions.152.	As a result  I reiterate the reservation that Ecuador expressed before the Assembly at the 31st meeting of the thirty-sixth session with regard to its rights of territorial sovereignty over the undefined border zone extending to the east of the Condor Range to the effect that whatever acts and works Peru may have carried out  as well as those it is currently undertaking and those it may undertake in future  in no case will Ecuador agree to the sitting of the landmarks that Peru claims in that Range  which is not mentioned as a border line in any instrument between the two countries  not even in the so-called Rio Protocol that was imposed upon Ecuador in 1942 after the armed invasion of 1941 and under conditions that included the occupation of part of its territory.153.	As a country of the Amazon region  Ecuador fulfils its role under the Treaty of Amazonian Co-oper¬ation among the eight countries whose territory makes up the water basin of the great river that was discov¬ered by the expedition organized in the sixteenth century from Guayaquil and Quito.154.	Because of its vocation for peace  Ecuador has supported all disarmament resolutions at past sessions of the General Assembly  in particular those resolu¬tions calling for nuclear disarmament and for the prohibition of nuclear tests. We must reiterate our total condemnation of the unbridled arms race—if only because of a basic instinct for the preservation of human life on our planet  which belongs as much to the non-nuclear as to the nuclear countries. We have supported resolutions calling for the reallocation of the astronomical sums spent for military purposes worldwide to be used for the development of the poor countries  a development which is essential for the establishment of the new international economic order. In that connection  we have enthusiastically supported the inclusion in the agenda of the additional item concerning the relationship between disarmament and development.155.	On the other hand  we deplore the lack of political will on the part of the great Powers  which prevented the General Assembly at the second special session devoted to disarmament from even ratifying the points agreed on during the first such special session.156.	There are  of course  other important factors that have to be taken into account in the maintenance of peace and the promotion of the integral development of nations  such as the elimination of economic aggression and of theillegal exploitation of natural resources belonging to other peoples  the changing of unfair terms of trade  and the elimination of all kinds of coercive measures.157.	The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea highlighted the evolution of one aspect of international law  which began 30 years ago with the Santiago Declaration  in which Ecuador  Chile and Peru proclaimed sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea along their coasts to a distance of 200 miles. That legal position has become universal. The new law of the sea recognizes wide-ranging and specific rights of sovereignty of the coastal States over the natural resources in the adjacent waters  on the sea-bed and in the subsoil thereof in that 200-mile zone. The recognition that the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction constitutes the common heritage of mankind is also an irreversible victory. Much has been gained. But further progress is necessary to achieve definitive protection of all the rights of peo¬ples which  like that of Ecuador  have been exercising their rights over their seas without violating any of the norms of international law.158.	Similarly  in the face of the unacceptable claim by the space Powers that it is the right of the first occupant to place satellites in geostationary orbit  Ecuador has maintained that the special rights of the equatorial countries must be recognized for the benefit of the developing world and in view of the determina¬tion to keep outer space an area of peace and co-oper¬ation for scientific and technical progress in the service of all mankind  and especially the developing countries  was reaffirmed in the Declaration of Equatorial States  which met at Quito in April of this year. Ecuador will continue to maintain that position.159.	Disarmament is closely linked with the peaceful settlement of international disputes  which is an element essential to understanding among countries and the strengthening of world peace and security. In every forum of which it is a member—international  regional and subregional—Ecuador advocates peaceful settlement. All disputes between States  both present and future  must be settled solely by peaceful means  without interference and without anything being imposed from outside. We therefore maintain that the United Nations must redouble its efforts in this regard.160.	Our country has accordingly supported the draft Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes   designed to strengthen and make more effective the system of the peaceful settle¬ment of disputes between States  in accordance with an initiative  in which Ecuador took part from the beginning  in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. We have also pointed out the advisability of establishing a body empowered to co-operate with the parties to a dispute in the search for a peaceful settlement at the request of any of them  so that full use may thus be made of the possibilities afforded by the Charter for that purpose.161.	Among the increasingly important forums in which Ecuador participates is the non-aligned move¬ment  which it joined over a year ago  although it had endorsed the principles and policies of the movement ever since the Belgrade meeting of 1961  because of our wishes for the consolidation of peace and inter¬national co-operation  in accordance with Ecuador's foreign policy  which is independent  and free from any influence  with respect for ideological pluralism  and seeks to maintain friendly relations with all coun¬tries. For the sake of adequately coordinating the foreign policies of countries with the greatest historical  political and cultural affinities  the President of Ecuador has proposed that the Foreign Ministers of the Latin American countries join together in a com¬mittee on co-ordination  which would be an essential step in strengthening Latin American unity and soli¬darity. At the subregional level  Ecuador is an active participant in the integration process among the Andean countries which are parties to the Cartagena Agreement.162.	The International Development Strategy was conceived in response to the new approach of a world of co-operation  and to promote a new stage of global economic growth which would benefit all and which would accentuate the activities and benefits of peace in relation to the many development tasks which involve the fulfillment of the world's needs in the fields of education  health  housing  productivity  sources of energy  transport and communications. Consequently  Ecuador trusts that  in the Assembly  the political will which is indispensable for the pro¬gress of the global negotiations will be forthcoming form the industrialized countries and that a system of world economic relations will be arrived at reflecting the principles of equity  sovereignty  equality  inter¬dependence and co-operation among States that are the basis of the new international economic order. We cannot watch with indifference the increasingly serious broadening of the gaps that separate the  poor coun¬tries from the rich countries  with respect to access to the sources of capital and to markets  and to the transfer of technology  while inflation and unemploy¬ment afflict the whole international community  the harshest effects being felt by the weakest.163.	The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States must be effectively implemented in order to establish just and equitable bases for international economic relations. To that end it is also necessary to revitalize the Economic and Social Council  a principal organ of the United Nations  where the crucial questions of our time should be debated. The Council should contribute to consolidating and making more coherent the whole system of specialized agen¬cies  development funds and operative programmes created and consolidated over the past three decades. It must also follow up the resolutions of the General Assembly as well as those of the Council itself and of its Commissions. This covers the major part of the work of the United Nations  since 80 per cent of the activities of the system are in the economic and social fields.164.	In this respect  it is appropriate to mention that the Committee on Information  created by the Assembly  has succeeded in adopting by an admirable and encouraging consensus 42 recommendations [see <4/37/2/  para. 9/]  which we hope the General Assembly will endorse. They include an appeal to the powerful world communications media to back up the efforts of the international community to ensure global development  and in particular the efforts of the developing countries to achieve their own economic  social and cultural development.165.	While the global negotiations are going on  Member States will have to prepare plans and projects  as well as train personnel  with the support of oper¬ational programmes such as UNDP  whose charac¬teristics of universality  formulation of programmes by Governments and financing by voluntary contributions as well as its 32 years' experience all combine to make it the ideal instrument to meet the real needs of world development. That is why its activities must be trebled  which is possible if the major countries respond to the General Assembly's appeals to increase their con¬tributions by 14 per cent. Ecuador  for its part  has done so. The developing countries have made a significant increase in their contributions  and there is growing South-South co-operation in the economic and technical fields. The world multilateral system of technical co-operation and pre-investment is the most commendable  because of its political independence  its objectivity  its flexibility and its experience. We reject any attempt to orient it towards the governing of the programmes of some States by others  which would be intolerable.166.	Together with technical co-operation and pre- investment  which link the transfer of technology with economic development  from investment to productivity  trade must be an instrument of justice between countries  through agreement on equitable prices and theelimination of discriminatory barriers. It is also necessary to stress the multilateral process of trading  because this contributes to the preservation of the independence of peoples and prevents the anachronistic exploitation and dependence which often accompany bilateral aid. All this must continue to be considered in international forums  so that exports from developing countries may earn a fair remuneration and maintain sources of employment for the inhabitants of those countries. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming session of UNCTAD will result in new approaches  understandings and decisions which will ensure the dynamics of development for the countries of the third world.167.	Although Ecuador is not a contracting party to GATT  it has always been interested in its activities  since GATT's main objective is the reduction of barriers to international trade and the preparation of rules which will enable it to be regulated according to equitable and just terms. However  GATT has not yet succeeded in solving the problems which affect the trade of the developing countries  such as quantita¬tive restrictions and the increased protectionist measures which are applied to the products of which the developing countries are major exporters.168.	We have expressed our concern about the suggested ways of differentiating between developing countries in granting preferential treatment  since the concept of graduation  which the countries granting the preferences seek to introduce  is incompatible with the basic norms of the generalized system of preferences. Ecuador has spoken of the advisability of examining a system of safeguards under conditions and on the basis of criteria that are mutually agreed and are supplemented by a multilateral mechanism of control and monitoring. The forthcoming GATT ministerial meeting will be an opportunity to reach concrete agreements which may allow GATT to achieve its essential objective of the attainment of shared benefits.169.	A regrettable  anachronistic colonial case arose this year in the South Atlantic—that of the Malvinas Islands  where an extra-continental Power mounted a disproportionate punitive expedition  with the support of other great Powers  to deny the Argen¬tine Republic's right of sovereignty. Ecuador  which maintained its anti-colonialist position before  during and after that warlike episode  has rejected the use of force and has recalled that the principle of uti possidetis juris of 1810 is the basis  of the territorial reality of the American countries which gained independence from the Spanish Crown. Ecuador has reaffirmed its adherence to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted as General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  paragraph 6 of which clearly states:Any attempt aimed at the partial or total dis¬ruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the pur¬poses and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.It should not be forgotten that the islands are located on the continental shelf of Argentina and within the security zone established by the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance.170.	There is a dispute  and it must be solved by diplomatic means. In this connection  Ecuador supported the request for the inclusion of the question of the Malvinas as an additional item in the agenda of the present session submitted by 20 Foreign Ministers of Latin American countries and Haiti so that negotiations between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom may be carried out within the framework of the United Nations and as soon as possible.171.	That historic Treaty strengthens the vigorous unity of the Latin American peoples  founding mem¬bers of the United Nations and heirs to an ancient juridical tradition which has strengthened interna¬tional law and contributed significantly to the forma¬tion of the United Nations and of various regional organizations  as they themselves have acknowledged.172.	Because our country owes to the Liberator  Simon Bolivar  the culmination of its political inde¬pendence and the defense of its territorial integrity  the President of Ecuador has proclaimed as the Year of the Bicentenary of the Liberator the period from 24 July 1982 to 24 July 1983  at which time the bicentenary of this great world figure of freedom and international understanding will be celebrated. Ecuador  together with the other Bolivarian countries  that is  the Andean Group and Panama  will co-operate fully in the well-deserved tribute to be paid within the United Nations to the universal thinking of Bolivar.173.	When in 1822 Bolivar  as President of Colombia  proposed to the Governments of Buenos Aires  Chile  Mexico and Peru that they should constitute an assembly of confederated countries  he envisioned that this would lay the legal foundation between the American Republics and would come to serve as a counsel in common dangers  a faithful interpreter of public treaties whenever difficulties arise and  finally  as a conciliator of our deferences .174.	These are additional reasons  revitalized through the San Francisco Charter  upon which Ecuador relies to reiterate its full trust in the United Nations and to urge it once again to intensify its efforts to attain the purposes and objectives of the greatest legal instrument of our time."
"45",2130,"EGY",37,1982,"It gave me great pleasure to see Mr. Imre Hollai elected President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. On behalf of my Govern¬ment and my people  I convey congratulations and best wishes also to the great Hungarian people and the friendly Hungarian Government  of which he is such a worthy representative.113.	i should like also tc pay a tribute to Mr. Ismat Kittani for the skilful and exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the thirty-sixth session.114.	The President's inaugural statement was an eloquent compendium of the events that had occurred in the year since we met in this Hall at the beginning of the thirty-sixth session. They were truly momentous events which cast a heavy shadow of gloom over the international scene. They are fraught with grave dangers both for the issues of war and peace and for the issue of development.115.	Two years ago  Egypt urged that we pause for serious reflection. Members will recall that in our statement at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly we gave the following warning:""The recent alarming developments that have challenged the Charter and the international order that we have subscribed to... since 1945 have... created a perilous situation of political upheaval sometimes bordering on chaos..."".And we noted that  in our opinion:""... the time is ripe to undertake an objective appraisal of the existing political order and  in par-ticular  of the role of the existing international machinery. Accordingly  the Government of Egypt... [Proposes] the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to take up this whole matter.""H6. We raised this matter and submitted it for the Assembly's consideration at the thirty-fifth session. If anything  the developments that we have all witnessed since that time should confirm the serious¬ness of our proposal. In this context  I feel it is most appropriate to pay a special tribute to the Secretary- General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His report on the work of the Organization has provided a valuable analysis of the international situation and of the role of the United Nations in the international system. I support all the proposals made in his report.117.	It is high time that we tackle effectively and with firmness and fairness the various problems that beset us. Foremost among those problems are the issues of war and peace. In the past year alone we have witnessed the invasion of Lebanon  the destruc¬tion of Beirut  the Falklands (Malvinas) war  the con-tinuing Iran-Iraq war  the situation in Afghanistan  the grave situation in Kampuchea  the precarious situation in Korea  the impasse in the problem of Cyprus and grave possibilities in Central America  Africa and the Middle East.118.	The problems we are facing are not confined to those political areas; they are interlocked with economic  social and cultural problems as well as with human rights issues. A number of special sessions of the Assembly have been held to examine various problems and issues  such as the Palestinian problem  the question of Namibia  the situation in Afghanistan  the new international economic order and the problem of disarmament. But what has been the outcome of those sessions? The resolutions that were adopted have not been implemented. They remain dead letters  thus contributing to the further weakening of the United Nations and bringing into sharper focus the paralysis of the international system. This state of affairs is not consonant with aspirations to peace  progress and justice. The present political order  with its principles and conventions  was established solely in order to guarantee the attainment and enjoyment of those goals. The persistence of present conditions can lead only to a serious disintegration of the fabric of international relations.119.	Against the backdrop of these developments  the Egyptian Government reiterates its proposal for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to assess the situation and the role of the Organization in general and so that all Member States can take part in a detailed discussion of the issue. Essentially  we urge the General Assembly to focus on and intensify discussion of the entire interna¬tional order  the suitability of the present political system  the role of the United Nations and  in par¬ticular  the system of collective security—as the delegation of Sierra Leone rightly said in connection with the discussion on the inclusion of that question in the agenda of the present session.120.	AH these matters are of paramount importance for all the peoples of the world and consequently they must be debated by their representatives on a basis of equality. The Security Council would then be asked to consider the situation in the light of the General Assembly's findings. The system of periodic meetings provided for in Article 28 of the Charter would probably constitute an appropriate starting- point for the fulfillment by the Council of its responsibilities in this respect. The Secretary-General has an essential role to play in this regard  but he has to be provided with the necessary resources and with the means to help move the world to a new phase of constructive action aimed at achieving more stable conditions.121.	The international economic situation is a cause for alarm and profound concern because of adverse economic conditions confronting both developing and developed nations  with the impact on the third world even more painful. Third world countries have fre¬quently asked for a review of the existing pattern in international economic relations so that economic life can be based on justice and partnership. All of us are required to redouble our efforts and muster the political will to bring about an economic order that is both effective and just.122.	Our alarm is due to the absence of any encour¬aging signs in the international economic climate and the tendency among some countries to solve their economic problems in isolation. This development is likely to increase the existing discrepancies. Relevant to this issue are the claims made by some indus-trialized countries that call into question the efficiency of economic aid through international organizations. This is one of the major reasons for the acute crisis facing UNDP  which is suffering a serious depletion of financial resources because of the decrease in the voluntary contributions of the donor countries  a situa¬tion that has led to a 40 per cent reduction in country programmes for developing nations. This is bound to have an adverse effect on the economic and social development programmes of those countries  not to mention the negative effects in discrediting the concept of co-operation and interdependence  the mainstay of the United Nations.123.	Some of the issues discussed within the frame¬work of the North-South dialogue have assumed special significance and urgency; we must therefore act vigorously in dealing with them and seeking the necessary solutions. In addition to those issues is the question of global negotiations for restructuring the international economic order. Consultations over those negotiations have now entered their third year  but we are still going through a vicious circle of sug¬gestions and counter-suggestions  a circle that has not yet been broken.124.	Nevertheless  we are still hopeful that the parties can find a common ground to permit the realization of this objective  provided that the political will emerges among some patties to forge ahead towards genuine reform of the international economic order.125.	The Group of 77 has made strenuous efforts to get the North-South global negotiations going  and to make the negotiations comprehensive as well as complementary. This goal  regrettably  has not been realized because of the rigid position taken by some industrialized countries. We see no alternative to stepped-tup efforts to induce more flexibility among the industrialized nations in their attitude towards the problems of the developing nations. The international community is increasingly convinced of the need to review and change the current pattern of international economic relations and to establish it on a basis of equity  partnership and international interdependence.126.	The developing nations have spared no effort in providing an impetus to economic co-operation among themselves and in establishing the principle of individual and collective self-reliance. The Caracas Programme of Actions is undoubtedly a positive step towards more balanced economic relations between North and South. A general review of the meetings that have taken place from the time of the Caracas meeting  in May 1981  to the Manila meeting  in August of this year  sheds some light on the efforts made and the genuine desire on the part of the developing nations  despite their limited resources  to ensure the success of the Caracas Programme of Action  and to ensure both sound implementation and continuing economic co-operation among themselves.127.	Egypt is very interested in extending its eco¬nomic relations with developing nations. We believe in such co-operation  especially technical co-operation. Technical and expertise exchange programmes have been instituted  together with the provision of scholar¬ships and training for students and trainees from various developing countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America.128.	As a non-aligned and non-nuclear country with a keen interest in international security and develop¬ment  Egypt has a well-established position based on full support of and effective participation in all efforts and measures leading to general and complete disarma¬ment under effective international control.129.	The convening of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament this year was an event of tremendous significance to which mankind pinned its hopes for peace. Thus  our disap¬pointment was all the greater because at that session the Assembly failed to agree on a comprehensive program for disarmament within a specific time¬frame  including specific and effective measures to halt the arms race  nuclear and conventional. By that failure an excellent opportunity was missed for realizing the goal of disarmament and thereby guaran¬teeing a safe and peaceful world.130.	The failure of that session  however  should not lead us to give up hope. Armed with a persistent political will  we the Governments and peoples should be able to proceed towards narrowing the gap between the various positions. And here we would like to under¬line that the nuclear Powers  especially the superpowers  have a special responsibility  emanating from their international obligations to ensure world peace and security  over and above the collective responsi¬bility of all States in this regard.131.	Egypt will work tirelessly in contributing to the achievement of peace all over the world  and espe-cially in the Middle East. In that connection  Egypt has launched an initiative for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and has been pursuing means to implement it for the last eight years.132.	The declaration of the Middle East as a nuclear-weapon-free zone would be a major element in lessening tension and eliminating instability in the area. Appropriate measures would be needed to determine the best approach to that goal.133.	Egypt has suggested that the Secretary-General send a special representative to meet the parties concerned in the area to explore their views on means of achieving this goal. That proposal still constitutes for us an important step in this direction. The establish¬ment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would undoubtedly contribute to the security of the Mediterranean and would enhance African security as it relates to the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa and to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.134.	More than a year after its accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Egypt reaffirms its dedication and commitment to ensuring international respect for the objectives of the Treaty  believing that it can contribute to the search for an effective system of non-proliferation and to ensuring the right of all States to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this connection  we strongly support the position of the non-aligned countries in insisting on iron-clad guarantees of the protection of the security of non-nuclear countries. In addition  nuclear Powers must give assurances to those countries that nuclear weapons will not be used against them. Now that non-nuclear countries signatories to the Treaty have fulfilled their obligations  Egypt stresses the need for nuclear Powers to abide by their commitments under the Treaty.135.	It is abundantly clear that the international situation  because of the conflicts with which it is plagued or because of wars actually being waged  demonstrates that no partial approach of dealing with a single problem in isolation from others—whether it be disarmament the new economic order or collective security—will provide an effective remedy for the problems connected with the international political system. This leads me to reiterate our earlier proposal on the convening of a special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of a thorough review of the entire international political system and the role of the United Nations. This would help us to fulfill our responsibility to establish an international political system that is more just and more secure.136.	As an African country  Egypt is passing through the game crucial stage as the rest of Africa. We see attempts to circumvent the United Nations plan for Namibia  the persistence of apartheid in South Africa  the grave situation in the Horn of Africa and disagree¬ment over the question of Western Sahara. Moreover  the pursuit of certain reckless policies poses a threat to the unity of Africa and to the territorial integrity of its States and the security of its peoples. We are aware of the predicament with which the OAU has been faced  ever since the thirty-eighth session of the Council of Ministers  which was held in February in Addis Ababa  in connection with the question of the membership of Western Sahara. That question has given rise to disagreement within the ranks of the OAU  threatening its very survival. However  impelled by our deep conviction and belief in African unity and by our interest in the continuing viability of the OAU  we in Egypt have adopted a firm position  namely  that differences  no matter how deep and extensive  can be solved in a spirit of reconciliation  in the true African tradition. We in Egypt are confident of the ability of Africa to exercise African wisdom and to resolve those differences that arose last February and interrupted the work of the OAU at a time when the need for co-ordinate and collective action though the African organization was more pressing than ever before.137.	Foremost among African problems is the situation in southern Africa  where South Africa con-tinues to defy the international community by inten¬sifying its policies of racial discrimination and apartheid  which have been condemned by all mankind  irrespective of creed  ideology or religion. Egypt strongly supports all international resolutions calling for sanctions against South Africa until it desists from the policies that flout the elementary principles of human rights. Furthermore  Egypt urges all States to participate effectively in the application of such sanctions.138.	We condemn the racist policies of South Africa and its colonialist policy in Namibia. Although four years have passed since the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which sets forth the United Nations plan for the peaceful settlement of the matter  the region has not yet achieved its indepen-dence  because of the intransigence the colonialist racist Pretoria regime.139.	We are all only too aware of the lengths to which SWAPO  the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  has gone in its efforts to adopt a reasonable attitude and to achieve a peaceful settle-ment of the problem. We are all familiar with the maneuvers of South Africa designed to perpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia and to set up a quisling regime there.140.	SWAPO and the African States have expe¬rienced the bitterness of frustration created by such endless maneuvers. The latest of those maneuvers occurred only a few weeks ago. After the Western contact group had sent the letter concerning the agreement reached on constitutional principles  the Prime Minister of South Africa came up with a new stratagem to obstruct agreement by introducing elements extraneous to the question of Namibia and also to the United Nations plan. We call upon the Western contact group to exercise all types of pressure on South Africa to induce it to implement the United Nations plan which it approved in principle in 1978.141.	In talking about Africa I cannot refrain from emphasizing one of the most serious problems in the continent's history  namely  that of Western Sahara. The resolution adopted at the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government in June 1981 in Nairobi  "" and the decisions adopted in August 1981"" and February 1982 by the OAU Implementation Committee provide a sound basis for a peaceful settlement that would ensure stability in the area in accordance with the right to self-determination. The subsequent negative develop¬ments in the attempt to impose new conditions without consensus have not only complicated the question of Western Sahara but also threatened political life in the continent.142.	We appeal to our brother countries parties to the problem before the OAU to seek a peaceful approach to conflicts and to avoid recourse to force. We consider it our duty to call for adherence to the charter of the OAU  which forbids intervention in the internal affairs of member States. We also call upon them to safeguard their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and the security of their peoples.143.	While reviewing the situation in Africa I should like to convey some good news to the international community about an important event that will take place in a few days. Egypt and the Sudan are con-cluding a new charter for integration  a charter formulating an organizational and substantive frame¬work and reflecting the political will of the two coun¬tries to step up their development through the imple-mentation of a number of projects in the economic  social and cultural spheres. The charter provides for a presidential council for integration affairs  a ""Valley of the Nile"" parliament with about 60 members repre¬senting the two peoples  a general secretariat to act as the executive arm in following up integration projects and a special fund to finance those projects.144.	The goal of the integration and its charter is to establish regional co-operation as a model and a nucleus that could  in the future  encompass the nine countries of the Nile Basin. It should be recalled that in 1980 the OAU Assembly endorsed the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Development of Africa  when they decided that African regional co-operation constituted an indispensable basis for social and economic develop¬ment in Africa. The integration plan concluded by Egypt and the Sudan is fully in keeping with the Lagos plan. It is indeed a good omen  heralding wel¬fare and prosperity for the peoples of the Nile Valley  north and south alike.145.	As a founding member of the non-aligned movement  Egypt declares that there is no alternative to the policy of non-alignment. Non-alignment is the sole means of safeguarding the security and the safety of the third world and of facing the policies of polarization  blocs  pacts and confrontation. Non- alignment i: incontestably the only deterrent to policies of hegemony  expansion and domination. The non-aligned movement was established in response to the aspirations of emerging nations which had barely left behind the struggle for liberation. The movement also includes peoples and nations which are still locked in a bitter struggle to liquidate the remnants of colonialism  overcome dependence  back-wardness and racism and defend human rights and dignity.146.	The active and historic role played by the early pioneers and founders of the movement deserves a special tribute from all of us. Today we recall the guidance of great  inspired leaders such as Tito  Nehru and Abdel Nasser  who charted for us the lofty goals and noble means for success. We feel that the values and principles which they struggled for are in need of further defense and further sustained efforts if they are to retain their authenticity  purity and essence.147.	Indeed  much has been achieved. The movement now has a wider membership  as it comprises the majority of the States in the international community. But as opposed to these achievements  a number of problems have unfortunately arisen  the most serious of which are those affecting the ranks of the countries of the movement.148.	We have faced direct and indirect intervention in the internal affairs of the non-aligned countries. We have experienced military adventures and power politics exercised directly or by proxy. The movement has been infiltrated by a tendency to divide the world into natural allies and natural enemies. Furthermore  the movement has been arbitrarily over-categorized and over-stratified  which has deepened differences and dissension  distracting the movement and sapping its energy.149.	The challenges facing the movement make it necessary that all of us who have an interest in pre-serving its non-aligned character should try to keep it on course. It gives me great pleasure to note that within the movement the situation is far better than it was a few years ago. This is to the credit of the member States  which for the most part have reso¬lutely defended that great body and respected its true principles in order to put non-alignment back on its original track in facing the perils of the cold war between the super-Powers. Experience has taught us that it is the small and developing countries that generally and ultimately bear the brunt and the conse¬quences of that cold war.150.	The basic principle of our great movement  to which President Hosni Mubarak reaffirms his commit¬ment  is for us a firm creed and a constant element of our foreign policy under the new leadership of Egypt.151.	It would be appropriate to acknowledge here the efforts that have been made recently to save the movement from fragmentation owing to the insistence of some countries on changing the venue of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was scheduled to be held in Baghdad. We welcome the constructive attitude of the Iraqi Government in not insisting on Baghdad as the venue  and also thank the Government of India for agreeing to hest the meeting; we urge  so that the non-aligned countries can pursue the positive approach they have chosen.152.	Recently the Middle East has been the theatre of very tragic events  being subjected to devastating wars and unprecedented waves of destruction. But despite all the anguish  hopes of a just settlement that takes into account the rights of all the parties without exception have not yet been extinguished. Egypt  which bears a special responsibility in this area  was in the forefront of the battlefield when war was the only means of dealing with the situation. Similarly  Egypt was in the front line of negotiators when the time was propitious and the balance was redressed.153.	Egypt most emphatically cannot afford to accept a situation in which one party to the conflict arrogates to itself the role of arbiter  waging wars; wreaking havoc and committing aggression. Egypt will never accept Israeli aggression against Iraq  its annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights or its occupa¬tion of Lebanon. Egypt totally rejects Israel's utterly irresponsible policy of unbridled aggression against the Palestinian people and the FLO.154.	Israel must understand that Egypt will never tolerate the mutilation of the Palestinian question or of the Palestinian people and that Egypt rejects Israel's crime in Lebanon and against the Palestinians in all its aspects.155.	If Israel demands respect for its sovereignty  territorial integrity and security  this can be achieved only with reciprocity. If Israel demands respect for its rights and the rights of its people to life and existence  Israel must respect the rights of the Palestinian people to life and existence.156.	There should be no double standards. Israeli policies should not be based on considerations of self-arrogated privileges over other countries and peoples. This should be unequivocally clear to the leaders of Israel. In this context  Israel stands fully responsible for all its actions. Israel  under the provi¬sions of the Charter  the norms of international law  the resolutions of the Security Council and the provi¬sions of the peace accords  is committed to respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  fore¬most among which is their right to life  to existence and to self-determination.157.	If Israel does not understand  or chooses not to understand  it will have shunned international legality  flouted the Charter  disregarded the norms of interna¬tional law and  indeed  repudiated the peace accords.158.	However  if Israel still relies on its security argument  we  for our part  assert in all candors that such claims defy logic and reason. Israel's security lies  in a word  in the establishment of peace based on justice. No amount of weapons  money  maneuvers  invasion  attempts to establish settlements  or displacement of thousands of human beings is going to bring security to Israel. Peace means security for all  based on justice for all. This is the only road to security and stability.159.	When Egypt initiated the peace process with President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem it was destined to achieve the following objectives: First  Israel's recog¬nition of the existence of the Palestinian people and the existence of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Secondly  Israel's acceptance of negotiations with the representatives of the Palestinian people. Thirdly  free election of a Palestinian authority to assume power fully in the occupied Palestinian terri¬tories as a transitional arrangement. Fourthly  the with¬drawal of the Israeli military and civilian administra¬tion from the occupied territories  as well as the beginning of the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces  the remaining forces to be redeployed during the transitional phase to specific  points and camps. Fifthly  initiation of negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians on the final status of the occupied West Bank and Gaza/This meant  in other words  a total rejection of Israel's expansionist  annexationist and sovereignty claims as well as of any unilateral or arbitrary measure. Sixthly  it is inevitable that the Palestinian people should be enabled to exercise its right to self-determination  including the right to establish its own State or any other arrangement accepted by the Palestinian people within the frame¬work of international legitimacy.160.	As all delegations are aware  Egypt has been engaged in negotiations with Israel with the full participation of the United States of America to help establish transitional arrangements that would assist in accomplishing those legitimate objectives. Egypt entered into these negotiations in good faith  motivated by the hope of an early dawn of peace and anticipating that Israel  too  would pursue that path and co-operate in implementing the agreements towards comprehen¬sive peace.161.	However  Israel opted to persist in establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in an attempt to seize and usurp the territories of the West Bank  including Jerusalem and Gaza. Again  Israel persisted in annexing Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights and in adopting other measures that conflict with the confidence-building endeavors required to establish a comprehensive peace in the area.162.	This has culminated in the suspension of those negotiations more than once. Needless to say  Egypt  committed as it is to a firm rational stand based on and reinforced by the rules of international law and the principles and the purposes of the Charter  cannot accept such distorted interpretations of accords reached under international legality. Egypt cannot associate itself with a conspiracy against the Palestinian people through any unsound interpretation or equivo¬cal intentions or designs aimed at annexation  incor¬poration and other practices directed against the Palestinians in Jerusalem  the West Bank or Gaza.163.	In the wake of Israel's complete withdrawal from Egyptian territory on 25 April 1982  hope still lingered and did not fade. We expected that Israel would be serious this time in the continuation of the peace process. Allow me here to emphasize the fact that Egypt views the withdrawal from Sinai as only part of a settlement of the overall problem and as a step on a long  tedious road. Unfortunately  Israel dissipated all hopes through persistence in its policies  unacceptable by any logic or reason. Then came the devastating aggression on Lebanon  which has been both a staggering blow to the sovereignty and terri¬torial integrity of Lebanon and a flagrant violation of the political and human rights of its citizens  whose lives have been severely disrupted. The invasion has also painfully disrupted the structure of the Palestinian community in Lebanon which  owing to displacement and dispersion  had been forced to take temporary shelter in Lebanon. The invasion was planned also to abolish the political and national rights of the Pal¬estinian people and to stifle its struggle under the leadership of the PLO.164.	Against this background  Egypt and France presented a joint initiative in the Security Council last July. The draft resolution contained two parts  the first providing for guarantees of the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon and the second dealing with and supporting the national and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people against the armed Israeli invasion. It called for the application of the principles of security in order to:""Reaffirm the right of all States in the region to existence and security in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967);""Reaffirm the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to self- determination with all its implications  on the under¬standing that to this end the Palestinian people shall be represented in the negotiations and  con¬sequently  the Palestine Liberation Organization shall be associated therein;""Call for the mutual and simultaneous recognition of the parties concerned"".165.	This is the political  historical context and rationale of that initiative. Egypt and France strongly uphold their initiative and reiterate full commitment to its principles in the deep conviction that its provi-sions stem from the rules of international law and the principles and purposes of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations. While solemnly stating this position  Egypt also declares that in the light of the agreement reached with France at the highest level  we shall defer our participation in the debate on this initiative at the present time  taking into consideration a number of positive developments in the overall situation and also in anticipation of future develop¬ments. In this context  we wish to welcome the PLO's statement in the Security Council on 29 July 1982.""166.	Foremost among those positive developments is President Ronald Reagan's initiative made public on 1 September 1982. It is a commendable attitude on the part of the American Administration. Its analysis of the situation in the Middle East is sound  and that is why the United States is urged to take a firmer stand concerning the grave developments resulting from the Israeli policy in Lebanon  Beirut in par¬ticular  the Palestinian problem and the problem of the Middle East in general.167.	We welcome the initiative  which contains many ^ positive elements and constitutes a major step towards a just solution of the Palestinian problem and a fair and comprehensive settlement. Meanwhile  we have some comments to make on parts of this initiative which we hope will be considered by the United States Administration. There will certainly be ample time and opportunity for such reconsideration when discussions start with the parties concerned. How¬ever  what is essential in the final analysis is that sustained efforts be made to give effect to this ini¬tiative as quickly as possible  before it is overtaken by events or eroded by maneuvers such as those we have witnessed recently.168.	At the same time we urge the Government of Israel to reconsider its negative attitude to the Reagan initiative  to respect the framework of international legality by ceasing the establishment of settlements and desisting from its policies of annexation and assimila¬tion and to treat the population of the West Bank  including east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  in accord¬ance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention. We urge Israel not to adopt an inflexible attitude but to respond positively to the appeal made by the highest authority in the United States.169.	We also urge the PLO to reassess the present situation in all its aspects  re-examine our suggestion for simultaneous mutual recognition  and reaffirm its adherence to all the United Nations resolutions relevant to the question of Palestine  in order to facilitate a dialogue with the United States  thus enabling the PLO to participate in the dialogue with all the parties directly concerned with this question. In turn  such a dialogue would enable the American Administration to communicate on a basis of equality with all the parties concerned.170.	In that context  we appreciate the statement made by Yasser Arafat  Chairman of the Executive Committee of the PLO  to the effect that he accepts all United Nations resolutions relevant to the ques-tion of Palestine. We consider this statement to be a step in the right direction. This attitude deserves respect and encouragement  as it reflects a sound appraisal and understanding of the situation and its imperatives.171.	There was yet another development when the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference adopted unani-mously another peace plan on 8 September 1982. Some might take issue with one or other aspect of the plan  but many positive elements in it cannot be overlooked or minimized. Also  the political significance implicit in a consensus among Arab heads of State or Government on such a plan should not be overlooked. The Arabs have spoken with one voice in Fez  opting in clear and unequivocal terms for a comprehensive peace based on justice. The Arab States are willing to pursue the course of a negotiated peaceful settlement based on mutual recognition.172.	The principles and broad outline embodied in the Fez resolutions constitute an acceptable basis for negotiation. They may require mechanisms or pro¬cedures  executive preparatory measures or transi¬tional arrangements  but  taken with the other existing initiatives  the Fez resolutions are capable of being translated into a practical  just and acceptable form.173.	By the same token  I have to reiterate that Egypt does not exclude any other initiative designed to make it possible to forge ahead towards a just  peaceful and comprehensive settlement. In this connection  reference should be made to the European initiative  the Romanian initiative  the Soviet initiative and the ideas put forward by the Secretary-General.174.	By a natural process of association  talking about Fez leads me to touch on Egyptian-Arab relations. Egypt has been intrinsically an Arab country for the past 14 centuries. The genuinely Arab character of Egypt can be neither made nor unmade by a decision. Egypt is far beyond being affected by one country and regime  or a number of countries and regimes  which may call into question its genuine Arab char¬acter. The Arabism of Egypt  metaphorically speaking  is like a tree  deeply rooted for 14 centuries  watered by the blood of the martyrs who have fallen in battle in defense of Palestinian rights on many occasions  indicating the position of Egypt as it has stood firmly for Arab rights from Morocco to the Gulf States  from the turn of this century until today.175.	We may have disagreed with some of our brothers  and we may still be in disagreement  over a number of issues but we call upon Arab countries to stand united in the face of the crucial challenges confronting the entire Arab nation today. Egypt will continue to exert every effort to that end. We are confident that Arab solidarity will surmount those Arab differences and disputes.176.	I have talked at some length about the situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian problem  the core of that conflict  and in conclusion I should like to tackle two important points. The first relates to the deteriorating conditions in Lebanon. The situation is still fraught with danger; it still threatens to explode  engulfing Lebanon and spreading beyond. We in Egypt reject the claim that the continuing Israeli occupation is a necessity or that it protects anybody. The existence in Lebanon of foreign military occupa¬tion resulting from invasion would be the principal cause of any further deterioration. We maintain our unshakable belief that the solution lies in the with¬drawal of the Israeli invasion forces from all Lebanese territory to its internationally recognized borders.177.	All foreign forces must withdraw from Lebanon  but the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces should neither be conditional on nor relate to any other presence. Israel must realize by now that its view concerning the situation in the Middle East is erroneous  that its understanding of conditions in Lebanon is superficial. It results not from any under¬standing of reality but from the arrogance of power. The presence of Israel in Lebanon will not lead to stability in that country but will  rather  intensify the waste and destruction there. That may be what Israel wants; it is certainly what Israel is accomplishing. But Israel will not long escape the consequences  unless it hastens to correct the situation  unless its wise men or its friends correct the situation  before the oppor¬tunity is missed and it is too late.178.	We urge the United States  the super-Power that is in a position effectively to influence several situations in the area  and which is providing Israel with the tools of power and the means of life  to restrain Israel without delay  as President Eisenhower did in 1957.179.	Israel dishonored all its pledges and guaran¬tees under the agreement reached on the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut when Israeli troops pushed into west Beirut and inside the refugee camps of innocent Palestinian civilians in Sabra and Shatila unleashing their henchmen and lackeys  murderers and assassins to butcher children  babies  women and elderly men who were under the protection of the Israeli occupation army  on a dark day of shame for Israel.180.	The basic solution to the Lebanese problem lies in respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and Arab character of Lebanon  the unity of its people and Government and the safe¬guarding of the rights of all its citizens on a basis of equality  coexistence and co-operation.181.	At the same time  we advise our brothers in Lebanon  irrespective of their creed  affiliations  aspi-rations or position  to make the unity of their State and their people their highest concern. They are required to stand united in these crucial moments to enable Lebanon to weather this stormy crisis and restore their country to its traditional pride and traditional pros¬perity. In this connection  Egypt wishes all success to President Amin Gemayel  Lebanon's new Presi¬dent  in his challenging mandate  and hopes that his election will be a major step towards stability  inde¬pendence and the termination of foreign occupation.182.	I have touched on the painful events taking place in the heart of the Arab world. On its eastern frontiers  a ferocious war between Iran and  Iraq has entered its third year posing grave perils to the stability  resources and the well-being of the Middle East.183.	We know all about the latest of the repeated Iranian invasions of Iraq. We are also familiar with Iran's rejection of all attempts at a settlement and of all peace mediations. Iran  instead  is determined to continue the war against Iraq. Iraq has already with¬drawn or at least is ready to withdraw from all Iranian territory. Iraq has also made public its readiness to accept peace mediations and its responsiveness to efforts for a settlement. We call upon the Iranian Government to opt for peace and to revoke all claims that could engender conflicts and rekindle the con¬flagration.184.	As an Arab country which believes in the terri¬torial integrity of the Arab nation  and confident of the Government of Iraq's acceptance of peace initiatives  Egypt declares that it will support Iraq in defense of the Iraqi people and territory.185.	Peace for Egypt is a profound conviction and a full commitment. Consequently  despite the colossal obstacles obstructing our pain towards a peaceful settlement in the Middle East  Egypt will never resign itself to despair  but will persist unwaveringly in exerting all efforts to achieve a peace based on justice  which alone can ensure permanence and continuity.186.	Egypt's commitment to peace is not exclusive  but transcends the Middle East to spread to other regions of the world. Egyptian positions on world issues emanate from one consistent and constant prin-ciple. We call for the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and negotiation  and through respect for international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.187.	These are our expectations and aspirations. They are not dreams  because through our common and concerted efforts  they could be translated into realities of life  to help create a better world for our posterity and all future generations."
"46",2200,"ESP",37,1982,"Sir  in congratulating Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the presidency  I wish to express the confidence of the Spanish delegation in his experience and knowledge of the questions that we shall be discussing and assure him of our co-operation to ensure that this thirty-seventh session will be crowned with success.199.	I should also like to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Kittani  who conducted the work of the Assembly during the past year with a sense of impartiality and wisdom that we all should recognize and appreciate.200.	For the first time in the history of the Organization  the responsibility of conducting the work of the Secretariat has fallen to a Latin American. Spain shares the satisfaction and legitimate pride of Peru and all the peoples of Latin America. Today we reiterate our confidence  already confirmed by the facts  in the political skill of Mr. Perez de Cuellar. His experience and ability  well known to us  have been manifested in recent months during critical times at which he has shown himself capable of placing his full efforts at the service of the cause of peace with patience  wisdom and dedication.201.	During the year that has elapsed since the beginning of the last session of the Assembly  it could not be said that the United Nations has reached the goals of international co-operation and coexistence laid down in the Charter. In addition to problems inherited from the past  we have seen new tension and conflicts emerge with their tragic sequel of loss of human lives  irreparable damage  suffering and the development of potentially still more dangerous situations. Unfortunately  all this casts greater discredit upon the Organization. Both in disarmament and in the progress of economic co-operation  two serious questions  progress has been practically nonexistent.202.	My country has been a member of the Security Council for some two years. From this position of responsibility we have been able to take an active part in the consideration of matters such as the Middle East conflict  the situation in southern Africa  the crisis in Lebanon and the problem of the Malvinas.203.	In each case  we have maintained an absolutely independent position  based on the application of principles of our foreign policy in defence of the Charter and of the resolutions adopted in the United Nations. We have constantly endeavoured to ensure that the action of the Council was sufficiently prompt and effective to prevent open confrontations and loss of human life.204.	The Spanish delegation has taken part both in the deliberations of the Council and in negotiations among its members and interested parties in the solution of conflicts. When we have felt that our initiative was necessary  we have placed before the Council draft resolutions inspired by those principles and by humanitarian reasons.205.	At times our efforts have led to the adoption of resolutions. At other times  they have been blocked. Unfortunately  some countries have placed greater trust in victory by arms than in the fruits of dialogue and negotiation. We are at least left with the satisfaction of knowing that we have put forward appeals and proposals for peace  negotiation and compromise when there was still time to prevent bloodshed. Still  a minimum of lucidity suggests that once again  this year  the reason of force has made more headway than has the force of reason.206.	During the past year  Spain has pursued its course towards full membership in the political  economic and defence institutions of the world to which it belongs. It has done so faithful to its European and Western vocation and aware that the defence of its national interests and of international peace and progress required the full normalization of its presence in its natural forums and aware also that through that normalization it was serving the objectives of equality and absolute and uncompromising defence of its own sovereignty. These are objectives which are best served by participation rather than by maintaining anomalous positions of dissociation and indirect links with those forums. This was required by our history  our culture and our own geographical situation and made possible by the full restoration of the political values of freedom and pluralistic democracy.207.	We are taking our place in Europe and the West. We are doing so in conditions of equality and respect for our sovereignty  overcoming the merely indirect relationship which previously existed. We have done so aware that it does not diminish but rather enhances our independence for outside action and our capacity for activity in the world; good proof of this has been our involvement with the Security Council.208.	We have done so with the certainty that our action is not directed against anyone but only in favour of our national interests and rightsóaware  finally  that the historic restitution of Spain to a position of equality with the rest of the West enriches and gives meaning  depth and coherence to the other innate and profound dimension of our historical being  the Latin American dimension  and at the same time encourages our involvement in other forums of particular relevance  such as relations with the Mediterranean  Arab and African nations.209.	In recent years  our relations with the brother peoples of America have grown spectacularly in the area of economic  commercial and technical exchanges  cultural and educational co-operation and Spain's presence  contacts and full participation in the institutional framework being shaped by that community of nations.210.	Thus  we have now become members of ECLA and observers in the Andean Pact and we have  as full-fledged members  subscribed to the Andres Bello Convention this year and the Hipolito Inanue and Simon Rodriguez conventions in 1981. It is clear that greater involvement by Spain in its environment enables its presence in the Americas and the Americas' presence in Spain to have greater depth  impetus and promise.211.	But  above all  we maintain with Latin America a common political will  seeking to ensure that in the United Nations and in other international forums to which Spain belongs we can advance and defend tin problems and just causes of those brother nations which Spain defends as its own.212.	These months of crises and international problems have been particularly difficult for Latin America. The grave situation in Central America  with its tragic spiral of violence and tension which threaten to spill over the borders of the States of that region  is taking on alarming proportions. The instability is growing through the deterioration of national economies;  aggravated by adverse international economic factors and a lack of understanding on the part of the economically powerful countries  which reduce to cold figures the treatment of issues so basic to Latin America as trade of commodities  on which the development and survival of entire peoples depend.213.	Various plans and peace proposals for Central America have not attained the objectives set. The coherent and reasonable plan of President Lopez Portillo of Mexico  proposals for Central American meetings emanating from Panama have not reached a stage of maturity and execution because the common horizon is darkened by misunderstanding and violence.214.	Spain is continuing to give priority attention to and show greater concern for the development of the Central American tragedy. We consider it necessary to design a pattern of solutions based on a number of basic ideas  which in our judgement could be the following: rejection of so-called military solutions  which lack effectiveness; reliance on political negotiations involving all national forces; an appeal to the principle of non-intervention  which must be applied strictly in Latin America to ensure that each people can determine its own fate; a willingness to assist in the consolidation of democratic and pluralistic alternatives  convinced of the need to organize peaceful coexistence on the basis of a respect for life and freedom and the requirements of social justice; and unequivocal and indiscriminate condemnation of the violation of human rights  without any territorial or ideological exceptions.215.	In affirming these ideas the Spanish Government will always be ready to contribute its efforts and determination  as we have said before in United Nations forums and as we publicly proclaimed in the Bogota Declaration last August. Spain understands the deep roots of the problems of these nations. We feel these problems as our own  and we know that it is unrealistic to trust that the course of time or unilateral formulas will resolve them  because the Central American situation needs solutions urgently  before it deteriorates into a conflict affecting the entire area and becomes one of the major focal points of world crisis.216.	The renewed Central American tragedy is even more regrettable in that it is avoidable. All that is necessary is a collective commitment to respect borders; to give Central American States the assurance that there will be no interference and that there will be self-determination for their peoples; to refrain from sabre-rattling  which makes neighbouring countries nervous and causes them to give the acquisition of weapons precedence over the satisfaction of social needs; to make the necessary effort to modernize their societies and encourage scrupulous respect for human rights. If we all dedicate ourselves to the task of encouraging the restoration of social and political balances  facilitating negotiation between democratic and representative forces and avoiding the possible dead-end of armed confrontation and political polarization  we shall have embarked upon a road leading to peace and stability in the entire zone. The Spanish Government whole-heartedly desires that peace and stability and is prepared to co-operate fully  together with sister republics of Latin America  in the achievement of that noble objective.217.	Another focal point of tension in Latin America has been in the South Atlantic  where a colonial situation has led to bloodshed and a tragic war. The Spanish Government has followed with concern and anxiety the development of the armed conflict in the Malvinas  a confrontation which should never have happened and which could have been avoided if appeals for dialogue and negotiation  insistently repeated by Spain  had been heeded. It is well known that my country made a number of attempts  both bilaterally and internationally  to halt the escalation towards a senseless and anachronistic war  in an effort to avoid bloodshed  the enormous material losses and the opening of a huge abyss of resentment and misunderstanding between Latin America and Europe. The Secretary-General and other countries joined in this effort  but our appeals were not heeded  with the disastrous consequences of which we all know.218.	It is now our duty  since it was impossible to avoid war  to redouble our efforts to ensure peace in the future. To that end Spain  which opposed the use of force as a means of settling international disputes from the beginning of the crisis  considers it indispensable that negotiations on the substance of the problem be opened  the substance being none other than decolonization of the Territory  in order to achieve a diplomatic solution which would contemplate the restoration of the territorial integrity of Argentina and safeguarding and guaranteeing the legitimate interests and rights of the population of the Malvinas. This is the only way we can definitively eliminate the roots of a conflict which would otherwise become a permanent source of tension and destabilization throughout the region  with the foreseeable negative impact on relations between Europe and Latin America  which we believe must be harmonious and must be improved.219.	In recent months the situation in the Middle East has continually worsened. Despite the existence of some positive elements  such as the recovery of the whole of the Sinai by Egypt  other developments  such as the illegal annexation of the Golan Heights and  more recently  the brutal armed intervention by Israel in Lebanon  with its consequent tragedies  have posed a constant challenge to the international community and have seriously disturbed the conscience of mankind.220.	Spain has co-operated actively in the Security Council in the search for a solution and humanitarian activities to alleviate the sufferings of the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples. The results achieved have been modest. The resolutions of the Security Council  which are binding upon all Member States  have remained ineffective. We have seen the powerlessness of the Organization to prevent the invasion of Lebanon  the assault upon Beirut and  in a context in which the horror of the deed was much greater than any political consideration  the sacrifice of hundreds of innocent victims in the Palestinian refugee camps  an act of barbarism such as we had thought was a thing of the past.221.	In the ruins of Beirut and the renewed tragedy of the Palestinian people  however  some elements can be perceived that would seem to point towards the beginning of a solution. For many years Spain has stated in this forum that any solution to the Middle East conflict must necessarily include recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people.222.	The principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) remain valid and include withdrawal from all the occupied territories and the right of all States of the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  a right which Spain accepts  recognizes and respects and from which it excludes none. But together with this recognition it is necessary to view the Palestinian phenomenon in its full dimensions. Spain welcomes the new proposals  especially the Arab plan prepared in Fez  with optimism. These are gaining growing acceptance as containing all the political elements necessary to ensure a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem.223.	Spain seeks to intensify its co-operation with all the countries of Africa  being closely involved with the problems affecting that continent. We feel ourselves linked with those countries  more especially the northern African countries  for reasons which go beyond immediate geographical proximity  including the old historical and cultural ties which unite us with the Arab nation.224.	Spain's determination to maintain permanent and fruitful co-operation with the neighbouring countries of the Maghreb is well known  as is our desire to ensure that the problem of Western Sahara is solved to the satisfaction of all parties  in accordance with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU and the expression of the will of the people.?25. We believe that a decisive role must be played by the OAU in the solution of the problems of the continent and in eliminating the tension existing today. Spain's determination to co-operate in the African continent  expressed both in our political statements and in our growing links of co-operation wit: various countries of that continent  is of signal value in the case of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  a Spanish-speaking African nation now going through a vital stage of renovation of its political institutions with the approval by referendum of a new constitution and is making great efforts for economic development and reorganization. Spain views with satisfaction the convening  under the auspices of the United Nations  of a pledging conference for that Republic  a conference in which it took an active part. It will continue to enhance its links of co-operation with that nation  always adapting them to the will expressed by the people and Government of that nation  in strict respect for its options  its independence and its sovereignty.226. With respect to the problem of Namibia  we view with concern the fact that our hopes for an imminent settlement are now meeting with new and growing difficulties. Spain considers necessary the immediate implementation of the plans for the independence of the Territory contained essentially in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  whose principles and provisions we support.227.	We reiterate our rejection of the heinous practice of apartheid which constitutes not only a flagrant violation of human rights but a source of grave tension endangering peace and security in the Region and representing a permanent challenge to the Organization.228.	With regard to the problem of Cyprus  we favour the continuation of all efforts to relaunch  under the auspices of the Organization  the intercommunal dialogue upon which the future of peaceful coexistence favouring the economic development of the Cypriot people must be based  in order to ensure that a satisfactory solution may be achieved on the basis of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.229.	In other areas of the world there remain tension and armed confrontations to which the Organization must attempt to put an end. The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  to cite only one example  has now lasted for more than two years  with enormous losses of human lives and suffering for both parties. The Spanish Government views with distress and concern this conflict between two friendly countries and is prepared to support every effort designed to achieve a solution.230.	With regard to Afghanistan  three years after the invasion there is still no glimpse of a solution to this foreign armed intervention which we have repeatedly denounced. We must continue to insist on the exercise of international pressure to bring about the liberation of Afghanistan. Therefore we hope that the General Assembly will reiterate its resolutions demanding the withdrawal of the foreign military forces and calling for the restoration of Afghanistan as a free and independent country.231.	In Gibraltar there persists a situation which must be brought to an end according to the recommendations of the United Nations  through negotiation between Spain and the United Kingdom. This principle has been accepted by the British Government  which  in signing the Declaration of Lisbon^ committed itself to resolving through negotiation with Spain all differences concerning Gibraltar  in a spirit of friendship and in conformity with relevant resolutions of the United Nationsóa commitment that was reiterated on later occasions.232.	The climate of dialogue and understanding  the favourable climate which must necessary precede or accompany a negotiation which for us is of decisive importance  was modified by subsequent events which have brought about postponements. There have been circumstances that have affected negatively the intensity  the earnestness  the seriousness and the depth which these negotiations require. The course of authentic negotiation is the course that Spain has long since chosen  in conformity with the United Nations decisions and parallel with activities in other forums  it is also the only possible course. We are convinced that the persistence of a situation such as this is contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter  as the Assembly has repeatedly declared. We also believe that two democratic countries such as Spain and the United Kingdom must resolve this problem by the civilized method of dialogue and negotiation. However  the negotiation must be authentic and conducted m good faith  and cover  of course  all the elements of the problem and essentially the one constituting the very root of the dispute: the question of sovereignty. Any attempt to avoid that element because of temporary circumstances  however strong the passions aroused  would constitute a grave responsibility and could endanger the process of resolving the problem as it has been set forth.233.	With regard to the population of Gibraltar  I wish to reiterate once more that Spain accepts the idea that its interests must be borne in mind and fully safeguarded in the negotiations and that the preservation and promotion of their well-being and the protection of their rights must also be part of the solution of the problem. The Spanish Government has no hostility towards that population  nor has it any intention of interfering with its citizenship or any other questions of that nature in its relations with the United Kingdom.234.	Spain has the irrevocable objective of restoring its territorial integrity by recovering? through negotiations with the United Kingdom  that portion of its territory  while preserving the interests  rights and well-being of the population. This has been the doctrine of the United Nations  according to which the principle of territorial integrity  enshrined in paragraph 6 of the Declaration in Assembly resolution 1314 (XV)  is applicable in this case  taking precedence over any other criterion. This doctrine has been estate listed by the United Nations in an irreversible dear and manifest manner for the solution of this problem.233. I wish to refer to various matters which demonstrate both the essential nature of the work we are doing in the Organization and the lack of effectiveness -chat the Organization has  unfortunately  had in recent years.236.	The first is the matter of human rights  which by its very nature is the ultimate goal of all political activity and of all organizations such as this one. Proper observance of human rights is the key to the peaceful solution of national and international problems.237.	Spain values respect for these rights nationally and internationally  with the intensity and passion of one who has recovered something he lost. The constitutional recognition of the value of international and European claims in this matter  the acceptance of all mechanisms for monitoring at the international and European levels  the full participation and assumption of initiatives in every facet of the work of the Council of Europe  the United Nations and other bodies in these fieldsóthese are clearly well known and demonstrate the sincerity of our position. There remains a great deal to be done in the protection and safeguarding of human rights  removing this question  as I have said before  from the geographical or ideological limitations with which it is sometimes viewed  limitations which because of their basic insincerity prevent effective progress from being made.238.	The first human right is the right to life  a right which is being infringed every day by terrorists. Terrorism crosses all borders and there must be international co-operation in order effectively to combat it. On previous occasions we have spoken of that necessity and  more specifically  I stated the following to the Assembly at the thirty-sixth session:""... we cannot compromise with terrorists without endangering peace. No one can claim to be persecuted for political reasonsóan allegation all too often made by the terroristóif that person is free in a free political society. Wherever political change can be sought without risk through regular elections allowing free expression of every option  none can claim to be persecuted for political reasons. There are no political offenders in a real democracy: if it is a democracy they do not exist; if they exist it is hot a democracy.""It is abnormal to impose by force a nonexistent and brutal 'right' to kill and to seek protection outside one's borders  claiming that political freedom is needed when it already exists.""239.	That co-operation for which I appealed last year is something that we have called for and sought firmly and emphatically  in all its dimensions and in all forums in which we are represented. In European and Western forums  as in international organizations  we have contributed to creating sensitivity to and arousing awareness of the immoral and obnoxious character of terrorism and of its serious social and political aspects. The progress achieved  however  should not lead us to forget the continued existence  in increasingly isolated cases  of indifference or lack of solidarity  the explanation of which can only lie in short-sighted and suicidal egoism  and which is particularly serious and painful when the countries concerned have common borders.240.	Another aspect which an international organization must constantly bear in mind in dealing with human rights is the situation of immigrants. If there is a group of human beings who  together with refugees  deserve international understanding and protection they are immigrants. Spain will continue to work for the adoption of a set of clear and precise rules effectively protecting the rights of immigrants and foreign workers  who need legal protection  social solidarity and economic security. The Government of Spain has presented specific proposals and working documents to the General Assembly designed to bring about a speedy international agreement guaranteeing the rights of migrant workers.241. Not only has the international economic picture failed to improve but all indicators suggest that it may deteriorate still further in coming months. The financial crisis which threatens to distort the entire international monetary system and imbalances in commodity markets which affect the most vulnerable economies are leading the least developed countries into increasingly untenable situations.242. Spain favours global negotiations conducted within the framework of the United Nations. The preparations for the negotiations should be open to all States concerned to avoid the danger of a repetition of the problems that arose in connection with the North-South dialogue. The experience of recent years has demonstrated the interdependence of the different economies  which are affected by global problems which can only be solved through proposals and negotiations in which all the interested parties are involved.243.	It is obvious that one of the reasons for the economic difficulties is the arms race. In this field Spain  as is evident and is recognized by all  has made national defence  politically  internationally and militarily  genuine defence  without threatening anyone  and proclaims its concern about the arms race as well as the evasiveness and insincerity of those who really could contribute to disarmament.244.	The Government of Spain has taken many initiatives in this field and supports all initiatives which  based on realism and the effective preservation of security and balance and not on Manichean consideration or the desire to spread propaganda  could lead to progress in this field.245.	On 12 October the decade that will culminate in 1992  the date which will mark the five-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America  will begin. When on that dawn in 1492 the three Spanish vessels reached the coast of America  communication was established between the old lands of Europe and a fabulous new continent which its discoverers called the New World. The earth became round and history became universal.246.	Let me recall that event to the Organization the very aim of which is universality. The role played by Spain in that discovery justifies my mentioning to the Assembly now a proposal by the Dominican Republic that the Assembly declare the year 1992 the year of the five-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America. The Spanish Government supports and welcomes that initiative without reservation.247.	We believe that the responsibility for commemorating the five-hundredth anniversary of the discovery should be universal  so as to bring to every comer of the world and to the mind of all the memory of the American past  its present reality and its future promiseóa future in which Spain sees one of the great hopes of our time."
"47",2272,"ETH",37,1982,"  At the outset  Mr. President  my delegation would like to congratulate you on your unanimous election to guide the work of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. Your election is a recognition of your rich experience  personal qualities and statesmanship. It is also a fitting tribute to your country  the People’s Republic of Hungary  a country with which Ethiopia enjoys strong ties of friendship and cooperation  and a recognition of the outstanding contributions it has made towards peace and international understanding. I also pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the skill with which he guided the work of the thirty sixth session. I should also like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of my delegation to the Secretary General for the able manner in which he is serving the cause of peace and progress. Thirty seven years after its establishment  the United Nations is still far from meeting the challenge of ensuring international peace and security. As a result of the exacerbation of existing conflicts  the creation of new hotbeds of tension  the acute global economic crisis and the ever increasing danger of a nuclear holocaust  mankind today lives under the shadow of total annihilation. The ray of hope that flickered with the birth of the United Nations  which was conceived to avert conflicts and promote international peace and cooperation is  regrettably  being dimmed. Contrary to the obligations entered into by Member States under the Charter  and despite the lip service so readily paid to its lofty ideals  the violation of its cardinal principles is increasingly becoming a habit rather than an occasional lapse. Today  wars of aggression are openly condoned  dying tension revived  and new conflicts fomented. International law continues to be flouted with impunity by those in the well known imperialist circles  whose interest in exploitation and dreams of expansion have been undermined by the mighty tide of national liberation and social emancipation. The frustrating outcome of the second special session on disarmament is a reflection of the precariousness of the prevailing international situation. The unwillingness of some Members to be parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which has been finalized after more than eight years of painstaking negotiations  could adversely affect one of the major undertakings of the United Nations. The lack of political will on the part of the developed world to make possible the launching of global negotiations on the new international economic order and the overall heightening of tension on a global scale are disturbing trends. Twenty two years ago the General Assembly adopted its historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By invoking this Declaration  a number of countries gained their independence and joined the family of free nations. Yet colonialism and racism in their most vile forms continue to be practiced in southern Africa. The racist regime in Pretoria  with the political  economic and military support of its imperialist allies  continues not only to subjugate the black majority in South Africa but also to consolidate its colonial occupation of the international Territory of Namibia. Harassment  imprisonment  torture and racial indignity are the daily lot of the masses of South Africa and Namibia  who have been cruelly deprived of even the most basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore  the	regime  acting as the agent of imperialism  is busy sowing the seeds of terrorism and destabilization in the entire sub region of southern Africa. The frontline States have become prime targets for unprovoked acts of aggression by racist Pretoria. To us Africans  and indeed to all peoples the world over that cherish peace and freedom  the delay in Namibia’s accession to independence and the attempt to perpetuate the policy of apartheid in South Africa are outrageous in the extreme. The international community is fully aware that the terrorist regime in Pretoria  in collusion with its imperialist allies  is leaving no stone unturned in its bid to keep Namibia in its Fascist clutches. The independence process of Namibia has stalled because of Pretoria’s intransigence and the acquiescence of the Western contact group in its dilatory tactics. Without the accession of Namibia to genuine independence and the complete dismantling of the racist edifice of apartheid objectives to which all of us appear to be committed durable peace in Africa  and indeed in the world at large  will remain elusive. We therefore cannot and must not allow the obstructionist and dilatory tactics of Pretoria to delay or compromise the inevitable independence of Namibia. In this connection Ethiopia once again calls for the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 433. We reject each and every stratagem designed to introduce questions that are of no relevance to the issue and fall strictly within the purview of the sovereign jurisdiction of independent States. Indeed  we strongly condemn the contrived issue of the so called Cuban presence in Angola as a blatant and impudent infringement of the sovereign rights of the People’s Republic of Angola. While supporting all viable initiatives within the framework of the United Nations plan for Namibia  Ethiopia believes that  in the absence of the political will to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions  resolution 433 will remain a dead letter. In the present circumstances  Ethiopia feels duty bound to continue to render political support and material assistance  within its modest means  for the intensification of the legitimate armed struggle being so resolutely waged by SWAPO  the sole and authentic representative of the people of Namibia. Furthermore  Ethiopia pledges its unswerving support for the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle to build a democratic society based on racial equality and majority rule. Similarly  Ethiopia reaffirms its support for and solidarity with the peoples and Governments of the frontline States of southern Africa  which must remain vigilant in defense of independence and human dignity against an undeclared war by the Fascist Pretoria regime. Pretoria  having failed in its strategy of maintaining racist and colonial regimes around its borders  has now embarked on establishing in southern Africa a belt of instability as yet another weapon for the defense of the abhorrent system. Today it is not only Angola that is the target of racist and imperialist forces. Lesotho  Mozambique and Zimbabwe  as well as Seychelles  a State that has no common boundary with South Africa  are under the constant threat of acts of banditry and sabotage emanating from South Africa. Indeed  armed bandits and mercenaries organized and trained by the Fascist regime of South Africa with the connivance of international imperialism are at this very moment carrying out acts of terrorism  murder and pillage in the People’s Republic of Mozambique. In the face of these developments  the international community must therefore render both diplomatic and material assistance to Mozambique in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  to enable that country to strengthen its defense capabilities to ensure respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this regard  it is with great pleasure that I hail the victory once again scored by the people and Government of Seychelles over the forces of racism and imperialism. Encircled by a chain of military bases and interventionist forces  my own country is under constant danger. The forces of reaction  subversion  armed banditry and terrorism  bankrolled and equipped by international imperialism and its surrogates  are orchestrated to undermine the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. Rocked by internal crises and strife  the despotic regime of Mogadishu has  since early July 1982  been making allegations of an Ethiopian invasion of its territory. With regard to those unfounded and self serving allegations  there are a number of facts that the international community needs to bear in mind. First  Ethiopia neither covets nor has it ever claimed any portion of the territory of Somalia. On the contrary  it is Somalia which  in a systematic violation of the terms of United Nations instruments that brought about its emergence in 1960 as an independent country on the map of Africa  continues to be obsessed by an expansionist dream at the expense of its neighbors. Contrary to the cardinal principles of the Charter and to the decisions of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity  Somalia has over the past two decades repeatedly committed a series of brazen aggressions against its neighbors  especially my country  with the purpose of realizing its territorial ambitions. Secondly  the international community  including those members that are today cynically shedding crocodile tears over the conveniently fabricated invasion of Somalia by Ethiopia  can surely testify to the fact that it was Somalia which committed an unprovoked and massive aggression against my country in July 1977. Since Ethiopia was in the midst of a far reaching revolution  the Mogadishu regime  in collusion with its imperialist and reactionary allies  had calculated that the time was opportune to strike at my country with a view to realizing Somalia’s expansionist ambitions and destabilizing the Ethiopian revolution. In this connection  it may be recalled that even when the invading army had penetrated 700 kilometers into Ethiopian territory  the Ethiopian defense forces that routed the invading army early in the following year did not sweep the enemy to the shores of the Indian Ocean in hot pursuit  even though they had the capacity and the moral right to do so. As everyone will recall  our defense forces stopped at the international boundary between the two countries. That is an undeniable fact. Similarly  the record of Ethiopia’s policy of good neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperation with its other neighbors  namely  the Republics of Djibouti  Kenya and the Sudan  eloquently speaks fbr itself. The national objective of our revolution has been repeatedly stated on several occasions. If Ethiopia has declared any war  it is a war on the enemies of mankind: hunger  disease and ignorance. Our revolution is irrevocably committed to advancing the material and spiritual wellbeing of the Ethiopian people. The linchpin of our foreign policy is likewise peace  progress and the promotion of good neighbourliness. Since the achievement of those objectives compels us to devote all our energies and resources to national reconstruction  Ethiopia has neither the need nor the intention to launch an invasion against Somalia. It is obvious that the myth of the Ethiopian invasion has been fabricated by Mogadishu and its imperialist and reactionary patrons as a convenient pretext both to arm Somalia to pursue its territorial ambitions against its neighbors and to strengthen the imperialist military bases and the interventionist forces in Somalia. The truth is that under the leadership of the Somalia Salvation Democratic Front and the Somalia Liberation Movement  the Mejertin  Issaq  Dulbahanti  Haberawel and other oppressed nationalities of Somalia have taken up arms to rid themselves of the tyranny of the oligarchy based in the Merehan clan. The popular movements to which I have just referred have repeatedly and unequivocally declared to the world that they take full responsibility for the civil war now raging in Somalia. Hence  no amount of gross fabrication and distraction on the part of the Mogadishu regime and its collaborators can conceal the realities of the situation. Furthermore  it is evident that international imperialism and its surrogates in the area  particularly the archaic feudal potentates who could not even unite to combat genocide and help the Palestinian children falling at their doorsteps  are shamelessly echoing Somalia’s allegations. In their policy statements in the general debate of the current session and in other forums  those Governments have  regrettably  expressed concern over an alleged interState conflict in the Horn of Africa. To be concerned about the actual state of relations between two neighboring countries is one thing  but to lament an internal turmoil within a given country  a turmoil arising from an oppressive rule  is a totally different matter. My Government therefore reiterates its categorical and unequivocal rejection of the baseless allegations levelled against Ethiopia and once again calls upon the Governments that show such misplaced concern to see the situation for what it is  namely  an internal struggle between the regime in Mogadishu and liberation forces opposed to its oppressive rule. In this context  I must underscore the fact that some of those Governments that are currently raising a false alarm were either arming and financing the aggressor or maintained a dead silence in 1977  when Ethiopia was the victim of Somalia’s aggression. The position they have taken now is thus as transparent as it is self serving. Let me reaffirm once again that peace in the Home of Africa will reign only when Somalia eschews its territorial claims over its neighbors. The benefactors of the Mogadishu regime could therefore make a positive contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the area if they could persuade it to abide by the cardinal principles and decisions of the United Nations  the nonaligned movement  and the OAU  including the decisions of the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held at Nairobi in August 1981. Providing it with weapons and funds indulge in an unrealizable dream and destructive ventures can only exacerbate tension and conflict in the Horn of Africa. Africa’s endeavors to forge continental unity have often been the target of bedevilment and attacks by its enemies. In spite of the numerous obstacles that the enemies of unity have set before it over the last 19 years  African unity still remains a force to be reckoned with. The OAU  which was conceived to ensure the freedom and peace as well as the economic development of our continent  has in the last 19 years scored remarkable achievements. Only its detractors would dare deny its outstanding contributions to the decolonization process. Nevertheless  imperialist forces to whose interests the success of the Organization has proved detrimental have left no stone unturned in their devious machinations to drive a wedge between the ranks of its membership. Africa’s strength stems from its unity. Even with the pressure being exerted against it by its imperialist racist adversaries  Africa is resolved not only to determine the course of its own development but also to contribute to the peace and security of the rest of the world. We are therefore convinced that the OAU will remain strong and viable to enable Africa to speak with one voice and to guide effectively the common destiny of the sons and daughters of our great continent. Despite the best efforts of the United Nations  peace in the Middle East still remains elusive. The return of all Arab lands occupied since 1967 to their rightful owners  the exercise of the right to self determination by the Palestinian people  including its right to an independent homeland in Palestine  and respect for the sovereignty and security of all the countries in the area will go a long way towards ensuring durable peace in that region. Israel’s recent invasion of Lebanon and the resulting loss of life and destruction of property have once again thrown the entire region into turmoil. The subsequent massacre in west Beirut of innocent people  after the withdrawal of Palestinian combatants under a guarantee of the safety of their families and other civilians  has shocked and angered the international community. Ethiopia condemns in the strongest terms possible the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people and supports the call for an international investigation of the massacre in west Beirut. In any event  Israel and its imperialist allies cannot escape responsibility for that shameless and inhuman episode. Theimperatives of peace in the Middle East demand that Israel immediately withdraw from the entire territory of Lebanon and unequivocally recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a national homeland of its own. Ethiopia reiterates its full support for the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of its inalienable right to self determination and independence in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU. My Government strongly deplores the arrogant imperialist interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States in Central and Latin America. We reaffirm Ethiopia’s solidarity with the Nicaraguan revolution and the gallant fighters in Central America struggling against imperialism to reassert their inalienable right to guide their own destinies. In Asia  Viet Nam  Kampuchea and Afghanistan are endlessly becoming targets of imperialist provocation and slanderous campaigns. My Government is convinced that the thomy problems of South East Asia and SouthWest Asia could be resolved by the peoples concerned without outside interference. My Government also supports all endeavors aimed at promoting understanding between and the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. With regard to Cyprus  Ethiopia strongly supports all positive efforts designed to bring to an end speedily all factors of disharmony and instability. My delegation insists that the independence  unity  territorial integrity and nonaligned status of Cyprus be fully respected. The reversal of detente and the accelerating pace of the arms race  coupled with the acquisition of new military bases and the provocative behavior of some States  have often again revived the dangerous era of the cold war. In the Race of the deteriorating international situation and the production  stockpiling and deployment of ever more deadly weapons of mass destruction  peace has today become the overriding concern not only of Governments but also of people everywhere  as has been demonstrated by the mounting public protests around the world. In the light of the growing threat of a nuclear holocaust  we are convinced that urgent and concrete measures must be taken to halt and reverse the arms race  particularly in its nuclear aspect  until the attainment of our ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. The ongoing negotiations on strategic arms reduction prompt us not to lose hope despite the many failures we have encountered in our collective endeavors in this field. The expectations and hopes of the international community for a successful conclusion to the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament were shattered. Obviously the main responsibility for that failure is borne by the very forces which have embarked on a policy of massive rearmament and advocacy of dangerous military doctrines such as that of a limited nuclear war. We therefore call upon the Powers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to demonstrate good will and cooperation in expediting negotiations on the comprehensive programme of disarmament so that it can be adopted at an early date. The unilateral undertaking by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons is a significant step coupled with a reciprocal commitment by the other nuclear weapon States  would prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. At its current session the General Assembly has before it two important additional items also proposed by the Soviet Union. While the first deals with the urgent task of the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests  the second proposal underscores the growing need to redouble the efforts aimed at the elimination of the threat of nuclear war and the protection of peaceful nuclear facilities. As a party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons  Ethiopia not only welcomes these important proposals but also urges all Member States to seize the opportunity they provide to halt the arms race  to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of nuclear war andto enhance the development of peaceful nuclear technology. Despite the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  the expansion or modernization of existing military bases and the acquisition of new ones in the area  as well as the deployment of rapid intervention forces and weapons of mass destruction  are being highly intensified. Those actions  contrary to the decisions of the United Nations  continue to endanger international peace and security. In the light of those alarming developments  the holding of a conference on the Indian Ocean is surely long overdue. We are therefore compelled to reiterate our demand for the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  in Colombo  in the first half of 1983  as called for by the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. Similarly  Ethiopia attaches considerable importance to the signing  speedy ratification and implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. An examination of the international economic situation  regrettably  shows an increasing resistance on the part of certain industrialized countries to instituting structural changes in the existing system of international economic relations. The continuing deterioration in the situation of developing countries is assuming alarming proportions  while the economies of the least developed countries are on the verge of collapse. The burden of indebtedness  the low level of foreign exchange earnings  balance of payments difficulties  instability of commodity prices  rising import bills  low level of agricultural productivity and food shortages remain the general characteristics of the economies of the developing countries. In the midst of the grim world economic situation  the condition of most African countries should be a matter of the utmost concern to the international community. It is rather sad to witness today that in Africa food shortages caused by the shortfalls in agricultural output  low productivity  changing ecological and unfavorable weather conditions pre in the process of creating the simplest form of dependence of the continent for its food on the developed North. Food aid has tended in recent years to become a permanent feature of international assistance to the African countries. Today there are no fewer than 21 countries seeking special assistance from the United Nations because of their incapacity to withstand even mild shocks to their economies. This deteriorating situation has been a consequence of the basic structural constraints and other serious limitations. As a result most African countries  especially the least developed ones  have been forced out of the mainstream of international economic life. Unless the international community urgently implements on a priority basis the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  adopted at the Paris Conference the grave economic situation of these countries could soon reach an irreversible state. Indeed  we cannot envisage a solution to the problem of the world economic crisis in general and the least developed countries in particular unless the developed countries make a major political decision to accept and institute fundamental changes in the present international economic system. The growing anarchy in international relations and the ever present threat of a nuclear holocaust indicate that mankind has reached a very critical point in history. In the present circumstances  even decisions by individual States  let alone those taken collectively  are bound to affect the very survival of mankind and its civilization. While peace and progress are the overriding concern of humanity  war and destruction appear to be the hallmark of our era. In this regard  the head of State of my country  Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam  in his statement to the Ethiopian people on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the Ethiopian Revolution  said the following: Today  peace is the most vital issue for which the people of the entire world raise their voice in unison. The demand for the preservation and strengthening of peace  which at present figures top on the agenda of the entire peoples of the world  is also the demand of Ethiopia. The worldwide struggle for peace cannot also be seen separately from the struggle for national liberation  for a just international economic order  for democracy and social process. Unless mankind  collectively and with the utmost urgency  addresses itself to the serious challenges facing it today the consequences will be very grave indeed. Not only is the noble goal of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war likely to remain a mere ideal  but there may be neither a generation to succeed nor a war from which to save it. We must therefore take the present international crisis as an opportunity for introspection and a time for decision to map out a strategy to save humanity from the impending global catastrophe. In such a strategy international confrontation must yield to international cooperation. Scrupulous adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations must be consistently pursued and upheld. Each and every Government must exercise political wisdom  eschew political expediency and act  at all times  in the long term and broader interest of mankind. The time to rise to the supreme challenge of our times is now  for tomorrow may well be too late."
"48",2318,"FIN",37,1982,"It gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  the congratulations of the Government of Finland on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Finns and Hungarians have a common ethnic and linguistic back¬ground spanning thousands of years. This gives a special character to our relationship which was evident during the recent visit by the President of Finland to your country. You personally bring to your high office an exceptionally long experiences in  and profound understanding of  United Nations affairs. These  as well as your determination and patience  will ensure effective guidance of the Assembly's work at this particularly crucial time.243.	The Secretary-General is not only the chief administrative officer of the Organization; he is also the symbol and the guardian of its authority. In Mr. Perez de Cuellar the United Nations has a Secre¬tary-General who has shown that he will perform those functions well. His strength of will—sisu we would call it in Finnish—combined with political realism are both necessary for fulfilling the tasks entrusted to him by the Charter.244.	The new Secretary-General has taken office at a particularly thankless time. Rarely has the interna-tional environment been less amenable to peaceful resolution of disputes by collective action through the United Nations. The Secretary-General himself has made a profound analysis of this situation and the reasons for it. His report on the work of the Organi¬zation gives a graphic description of the erosion of the authority of the Organization. His suggestions for restoring the authority and ability of the United Nations to act are of crucial importance and have the full support of my Government.245.	The viability of the collective security system  as provided for by the Charter  is of particular concern to small countries such as those comprising the Nordic group. The Government of Finland has therefore followed with growing concern the gradual weakening of the United Nations in a world of tension and strife. In a statement made in mid-August on behalf of the Government of Finland  I had occasion to expound on that same theme. The matter was further discussed at the meeting of the Nordic Foreign Ministers in Helsinki who agreed to study amongst themselves and with other Member States which share this concern ways and means to remedy the situation. Taking into account those consultations  we intend to return to this matter in greater detail.246.	As a small neutral country  Finland has sought and found security not through reliance on military alliances but through a foreign policy designed to keep it outside international conflicts and controversies. We have a vested interest in promoting the development of a peaceful and rational world order based on the universal collective security system provided by the Charter. In the words of the Secretary-General: ""Without such a system there will be no reliable defense or shelter for the small and weak. And without such a system all of our efforts on the economic and social side  which also need their own collective impetus  may well falter.""247.	In his report the Secretary-General warns us that we are perilously near to a new international anarchy. In fact  the notion that it pays to use force to solve international problems is gaining currency. Regional and local conflicts have erupted into open warfare. International tension mounts. Relations between great Powers have steadily deteriorated. Confrontation has replaced dialogue and competition has overwhelmed accommodation. The arms race continues. Resources badly needed for the alleviation of poverty and hungers are squandered on the perfec¬tion of instruments of death. Confidence in the pos-sibility of peaceful settlement of disputes is breaking down. The international system which was set up to maintain peace and security and to promote interna¬tional co-operation is in jeopardy.248.	This year has put the United Nations security system to a harsh test. It has to meet this challenge if it wishes to survive. The conflict in th3 MiddleEast has assumed a new dimension of violence compounded by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) led to a bloody military conflict. The war between Iran and Iraq continues  causing devastation and suffering.249.	In addition  the persistent problems of the situation in southern Africa  South-East Asia  Afghani-stan  Central America  Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa stand unresolved. All these remain ques-tions of legitimate concern to the international com¬munity  yet the United Nations has been ignored or pushed aside. Its potential for crisis management and peaceful settlement of disputes has been neglected.250.	The United Nations has not been listened to; there has been scant willingness to use its services. At worst  the authority of the United Nations has been flouted. The abuse of the United Nations for short- term interests has overshadowed its ultimate im¬portance to all Member States as the only universal Organization for finding peaceful and negotiated solu¬tions to global problems.251.	In his report the Secretary-General has proposed concrete measures to halt the erosion of the authority of the United Nations and to restore its capacity to act. The Secretary-General proposes  as a first step  that Governments consciously recommit themselves to the Charter. He proposes that the Security Council keep an active watch on dangerous situations and  if necessary  initiate discussions with the parties before they reach a point of crisis. He considers it useful for the Council to give renewed consideration to reviewing and streamlining its practices and pro¬cedures with a view to acting swiftly and decisively in crises. He appeals to the permanent members of the Security Council to reassess their obligations and to fulfill them at the high level of responsibility indicated in the Charter. He intends to develop a wider and more systematic capability for fact-finding in potential con¬flict areas  in close co-ordination with the Security Council. He proposes that the authority of peace¬keeping operations be underpinned by guarantees  including explicit guarantees for collective or indi¬vidual supportive action. For its part  my Government pledges its full support for all these measures suggested by the Secretary-General.252.	As a matter of consistent policy  Finland has taken a balanced and conciliatory position on the various controversial issues in the world. It is our firm intention to continue this policy. We believe that Finland can best contribute to the search for a just and durable world order through strict and consistent adherence to a policy of neutrality which  while it enjoins us to refrain from taking sides in disputes between the great Powers  enables us to maintain friendly relations with all States across the dividing lines of ideology or military alignments and thus to work whenever possible for the cause of conciliation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Neutral States have  we believe  a special obligation  not only to themselves but to the international community as a whole  to conduct themselves with objectivity and restraint in order to retain the confidence of all sides and thus the ability to perform such peaceful services as may be required in the interests of international peace and security.253.	The situation in the Middle East is often perceived as a regional conflict. This conception belittles the pivotal political  strategic and economic importance of the region  which transcends the regional confines of the conflict. The situation in the Middle East continues to pose the most persistent threat to international peace and security. The dangers inherent in the absence of peace in the Middle East have been demonstrated once again by the events in Lebanon. Israel has invaded and occupied and con¬tinues to occupy a major part of a sovereign State Member of the United Nations  in defiance of the repeated calls by the Security Council and the interna¬tional community as a whole. The tragedy of Lebanon has been compounded by the massacre of hundreds of innocent civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila. On 20 September the Government of Finland expressed its profound shock at that tragic event and gave its full support to Security Council resolution 521 (1982). Having entered west Beirut with the declared aim of maintaining law and order in Beirut  Israel cannot now escape its responsibility for what took place.254.	In the conditions prevailing the immediate concern of the international community has under-standably focused on the crisis in Lebanon. That crisis  however  should be seen in a wider context. It is but a consequence of the unresolved situation in the Middle East as a whole. In our view the basic principles of a peaceful settlement remain immutable. The acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible. Israel therefore must withdraw from territories occupied since 1967. It is equally imperative that the right of Israel and all other States in the area to exist within secure and recognized boundaries be guaranteed. Those principles are embodied in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which we continue to regard as basic. Furthermore  provision must be made for the legitimate rights of the Pal¬estinians  including their right to national self- determination. This presupposes the right of the Palestinians and the PLO  as the most significant representative of their national aspirations  to par¬ticipate in negotiations on their own future within a comprehensive solution in the Middle East.255.	Finland has given its support to all those pro¬posals and initiatives that aim at a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Thus we supported the joint approach by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1977  the Camp David process and the initiatives by the European Community and the King of Saudi Arabia. In this general context  the initiatives by President Reagan and President Brezhnev and the proposals made at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference are of great significance. While these initiatives approach the problem from different premises  they all have a common denominator: the achievement of peace in the Middle East through negotiations. In substance they also have a number of basically identical or similar elements. In line with this general approach  the Government of Finland has recently given its support to another request bom out of the tragic conflict in Lebanon and addressed to the Secretary-General that he exert his influence to convene an international conference on the question of the Middle East.256.	In southern Africa the Namibian problem con¬tinues to pose a basic challenge to the Organization. My country has ties of friendship with the Namibian people that span more than a century. Our commit-ment to early independence for Namibia has been demonstrated by our initiatives and contributions in different United Nations forums. Based on a Finnish initiative  the International Court of Justice declared  in its advisory opinion in 1971  that the presence of South Africa in Namibia was illegal. The United Nations Fund for Namibia and the Nationhood Pro¬gramme for Namibia have also been launched on our initiatives.257.	At present  the urgency of arriving at an inter¬nationally acceptable solution to the question of Namibia is more pressing than ever. We support every effort towards a negotiated settlement and hope that the people of Namibia may be permitted without delay to determine their own future through free and fair elections  under the supervision and control of the United Nations  as provided in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).258.	Finland stands on its own record of contributing to the goal of a free and independent Namibia not only in words  but in deeds. It is natural therefore that we have pledged our best efforts to the imple-mentation of the United Nations plan by making Namibia a major recipient of our bilateral development aid and by keeping a peace-keeping battalion in a state of preparedness should the Security Council and the parties concerned choose to avail themselves of our services in this respect.259.	International tension fuels the arms race  while the arms race feeds on tension. This is the deadly logic of reality. The arms race seems to be out¬stripping all efforts to contain and control it. The continually increasing pace of the arms race ultimately serves the interests of none. Its new technological dimensions may even undermine global strategic stability  however imperfect and fragile. The arms race as a threat to the security of nations was the predominant theme when the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament convened last June. It generated a very high degree of public attention and interest. Anxiety about the danger of nuclear war had given rise to an increasingly active world public. It would be a mistake to belittle its significance. For all the intense work and bargaining  the special session failed to produce a commonly acceptable substantive document.260.	Progress or lack of progress  in disarmament is dictated by political realities. The past few years have again shown how disarmament negotiations only too easily fall victim to political confrontation. Yet at times of confrontation  disarmament negotiations would be particularly urgent  both politically and militarily.26 L Since the introduction of nuclear weapons more than a generation ago  nuclear arsenals have grown in size  sophistication and destructiveness beyond any conceivable purpose. The development and refinement of nuclear weapons have proved to be the most dynamic field of advancing arms technology. Ulti¬mately  such advances may upset global strategic stability  an outcome that would have incalculable consequences. It is equally alarming that the develop¬ment of military technology is likely to complicate any future efforts to curb the arms race. It will be ever more difficult to agree as to what weapons should be limited  and how.262.	The two major nuclear Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  have the main responsi-bility for constraining the nuclear arms race. They have recognized that responsibility by engaging in the strategic arms limitation talks in the early 1970s. The agreements reached have marked limited but not insignificant efforts towards constraining the arms race and reducing the danger of nuclear war. The continuation of the dialogue is  furthermore  in itself a vitally important arms control measure and has intrinsic political value. The Government of Finland has therefore welcomed the resumption of the strategic arms dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States last June. It is obvious that the negotia¬tions will prove long and arduous. Nevertheless  the goal should be a significant quantitative and qualitative reduction in nuclear arsenal.263.	Nuclear weapons are a particularly acute con¬cern to the nations of Europe  the continent of the deadliest concentration of weapons. It is an urgent necessity for Europe to reach concrete and compre-hensive results in the Geneva talks on nuclear weapons. The goal should be to eliminate the danger of nuclear weapons  deployed or scheduled to be deployed.264.	The Committee on Disarmament has not for the past few years produced tangible results in the form of draft treaties on arms limitation. This is to be regretted.The Committee on Disarmament  as the central body of the United Nations disarmament machinery  must intensify its work. Its agenda reflects the agreed priorities among disarmament issues: the security of non-nuclear-weapon States  the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons and the cessation of all nuclear testing. Finland is prepared to continue its fullest possible contribution to this work.265.	In the post-war era  the Nordic region has been largely untouched by international tension. Our security environment is one of stability. The absence of nuclear weapons in the region is an important feature of this situation. It is the basis of the idea of estab¬lishing a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone. Finland will continue to pursue this idea. As emphasized by 6th President of Finland  Mr. Mauno Koivisto  such a measure by the Nordic countries would consolidate regional security. The question of such a zone has been discussed between the Nordic Governments in various forums  most recently by the Foreign Ministers at their meeting last August. The Ministers agreed to maintain contact on the issue.266.	In view of our interest in nuclear-weapon-free zones  it is natural that eight years ago Finland took the initiative at the United Nations to undertake a comprehensive study on the question of nuclear- weapon-free zones. Since the study  progress has been achieved in arrangements for such zones. New con¬crete ideas envisaging the establishment of nuclear- weapon-free zones in various regions suggest the need for updating the comprehensive study to reflect new realities. It could facilitate the creation of such zones and thus advance limitation of nuclear arms. Finland proposed an updated study at the second special session devoted to disarmament and will pursue it during the present session.267.	The proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to all States  nuclear and non-nuclear alike. It is par¬ticularly serious in regions where international peace and security are already in jeopardy. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the best instrument to combat that threat. As long as some nations remain aloof from the Treaty and refuse to accept interna¬tional safeguards on all their nuclear activities  sus¬picion about their intentions is justified. This also hampers international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  the benefits of which all nations should equally share. In this respect  we attach great importance to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Promotion of International Co¬operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.268.	While nuclear weapons represent the most awesome threat  this should not overshadow the problem of conventional weapons. The conventional weapon is not only a threat but an instrument of death and destruction used every day. Efforts towards conventional disarmament and control of arms transfers should therefore be intensified  both globally and regionally. Results from the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and As¬sociated Measures in Central Europe continue to be urgent.269.	The signatory States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should make every effort to reach a decision on a conference on confidence-building and security-building measures and disarmament in Europe as envisaged in the follow- up meeting of the Conference in Madrid. A success¬ful outcome of the Madrid meeting  which was inau¬gurated two years ago  is of utmost importance in the present international situation. The persistent efforts of this meeting and the results achieved so far are proof of a widely and seriously felt need to preserve the process itself in order to revive and enhance its con¬tribution to detente in Europe. A successful outcome of the Madrid meeting would not only have a positive effect on the relations between the European States  but also have an impact on the international situation as a whole.270.	The Charter of the United Nations established respect and promotion of human rights as one of the main principles of the Organization. In terms of the Preamble  respect for human rights is equal in urgency with saving future generations from the scourge of war. The United Nations has created an ample body of international legislation on human rights. Yet the implementation of these rights and freedoms is woefully inadequate. Violations of human rights are the rule rather than an exception. Yet all Member States have undertaken a solemn commitment to promote and respect human rights. Observance of human rights is not an option but an obligation. The rights of man are not dependent on political or ideological considerations.271.	The Finnish views and values in the field of human rights are well known. They are based on the Nordic concept of freedom  solidarity and justice. While we firmly believe in the validity of these funda-mental convictions  we are equally aware that the international work in this Held can best be carried out on the basis of common  accepted codes of conduct; no purpose is served by attempts to impose one set of values on another. ESorts towards finding common ground are therefore of primary importance. On the whole we see a great task for all countries in promoting and implementing human rights  both nationally and internationally. Success in this task will help to strengthen the rule of law and build a durable world order in peace and security. It is on that basis that Finland approaches its term as representative of the Nordic countries in the Commission on Human Rights.272.	The plight of an increasing number of refugees and displaced persons fleeing wars  oppression and persecution bears witness to a serious aspect of human rights violations. Refugee outflows confront the United Nations and its Member States with some of their most pressing humanitarian  legal and political problems. The response of the international com¬munity to the tragedy of the massive refugee exodus cannot be limited to humanitarian concern but must encompass all aspects of the problem  including its underlying causes.273.	The Government of Finland notes with satis¬faction that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea'^ was adopted last spring with the support of an overwhelming majority of States  although full consensus could not be reached. The general acceptance of the Convention  which could well be the most significant legal instrument of this century  is obviously not in doubt. It is therefore of great importance that the Convention gain the widest possible adherence in order to serve its purpose in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV)  the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil There¬of  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. A satisfactory order governing the world's oceans would greatly reduce the possibilities of inter-State conflicts and consolidate the role of the United Nations in the codification and progressive development of interna¬tional law in other fields of human endeavor also.274.	In his report the Secretary-General has drawn attention to the crisis in multilateralism. His analysis applies also to international economic co-operation. The lack of confidence in the multilateral negotiating mechanism  the increasing resort to unilateral action in the field of trade and the decreasing financial backing of multilateral development institutions all point to this crisis in multilateralism.275.	The prolonged delay in launching the global round of negotiations on international economic co-operation and development is a case in point; yet  given the global dimensions of many of the difficulties currently affecting national economies  a global effort to tackle those difficulties should call for general support. The envisaged global round should not  however  hold up urgent remedial action. Negotia¬tions in various economic forums must be vigorously pursued and all multilateral institutions must be fully utilized.276.	The tendency to resort to unilateral trade measures as a means of coping with structural problems in the world economy causes serious concern. With a Western market economy heavily dependent on international trade  my country is affected by these developments. We sincerely hope that the forth-coming ministerial meeting of GATT may strengthen the determination to maintain a free and open multi¬lateral trading system and to resist protectionist pressures. The sixth session of UNCTAD  to be held next spring  can for its part give new stimulus to the North-South dialogue  which at present lacks dynamism.277.	The severity of the liquidity problems faced by many developing countries is a serious issue not only for those countries but also for world trade as a whole. As a result of their debt-servicing problems  developing countries have had to resort to growth- reducing policies. The poorest among them have fared particularly badly. They are entitled to the special concern of and action by the international community.278.	Multilateral development institutions contribute to a more equitable geographical distribution of aid  taking particularly into account the needs of the poorest countries. Those institutions must be provided with necessary resources  and that can be done only by reversing the decrease in official development assis¬tance in general and in multilateral aid in particular.279.	Finland will continue its strong support for multilateral development activities. In our develop¬ment policies we have traditionally concentrated on the poorest countries. Finland has committed itself to allocating at least 30 per cent of its bilateral assis¬tance to the least developed countries  in compliance with the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. We have also consistently emphasized the value and the unique role of United Nations programmes aimed at human resources development. In that spirit  my Government is pro¬posing for 1983 to increase the Finnish contribution to UNDP again by 14 per cent and to double our support to UNICEF.280.	On this occasion I wish to reaffirm the deter¬mination of the Finnish Government to continue the rapid growth of our international aid program. This year Finland has reached the medium-term target aimed at doubling the share of gross national product for official development assistance which we set ourselves five years ago. The budget proposal for 1983 includes a further increase of aid appropriations by 28 per cent. This means that we are well on our way to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent before the end of the decade.281.	While the realities of the present international situation seem to give little cause for encouragement  this should make us more aware of our duties as Mem¬bers of the United Nations. The United Nations is the principal instrument available to the international community for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is the only universal forum where the nations of the world can unite their efforts for that purpose. The Charter of the United Nations is not simply an expression of the aspirations of the interna¬tional community: it is a legally binding document through which nations  big and small  have accepted a code of conduct for relations between them. These obligations transcend considerations of political expediency  which only too often lead to their viola¬tion. During its existence the United Nations has proved its viability as an instrument for preventing conflicts and assisting the peaceful settlement of disputes  for enhancing the rule of law and promoting human rights and economic development  whenever it has been given the opportunity to do so. Finland therefore remains committed to the United Nations as the principal instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security and for averting the impending anarchy of which the Secretary-General warns us."
"49",2363,"FJI",37,1982,"My delegation wishes to associate itself with the compliments paid to you  Mr. President  on your election to your high office  and we pledge to you our continued co operation. We would also like to acknowledge with satisfaction the outstanding leadership of your predecessor in office. I would like to place on record my Government's satisfaction with the excellent work being done by the Secretary General during his first year in office. We wish to assure him of our continued support. We extend to him our compliments and endorse his forthright and incisive views on the major issues confronting this planet and on the role of the United Nations in the efforts to resolve the problems that we share as a result of our inseparable humanity. He has highlighted not only the problems  but the structural weaknesses of the Organization in tackling those problems. In our view  the United Nations must  as a matter of urgency  address both dimensions if all of humanity is to have even a chance.In the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization he alluded to the failure of the collective security system of the League of Nations. It will be recalled that concurrently with the failure of the League of Nations the world suffered an unprecedented economic depression which in many ways contributed to the upheaval of the Second World War.It has been noted that the only thing we learn from history is that we do not learn from history. How true that is. The present world political and economic situation  which I need not reiterate before the Assembly  and the inability of the United Nations to deal effectively with issues pertaining thereto  bear an unnerving resemblance to the events that ushered in the Second World War.While my country  Fiji  in the peaceful South Pacific Ocean  is thousands of miles away from the Middle East  our commitment to world peace led to our direct involvement in United Nations efforts to bring peace and stability to the area. Of particular concern to my Government has been the recent resurgence of war in the unfortunate country of Lebanon. The resultant massacres of Palestinian men  women and children is a matter  to be deplored by all. My Government has already condemned all those that were directly or indirectly involved in the killings. The problem of Lebanon is part of the overall problem of the Middle East J which has defied solution for more than three decades. In the mean time  new elements have been injected into the conflict and this has made peace in the area even more elusive.My delegation continues to support the principles set forth in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as a basis for peace in the region. It is also imperative that the aspirations of the Palestinian people to a homeland be realized  and that the rights of all States  including that of Israel  to live within recognized boundaries be acknowledged.My country has always advocated the peaceful resolution of all disputes through dialogue and negotiations. It was in this spirit that my Government agreed to contribute peace keeping forces to UNIFIL in 1978. In the same spirit  Fiji decided to contribute troops to the multinational forces and observers last year in order to further the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel that led to the return of the Sinai.The cost of the contribution to UNIFIL has been particularly burdensome for a small country such as ours. For the past four years our ability to maintain our troops in Lebanon has been seriously undermined by the accumulated arrears of reimbursements  which amount to millions of dollars. It is our earnest hope that all Member States will meet their obligations and pay the assessed contributions promptly so that reimbursements at the agreed levels can be made to participants in UNIFIL without delay.No one can deny that UNIFIL has proved its usefulness  but for peace keeping forces to be effective it is essential that they have both a clear mandate and the co operation  respect and support of all Member States and  more particularly  of the immediate parties to the disputes. This  regrettably  has not always been the case in Lebanon.The situation in the Asian region has remained the same. Foreign armed intervention and occupation continue in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In both cases the majority of United Nations Members have taken an unequivocal stand  to which we subscribe. This international concern will continue until the foreign forces are unconditionally withdrawn. Only then will the freedom of their people and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries be restored.With respect to Kampuchea  the recent initiatives that have brought the resistance groups into a coalition provide a better basis for a negotiated and peaceful solution of the problem in that country. We hope that there will be a more positive response to this important development.The vexed question of the peaceful reunification of Korea remains with us. However  we regard the recent proposal by South Korea as an important step towards reconciliation. It is our hope that a unified Korea will soon become a reality.In the field of disarmament very little has been achieved. All we hear of are new initiatives or the breakdown of talks. The recent special session of the General Assembly on disarmament was no exception. If anything  the arms race has been escalated. The goal is no longer to establish deterrent forces  but rather  as one of the super Powers has stated recently from this rostrum  to achieve armed superiority and maintain it. We must pause to think of the logical consequences of such a course and where the super Powers are leading us all. There appears to be no limit to man's quest for self destruction.It is more urgent than ever that  as a first step  the international community agree to the total prohibition of nuclear weapon testing. Fiji supports this proposal  as well as efforts to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty. In this regard  it urges the resumption of the trilateral talks.We in the South Pacific find ourselves a direct victim of the arms race. One major Power continues its nuclear testing in the Pacific  in total disregard of the protests of the peoples and the Governments in the region. These tests  conducted by France on small atolls  pose great hazards to the marine environment in the region. No one can say with certainty what the effect of those tests may be in the future.Last August the heads of Governments of the South Pacific countries  who met in Rotorua  New Zealand  once again condemned those tests and urged their immediate cessation. They also expressed their opposition to the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific. We hope that those calls will not go unheeded.Since its inception the Organization has played an important role in the field of decolonization. As a member of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples over the past 12 years  Fiji has seen the decolonization process evolve further. Apart from Namibia  the African continent is liberated. But there are still other dependent Territories in other parts of the world. Some of these are in the Pacific  and we note with interest that this process of evolution is beginning to take place in Territories such as New Caledonia. In this connection the leaders of the countries of the South Pacific Forum find reassuring the determination of the French Government to introduce important reforms in that Territory Y these reforms are followed through  they should eventually lead to self determination and independence with the full participation of its indigenous population. We welcome this important development.After years of arduous negotiation  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adopted in April this year a comprehensive Convention dealing with all uses of the sea. It is a pity that  because of a few delegations  this important milestone in recent history could not be reached by consensus. But this cannot detract from the significance of the achievement  given the vastness  importance and complexity of  the subject matter  the conflicting interests of States and the difficulty of working out an international regime for the sea bed beyond national jurisdiction capable of equitably balancing the interests of developed and developing countries.For Fiji and similar small island countries the Convention consolidates their inherent rights to the resources in their surrounding seas. It was therefore not surprising that the heads of Government of the South Pacific countries  at a recent meeting  unanimously welcomed the adoption of the Convention and urged all States to sign and ratify it. Indeed  my Prime Minister observed that it was an historic act and a milestone in international negotiations. Fiji  which participated actively in the negotiations  looks forward to signing the Final Act in Jamaica this year.The world economy is beset by severe problems. The industrialized countries are facing continuing recession and heavy unemployment. Enough interest rates have tended to decline recently  they have been at unprecedentedly high levels in the past two years. Commodity prices are at their lowest levels and the volume of international trade has virtually ceased to grow. Global interdependence is such that the prosperity of the developing countries is dependent on the performance of the industrialized countries. The recession in the industrialized countries  therefore  has a profound impact on the economies of the developing countries. Many developing countries which are already struggling with large debt repayments have had their problems exacerbated by high interest payments  adverse trends in the terms of trade and depressed export volumes.The conditions of weak demand and high unemployment in the industrialized countries have led to an increasing tendency towards protectionism. In particular  there has been an expanding commitment in developed countries to protect agriculture through high tariffs  variable import levies or variable export subsidies. As a result  there is hardly a major agricultural product in which developed countries compete with developing countries for which the world market is not undermined or distorted by subsidized exports or concessional sales from surplus stocks of developed countries. In some cases  as a consequence of rising agricultural protection  countries which were once large importers have become large subsidized exporters. International commodity agreements are rendered useless by large scale dumping.A case in point is that of sugar. In 1981  for instance  the European Economic Community became the world's second largest exporter of sugar  after Cuba. Ironically  it is the developing countries  which cannot afford large scale competitive subsidization of major exports  that are forced to adjustIn the present world economic climate the plight of the small island countries such as Fiji is a difficult one. They are vulnerable. Their economies are highly susceptible to external economic influences beyond their control. Fiji's expert base is Harrow  with sugar and tourism the two major foreign exchange earners  accounting for the major part of total foreign exchange receipts.The unpredictable and harsh impact of external developments has brought a number of small island economies face to face with precarious financial situations. Their efforts to develop and diversify their economies have been dealt severe blows by adverse world economic developments  such as the oil crisis  high rates of interest  protectionism and drying pools of multilateral and bilateral loans. The smallness of island economics and their high dependence on international trade leave these countries limited policy options for solving the problems of low income   high unemployment and balance of payments deficits.In a period when global arrangements Car trade liberalization have not made progress  my Government finds at least two limited arrangements of particular interest  the first being the Lome Convention between the African  Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Community  and the second the South Pacific Regional Trade and Co operation Agreement between the small island countries in the South Pacific and Australia and New Zealand. The Lome Convention also guarantees access to part of our vital sugar exports into the European Community. Under SPARTEC A  certain products from the island countries enjoy preferential access to Australian and New Zealand markets. Both these arrangements have provided considerable economic benefits to the developing countries concerned and are examples of the kind of schemes required under the North South economic dialogue. As a member of the Governing Council of UNDP  Fiji is concerned about the general decline in the resources available to UNDP. The numerous projects supported by UNDP in many developing countries and the increasing number of requests regularly made for such assistance amply demonstrate the significant role being played by UNDP. It is to be hoped that Member States  both donors and recipients  will make extra efforts to build up the resources of UNDP so that it can meet the demands on it.These and many other issues of international concern  on which previous speakers have addressed the Assembly so eloquently  have become the stumbling blocks in the efforts to achieve a peaceful and secure world. They have to be resolved  and this world body cannot abdicate this responsibility. Like others  my delegation knows only too well the magnitude of this responsibility. The task before the United Nations in ensuring peace and security in the world and in promoting development is not an easy one. We represent an organization in which diversity is the norm rather than the exception. However  many of the achievements that we as an organization have registered and hope to continue to register have been and remain possible only through a commonality of purpose  accommodation of differences and understanding. The issues before us at this session of the General Assembly reflect this diversity and call for much greater understanding than has been demonstrated in the past.I wish to conclude my statement by drawing to the attention of the international community the plight of the very small communities micro States  as they are called most of which are islands. I do not pretend to be a spokesman for them  but it is clear that their special needs are not being adequately addressed and that so far as the United Nations is concerned such countries  including my own  appear to be nobody's baby.The economic situation to which I referred earlier  which is so well known to representatives  bears particularly harshly on small  scattered communities. Their fragile economies are often tied to a single crop and they are susceptible to natural disasters. These are the harsh realities of their daily existence. We experience major disadvantages as we try to modernize  and find ourselves caught in vicious circles in our interaction with larger  more powerful countries. For example  it is not relevant to use per capita income as an index of our status. Its use inevitably denies us access to concessionary finance with which to advance our development. Those of us that make a little headway through our own efforts appear to be penalized for doing so. It is as if whenever we think we are making ends meet someone moves the ends.There is no point in preaching to us that we should pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps when   those who give that advice keep standing on our hands.Yet let us not abandon hope. Huxley's  Brave New World  may not have anticipated a world in which islands come closer to center stage  but that world is not far off. For the first time in human history  small States are finding themselves expanded almost overnight as their jurisdiction encompasses millions of square miles of ocean. How to utilizethat space  how to explore and exploit it to improve the lives of our people and  indeed  all mankind  poses a challenge that we cannot face alone. No longer will the development models of the 1930s and 1960s  based on large land masses  as inAfrica  Asia or Latin America  distract or delude us.I do not imply that islands will soon be the inheritors of untold wealth or that all our problems will be overcome. My point is that the day is dawning when a new order of importance must be attached to us  our needs and our potentials  for in that process interdependence itself will be made more manifest and achieve a real meaning beyond today's fashionable rhetoric."
"50",2409,"FRA",37,1982,"Permit me  Sir  on behalf of the French delega¬tion to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. Your experience of international life acquired in the high offices you have held together with your thorough knowledge of the United Nations are assuredly a guarantee that the work of the Assembly will be conducted with all the necessary authority and efficiency.80.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secre¬tary-General. I had the pleasure of welcoming him recently in France and I have excellent memories of that first meeting. I found in it confirmation of the qualities which he has constantly demonstrated in the exercise of his functions. The French delegation would like to express its gratitude to him for the dedication he has shown in carrying out his duties in the past 10 months. Our gratitude naturally extends to all the members of the Secretariat  with whose work we are familiar and whose competence we appreciate.81.	The presence of the Prime Minister of France in the Assembly is  I know  unusual. I am the first French head of Government to come to this rostrum since the founding of the Fifth French Republic in 1958. By this gesture we wanted first of all to demon¬strate the importance which the President of the French Republic attaches to the Organization.82.	For more than a century the body of ideas of which we are the heirs has been concerned with promoting internationalism as one of the forms of solidarity. For us  this solidarity must be both an ethic and a principle of action. Just as in France we are offering companies and workers ""contracts of solidarity"" to fight unemployment  so the international community could turn to ""contracts of solidarity"" among countries to fight underdevelopment.83.	The head of the Government of France is present today at this rostrum precisely to emphasize the imperative need for solidarity  which we believe is the best way to achieve peace. France wishes in this way to demonstrate its confidence in the United Nations and in the capacity of the Organization to revert to its original mission  namely  the maintenance of peace. The Assembly is in effect the only one in which all States meet on an equal footing. I should like at once to stress this conviction  at a time when France  in response to an emergency situation  is contributing actively to a multinational force requested by the Security Council but not constituted according to our customary procedures  which  unfortunately  are too slow.84.	I should like to describe to the Assembly the state of the world as I see it today and to analyze the causes of our present difficulties. Then  in the second part of my address  I will outline the responses that France proposes.85.	What  then  is the present state of the world? Wherever we look we see nothing but disorder and confusion. Since the creation of the Organization blood has been spilled in some 120 conflicts on this planet  and in the past two years we have seen the dangers grow and multiply. No continent has been spared. Localized conflicts  declared or potential  are increasing and represent a permanent threat to regional balances. Old conflicts are being perpetuated. States are invaded; others are tom apart.86.	This year the absurd war in the South Atlantic was added to the list. This showed once again in striking fashion that the use of force is never a per¬manent solution to a quarrel.87.	In the Middle East also  the world has had to recognize once again the futility of military operations. Only death and suffering profit by it while the basic issue remains unaffected. A people is still condemned to a life of wandering. And once the wheels of the military machine were set in motion this led to the hideous massacres of civilians which the international community has been unanimous in condemning.88.	In Eastern Europe  in a Poland occupied by its own army t we see a courageous people prevented from choosing the paths of liberty.89.	In Central America conflicts are becoming more widespread and redoubling in intensity. How could it be otherwise when peoples are denied the elementary right to shape their own futures?90.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to rise up against oppression.I was myself nurtured in this noble tradition and would be the last to forget it.91.	Such events are all factors making for imbalance and insecurity.92.	At the same time  the economic crisis is assuming planetary proportions. The length of time it has lasted has become a new factor for disarray which tends to increase its ravages. One after another  countries  even stable and developed countries  have found themselves in financial straits.93.	For 18 months now the recession has hit the industrialized countries hard. Production is stagnant or is falling back; unemployment is rapidly increasing  at times achieving levels comparable to those during the Great Depression of 1929.1 make that point with particular seriousness because in this context France  together with Japan  is the country which has been able to maintain a positive rate of growth.94.	Certain precarious balances which had been main¬tained hitherto are beginning to crumble; one after another industries are going bankrupt; budgetary and trade deficits are increasing. The development of the third world has now been halted. Per capita income in many countries is perceptibly diminishing. The least advanced countries are suffering particularly from a reduction in public aid programmes for development. The problems of hunger today are even more dis¬tressing than they were a decade ago. How many coun¬tries are at the mercy of a climatic or financial accident which might threaten their very existence?95.	All these disorders have the effect of increasing even further the inequalities between the industrialized States and the majority of the others. I would add that in many countries the crisis is widening the gap between different social categories  between those which have some reserves in order to face up to the hardships of the times and those which do not possess those reserves.96.	We are thus witnessing a world decline which is promoting self-centeredness and mounting violence  of which terrorism is one of the most despicable manifestations. Every possible pretext has been used to justify this violence: security  ideologies and sometimes simply vengeance. The rights of States and of peoples have too often been flouted for this reason. France sees in that some disturbing signs of mankind slipping backwards towards a situation where might prevails over right.97.	That then is the state of the world. For France  current difficulties derive essentially from three factors: the interplay of the two great Powers; the rise of national self-centeredness; and over- armament.98.	Let us talk now of the first factor  the interplay! of the two great Powers. For years now the world has lived with the illusion that peace-loving coexistence between two great Powers served to reduce sources of tension. This illusion has now been dispelled.99.	The progress of education  particularly over the last 20 years  developments in science and technology which they promoted  have stimulated the aspirations of men to freedom and justice and the aspirations of peoples to national identity and of nations to inde¬pendence. The Organization is the living expression of that  because I would point out that the number of its Members has tripled in 20 years. It is that diversity  that vast planetary change  that teeming burgeoning of life  to which the two great Powers have not been able to respond. They have striven to perpetuate a wide¬spread policy of blocs which is no longer in keeping with the state of the world today.100.	This persistent temptation to defend or expand their spheres of influence  to deal with world problems through the distorting prism of their own interests  and to transform into East-West confrontation internal tension in States or disputes between neighbouring countries  has been a constant factor for destabilization. Innumerable pressures of all sorts  from military maneuvers to financialpenalties  have been brought into play against peoples who want to have their independence respected. Third world countries are the very first to suffer from this rivalry  but the industrialized nations are nevertheless not free from its consequences  even if it takes a different form in the East and West.101.	In the West  one of the great Powers has been using  for the benefit of its national interests  the dislocation of the international monetary system. It has been laying down its budgetary and monetary policy without concerning itself about the conse¬quences which may result for other countries.102.	In the East  the other great Power has been continuing to employ  directly or indirectly  military force to thwart the wish of the peoples of the world to be masters of their own destiny.103.	This blindness on the part of the two great Powers is without any doubt one of the major causes of the disorders troubling the world today. I say that as I think of the great American and Soviet peoples with which the French for centuries have maintained ties of friendship. I say that because France is a member of an alliance to which it intends to remain loyal.104.	Faithful to its commitments  France never¬theless desires the gradual disappearance of military blocs. It wants entirely free countries to express their initiatives freely.105.	There exist  it is true  other forms of domination  sometimes crude censorship which strives to crush the powers of creation. There are also modem tech¬nologies—which  together with economic power  make it possible to control the human mind. Let us beware of that. Reactions can it fact be extremely violent when one offends the culture of peoples at their deepest roots  and when one does violence to their conscience.106.	The second factor explaining the difficulties through which the world is going is the rise of national self-centeredness. Since international economic rela¬tions can and will be adapted to the law of ""might is right""  it is inevitable that we should be witnessing a return of policies which are more or less protec¬tionist. I urge those who deplore this in defense of the rules of the market-place to be good enough to consider that they have in fact contributed to the destruction of these regulating mechanisms by imposing the law of the jungle.!09. This rise in national self-centeredness has become an additional curb on international trade and has thus contributed to prolonging and fueling the crisis. Furthermore  and this is even more serious  it under¬mines regional groupings which have been functioning for two or three decades now. The process of integra¬tion of the European Community has thus been halted  and the same is true of the Americas and Asia.! 10. Behind the facade of international meetings  and a co-operation which has never in history been so widely developed as today  the Community which we make up seems in fact to be breaking up  to be fragmented  and gradually to be falling back on each of its national entities.111.	It would be particularly serious if  on the pre¬text of an economic crisis  the industrialized countries were to oppose the emergence of new industrial centers in the third world countries. They must adapt to this new reality  even at the cost of sometimes painful conversions.112.	However  this industrialization of the third world cannot be limited to forms of dumping based on uncontrolled exploitation of cheap labour. It cannot be considered simply in terms of the profit accruing to multinational corporations which take advantage of the disorder in the world to impose their own laws. The inevitable mutation must be controlled.113.	The future of the world will be based largely on the independence of our economies. Yet the increasing number of divergences grows in proportion to the increasing articulation of policies arising solely from national interest. Thus multilateral institutions  the privileged instruments of international co¬operation  no longer seem sufficient to enable us to overcome today's crises.114.	The third factor which explains the disarray in the world today is over-armament. All States have a right to security and an independent system of defense. This is in fact the policy that France applies for itself. Still  we are convinced that the build-up of arms is a serious source of danger to peace and security in the world. The General Assembly itself  meeting in special session a few weeks ago to consider possibilities of disarmament  made the distressing observation that more than ever before in history the arms race is proceeding at a frantic pace.115.	This situation stems from the two factors that I have just analyzed: the action of the super-Powers and self-centeredness on the part of nations. The ten¬sion to which these factors give rise is only worsening in a world where the rule is determined by power relationships. Our States have a duty to respond to the questions and sometimes the anxieties which result from this among peoples and which are reflected  for example in Europe  by the development of a current of pacificism. Our States have a duty to show that a path to genuine arms reduction can be opened. This is the urgent obligation incumbent on our Govern¬ments today  particularly on those which alone possess the bulk of the world's military arsenal.116.	Now  in face of the great Powers' nuclear over- armament  the build-up of conventional forces in Europe and the arms race raging in the third world  negotiations are not advancing. Before we can turn to serious talk of the general and verifiable disarmament that is our goal  we must first challenge the over- armament.117.	France is disturbed to find a growing imbalance between the requirements of peace and development  on the one hand  and the policies actually being pursued in the world  on the other.118.	If I have felt it necessary to make this assessment and to give our analyses of the situation on behalf of France  it is not in order to give in to any sort of pessimism or to throw up my arms at the enormousness of the task before us. We can overcome the crisis  but we must have the will to do so and not allow ourselves to be taken in by delusions. The world must get back on the road to growth and peace.119.	First of all  the search for peace. France speaks and acts on a basis that is clear and unchanging: one method  negotiation; one goal  political solutions in respect for the rights of peoples.120.	This was already the sense of the Franco- Mexican Declaration"" with regard to El Salvador. It called for mutual recognition on the part of the adversaries.121.	This political approach on France's part applies to all crises in which one or the other of the two great Powers is directly involved.122.	In the case of Afghanistan  France reaffirms its support for any political solution leading to the with-drawal of the foreign forces; it calls for respect for the right to self-determination on the part of the Afghan people and the guarantee of the non-alignment or even the neutrality of that country.123.	In Poland we fervently desire an end to the state of siege and the liberation of the internees—neces¬sary conditions for the resumption of a genuine dialogue between the segments of Polish society.124.	In Central America the principles France expresses are as follows: political settlement of inter¬nal or external conflicts; regional guarantees of security and non-interference; absolute respect for the sovereignty of States  which means the right of peoples freely to determine the forms of their eco¬nomic and social developments125.	This approach is also the basis for our pro¬posals in two regional conflicts that are of course of long standing  but the fact that they still persist is particularly alarming.126.	I refer first of all to the question of Namibia. The contact group has proposed a plan of action that has enabled considerable progress to be made con¬cerning constitutional principles and the transition period. Currently  negotiations are stalled precisely because certain conditions are inconsistent with the general principles we. Uphold and because they fall solely withinthe ambit of Angolan sovereignty. France for its part will continue to support the three-  stage plan while at the same time condemning any strategy that would destabilize the region and refusing to establish any link with external considerations.127.	My second example concerns the Middle East. I believe that the tragic events of recent days have clearly demonstrated that the positions France has supported since the beginning of hostilities are sound.How much time would have been gained and now many lives spared if our voice had been heeded.128.	I would  to refresh the memory of the members of the Assembly  just recall the principles so often set forth in this very Hall by France's representatives  and in particular by our Minister for Foreign Affairs  Mr. Cheysson  namely  security for Israel and for all the Arab States in the region  on the one hand  and the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people  on the other. Moreover  any settlement quite obviously presupposes the mutual recognition of the States and political forces in the region.129.	France has done every g possible to halt the hostilities and to prevent the tragedy. As far back as 28 July  in agreement with Egypt  we submitted to the Security Council a draft resolution. We hoped for and proposed the intervention of United Nations forces. In the past few days  we have once again assumed our responsibilities.130.	We note that many States  among them some of the most important  have agreed with our analysis of the situation. We also note that the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez expressed a view we believe to be positive.131.	In the case of Lebanon  the invasion of which was condemned by France  we will continue to work to see Lebanon's sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity restored and respected.132.	I should also like to say a word about disarma¬ment. Our position is based on two simple ideas which  I believe  have the merit of realism: a balance of forces and verifiable monitoring of the reduction of arms stockpiles. This is the basis upon which we approve the current negotiations and on which we favour completion of regional security agreements and arms limitation agreements.133.	But the return to a peaceful climate is possible only if  at the same time  we give ourselves the means to overcome the economic crisis. What is this crisis  in fact? It is not an unforeseeable natural catastrophe that has suddenly descended on us. It is only that our system of economic relations and production has gone wrong. It is a period of change between two stages of the world  between two technological phases. That change  if not controlled  may take place in the worst possible conditions  even generating armed conflicts. If it is controlled  however  that is to say if it is intellectually controlled  it may very well provide the opportunity for decisive progress for the community of nations.134.	We should first of all reject false solutions which  on the pretext of rigour or realism  call for adjustments at the lowest level of production  that is  adjustments that prolong the crisis. This would truly mean giving up.135.	The new conditions in the world economy call for a considerable effort of adjustment within each economy. France in no way challenges the need for this and has committed itself with determination to this course. These actions must be pursued within a context that is particularly difficult for all. I would note that the countries of the third world have obtained significant results in this respect. But we must avoid a generalization of restrictive policies that would com¬promise the benefits to be obtained from each country internally. And we must see that such policies do not draw them all into a deflationary spiral.136.	Economically there exists among us today a profound solidarity. Whether we like it or not  no one is spared the effects of the daily economic decisions of the international community  and our own deci¬sions  in turn  cross frontiers. New economic policies largely based on a monetarist credo and on a lessening of government influence  promise both long-lasting control of inflation and the rapid resumption of sound growth. Everyone today is aware of the limitations of these policies which have led to massive budgetary deficits  the maintenance of excessive real interest rates and persisting stagnation. The absence of inter¬vention in financial markets explains the persistence of erratic variations in rates of exchange.137.	France  with several of its partners  has emphat¬ically criticized these policies for their serious conse-quences for the world economy  particularly the economies of the developing countries.138.	The fragile foundations upon which we have built our economies are beginning to give way. In order to halt the process  it is indispensable that action on the domestic front be coupled with active explora¬tion on the international front of ways of promoting a general return to growth and prosperity. Each of us should contribute to the attainment of these goals according to his means. This is the tenor of the reso¬lution adopted at the Versailles Economic Summit by the seven most highly industrialized countries  which were meeting on the invitation of President Mitterrand.139.	If we are to succeed in this  we must reaffirm our solidarity and use all the resources available to us. The progress of technology and the satisfaction of the needs of the most disadvantaged among the world population  constitute an enormous potential  the mobilization of which could give new momentum to the world economy. Recession is not inevitable; it can be overcome by collective  clear-sighted  integrated action.140.	This is the proper perspective in which to see North-South relations. The growth of North-South interdependence has so far been uncontrolled. It has helped to extend and aggravate the crisis. The time has come to establish true collective management of this interdependence of equal partners. The time has come to make it the instrument of the return to growth and development for all. The time has come to work for true international economic solidarity. This is basically what is at stake today in the North-South dialogue. This is the meaning of the appeal made by the Presi¬dent of the French Republic at Cancun in October 1981.141.	How can we fail in the circumstances not to be disappointed and concerned that these discussions are now deadlocked? The proposed global negotia¬tions  so keenly sought by France are at a standstill. Yet the viewpoints differ little. I see an illustration of this in the immediate results it was possible to achieve in Toronto with regard to the specialized agencies. France attaches great importance <to this and welcomes the resulting agreement on financing the International Development Association [IDA] in 1984 and on the creation of a special fund.142.	I am sure that with a little good will the global negotiations could get under way very quickly. This would represent a decisive achievement for the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. It is clear to us all that the present circumstances make it neces¬sary that steps be taken forthwith. You  Mr. Secretary- General  spoke of these in your statement at the 1st meeting of the Economic and Social Council in1982.	We must ensure sustained expansion of the world economy in a climate of stable exchange rates and stable prices for raw materials and manufactured products.143.	We must also try to reduce hunger in the world and make it possible for countries which have not yet done so to reach a threshold of food self-sufficiency.144.	I lay particular stress on official development aid. This is undoubtedly the only hope for the poorest countries. Despite our serious budgetary constraints France is continuing its own efforts. From 1980 to 1982 the amount devoted to official development aid has risen from 0.36 to 0.48 per cent of the gross national product and it will reach 0.52 per cent in1983.	We are speaking only of aid to independent countries. Our goal is still to reach 0.7 per cent in 1988. The least developed countries will receive 0.15 per cent of our gross national product with effect from 1985  in accordance with the commitment we entered into in September last year at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Coun¬tries  held in Paris.145.	France hopes that most countries will undertake similar action and join France in its efforts to guaran¬tee IDA resources in the period from 1985 to 1987.146.	In addition to financial and technical measures  in addition to the reinvigoration of the activities of the organized international community  France intends to work towards the construction of a world based on right  not might. From this standpoint we advocate the right to difference  for we know that culture is not monolithic. There are no hierarchical links between the Confucian  Christian and Hindu philosophies. The universe is rich  above all  because of its diversity. Let us therefore respect the struggles of those who want to achieve dignity and freedom  because peoples exist when they have a history  a culture  and a willingness to live together. The international com-munity must recognize their rights.147.	We are convinced that in affirming the right to difference we affirm the right to life and to develop¬ment. Economic crises are all too often accompanied by a crisis of identity  a cultural crisis. This leads to resignation and a fatalistic surrender to destiny. It seems  unfortunately  that there exists a link between the dulling of our intellectual capacities and the worsening of the crisis. We must heed the forces of the spirit and of creativity. We must pay a tribute to and help those who have within them a strong determination to assert that we will emerge from this situation. This is our sole purpose  in France  in giving absolute priority to research and culture. A society that does not create  that does not call upon the resources of the will and the intellect  is a moribund society.148.	This conviction has also guided France's deter¬mination to contribute to the promotion of individual and collective human rights. In this France remains faithful to its vocation and its history. This means that our foremost concern is to respect the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs in relations between States and that we must not lose sight of the fact that the Charter of the United Nations confers a universal character on human rights.149.	The Charter must remain the hope of the oppressed. It recognizes the right if not the duty of the organized international community to concern itself with the way in which each State acquits itself of its obligations towards its own nationals. In this spirit France has recently recognized on the regional level the right of individual recourse provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights. Similarly we have just recognized the right: laid down in arti¬cle 14 of the International Convention on the Elimina¬tion of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.150.	But we believe that in this field co-operation with the States concerned should be encouraged. In our view this alone justifies the limitations which the universality of human rights imposes upon the principle of non-interference.151.	Similarly this indispensable co-operation is the only guarantee for the States concerned that interna-tional supervision  a peaceful and humanitarian act  can never be conceived of as an unfriendly act. Full enjoyment of all human rights presupposes an eco¬nomic balance  which itself depends on a certain con¬ception of development. It is in this spirit that within the United Nations France is taking an active part in the preparation of a draft declaration on the right to development.152.	We welcome the increase in regional super¬vision. Europe  with the Commission and the Court at Strasbourg  is no longer acting alone in the regional protection of human rights  as is shown by the growing role played by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on the American continent. Similarly we should stress the progress achieved in Africa with the proclamation of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights.153.	This development has  furthermore  made it possible to develop global protection of the right to self-determination by taking internal situations into account  due consideration being given to the juridical identity of each particular region.154.	We want to make this point categorically: the freedom of a people—even once it has become inde-pendent—to decide on its own future with the par¬ticipation of all is essential for the safeguarding of human rights in the world.155.	the United Nations is not only the most im¬portant meeting place in the world of which the As¬sembly is the living symbol; it is also a formidable instrument that has been considerably enriched since its foundation. The creation of an impressive number of specialized agencies has made it possible to work in all areas to achieve the objectives set forth in the Preamble to the Charter. We must therefore make these instruments effective. It is a question of imagination and will. I should like in this connection to thank the Secretary- General for the remarkable report he has presented to us. In breaking with a well established tradition  he has gone out of his way to focus attention on the capacity of the Organization to maintain peace and to strengthen the system of collective security which  unfortunately  we can only note has not been success¬ful. Mr. Secretary-General  you have made concrete suggestions in this regard  and by and large we sub¬scribe to them. Your proposals are in fact very much in keeping with the constant concerns of France.156.	We endorse your desire to make the Organiza¬tion  and the Security Council in particular  a forum for negotiations once again. We favor a revision of United Nations practices and procedures  which you have recommended. Like you we should like to see the Organization act more rapidly and more effectively. To that end we are ready to contribute to the necessary strengthening of peace-keeping opera¬tions. In fact France has demonstrated this very point today in Lebanon.157.	The imperative need for solidarity calls also for a massive consolidation of the international financial system. This can be achieved through the following means: a very substantial increase in the size and resources of the International Monetary Fund [/MF] to enable it to assume its role of supporting countries caught in the grip of financial difficulties and recover its fundamental role of monitoring monetary policies and rates of exchange; systematic intervention by the Bank for International Settlements in the solution of financial crises; early implementation  within the framework of UNCTAD  of the Common Fund for Commodities  accompanied by renewed efforts aimed at reaching commodity agreements together with effective mean for the stabilization of prices; estab-lishment of an energy affiliate of the World Bank or some other comparable system so as to have avail¬able an instrument appropriate to the size of the energy investments the developing countries will have to make in the course of the coming decade.158.	There must be progress on all these subjects in the various bodies where they are being discussed. It is essential to seize every opportunity for dialogue and meetings in order to restore the proper signifi¬cance to the multilateral institutions existing in the economic and political field and make them fully functional and useful.159.	It is imperative to promote the spirit of interna¬tional co-operation  which alone can enable us together to return to the path to development and prosperity and  ultimately  peace. This strengthening of international institutions thus calls for the drafting of a new and better balanced code of law. The work of codification  which has been going on for more than 30 years  has certainly shown progress. But we must take into account the profound changes that the international community has experienced as an organized entity. We must therefore forge new instruments.160.	There is one specific area that illustrates this determination: the law of the sea. La^ April practically all the Members of the Organization adopted a con¬vention. In spite of the reservations it may have on certain of its provisions  France voted in favor of that text. We considered that it was in itself an illustration of the North-South dialogue  which we advocate  and that it also constituted an important step towards an improvement of the world system. That is why I very much hope that the inadequacies and imperfections of the text will be remedied  which will make possible larger adherence to the Convention. I should like to announce today—and I do so symbolically from this rostrum—that France will sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  because it does not confine itself to coming here to make proposals. We also want to preach by example and to make our deeds fit our words.161.	I am also in a position to inform the general  Assembly that France has decided to endorse the principles contained in the 1975 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Today I shall give official notification of this to the Secretary-General on behalf of the French Gov¬ernment.162.	Finally I should like to add that France will recognize the right of a State or an individual to exercise  before the Human Rights Committee  the right of recourse provided for in article 41 and the Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.163.	Before coming here to address the Assembly  I re-read the remarks made by Leon Blum in June 1936 in the League of Nations. Many of his arguments are still relevant today; France still means ""to declare publicly  and to attest to by its deeds  its loyalty to international law. For history is not made up only of conflicts among men. It is also shaped by their dreams and their Utopias. And what finer idea! is there than the one we symbolize here: that of an interna¬tional society capable of abiding by a discipline to which it has freely consented? We are the image of what the world could be  and that image can give hope to millions of people on this planet. For our role has not changed. The task is sti!! to put an end to what Victor Hugo called ""the world's great insomnia"". And  as Leon Blum added  ""Men want to be able to sleep again. They want to rest their heads peacefully on their pillows after a hard day's work. They place their hope in you. ""164.	Yes  the Organization must once again become synonymous with hope. We can do it if we want to."
"51",2479,"GAB",37,1982,"It is an honour for me to convey to Mr. Hollai on behalf of the Gabonese delegation and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Aware as we are of his wealth of diplomatic experience and his brilliant qualities  to which all previous speakers have paid a tribute  I am convinced that under his enlightened  fair and balanced guidance  our work will be conducted in an atmosphere of calm and dignity and will yield useful results  thus living up to our expectations. I should therefore like to assure him at that the Gabonese delegation will always be ready to co-operate with him in any way he wishes  to assist in achieving his goals. To Mr. Kittani  Deputy Foreign Minister of Iraq  President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly  I wish to say how highly we esteem his judiciousness  effectiveness and sense of moderation which he demonstrated throughout a tenure of office during which he had to deal with many difficult and delicate questions within the framework of a seriously declining international situation. The Government of Gabon has already had occasion to convey its official congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar  the new Secretary-General  on his election to the chief office of the Organization. r wish here to repeat our profound satisfaction at his appointment  which is an honour not only to Peru but also to the whole third world  and to assure him once again that he can always count on the Gabonese Government for the necessary understanding and support in the accomplishment of his difficult and delicate task.130. There is now a well-established tradition that we  the representatives of Member States  should meet here each year to review the international situation. By evaluating the accomplishments since the last session and exchanging views on future prospects  we attempt to define together the objectives to be attained and the tasks to be performed for the coming period.131. The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly has opened in a very dramatic climate  marked by the tragic events in Lebanon  the fratricidal war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the aggression against Angola by South Africa  the presence of foreign occupation troops in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea not to mention other sources of tension which imperil security and peace in other parts of the world.132.	The peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiation  the very basis of detente and inter-national co-operation  is increasingly giving way to the use of naked and blind force  a phenomenon that is becoming more and more frequent and indeed seems now to be the rule in diplomatic practice.133.	The right of peoples to decide on their own destiny  although universally recognized  is far from being accepted and applied by those Powers which hold sway over them.134. New forms of political and economic domination are emerging and developing  aggravating injustice and imbalances  a source of tension and conflict which imperil international peace and security.135.	There is no denying that international relations are now going through a difficult period and the persistence of these tensions and conflicts is subjecting the Organization to a considerable ordeal and exposing the international community to new perils.136.	In the Middle East the recent invasion of Lebanon by Israel with all its disastrous consequences has even further complicated a situation that was already explosive in that region. The recent massacres committed in the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut have filled us all with shock and horror. The international community has unanimously condemned that odious crime  which sounds the death knell of a certain morality which hitherto had compelled respect for non-combatants' right to life. Let us hope that that criminal act will not open the way to a new cycle of blind and murderous violence  whose first victims are liable to be more innocent people.137. The situation in the Middle East has now become so serious that the United Nations  with the total support of the great Powers permanent members of the Security Council  must more than ever before do everything in its power to halt war and to look for a comprehensive  just and durable solution that will restore peace to that sorely troubled region. Such a solution can never be based on force and must there-fore be accepted by all  because it has become clear that there can be no solution to the Middle East crisis if it fails to take account of the interests of all parties. This entails the restoration by Israel of the Arab territories occupied in 1967  the participation by Palestinians in the peace negotiations  and  of course  all necessary international commitments guaranteeing to all the right to existence within secure and recognized borders.138.	Furthermore  Gabon is profoundly concerned over the bloody and prolonged conflict between Iraq and Iran which is jeopardizing peace and security in that so sensitive and vital part of the world.139.	On the strength of its close and friendly relations with the two States in question  Gabon once again appeals to the sense of responsibility and real-ism of their leaders to put an end to that fratricidal war so that dialogue and negotiation may commence  in accordance with the spirit of the Charter and the principles of non-alignment to which both countries have subscribed.140.	The situation has become even more explosive in that part of the world through the existence on the borders of Iran of another source of tension: Afghanistan  a country rent by a terrible internal war.141. The United Nations must continue its past actions and its efforts to secure the withdrawal of foreign troops fighting in that country. It is only after that withdrawal that the peoples concerned will be able freely to express themselves and to determine the regime of their choice  which alone can guarantee the sovereignty of Afghanistan and safeguard its non-alignment.142. The same applies to Kampuchea  where the legal  internationally recognized regime is not able to exercise its authority throughout the territory because of the presence of foreign troops. We wish to encourage the initiatives aimed at restoring legitimacy and democracy to Kampuchea taken by the free political forces of that country as well as by the independent States of the region.143. With regard to the Korean peninsula  the division of the country into two distinct antagonistic States because of differences in the political options of the present regimes is a sequel of the cold war of a bygone era  a time of confrontation of the rival ambitions of East and West. Faithful to its motto-dialogue  tolerance  peace-Gabon has always recommended that the two parties should sit down at a negotiating table and together  without foreign interference  seek ways and means of permitting the reunification of the country. This position was recently once again reaffirmed by the Gabonese head of State  El Hadj Omar Bongo  who stated:""It is through dialogue and dialogue alone  in the spirit of the joint communique issued on 4 July 1972 whereby the two Koreas announced to the world their wish to work peacefully for unification  that the peninsula will achieve this end in the interest of peace and security  rot only in Korea but also in the world at large.144. The violence of the conflicts which we have just described b    s its consequence  it would appear  that of polarizing and attracting the concern of the international community  which gives the impression of being less attentive to what happens in Africa. Are we to believe that the problems of Africa arouse only secondary interest and that compassion and fraternal solidarity are aroused only by what happens outside the black continent?145. Nevertheless  in Africa people are dying by the thousands and continuing to die in the south of the continent-in Namibia  Angola and elsewhere-because of the aggressive acts of the South African racists dictated by their inhuman policy of apartheid. In spite of the unanimous censure of the inter-national community  in spite of the appeals and condemnations of the United Nations  the racist Government of Pretoria continues imperturbably and I with impunity its disgraceful policy of segregation and continues to subject the black community to terror and violence. Expeditious methods of physical elimination have now become common practice. The arsenal of unjust laws is constantly being strengthened and ever more sophisticated in order better to neutralize and subjugate the black people  whose sons  within the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress  are being imprisoned  tortured  martyred and murdered every day in their heroic resistance struggle.146. This heinous policy  which everyone has utterly censured and condemned  can be carried on only thanks to the massive support of major international capital and the proved complicity of the Governments of countries which possess in South Africa powerful and varied interests. Once again we call upon those Governments to cease all co-operation with the racist Government of Pretoria  in accordance with United Nations resolutions  and to exert on that Government all appropriate pressure to prevail upon it to abandon its apartheid policy and to permit the black majority finally to occupy in dignity and equality of rights and duties its proper place in national life.147. With regard to Namibia  the South African government does not appear to wish to give way and to comply with the will of the international com-munity. The independence of Namibia  which should have been achieved long ago  is constantly being postponed from year to year because of the refusal by Pretoria to put an end to its illegal occupation of that country. The South African army  which is meeting with heroic resistance from the valiant people of Namibia  is not only sowing terror and desolation among the innocent civilian population but also attacking  now openly  neighbouring countries  particularly Angola. It is inadmissible that the great Powers  which bear responsibility for peace in the world  should countenance this arrogant policy of aggression  which is a violation of international law and flouts international morality. The Governments of the five Western States of the contact group must impose on the Pretoria Government the settlement plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the only valid basis for negotiation.148. The manoeuvres of Pretoria to justify its illegal occupation of Namibia by the presence of its forces on the territory of Angola cannot possibly deceive anyone  and blackmail aimed at establishing a link between the withdrawal of its troops from Namibia and the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is inadmissible and must be rejected. Indeed we are all aware that South Africa is illegally occupying Namibia  an international Territory under the sovereignty of the United Nations  while the Cuban troops are in Angola on entirely legal grounds  by virtue of agreements negotiated and concluded in full independence and liberty by two sovereign States. Consequently  there can be no question of linking the two facts  and the Governments of the five States of the contact groups must make the South African government see this. Africa-indeed the whole international com-munity-demands that South Africa withdraw from Namibia so that the people of that country  fighting so heroically  can exercise freely its right to self-determination and accede to national sovereignty with territorial integrity.149. The United Nations will thus have succeeded in putting an end to an anachronistic colonial situation that is unacceptable in the world today  where all men  all peoples  all countries must be free  equal and sovereign.150. The violence  conflict and war which trouble peace and security in the world are all part of the absurd logic of man's self-destruction  to which the folly of the arms race is inexorably leading-an arms race which is assuming a pace and proportions that are more and more alarming. The continuance of the manufacture and accumulation of increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the development of biological and chemical weapons with terrifying effects are leading inexorably to a wholesale conflagration.151. This real danger of a planetary catastrophe  although everyone is aware of it  is. Unfortunately  not sufficient to halt the arms race in which the great Powers are engaged. It has become commonplace to describe the vast sums spent on armaments  just as it has become commonplace to denounce the wastage of all the resources spent in that way-resources which could have been devoted to development needs-but  such is man's nature that  blind to the obvious  he pursues his course imperturbably  even if it is a path that leads to the abyss.152.	The failure of the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  held here last June  is a sad example of that blindness. At that session representatives of the non-nuclear-weapon States as at the first special session on disarmament  vigorously denounced the mad arms race and the wastage of resources and urged the great Powers to put an end to the policy of over-armament  to abolish weapons of mass destruction and to embark on a process leading to general and complete disarmament. We must recognize  unfortunately. that that appeal fell on deaf ears and at that session the Assembly was unable to come up with any positive measure.153.	Nevertheless. Gabon believes that we should not lose hope and that the efforts already begun should be continued  to prevail upon the great Powers to adopt a more co-operative attitude towards the United Nations which must be in a position to play its full and proper role in disarmament negotiations.154.	General and complete disarmament is a vital necessity. not only because it will put an end once and for all to the ever-growing risk of a planetary conflict but also because it will free the huge sums of money now being swallowed up in the arms race and enable them to be used for reviving the world economy which. as we can see is today in a state of general collapse.155.	Indeed many studies undertaken recently both by the World Bank and by UNCTAD present a very gloomy picture of the economic situation in the world. The slowing down of economic expansion has spared no region no group of countries whatever the level of development or economic structure. This slowing down has been particularly clear in the' developing countries where we have witnessed a sizeable increase in unemployment and a significant and constant decline in national income.156.	It is unlikely that the international economic situation will make possible any revival of growth in the developing countries in the next few years. The export of these countries will continue to decline until there is a clear revival of the economies of the industrialized countries. Similarly. the decline in the terms of trade  which is reflected in the increase• in the prices of capital goods and the decline in the prices of commodities  the malfunctioning of the inter-national monetary system engendered by the abandonment of fixed parities and the increase in interest rates  which has now placed an intolerable burden on debt servicing  do not give grounds for optimism; they are all reasons for the general economic recession we can see in the developing countries.157.	The industrialized countries do not seem to be concerned about this situation. On the contrary  they are multiplying protectionist measures in the name of their national interests  in flagrant violation of the international norms  which are in any case unfavourable to the developing countries.158.	It is to deal with this situation  pending a restructuring of the world economy  that we have found it necessary to call for an increase in bilateral aid  particularly official development aid. Similarly  multilateral institutions should adopt more flexible methods in this regard. It would  for example. be desirable that the share of the resources of the Inter-national Monetary Fund [IMF] allocated for co-operation for developing countries be granted on more favourable terms and for the World Bank to increase Hs loans to those countries  which of course presupposes a strengthening of its means of intervention.159. In my statement to the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session [27th meeting]. I said that I placed great hopes in the International Meeting"" on . Co-operation and Development at Cancun  which was supposed to launch the process of global negotiations. Unfortunately. those negotiations have not yet got under way. and millions of people who are calling for the establishment of a new international economic order fail to understand how this year again 'We have been unable to reach an agreement that would make it possible for the negotiations to begin. .160. It is in order to mitigate the effects of this momentary failure in the North-South dialogue. a failure we all deplore  that the developing countries have been trying to organize regionally and sub-regionally. In our own sub-region  for example  on the initiative of El Hadj Omar Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic  11 heads of State and Government met this year in Libreville  Gabon  and  in keeping with the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action;5 laid the foundations of an economic community -of Central African States  an organization that should provide us with structures to expand and promote trade and economic development among member States and stimulate and. consolidate regional solidarity and co-operation.161. This need for solidarity and co-operation  noted in the economic plan. has also been felt on the cultural• level with just as much force. It is clearly a vital imperative in the fight for development  fulfilment and assertion of the identities of the peoples of these States. which have a profound awareness of their common identity. That is why in the cultural field -again on the initiative of President Bongo-the representatives of the States of the Bantu world  which embrace some ISO million persons ' met in Gabon to attempt more closely to identify the cultural dimension of development and to examine the possibility of creating an international centre for Bantu civilizations  a project agreed upon by the UNESCO World Conference on Cultural Policies  known as MONDIACULT  held last July in Mexico City.162. In the face of all these problems  all these difficulties both economic and political  one question naturally arises: how to create a more favourable climate for international relations and hence how to propose solutions likely to satisfy the aspirations of States and peoples.163. In the view of the Gabonese delegation  the United Nations must enjoy increased effective support from its Members if it is to become an effective instrument in the service of the community of nations in the consolidation of the independence and sovereignty of all States  the safeguarding of international security and the strengthening of world peace."
"52",2524,"GBR",37,1982,"Sir  I should like to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to offer you my best wishes in the tasks which lie ahead of you. I should like  too  to join other speakers who have expressed their gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Kittani  for his distinguished efforts on behalf of the Assembly. It also gives me particular pleasure to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  who in his first year in office has shown admirable flair and discretion in discharging his responsibilities. His dedication and integrity are beyond praise. He has already brought the Organization much credit. The United Nations could not be in better hands.165.	The maintenance of peace  the development of friendly relations between States  the promotion of social and economic progress and of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international co-operation-these are the noble purposes for which  under the Charter  the United Nations exists. Once more we must assess how far those purposes have been achieved; we must examine the problems facing the world community  and see how better to realize our joint purposes. These purposes are by no means exclusively political  and neither  of course  are the problems. The daily lives of all our peoples are just as much affected by the decisions we take and the progress we can make on economic  social  humanitarian and commercial issues. The United Nations has rightly involved itself in such questions as agricultural productivity  energy and food programmes and population control. These are issues to which Britain attaches great importance  as we do to international economic matters  such as the role of the financial institutions and the avoidance of protectionism and trade wars.166.	I do not intend today to deal comprehensively with all the problems that confront us. That would make my speech intolerably long. I would also be repeating much of what the Foreign Minister of Denmark said at the 8th meeting in the name of the European Community and its member States. I propose to concentrate today on questions of peace and war. This year we have little cause for satisfaction  and none for complacency. The world is no more peaceful than it was 12 months ago. On the contrary  new conflicts have arisen-several of them. Old ones have worsened. Since the last session of the General Assembly thousands of innocent lives have been lost. Hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes to swell the growing flood of refugees. Countless others have witnessed the destruction of their property and livelihood. Who is responsible for this misery and waste on such an enormous scale? I do not think that the blame can be laid in any way at the door of the United Nations system as such. The Charter remains as valid today as when it was drawn up almost 40 years ago. Nor does the fault lie in the way in which the organs of the United Nations are constituted.167.	The fault lies with us  the Member States. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  has drawn attention to the need for us to re-examine the way in which we use the system we have inherited. I warmly endorse his thesis. We have received his proposals with respect and will study them with care. The Secretary-General has also emphasized the fundamental need for Member States to recommit themselves to the Charter. Clearly  the system cannot perform the tasks which the founders gave it when there is so widespread a tendency for Member States to flout the obligations they have assumed under the Charter. Time and again we encounter the depressing fact that if a State is determined to resort to force or to violate international law it is virtually impossible to stop it. Wars arise not because of any failing on the part of the United Nations system but because national ambitions and rivalries prove stronger than respect for the principles of international law and the Charter. The impotence of the United Nations in these circumstances may seem to historians in the next century to be one of the more extraordinary facts of contemporary international life. I know that the Secretary-General is determined to do what he can to improve the record. We for our part will do all we can to help him. The first step must be to discard preconceptions and self-serving analysis  and to look again at the roots of the problem.168.	What are the principles of the Charter whose violation is at the heart of so many of our conflicts? First and foremost is the requirement in Article 2 of the Charter to settle disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the unlawful use of force. As the drafters of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  which is to be considered at this session and  we hope  approved ^ have so aptly put it  neither the existence of a dispute nor the failure of a procedure to settle it peacefully can justify the use of force by any of the parties to it. Otherwise  in a world where there are such disparities between nations  the strong will inevitably batten on the weak and we shall all be subject to the law of the jungle.169.	By extension of the same principle  terrorism  too  must be rooted put. Terrorists can only discredit the causes for which they claim to work. We will always listen to civilized advocacy. But terrorism means the massacre of innocent people. Bombs planted in crowded restaurants  airline passengers held hostage or sprayed with gunfire  diplomatic personnel assassinated-this can be condoned by no one. The international community should unite to condemn terrorists and bring them to justice. To make exceptions is to spread the scourge.170. I therefore urge all those that have not already done so to sign and ratify the Hague/ Montreal and Tokyo? Conventions concerning the safety of civil aviation and the Conventions against the taking of hostages and on crimes against internationally protected persons. And I hope that those that have signed and ratified those Conventions will do their utmost to carry them out.171.	A second basic principle of the United Nations is respect for human rights  entrenched since 1948 in the Universal Declaration to which we all subscribe. Respect for the Declaration is easy. What remains is for us to ensure that its provisions are observed. That is far harder. In many countries the spirit and the letter of the Declaration are persistently and deliberate^ ignored. In recent years the United Nations has made some limited progress in developing its ability to respond to such situations. But all too often its responses have been and remain pitifully inadequate.172.	Another of the basic principles is self-determination. It is a principle whose implementation has preoccupied the Organization and informed its proceedings ever since its inception. The right of all peoples to self-determination is enshrined in the two International Covenants on Human Rights and underlined in such important United Nations documents as the Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed  the United Nations has long since come to regard self-determination as not just a principle but an inalienable right.173. Self-determination is therefore fundamental to British foreign policy. Thanks to our recognition of this right in regard to our own dependencies  nearly 50 members of the General Assembly have taken their places here. Never in the whole history of the world has there been such a massive transfer of power  voluntarily and deliberately undertaken. The legacy of our imperial past is not bitterness or suspicion  but friendship and co-operation.174. The achievements of the British in decolonization since the last war have been our expression and application of the principle that we have long supported in other parts of the world. To take one example  early in the nineteenth century  Britain recognized the struggle of the newly emerging Latin American nations for independence. We stood by them and gave them support. We were among the first to realize the justice of their aspirations  and we laid a basis of friendship and mutual respect which has persisted to this day.175.	The example of Latin America showed the world that respect for self-determination was the right and natural way to discharge colonial responsibilities. Next year is the bicentenary of Simon Bolivar  and I should like to pay a tribute to him and to the nations which he brought to birth. Our relations with the countries of Latin America which reflect that history have been and remain of great importance to us.176.	This last year  Britain itself has been involved in a major conflict  a conflict which we and our fellow members of the Security Council tried strenuously to avert. On 1 April 1982 the President of the Council  in the name of all its members  appealed to Britain and Argentina to exercise the utmost restraint. Britain responded positively to that appeal. The response of Argentina was a military invasion of the Falkland Islands. Following an authoritative determination by the Security Council the next day that Argentina's invasion of the Falklands had created a breach of the peace  and a mandatory demand by the Council in its resolution 502 (1982) that Argentina withdraw  we went to every conceivable length to avoid having to resort to force in self-defence.177.	The Security Council thus sought first to deter Argentina from aggression and then to induce it to withdraw. The efforts of the United Nations-the efforts of the Security Council and of the Secretary-General himself-to achieve a peaceful settlement had the full  active and whole-hearted support of the British Government. They failed through Argentine obduracy.178.	Throughout our campaign to repossess the Islands  we took immense care to act strictly within the framework of the Charter  at each point reporting our actions to the Security Council. The force we used in self-defence under Article 51 was the minimum necessary to remove Argentina's occupying forces. We made it clear that in so acting we were showing our absolute determination to implement to the full our obligations towards the populations of our dependent Territories under Article 73. We will not be deflected from that determination and I make that quite clear.179.	By liberating the people of the Falklands from alien domination  we were also standing up for the right of a small but authentic people to determine how they should be governed and how they should live. Our tragic losses in men and ships were considerable  but we were able to prove that in some cases  given the will and the courage and the professionalism required  aggression does not pay.180.	The Argentine invasion took place when negotiations in good faith were actually in train between Britain and Argentina. We were talking round the table with the Argentines at the time. Suddenly and brutally they decided upon a military invasion. That flagrant violation of the principles of the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes has radically altered the situation. It will be difficult indeed to revive our confidence in Argentine intentions. It will take a long time. Why  even now  has Argentina not accepted the definitive cessation of the hostilities which it so mistakenly initiated? Is it not for Argentina to prove that it has renounced any thought of using force? Is it not for Argentina to demonstrate respect for the right of self-determination  including the right of the Falklanders? Will Argentina now abide by the principles of the United Nations and the precepts of international law? Those are the questions which must be answered if confidence is to be rebuilt.181.	But the Falklands dispute  though it loomed large for Britain  is far from being the only example of defiance by Members of fundamental United Nations principles. It is certainly far from being the most costly in lives. The region which has suffered most from war over the past year has undoubtedly again been the Near and Middle East.182.	The Israeli invasion of Lebanon has been horrifyingly destructive and has taken a terrible toll of innocent life. Israel has legitimate security concerns  but the operation undertaken against Lebanon went far beyond the requirements of Israeli security and was pursued in defiance of the explicit demands of the Security Council. Force was used disproportionately and relentlessly  and in the process the Lebanese people and Palestinian civilians have paid a cruel price. It does not require much imagination to realize the bitterness and resentment they must feel.183.	At the heart of the issue is the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and their aspiration for a land of their own in the West Bank and Gaza. Only by reconciling that right with Israel's right to a peaceful existence within its own borders will there be a lasting end to this appalling conflict. I believe -and we must certainly hope-that a significant proportion of people in Israel and the Arab world are now convinced that war is not the answer and are prepared to compromise for peace. Experience does not encourage us here  but the proposals put forward by President Reagan and by the Arab heads of State have created a new opportunity and a new outlook for negotiations which none of us can afford to see wasted. The choice lies with the peoples of the region but they are going to want and to need all the help the rest of us can give them.184.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq has equally been ruthless and bloody. It has cost many thousands of lives. Obviously it has seriously endangered the stability of a crucial region of the world vital to the interests of many countries outside. Surely by now both sides must accept that further conflict is fruitless. As so often in war  both sides have been the losers. To prolong the conflict will only increase the suffering of their own peoples.185.	Although the Middle East has recently held the main focus  we must not forget that the same principles are involved in other areas. It is now nearly three years since the Soviet Union mounted its massive military invasion of Afghanistan. The General Assembly has three times cried out for the self-determination of the Afghan people to be respected  cries which have been cynically ignored by the Soviet Union. No one knows how many people have been killed; no one knows how many villages have been destroyed or how much the lives of innocent people have been disrupted. All those facts are suppressed  and people can well understand why. What we do know is that some 3 million refugees have fled their country  imposing an enormous burden on its neighbours. Pakistan's impressive and generous handling of this problem deserves our admiration. We also know that the Afghan people continue to resist the imposition by Soviet arms of a regime they do not want. What a crime against humanity war is  and what a blot upon our collective record.186.	Then  in Kampuchea  an unrepresentative regime is also kept in power by the armed forces of its larger neighbour; in this case the invader was Viet Nam. The regime was imposed by military invasion more than three years ago. All the efforts of the United Nations and the neighbouring countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations-which we have whole-heartedly supported-have so far failed to move the Vietnamese from their insistence on maintaining by force in Kampuchea a regime to suit their own interests. The recent formation of a coalition of Kampuchean resistance forces could prove a significant step towards a comprehensive political solution based on self-determination  and we wish it well. As in the case of Afghanistan  Britain will continue to work with every other freedom-loving country for a just solution to this dispute and to ensure that these continuing injustices are not forgotten.187.	And the same is true concerning Poland. As a European country Britain has been profoundly concerned with events in Poland. The struggle in that unhappy country may on the face of it seem to some a domestic problem. But of course it is far more than that. This time last year the Polish people were seeking peacefully to liberalize and reform their society under a regime that was originally imposed on them from outside-and incidentally  with no consultation and no reference to their rights of self-determination. Since then  with full Soviet encouragement and support  the Polish regime has taken deliberate steps to crush the hopes of the people for a freer and more just society. No freedom-loving person  no true democrat  no one with any feeling for human rights can fail to be concerned that a wave of oppression has once again swept across that long-suffering country and its valiant and noble people. We shall continue to call on the Polish authorities to fulfil their undertaking to return to the path of renewal and reform  and we shall continue to urge and press the Soviet Union to allow the peoples under their tutelage to develop in ways more in accordance with their natural traditions and aspirations and. in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.188.	By contrast it is a relief to be able to record that in one of the world's major disputes progress has been made recently towards a settlement based on a Security Council resolution. I am glad that Britain  as a member of the contact group  has been able to contribute towards progress over a settlement in Namibia. For progress there has undoubtedly been. Although it is premature to assume that the many obstacles in the path of Namibian independence will all be overcome  it is not  I think  too much of hope that the people of Namibia may soon have the opportunity to determine their own future and to do so in elections held under United Nations supervision. If a solution can be achieved in this way in Namibia it will indeed be a success to chalk up for persistent and patient diplomacy backed by the United Nations. I should like to pay a tribute to the constructive way in which the parties to the dispute and the front-line States have approached these lengthy and delicate negotiations.189.	A settlement in Namibia  if it can be added to that in Zimbabwe  would provide further proof that the complex problems of that troubled region of Africa can be solved through peaceful means rather than conflict and violence. There is no need for further lives to be lost. We hope for peaceful evolution within South Africa itself and the emergence there of a form of government based on the consent of the South African people as a whole.190.	I should also like to welcome signs of progress in another region where the United Nations has long been directly involved  namely Korea. We are encouraged by the positive attitude to contacts with the North shown by the Government of the Republic of Korea. This should contribute to the prospects for a lasting solution to the Korean question based on genuine understanding.191.	There are many Member States which are not directly involved in any of the problems I have touched on. But there are some international issues which affect us all. One of them is disarmament. I want to say that the British Government remains fully committed to the pursuit of realistic  balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament measures in both nuclear and conventional forces which will promote peace with freedom and security at a lesser cost.192.	The second special session on disarmament did serve to concentrate the minds of world leaders on this subject. But it was a forum for stimulus and review  not negotiation. The straight talking and the hard work has to be done in the negotiations taking place elsewhere  in talks on strategic arms  intermediate-range nuclear forces  mutual and balanced force reductions and chemical weapons.193.	Britain's principal purpose  the principal purpose of the United Nations  is peace. In the absence of a world-wide will for peace  it can be achieved only if each and every member of the international community respects the principles of the Charter. All Members of the United Nations bear a heavy responsibility to remember that it is an organization designed to preserve the peace. To use it as a forum for ideological rhetoric is to undermine the respect in which it should be held and to diminish its capacity to fulfil its purpose.194.	I referred earlier to the importance my Government attaches to international economic co-operation. Our record speaks for itself. I wish that that were true of all who orate on the subject in this Hall. To say that this co-operation presents a moral challenge is not new. But the concept gains force in face of the current painful realities of the world economy  with growth barely visible  inflation a persisting plague  and unemployment still rising. For developed countries these problems have been serious; for developing countries they can be devastating.193. So today it is more than ever in the mutual interest of developed and developing countries to pull together. Renewed stable growth in the world economy  the balanced and reciprocal development of world trade  the social and economic well-being of the developing countries  especially the low-income countries  are in the general and the particular interest alike. Cur conviction that current problems need to be tackled positively is underlined by the United Kingdom's strong support for IDA and the recent release of our third instalment for the sixth replenishment of IDA  our continuing support for an open world trading system  our resistance to protectionist measures  and our maintenance of a high level of official development assistance and essential private capital flows. I fully associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Foreign Minister of Denmark  who spoke at the 8th meeting on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community. North-South matters require a continuing commitment from all of us.196.	Britain's foreign policy is firmly based on respect for the principles which I have been talking about today. We sha31 continue to strive for the maintenance of peace  acid we shall work for that with all our friends and allies in all parts of the world  in this search for peace there is no place for make-believe or deceit. Unless we face up to the issues involved in each conflict and in each disagreement squarely  unless we decide to face them together with a will to resolve them without recourse to violence or war  we will never be successful.197.	So let us go forward from here now  with dedication and realism  to work together for the peace which the billions and billions of people we here represent long for."
"53",2595,"GHA",37,1982,"It is with particular pleasure that I join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Hollai most warmly  on behalf of the Government of Ghana  on his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His election is a fitting tribute to his many fine qualities  which allow him to bring to this difficult task wide experience and wisdom  from which we shall no doubt stand to gain. We therefore have every confidence that  with the collective support of all delegations  he will skillfully lead the session to a productive conclusion. My delegation assures him of its full co-operation at all times. I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  and express to him our deepest appreciation for his excel¬lent achievement in steering a difficult thirty-sixth session to such a successful conclusion. I should also like to place on record the profound appreciation of my delegation for the competence invariably displayed by the Secretary-General and his able and dedicated staff in promoting the business of the General Assembly.108.	Since the thirty-sixth session  the international political scene has continued to be worrying and efforts to find durable solutions to many burning issues have only been met with frustration. The Palestinian question  the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the escalating arms race  the prob¬lems of colonialism and racism and the ever-widening economic gap between the North and the South—all have increased in complexity. As we meet at this thirty- seventh session  our skills  inventiveness and good faith will be fully taxed in our quest for a better world.109.	In drawing attention to the explosive situations around the globe today  I should like to touch upon the Middle East  because it is one single issue which has gravely disturbed international peace and security. In the wake of some bold steps taken both within and outside the United Nations system  one would have thought that a significant improvement would by now be discernible in the Middle East situation. Unfor¬tunately  that situation has been further complicated by the recent tragic devastation of Lebanon. The callous Israeli invasion has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives; it has rendered hundreds of thousands homeless and without shelter; it has ravaged towns and villages  wantonly destroyed property and demolished Palestinian refugee camps—and the entire world has just looked on as though it was all to be expected and all too normal.110.	It is inadmissible that after 35 years of hostility and warfare no durable solution has been found to the Palestinian question  which is undeniably the crux of the Middle East dilemma. The Palestinian people have suffered for far too long. The international community and certain Governments in particular must abandon their fear of embarking on new policies which alone can ensure that the Palestinians have a home. The least that can be done is to implement fully relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions dealing with the fundamental and inalien¬able rights of the Palestinians as defined and elabo¬rated in General Assembly resolutions 3210 (XXIX) and 3236 (XXIX). Those two resolutions were again emphasized in Assembly resolution ES-7/2. Ghana very strongly urges a final solution of the question in terms of these resolutions. We stand our ground and reaffirm the principles underlying them  the most important of which are: the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homes and property in Palestine from which they have been forcibly displaced and uprooted; the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination without external interference; the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own independent and sovereign State in Palestine; the right to territorial integrity and national unity—which must apply to all States in the area; and the right of the PLO  the representative of the Palestinian people  to participate on an equal footing in all efforts  deliber¬ations and conferences on the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East within the frame¬work of the United Nations.HI. We cannot pretend that the legitimate aspira¬tions of the Palestinians will die with the arrogant use of force. The yearning of a people for a home can never die  as the Israelis must know. We call upon Israel to withdraw from ail Arab lands it has occupied. Until Israel heeds the conscience of mankind  it will continue to create conditions for its isolation.112. Another source of grave concern is the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq  two developing countries which require all the human and material resources with which they are so richly blessed to surmount the shackles of underdevelopment and help their less fortunate brothers of the third world. There is no point in continuing this war  and we should like to counsel our brothers in Iran and Iraq to seek the road to peace.113.	My delegation is equally concerned about the unsettled regional conflicts in Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea. The early solution of these conflicts will help brighten the international horizon and replace fear with confidence in the future  thus enhancing the chances of our winning true peace for all mankind. My delegation would like to support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those crisis areas and for respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States therein. The solution of these conflicts will not be possible  however  except within the context of a comprehensive settlement of the conflicting interests of all the parties involved.114.	The United Nations has  over its 37-year history  scored a number of successes in the areas of decoloni-zation  development assistance and humanitarian work. The record  however  is rather dismal in the resolution of conflicts and the removal of the under¬lying factors that engender them. The irony of the situation is that all parties involved in the conflicts are signatories to the Charter and all are thus legally and morally enjoined to settle disputes by peaceful means.115.	From the record of Ghana's participation in the deliberations of the Organization  there can be no doubt that my country has supported the United Nations initiatives for peace. My country has con¬sistently made troop contributions to United Nations peace-keeping forces to serve as a buffer in the effort to contain latent and potentially explosive disputes. It is a difficult and sometimes dangerous task which the United Nations has performed with courage and dedication  if not successfully on all occasions. With all its faults  peace-keeping continues to be a useful and serious undertaking that all Member States should support. It is therefore regrettable that countries which are easily in a position to make contributions for peace-keeping operations should be in default or refuse outright to do so. We therefore appeal to all those countries to honor their commitments in this regard and make good their assessed contributions in the greater interest of world peace and security.116.	My Government is also ready and willing to support any move designed to review the powers of the Secretary-General with a view to making him better able to deal with conflict situations more decisively. This review is necessary if the United Nations is not to be further harmed by the crisis in confidence that now envelops it as a result of the tendency of certain Member States to play down its importance in finding solutions to international problems.117.	A matter of fundamental importance to world peace is disarmament. The outcome of the recent second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was most disappointing. The primary responsibility for controlling the arms race rests with the big Powers. It is intolerable that they should continue to endanger the security of all of us in pursuit of superiority.118.	It is known that the quality of life in the devel¬oping countries would take on a new meaning if a portion of current expenditures on arms were to be released for development assistance. However  not only are we being denied that assistance; we stand in danger of being annihilated as a result of policies we have no part in shaping. It is a misfortune that no change of heart is in sight.119.	To have the peace and security in which harmony and human development can survive is the fervent hope of mankind. The delegation of Ghana associates itself with those delegations that have wel¬comed the proposals for a nuclear freeze and urges the nuclear Powers to seize this opportunity and to take those steps which must be taken in order to rid our¬selves and posterity of the danger of extinction.120.	It is not an accident of history that the odious policy of apartheid is practiced with impunity in South Africa; it derived its inspiration from the imperialism and the racism of the industrialized West and it is supported by certain Governments and transnational corporations  whatever they may say to the contrary. The policy of apartheid has been consciously and systematically nurtured into an insti¬tutionalized racial bigotry that maintains that the black man is little more than an object of labour. He works under unjust and discriminatory laws  suffers arbitrary imprisonment and is denied his basic rights and privi¬leges as a citizen of his own country. The educational structure for the black population is organized in such a way as to provide separate and unequal levels of education appropriate only to satisfy the labour needs of the white society and of the transnational corporations.121.	And if those conditions were not degrading enough  the South African Government's policy of creating bantust is or independent homelands has been initiated in order to eliminate the inter-ethnic cohesion that is necessary for collective action on the part of the black majority in defense of their liberty.122.	What is happening in South Africa should be a matter of concern to the entire world. Those who gloss over the transgressions of South Africa for whatever reasons and those who pursue profits at the expense of human dignity are as guilty as the bigots who hold power in South Africa.123.	The South African Government's provocative aggression against Angola and Mozambique  its inter-vention in Seychelles and in Lesotho and its threats to other front-line States show how passivity on the part of the international community can encourage dangers to international people and security. South Africa has seen fit to refuse to comply with United Nations resolutions and it continues its illegal occupa¬tion of Namibia. South Africa is a veritable inter¬national outlaw and it merits the imposition of punitive measures from the Security Council now. The longer we wait the greater the danger that with the develop¬ment of a nuclear capability in co-operation with other racist-minded regimes it will be able to hold the world to ransom.124.	There is no doubt that an oil embargo is not only feasible but could be effective. Virtually all South Africa's petroleum requirements must be imported from abroad and refined oil is indispensable to South African transportation and industry  crucial levers of its economic and military strength. An oil embargo against South Africa would not have an adverse impact on international oil companies. The total interest of the five oil companies that dominate the South African oil industry represents only 1 per cent of their global transactions. Nor is there any major oil-producing country whose livelihood depends on oil exports to South Africa. The sanctions envisaged can be enforced not by adopting the expensive method of patrolling the South African coastline but by having recourse to the cheaper alternative of the withdrawal of transport facilities for the shipment of oil to South Africa. We do not endorse the cynical argument that the black population stands to suffer most if mandatory oil sanctions are imposed on South Africa. I believe I echo the views of the black majority in stating that their plight under the yoke of apartheid with all its inhumanity and degradation will come to aspeedier end if sanctions are imposed on South Africa.125.	We are following with interest and some disap¬pointment the efforts of the Western contact group to resolve the Namibian problem. The linkage being made between this problem and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola casts grave suspicions on the sincerity of some of the parties involved. Meanwhile  our whole-hearted support will continue to be given to SWAPO for the successful liquidation of colonialism and racism in Namibia.126.	When one looks at the present world economic situation characterized  on the one hand  by record levels of unemployment  recession  budget deficits  high interest rates and other constraints in the de¬veloped world  and deteriorating terms of trade  record budget deficits  huge debt burdens and declining rates of growth in the developing world on the other  it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the crises in the political sphere have their parallel in the economic realm as well and that one can hardly be considered without the other.127.	In this generally dismal landscape the con¬spicuous plight of the non-oil-producing African countries  many of whom have long been among the poorest of the poor  is nothing short of desperate. I need not remind the Assembly that many African countries have actually been experiencing negative rates of growth at the very time when they are under¬going a population explosion. For them poverty has become a way of life.128.	The fact that the whole world economy is in a general state of disequilibrium and that even the most efficient and frugal countries are faced with serious economic difficulties should  in our opinion  once more underline the point many of the developing countries have reiterated almost nanseam; that the economic  recovery of the developed countries of the North is inexorably linked to the economic prosperity and progress of the developing countries of the South. The whole world economy  in other words  is so interlinked and interdependent that the prosperity and well-being of each country is a necessary pre-condi¬tion for the prosperity of all. No one country or group of countries can today pursue economic policies of a narrow  self-centered nature without risking economic disaster for itself in the long run. For that reason policies of economic blockade outside the framework of a United Nations sanctions policy are as outdated and reactionary as the gunboat diplomacy of times past.129.	The old order—which is now facing a grave crisis—in which the developing countries supply abundant raw materials at cheap prices determined by the markets in the West and are then forced to buy manufactured goods at expensive prices determined by the same markets  must give way to a more equitable system in which the benefits of economic activity accrue to all who create the wealth of the world and not only to a small minority of nations.130.	We reaffirm that the realignment of international economic relations  as envisaged in the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  adopted by the General Assembly in 1974   is a necessity if the world economy is to overcome its present malaise.131.	It is in this context that my delegation deeply regrets the failure of the strenuous efforts made to arrive at a suitable basis for the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development. We believe that the urgency of the situation requires that this issue should occupy a central position on the international community's agenda for the immediate future. Without the prospect of general economic recovery there cannot be genuine political stability and without political stability there cannot be peace. As long as millions of people continue to go to bed hungry  as long as thousands starve to death while some nations can afford to spend over $600 billion a year on refining the apparatus of destruction  there will be no peace. The responsibility for this will rest squarely with the industrialized countries  particularlyin the West.132.	Ghana stands ready to join in any meaningful initiatives to resolve outstanding differences so that the way may be cleared for a serious attempt to address the economic imbalances and injustices of the past and present.133.	While the North-South dialogue has made disap¬pointing progress  Ghana is pleased to note that the developing countries have made substantial efforts to increase co-operation for development among them¬selves. We are particularly pleased that a significant number of sectoral meetings have taken place this year in connection with the implementation of the Caracas Programme of Actions for economic co¬operation among developing countries  and we are determined to give full support to every move in the direction of collective self-reliance  not as a substitute for global economic reform but as a com¬plementary effort. Ultimately  the third world must look to itself to reverse the exploitative economic relationships fostered by colonialism and imperialism. This calls for a far greater level of political con¬sciousness than the leadership of many a third world country would allow or would be allowed by those who stand to lose. It is found to be more convenient to be content with a neo-colonial relationship that is beneficial to the class to which the leadership belongs but which is damaging in the long run to the interest of the masses. The Government of Ghana does not intend to be found wanting in the effort  co-operation and sacrifice that are necessary for the salvation of the underprivileged nations of the third world.134.	The adoption on 30 April 1982 of the Conven¬tion on the Law of the Sea by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea represents a momentous event in the life of the Organization. It demonstrates the capacity of the United Nations to forge legally binding instruments for peace  security and development. The Convention itself is a unique blend of old and new concepts in international law: the concept of freedom of the seas on the one hand and the modem and novel concepts of exclusive economic zones and the common heritage of mankind on the other.135.	The delegation of Ghana is firmly of the view that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea will provide  upon its entry into force  the only form of legality in regard to the oceans which is known to the world community. Any unilateral action intended to preserve the privileges of the few in the exploitation of the resources of the seas must be resisted by the international community.136.	As we meet at the present session of the General Assembly  it would be useful for us all to bear in mind that we represent peoples of a world in which the clear majority is yearning for peace  security and development; we must also remember that we play our respective diplomatic roles in a world that has become interdependent to a great degree. The situation calls for abandoning selfish national interests and making a moral commitment to the betterment of the inter¬national community. The delegation of Ghana hopes that this session will help generate that moral commitment."
"54",2641,"GIN",37,1982,"It is with real pleasure that  on behalf of the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea  we should like to extend to Mr. Hollai our warm congratulations on his well-deserved election to serve as President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My country maintains with the People's Republic of Hungary the best relations of friendly and fraternal co-operation. We cannot doubt that Mr. Hollai's election will indeed contribute to the crowning of our work with just solutions to our many concerns. In the quest for these just solutions  the President can be assured that the delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea will be available at all times to ensure our fruitful co-operation. We should also like to convey to the Secretary-General the warm encouragement and high hopes of President Ahmed Sekou Toure for a successful discharge of the lofty tasks he has assumed as the head of the Organization. The son of a thin world country  Mr. Perez de Cuellar will  with his recognized wisdom  be able to deal with the pressing problems confronting the international community. This session is taking place at a particularly difficult and disquieting moment in international life. The aggravation of political tensions  to which has been added a chronic and testing economic recession  is the hallmark of our time. Thirty-seven years ago  on behalf of perceptive humanity  the peoples of the world endorsed the Charter in San Francisco  thereby committing themselves: ""... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind... ""... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained  and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". Never had a human act and the legitimate will of peoples raised so much hope  confidence and faith in the future of nations. Between 1945 and 1982  37 years have gone by; 37 years of thought  action and experience  37 years of efforts crowned  to be sure  with victories  but more often ending with failure  disappointment and bitterness. This session is thus being held at a moment when the international situation is from various standpoints extremely unstable. The tragedy being acted out here and there demonstrates to the world the degree of anguish and the urgency of the responsibilities that must be assumed. On 29 June last  at the twelfth special session President Ahmed Sekou Toure stated from this very rostrum  in this connection: ' War  local though it be in a given geographic area of the world  is always universal in scope. ""War is raging in the Middle East  Africa  Latin America and Asia. Lebanon is under attack by Israel  and Angola by the Republic of South Africa. In Namibia  in Western Saham  ... in Afghanistan  ... in El Salvador ... the fires of war have not been extinguished. Human lives are lost and property is destroyed. Violence continues threatening the life of man and the well-being of society. ""International forums remain indifferent or powerless... Is the unhappiness of some creating the happiness of others?"" The outrageous attitude and the extraordinary stubbornness of racist South Africa  which is continuing not only to oppress and exploit the Coloured people of South Africa  but is obstinately maintaining a state of war along the Angolan border and in southern Angola and is illegally keeping Namibia under its colonialist domination  can be cited in this connection. The Namibian question is a question of rights  the inalienable right of peoples to independence. There is no ambiguity as to the correct or incorrect exercise of this right.Alibis arising from the Cuban presence in Angola  used to perpetuate the grip on Namibia  are unacceptable to our delegation. The Cuban presence in Angela falls within the sovereign rights of the Peoples Republic of Angola. Angola cannot be told to renounce that sovereign right. The open aggression of South African troops perpetrated against Angola is inadmissible and repugnant. It is even more intolerable to link that act of aggression to the Namibian question.One can never say enough about the violations of the Charter and the open arrogance of the proponents of the shameful system of in South Africa  maintained with the complicity of certain Powers. It would be appropriate now to reiterate our appeal to the international community to give material  moral and diplomatic support to SWAPO and to all the front-line States  which are the victims of the continuing acts of aggression perpetrated by the South African regime. The Government of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea considers that in view of the prevailing situation in southern Africa  the United Nations must demand the full and immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for the decolonization and accession to independence of Namibia  of which SWAPO is and remains the sole legitimate representative. Elsewhere  we must recall here the deep concern my country  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea  feels concerning Israel's arrogance in the Middle East. It is high time for the State of Israel to face the obvious and to understand that its peace  its development  its survival  reside neither in its military policy  nor in war  but rather in a peaceful and speedy settlement of the Palestinian problem. Israel's obstinate pursuit of a policy of aggression  expansion and confiscation and unbridled and systematic Judaization of Arab territories that it has been occupying by force dangerously jeopardizes its own future. It is time the world recognized that the Palestinian people  under the aegis of the PLO  has the right to a land  to a country  to a homeland; and that Al Quds Al Sharif should have an international status which alone is compatible with its threefold religious calling. The problems of the Middle East and those of southern Africa are obviously not the only concerns of our peoples. Africa  through its continental organization  is currently going through a serious internal crisis. This points to the urgent necessity of finding a just solution to the problem of Western Sahara. We consider that the Committee established at the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government should pursue its work to organize a referendum in the Sahara. The convening of a special session of heads of State and Government would also help to ease the crisis now undermining and jeopardizing the moral standing of the OAU. To talk about African problems is to talk about Chad  Mayotte  the Horn of Africa and the serious worldwide economic recession  of which Africa is one of the main victims. Our delegation notes with some satisfaction the beginning of an internal improvement in Chad that may lead to political stability and the strengthening of national unity. It is appropriate now to appeal to all men of goodwill to support the efforts of the Council of State of the Republic of Chad  so that the work of national reconciliation can be completed. With regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte  my delegation invites both parties to conclude an agreement that would allow the return of that island to the motherland. Another crisis is the deteriorating situation in the Horn of Africa  the gravity of which my delegation has constantly pointed out. Our concern is particularly great in the light of the increasingly obvious intervention of foreign Powers in events in that part of our continent. We call upon the two sister countries  Ethiopia and Somalia  which are embroiled in that conflict to turn to the art of African wisdom: constructive dialogue and mutual tolerance. We must nurture peace where it reigns  restore it where it has been breached  protect it where it is threatened. Tension exists not only in Africa and the Middle East  but also in the Mediterranean basin  in Cyprus  in the Gulf  in Korea  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. Only yesterday  in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  such tension flared into open  murderous war. In sofar as the situation in Cyprus is concerned  the Government of Guinea encourages and supports all efforts at national reconciliation based on dialogue between the Turkish and Greek communities and respect for territorial integrity and for the unity of the Cypriot people.With regard to the painful conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Islamic Peace Committee continues to do all it can. Despite the exacerbation of hostilities in recent days it will continue its efforts to reach a cease-fire and promote peaceful negotiations between the two Moslem sister countries  which should by all rights be living in peace.Peace remains fragile or threatened in many parts of Asia. Peace is endangered in Korea because of the continued division of that country and foreign interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean people. That people-in the North as in the South- seeks peace  independence and reunification of the country  which should be one and indivisible. My delegation reiterates its appeal to the international community to lend continuing and resolute support to all efforts at a final peaceful settlement of the Korean question. We endorse the idea of turning the current armistice into a peace agreement and effecting the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in South Korea  under the aegis of the United Nations. The Government of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea approves the conclusions contained in the Lome Declaration  adopted in June 1982 at the African intergovernmental Conference in support of the reunification of Korea.In Afghanistan and Kampuchea  violation of the fundamental principle of the Charter-non-interference in the domestic affairs of States-which implies the inadmissibility of recourse to force in relations among nations  is today creating tension and war. It is up to the people of Afghanistan alone to determine freely its domestic and external policies  without any pressure or interference.With reference to Kampuchea  my delegation considers that a solution to this problem will emerge from the sincere adherence of all citizens of that country  without exception  to a minimal programme. In this connection  the legitimacy embodied by Prince Sihanouk is one of the components that must be taken into account.Although the guns have been stilled in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  there is reason to fear that peace there remains fragile and at risk. Recent events in the South Atlantic prompt us to support the idea of negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom  under United Nations auspices  in search of a peaceful solution to the question.This rapid review of some of the problems affecting peace and stability in the world should serve to indicate that we are indeed living in anxious and dangerous times  times when the spectre of the apocalypse looming on the horizon troubles the peace of cities. At the twelfth special session of the General Assembly President Ahmed Sekou Toure said referring to the arms race ""Indeed  is there a decent person who is not increasingly alarmed about the negative consequences  already disastrous in many areas  of this frantic race being carried out at the expense of the lives of all the peoples of the world? It is doubtful that such a person exists  for if he did the internal light that God has given us would already have been extinguished. This is not a problem which concerns the nuclear Powers alone; rather  it is a whole set of concerns about which no statesman of our era can be indifferent. ""What actually is threatening peace? It is the practice of colonialism  racism and apartheid hegemonism; the downgrading of the fate of the so- called materially deprived peoples; the flouting of international laws which guarantee the right of every people to peace  security and progress."" I should not like to give the impression that I have come to this rostrum to talk only about political problems. The order designed  desired and maintained by those customarily called the ""great"" of this world persists and is being perpetuated. Because of that iniquitous order  the rich keep getting richer  and the poor keep getting poorer. The disappointment of developing countries is justified in the light of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  acclaimed here amid general enthusiasm-a new international economic order which shall correct inequalities and redress existing injustices  and ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development for present and future generations. We note with regret the lack of political will on the part of the industrialized countries to begin global negotiations. However  the many discussions between North and South  the various consultations held  and the adoption of Assembly resolution 34/138 had made it possible for the various parties to perceive a glimmer of hope in so far as the fortunate outcome of those meetings was concerned. It now seems more indispensable than ever for the developing countries to promote a sound and viable co-operation among themselves. An open and frank South-South dialogue would  we are convinced  make it possible for the developing countries to reinforce their unity of action and to reaffirm their common determination to solve the many problems arising from the requirements of integrated and endogenous development. The only possible way to ensure equality in North-South co-operation is to establish fruitful relations of co-operation based on justice and the reciprocity of interests  with the United Nations as the framework for negotiations. Above and beyond economic difficulties  our countries in some cases have to contend with natural disasters  which remain the lot of the third world. In this connection  my delegation believes that the restoration of the Fouta-Djallon Massif in West Africa would make it possible for that subregion of Africa to play its part as a regulator and supplier of water for West Africa and would also make it possible to combat the problem of desertification and its many disastrous consequences. By giving massive aid for the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification in Africa  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/185  the international community would be fulfilling its duty to act in solidarity-indeed  to take preventive action-within the framework of international co-operation. We shall continue to repeat that  in our legitimate desire to perfect the Organization and to make it possible for the majority of Member States to play a full and responsible part in solving the serious problems that afflict the world  we consider it indispensable to begin to reform the structures of the United Nations and its operations. As we said two years ago from this very rostrum  the vitality of any institution depends on its ability to adapt to the times and to events. We still believe that if we wish to make international relations more democratic-and indeed we must do so-the democratization of the Organization is essential. We therefore reiterate our appeal that the Charter be revised so as to ensure equitable representation of all the regions of the world within the discussion and decision-making bodies. It would then be possible to give the United Nations system the power to intervene effectively in the settlement of conflicts by peaceful means and to promote a policy of balanced co-operation among nations on a footing of equality."
"55",2682,"GMB",37,1982,"I should like on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and my entire delegation to express warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his accession to the high office of President of the General Assembly at this session. His broad diplomatic experience and his distinguished professional record admirably equip him to preside over the affairs of the Assembly  and my delegation has every confidence in his ability to guide the deliberations of the thirty-seventh session to a successful and effective conclusion. May I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Kittani of the fraternal Republic of Iraq  who with untiring dedication and commitment discharged the responsibilities conferred upon him at the thirty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate the fifth Secretary-General  Mr. Perez da Cuellar  on his elevation to his important position and to welcome him to the first regular session of the General Assembly that he has attended in his new capacity. In the successive crises that have beset the world community in recent months the Secretary- General has been indefatigable in his efforts to promote the cause of peace  to which the United Nations is dedicated. This formal dedication notwithstanding  and in spite of the sacred principles to which all signatories to the Charter of the United Nations have pledged their solemn commitment  the evolution of the international political situation in the past year suggests that the cause of peace has not been uppermost in our collective mind. Instead  tensions have smouldered and proliferated  and on too many occasions erupted into armed conflict. The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is therefore commencing its important work at a time of acute and widespread crisis ominously reminiscent of that dark era which preceded the global cataclysm of 1939 to 1945  from whose ashes the Organization emerged. The state of crisis confronting the international community is epitomized by the grave situation which has continued to prevail in southern Africa in stubborn defiance of international public opinion. Through the policy of apartheid  which has been rightly condemned as a crime against humanity  South Africa has succeeded in institutionalizing racial discrimination on a scale unique in history. Under that odious system some 20 million non-whites are routinely and systematically denied even the most fundamental of human freedoms. In recent years the South African authorities have attempted to convince the international community that  in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary  they are both willing and able to introduce gradual though meaningful reform. However  as has been demonstrated by the fanfare of publicity surrounding the establishment of a Presidential Advisory Council  on which the black population is not even represented  change is not in the nature of the beast. The absence of any constitutional provision for peaceful change has compelled the oppressed black population to resort to armed struggle. At this point I wish to reaffirm my Government's unwavering solidarity with the African population of that tortured land in its legitimate struggle to gain those rights we consider to be inalienable. In this connection my delegation wishes to pay a particular tribute to and to express its unequivocal support for the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress in their just and heroic struggle for freedom  justice and human dignity. The international community and the United Nations in particular face another grave challenge in Namibia  the Territory originally entrusted to South Africa under a League of Nations Mandate in 1919. Disregarding the formal revocation of this Mandate in 1966  the Pretoria regime has by unilateral decision extended its jurisdiction and administration over the Territory  whose vast mineral resources it continues  with the collaboration of foreign economic interests  to exploit for its own use. At the same time it has transformed Namibia into a forward base for repeated acts of aggression against independent African States in the region.In spite of the clear consensus within the international community  the competent organ of the United Nations  the Security Council  has been unable to apply the appropriate measures spelled out in Chapter VII of the Charter. Predictably  such indulgence  far from encouraging South Africa to comply with international norms  has instead prompted further breaches of international peace and security. As a result  the independent nations of the region  from neighbouring Angola to the far flung Seychelles islands  have become permanent targets of the racist regime and are subjected daily to subversion  infiltration and open invasion by South Africa. In March 1978 the Namibian people  in a commendable demonstration of statesmanship and compromise  endorsed through their sole and authentic representative  SWAPO  the settlement plan formulated by the Western contact group. The plan was subsequently accepted by South Africa and adopted by the Security Council under its resolution 435 (1978). Since that time  however  no progress has been made towards the independence of Namibia. Instead  South Africa has invented one pretext after another to delay its withdrawal from this illegally occupied Territory. The latest of these manoeuvres is the current attempt to link the independence of Namibia to certain extraneous factors. South Africa's continued intransigence is a direct affront to the authority of the United Nations and further undermines the credibility of the Organization. Any modification of the existing framework of negotiation would gravely compromise the authority of the Security Council. In this regard the position of the Government of the Gambia remains that resolution 435 (1978) constitutes the sole and immutable basis for the independence of Namibia. The situation in southern Africa is matched only by the grave situation in the Middle East  which has now escalated to critical proportions with dire implications for international peace and security. Here  too  the United Nations faces an important and historic challenge. Although the will of the international community has been clearly articulated in the successive resolutions of the Assembly  recognizing and reaffirming the inalienable rights of the sons and daughters of Palestine to self-determination and independent statehood  no progress has been made towards the achievement of these basic freedoms. In the occupied territories  the Palestinian population remains subjected to a campaign of systematic repression  under which the most peaceful protests are met with brute force. This campaign  which has spared neither school-children nor the elderly  attained epidemic proportions in March of this year. In June of this year the international community witnessed with indignation and revulsion the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  the latest episode in the seemingly endless saga of Israeli aggression. My Government reiterates its condemnation of this criminal invasion  which not only violates the most fundamental principles of the Charter and international law  but will remain for years a blot on the conscience of the civilized world. Ignoring the successive resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly calling for Israel's withdrawal to the internationally recognized borders of Lebanon  the invading army continued its relentless advance through Lebanon. The bloody Israeli advance culminated in the ten-week siege of the capital  Beirut  during which the civilian population was subjected to a veritable holocaust. I wish at this juncture to express the total solidarity of the Government and people of the Gambia with the courageous struggle of the Palestinian people  under the heroic leadership of its sole and authentic representative  the PLO. Still reeling from the surrealistic horror of this murderous siege  the world community has reacted with outrage and disbelief to the recent Sabra and Shatila massacres  in which more than 1 500 Palestinian civilians  mainly women and children  were murdered in cold blood. The Gambia strongly and unequivocally condemns these genocidal atrocities and urges a full investigation into the organization and execution of this crime against humanity  in accordance with General Assembly resolution ES-7/8  adopted at the seventh emergency special session  devoted to the question of Palestine. Despite the global consensus on the futility of armed force to resolve disputes  the shadow of war continues to darken the horizon on every continent. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  in which legitimately high hopes were placed  proved a major disappointment. Although successive government leaders and plenipotentiaries expressed unanimous awareness of and concern for the grave dangers which the accelerating arms race and the ever-increasing threat of a nuclear apocalypse pose for the future of mankind  the Assembly was unable  after five weeks of deliberation  to agree upon a comprehensive programme of disarmament. The ramifications of this diplomatic failure extend far beyond the confines of this hallowed building. They are symptomatic of a more global malaise. This phenomenon is characterized most notably by the absence of the necessary political will to renounce the use of force in international disputes in favour of peaceful negotiation. Indeed  with disturbing frequency the established framework and procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes have been bypassed  while nations have resorted to brute force to achieve political objectives. The dispute over the Falkland Islands  which culminated in a full-scale war with catastrophic consequences for both parties to the conflict  is a classic example of this syndrome. Pursuant to the provisions of the Charter on self-determination and the non-use of force in the settlement of disputes  the position of the Gambia regarding this dispute is that the status of the Falkland Islands should be peacefully determined on the basis of the freely expressed wishes of the inhabitants of the territory. In the Persian Gulf  meanwhile  the fratricidal conflict between two Islamic States has raged for too long  inflicting considerable loss of lives and immeasurable damage to property  not to mention the staggering financial costs of the war itself  now estimated to have exceeded $30 billion. As a member of the Mediation Committee established by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  my Government has since 1980 participated actively in a number of initiatives aimed at achieving a settlement of this most regrettable dispute. Unfortunately  these assiduous efforts have not yet borne fruit. The Security Council has meanwhile issued repeated calls for a cessation of hostilities  in favour of negotiations. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that the conflicting parties may respond positively to the most recent of these appeals  launched only last week under resolution 522 (1982). In the same region  the illegal occupation of Afghanistan by some 100 000 foreign troops has persisted  in violation of the cardinal principles of self- determination and non-intervention  and in defiance of the clear will of the international community in general and the Moslem world in particular. Loyal to their tradition of militant resistance to foreign domination  which stretches back in history to the era of the Persian Empire  the Afghan people have engaged in the heroic defence of their homeland from the new invader. The hostilities have  however  precipitated the mass exodus of some 2 million Afghans who have sought refuge in neighbouring Pakistan  placing an intolerable strain upon the economy of that country. The Gambia has been following and wishes to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General's Personal Representative for Afghanistan  Mr. Diego Cordovez  aimed at a political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan. In this connection  my Government cautiously welcomes the ""package of understandings"" which is reported to have emerged from his most recent consultations with the interested parties. In South-East Asia  the protracted occupation of Kampuchea by 200 000 foreign troops continues to deprive the Khmer people of its inalienable right to self-determination. The presence and operations of this army of occupation have forced an estimated 250 000 Khmers to die into neighbouring Thailand. In addition  the ongoing hostilities between nationalist forces and the army of occupation have repeatedly spilled across the Thai-Kampuchea frontier. In view of the considerable tension which this has created on the border  the continued incursions into Thailand by foreign troops stationed in Kampuchea clearly pose a grave threat to regional peace and security. My Government wishes meanwhile to register its support for the establishment on 22 June 1982 of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. It is our considered view that this crystallization of the various Khmer nationalist tendencies will make an important contribution towards the re-establishment of Kampuchea's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is the sinister course along which the international political situation has evolved over the past year. During this period of acute and protracted crisis which has shaken the community of nations to its foundations  the Gambia has striven consistently to promote peace  understanding and cooperation between States  both at the regional and international levels. Soon after the Gambia became independent in 1965  in recognition of the geo-ethnic and cultural ties that bind our two countries and peoples  the Gambia and Senegal signed a Treaty of Association within whose framework a Senegal-Gambian Secretariat was established to promote economic and socio-cultural co-operation between the two countries. The agreement establishing the Senegambia Confederation  signed by the Presidents of the two countries on 17 December 1981  evolved from the close and mutually beneficial co-operation which has always characterized relations between the Gambia and Senegal  since the Gambia attained nationhood. The instruments by which the respective Parliaments of the two sister States have ratified this Agreement have already been deposited with the Secretary- General of the United Nations  and some of the protocols for the implementation of the Agreement have been signed and ratified. It is our fervent hope that this significant step in the bilateral co-operation between the Gambia and Senegal will serve as a shining example for other African nations to emulate in our drive towards a united Africa. In the face of the unjust conditions in which the present international economic system operates  the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade did not only usher in a new era of hope for developing countries; it represents  in my delegation's view  an important milestone in the relations between developed and developing countries as it incorporates  in terms of structural and institutional changes  the concept of interdependence between North and South. However  the alarming rate at which the world economy continues to deteriorate  the widening wealth-gap between developed and developing countries and the little progress that has so far been achieved in the establishment of the new international economic order  constitute ample testimony to the fact that our partners in the North have still to summon the political will fundamental to the implementation and success of the Strategy. With regard to trade and development  notwithstanding the progress achieved in this area within the framework of UNCTAD  including the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities which is still not fully operational  and the adoption of rules to regulate restrictive business practices  developing countries continue to contend with the serious effects of spiralling world-wide inflation  inequitable terms of trade and phenomenal recession  as well as escalating protectionist measures in industrialized countries directed mainly against the finished products exported by developing countries. We have  therefore  been persistent in our call for the adoption by developed countries of more liberal trade policies and the dismantling of artificial trade barriers  so as to allow goods exported by developing countries greater access to the markets of developed countries. The sixth session of UNCTAD once again provides the international community with another opportunity for effective action permanently to stem these imbalances and we fervently hope that no effort will be spared towards the attainment of this objective. The urgent need to restructure the international monetary system so as to increase its responsiveness to the needs and development problems of developing countries not only poses a formidable challenge to the North-South dialogue but also constitutes one of the main stumbling-blocks to the launching of the global negotiations. The prevailing international monetary system established at Bretton Woods after the Second World War and prior to the ""wind of change"" catered exclusively to the interests of the industrialized countries without taking due cognizance of the needs of developing countries  the majority of which had not yet become independent. It is no wonder  therefore  that the developing countries continue to demand  albeit unsuccessfully  that the international monetary institutions be democratized and redesigned with a view to promoting the economic and social progress of developing countries in the interests of both North and South. Indeed  in a number of positive ways  the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun in 1981 could not have been more timely. The developing countries  and the Independent Commission on International Development Issues  under the chairmanship of Willy Brandt  which proposed it  had hoped that agreement would be reached at the Cancun meeting on the launching of the global round  thereby breaking the North-South stalemate and demonstrating the international community's commitment to the resolution of the multifarious problems impeding the economic development of developing countries. Regrettably  the disappointing conclusions of the Cancun meeting dealt another shattering blow to the aspirations of developing countries  as some developed countries represented at the meeting were simply unprepared to endorse the proposals which constitute the central theme of the global negotiationsóthe restructuring of the international monetary system  raw materials  and United Nations targets for official development assistance. It is now an established fact that industrialization is a sine qua non for the accelerated development of developing countries. Regrettably  however  the attainment of the objective of 25 per cent of world industrial output by the turn of the century set for developing countries in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation is far from being realized  since the share of the developing countries in world industrial production is only 12 per cent. It is equally disappointing that only $15 million has so far been pledged to the United Nations Industrial Development Fund as compared to the desired level of $50 million. The low level of contribution to the Fund makes it virtually impossible for UNIDO to expand its programmes and activities to a level that would enhance the industrialization efforts of developing countries. The Industrial Development Board  at its sixteenth session again underlined the slow rate of industrial growth in the third world  especially in Africa  and recommended among other things the strengthening of UNIDO's activities  in particular in areas relating to the transfer of industrial technologies  and in the exchange of experience gained in the establishment of industrial infrastructures  to energy-related industrial technology and industrial development  and to management training. In this connection  the proposal by UNIDO to establish an international bank for industrial development is certainly a welcome initiative. Provided that  following its establishment  the bank is accorded the needed support in terms of capital and resource availability on an assured basis  it should contribute significantly to promoting industrial growth in the third world. Largely because of the lack of enthusiasm and political will on the part of developed countries  developments in the field of science and technology have been equally disappointing in terms of the slow implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development. Contributions to the United Nations Interim Fund for Science and Technology for Development amounted to only $50 million instead of the target of $250 million envisaged in the Programme of Action adopted at Vienna. One cannot overemphasize the importance of the operational plan for the implementation of the Vienna Programme and of the comprehensive recommendations contained in the report of the Intergovernmental Group on the United Nations Financing System for Science and Technology for Development. The Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development should therefore exert every effort to finalize negotiations on these recommendations and on the International Code of Conduct on the Transfer of Technology. The energy problem continues to constitute a major factor in the present world economic crisis. The phenomenal increase in oil prices over the past eight years makes it urgently necessary to adopt a comprehensive world energy policy and to promote the expansion and diversification of conventional and non-conventional energy sources. It was with this in view and with the intention of seeking measures to deal with the persistent oil crisis and the attendant serious problems it poses to international economic development that the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy was convened at Nairobi in August 1981. The Conference adopted the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy designed to ensure a sustained supply of energy from both conventional and non-conventional sources  including small-scale rural projects  the development of indigenous energy sources and research into new and renewable energy technologies. The World Bank has already estimated that on an annual basis oil-importing developing countries would need a minimum of $50 billion to develop their domestic energy resources. In this connection  the Government of the Gambia welcomes the proposed World Bank energy affiliate to finance energy development in developing countries and trusts that the proposal will materialize in the very near future. We attach equal importance to the work of the intergovernmental Committee on the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy  established to mobilize the volume of resources needed for the implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action and look forward to the successful accomplishment of its important task. The problem of hunger and malnutrition today constitutes the most serious and fundamental problem that developing countries are confronted with. The food situation in the majority of developing countries has become absolutely intolerable  particularly in Africa  where  because of severe and prolonged drought conditions in the Sahel  the situation has reached alarming proportions. This situation has been further exacerbated by the international community's failure to reach either the minimum target of 10 million tons of grain per year established under the Food Aid Convention of 1980 or the minimum target of 500 000 tons of grain to stock the International Emergency Food Reserve. The need for a substantial increase in contributions to the World Food Programme has never been more urgent  and the international community should  as a matter of urgency  exert every effort  not only towards meeting the targets envisaged in the Food Aid Convention and for the International Emergency Food Reserve  but also towards implementing the FAO Five-Point Plan of Action on World Food Security."" Equally important is the replenishment of the resources of the International Fund for Agricultural Development to enable the Fund to maintain and even expand its efforts to promote increased food production and strengthen the agricultural infrastructure of developing countries. The decision of the International Monetary Fund to establish a food window to assist low-income countries in correcting the imbalance of their balance of payments resulting from cereal imports is certainly a step in the right direction. Notwithstanding that  concerted efforts should also be made towards recycling the substantial food surpluses in the developed countries. The declining level of concessional resources available for multilateral operational activities is a source of serious concern to the Gambian Government. In the case of UNDP  for example  the financial commitments made so far have fallen far short of the minimum average annual growth of 14 per cent in voluntary contributions envisaged for the third programming cycle  1982 to 1986. The Administrator of UNDP revealed a few days ago in a statement at the 4th meeting of the Second Committee that for the first year of the cycle  the Programme will not even have sufficient resources to enable it to deliver up to 60 per cent of the indicative planning figures envisaged in decision 80/30 of the UNDP Governing Council. Indeed  the entire United Nations development system is lumbered with the same bleak prospects of resource availability and  unless there is a dramatic about tum  the devastating effects of the waning resource prospects on the operational activities of the United Nations development system will hardly bear contemplation. It is particularly disturbing that following the adoption of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries in Paris last year  the good will and enthusiasm so amply demonstrated in Paris is yet to be matched by firm commitments in terms of resources for the early implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action. Today  we are living in a world in which some of the most basic needs for survival are virtually non-existent for the majority of mankind as chronic poverty and squalor become increasingly prevalent. For those of us from the least developed countries  which constitute the world's poorest sector  the situation has become absolutely unbearable. It is hardly necessary to remind the international community that the problems of poverty constitute the greatest threat to international peace and security. Let us  therefore  through unity of action  guarantee our collective survival by giving practical expression to our solemn pledge to the Organization to mould a more assured and acceptable future for mankind. In our pursuit of this crucial objective  I pledge the total support and co- operation of the Government and people of the Gambia."
"56",2721,"GNB",37,1982,"It is a great honour for me to address my warmest congratulations to Mr. Hollai  on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation  and to express my great satisfaction that he is presiding over the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. In choosing him  the Assembly was inspired by his great qualities and his particularly outstanding diplomatic career. The General Assembly is also paying a tribute thereby to the dynamic work done by his country  the People's Republic of Hungary  within the United Nations. My country has close relations of friendship and cooperation with his country. It will thus be understood that the delegation of Guinea Bissau fully associates itself with this confirmation by the General Assembly of his great abilities and his excellent knowledge of international affairs and is happy at the prospect of cooperating with him in seeking solutions to the many problems in international relations. I should like to express appreciation to Mr. Hollai's predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the dedication  wisdom and great ability he has demonstrated in the past year. His tireless efforts and constant work in the United Nations enabled us to achieve satisfactory results in our struggle for peace during a particularly turbulent period in international life. I take this opportunity also  on behalf of my country  the Republic of Guinea Bissau  to congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on his election to the high office of Secretary General. I am the more happy to do so because this is the first time that I have spoken from this rostrum  and I should also like to express to him my great appreciation of the tremendous contribution he has made to solving the many conflicts and problems which threaten international peace and security.I should also like to say to him that the Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau greatly appreciates the excellent report he has submitted to us. In our view  this report constitutes a real innovation in that it courageously and lucidly reflects the main concerns of the international community as a whole.The Secretary General proposes in his report a concrete and objective approach to improving the structures and operation of the Organization and he also suggests measures to strengthen the United Nations and to make it a truly universal organization in which all peoples and countries of the world without distinction will be able to play their role in the struggle of mankind to preserve peace and development. The Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau will make every effort to help in the attainment of these objectives. This session of the Assembly is taking place at a particularly tense time. Violence  war  disdain for the principles set forth in the Charter  systematic violation of the most basic rules governing international relations  the genocide of thousands of human beings and considerable material damage  as well as innumerable other problems  provide a threatening background to our debate. In this Hall we have heard the echoes of the world's outrage at the atrocities committed in Lebanon by the Israeli army. The international community has expressed its feelings of absolute revulsion at the massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps. The General Assembly  in devoting an emergency special session to those tragic events  which are a grim reminder of the darkest days of modem history  wished thus to express its outrage and to condemn this barbarous action and the authors of it. Israel  in allowing the massacre of thousands of Palestinian refugees and creating the conditions whereby that shameful act of genocide could take place  made itself answerable to international public opinion for one of the most odious crimes against humanity. The invasion of Lebanon and the mass bombings of west Beirut clearly showed the world that Israel  in its craze for power  was capable of the worst aggression to establish a climate of terror in the region and remove the Arabs once and for all from their land. But Israel should have learned the lessons of history  quiterecent history. The suffering imposed on the heroic Palestinian people  far from weakening them  has shown their true strength  courage  determination and political maturity. It is political maturity which  without any doubt  confirms the representativeness of the PLO as a national liberation movement which embodies the profound aspirations of the fraternal Palestinian people as a whole and guides their fight for freedom. I should like to pay a glowing tribute to the leadership of the PLO  and particularly to its Chairman  Yasser Arafat  for the courage  vitality and irrepressible determination which they have demonstrated in their struggle in the face of the institutionalized terrorism of the State of Israel and despite the disproportion in the methods used by the two sides. The people and Government of Guinea Bissau reaffirm their unwavering solidarity with and total support for the fraternal Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for the exercise of their national rights  including their inalienable right to exist and to create their own State. Recognition of Namibia's right to independence  which we have been demanding for many years and for which the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole legitimate representative have made innumerable sacrifices  has once again been jeopardized by the delaying tactics of the racist regime of South Africa. It is high time that the authors of the United Nations plan for the settlement of the Namibian problem reacted more forcefully to the Machiavellian policies of Pretoria  which wishes to keep Namibia indefinitely dependent on South Africa. The Namibian people  Africa  will never accept a constitutional system which would perpetuate the existence of a puppet administration acting in the economic and geopolitical interests of the racist apartheid regime. This must be understood and remembered. Pretoria's intransigence and its manifest determination to wreck the plan for the settlement of the Namibian question  thus jeopardizing the principles of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  should lead its allies to be realistic and recognize that a moribund colonialist regime can never guarantee their long term interests. The insecurity in which the racist regime of South Africa maintains the southern pail of the African continent and its repeated acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola  the People's Republic of Mozambique and the other frontline States must lead the international community to shoulder its responsibilities more effectively and pay greater attention to the war which persists in the People's Republic of Angola because of the occupation of part of its territory by the racist apartheid regime. It is wrong and even dangerous to think that this is an innocuous problem  because it is in fact the People's Republic of Angola that is bearing the brunt of the commitment although it was made by all the States Members of the United Nations to give the necessary aid to the SWAPO fighters in their just struggle for the independence and dignity of the Namibian people. It is also tolerable to see certain countries trying to link the question of Namibian independence to the presence of internationalist Cuban troops in the People's Republic of Angola. Such an attitude constitutes in reality interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State and is contrary to the right of every State freely to choose its sociopolitical system and to determine in full sovereignty its domestic and foreign policy. The heads of State of African countries where Portuguese is spoken rejected this approach to the problem at their last summit meeting  in Praia  in September  and declared their unwavering solidarity with the Namibian people and the Angolan and Mozambican peoples in their just struggle to preserve their national independence and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their States. That meeting also provided the Republic of Guinea Bissau with an opportunity to reiterate  along with the other fraternal participants  its total support for the fighters of the ANC in their heroic struggle to ensure respect for the most elementary human rights and for the establishment of a democratic regime in the Republic of South Africa. The complete liberation of Africa is a prerequisite for its development. This is why independent African States as a whole have undertaken to make their contribution to the complete decolonization of Africa. The Organization of African Unity has since its creation always provided a political framework for this historic commitment. Most African States  today Members of the United Nations  derived the political strength necessary for ensuring victory in their national liberation struggles from the cardinal principles of the OAU charter  which its members are determined to respect scrupulously. This explains the political  material and diplomatic support which they have enjoyed from the States members of that continental African organization. The present difficulties facing the OAU derive from the imperative need for all independent African States to show by their actions the commitment that they have entered into to struggle against all forms of domination and to support the struggle of all peoples for self determination and independence. Guinea Bissau is in favour of the emancipation of peoples and supports their national liberation struggle because we intend to remain faithful to the commitments we have freely entered into  the very basis of the Organization that we all belong to. The right of peoples to self determination  recognized by the international community as a whole  remains the guiding principle of our foreign policy. In recognizing the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and in supporting its legitimate struggle for the recognition of its sovereignty  we are guided by United Nations principles and decisions and acting with the strictest respect for the ideals of the founders of the OAU. The African peoples  in their struggle to regain their rightful place in the concert of nations and recognition of the role they can play in international affairs  have acquired the political maturity to settle their own problems for themselves. In our view  the current problems of the OAU are serious but not insurmountable. The African States are aware of the need to preserve their continental organization  which  despite many obstacles  has managed to deep its unitary character and to mobilize its energies to achieve the noble objectives of national liberation and of development. We believe that with the good will of all its members the OAU will be able to find a solution to its current difficulties  a solution that is based on the principles set forth in its charter and takes into account the higher interests of African peoples. I am convinced that those principles will guide the efforts by the OAU Mediation Committee to find a peaceful solution to the disputes between some OAU members. I should like to speak also about the situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa  where the OAU and the international community must take urgent action to create a climate propitious to negotiations between the parties to the conflict. My country has always believed in negotiations as a means to the peaceful settlement of disputes between States. That is why we urge the Governments of the Comoros and France to continue their efforts to find a swift solution to the problem of Mayotte and thus enable it to rejoin the Comoros. Similarly  we support the efforts by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to ensure the peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland and we call on the international community to create a climate propitious to the negotiations that are indispensable in that regard. We have repeatedly expressed our deep concern over the tragic situation in East Timor  which was thoroughly analysed at the latest summit meeting of Portuguese speaking heads of State. We must note today that  despite the commitments entered into by the United Nations to restore the usurped rights of the Maubere people  no progress has been made since the thirty sixth session of the General Assembly. The Maubere people continues to suffer from the horrors of oppression and the annexation of their national territory by the Indonesian occupying forces. The Security Council  immediately following the Indonesian aggression  unequivocally condemned that action  which was contrary to the principles set forth in the Charter and to the rules of international law  and it remains seized of this question  which can be solved only with strict respect for the right of the Maubere people to self determination and independence  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). Thus the Republic of Guinea Bissau welcomes the statement by the Government of Portugal—the administering Power of East Timor— that it will do all it can to ensure that this objective is achieved; indeed  the whole international community should join in this. We reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the Maubere people in their just struggle  led by their vanguard movement  FRETILIN  the Frente Revolucionario de Timor Leste Independente. Despite renewed efforts by the Secretary General and the international community to find a negotiated settlement to the problem of Cyprus  no real result has yet been obtained. We therefore once again express our concern over the persistence of this problem and our hope that urgent action will be taken to bring the positions closer together and to enable the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to live together in peace  understanding and harmony and to safeguard the independence  the territorial integrity and the nonaligned character of Cyprus. Nonalignment  as the Assembly knows  is the comers tone of the foreign policy of the Republic of Guinea Bissau. My Government therefore supports the efforts of the nonaligned movement to present its unity and cohesion  the only way to ensure its ability to take action to promote the maintenance of national peace and security. We thus feel it necessary  taking into account the particularly serious international political situation today  to reaffirm the fundamental principles of the policy of nonalignment  especially the principles of nonintervention and peaceful settlement of disputes. In this context we therefore repeat our appeal to our brothers in Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran to find a negotiated settlement to the dispute between them  in the interest of their respective peoples  of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  of the nonaligned movement and of the international community as a whole. The many conflicts and tensions that have been mentioned here could certainly be avoided or settled if the various members of the international community implemented the fundamental principles of noninterference in the internal affairs of States  nonintervention and peaceful settlement of disputes. The situation in South East and South West Asia is of great concern to Guinea Bissau. In our opinion it is essential  in order to preserve peace and stability in those regions  to begin a process of negotiations where the spirit of understanding and the interest of the peoples concerned prevail and thus to create the atmosphere indispensable to the exercise by each people of those regions of the right freely to decide its future and to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity  free from outside interference. In our opinion  there should be the same approach to international relations in regard to the situation in Central America and the Caribbean. The current crisis in international relations is to a large extent the result of the continuing atmosphere of distrust among States and the frenzied arms race and its consequences and logical implications  such as the increase in militarized areas  in military bases  and in the production and the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated and destructive weapons. It is clear that the final  comprehensive solution to the problems of disarmament  enabling us to do away with the serious threats hanging over the world  cannot depend on only a few members of the international community  however powerful they may be economically and militarily on the world scene. We believe  along with the overwhelming majority of the international community  that the desired solution can come only through concerted action by all the countries of the world. The worsening of the world economic crisis is the logical result of structural disparities and of the continuing inequality and inequity in international economic relations. The spirit of multilateral economic cooperation  which in the first decades after the Second World War was one of the great hopes of the international community  and of the developing countries in particular  is today seriously weakened. It is clear that this tendency is contrary to the objectives set forth in the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade his phenomenon has serious consequences such as cronic deficits in the balance of payments of the developing countries and the continuing deterioration in terms of trade. The limits and the difficulties with regard access by third world countries to international financial markets and to the required technology  the increasing constraints placed on financial and technical aid are additional problems facing the developing countries. The use of concepts such as gradualism  selectivity and differentiation by the developed countries in trade relations with the developing ones constitutes an obstacle to the promotion of the economic development of the latter and further complicates the payment of external debt servicing and the meeting of import needs in food  energy and manufactured products. In this context therefore there is an imperative need  both for the developing countries and for the industrialized countries  that the process of global negotiations be made more dynamic. The Republic of Guinea Bissau  which belongs to the group of least developed countries  is not spared the harmful effects of the present international economic situation. The new policy of development advocated by our Government is intended primarily to reduce such effects by using all international and external means available to promote the development of all the economic sectors  particularly agriculture  and to promote diversification and an increase in production so as to ensure food self sufficiency The imbalance in Guinea Bissau's balance of payments  the increase in its foreign debt  heavy inflation  the consequences of the constant increase in the price of manufactured goods and fuel  the fall in the prices of its exports as a result of the deterioration of the terms of trade and its increased dependence on foreign aid are major problems facing Guinea Bissau and they justify the measures taken by the Government within its national development strategy. In that framework  a programme for economic and financial stabilization has been drawn up  arrangements also having been made for the holding of a conference of prime lenders during the first half of 1983 aimed at encouraging implementation of a four year socioeconomic development plan. The international community through its agencies and instruments must shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the deterioration in the world economic situation and the constant increase in inequalities between the developed and the developing countries  in order to ensure the enjoyment by all peoples of the right to development. Interdependence among the nations of the world makes this an important step  one calling for the struggle of humanity as a whole to preserve its common values. It is in that context that we include the concept of mankind's common heritage  developed during the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and appreciate the adoption by a large majority of the international community of the Convention on the Law of the Sea which formally establishes an international legal order and defines  among others  the regime of the high seas  oceans and sea beds. We hope that all countries will join in the signing of the Convention when it is opened for signature this year in Jamaica  thus conferring upon that important legal instrument its universal scope. These are the few points that it wanted to make at this time. The agenda shows once again  by the number and relevance of its items  the gravity of the international situation. I cannot mention every item. However  the scope of the debate held since the beginning of our deliberations clearly states the determination of States Members of the United Nations to help solve them all. The measures advocated are many  as are the means available to us to preserve international peace and security. We must just work together to achieve results. In addressing the Assembly every year  we bring with us the determination of the Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau to work tirelessly to seek solutions to the problems affecting international relations. Thus  we should once again like to express our firm conviction that the survival and progress of humanity depend on the efforts that the States Members of the United Nations will make to implement the decisions taken by the Organization and on their commitment to respect the principles set forth in the Charter to which they voluntarily subscribed."
"57",2760,"GNQ",37,1982,"It is a great honour for me to avail myself of this opportunity to address the Assembly in the name of the people of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and their President  Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  whom I represent here  and to express to the vast family of the international community the brotherly greetings and solidarity of my country.4.	I am particularly pleased to pause here to express  on my own behalf and on that of the delegation over which I have the honour of presiding  our most sincere congratulations to you  Mr. President on your well-deserved election as President of the Assembly to direct and preside efficiently over the debates that will be held throughout these days during which we shall be trying to find viable solutions to the innumerable problems which affect our world of today and constantly threaten peace and the civic and harmonious coexistence of peoples. It is our profound hope that your presidency will be carried out with the equanimity  foresight  wisdom and high diplomatic skills which have always characterized you and won for you the respect and esteem of us all. I should also like to transmit to your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our appreciation for the effective manner in which he discharged his functions during the last session. We particularly wish to congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  on his election to the lofty responsibility of ensuring the administrative and political functioning of the Head quarters of our great community. We are certain that his stature as an accredited diplomat and his vast knowledge of the machinery of the United Nations system will ensure that the difficult tasks entrusted to him will be carried out with guarantees of certainty and effectiveness.3. On my delegation's behalf  it is my pleasant duty to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of the United States of America  and in particular to the authorities of the State of New York  for the hospitality that has always been lavished upon us and for making available to us the material and spiritual conditions necessary for the success of sessions of the General Assembly.6.	Three years ago a representative of the people of Equatorial Guinea came before the Assembly at this podium to announce to the international community the action taken by the Equatorial Armed Forces which  on the dawn of 3 August 1979  decided to do away with the blood-stained regime of the wretched tyrant Macias Nguema.7.	Three years ago  in the same statement  the Government of the Supreme Military Council  established by that liberating action of the people of Equatorial Guinea undertook freely and resolutely  before the world and history  the sacred obligation of making every necessary effort to remove my people from the abandonment and destruction in which it had been plunged by the former regime.8.	Of course  the Government of the Supreme Military Council had no idea of the enormous difficulties that would later arise in the country's reconstruction. Indeed  the difficulties were and are enormous and multiple  since our task consists in eliminating the trauma from the minds of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea and building a new and different society. To this end  we have the urgent need to give priority to rehabilitating those fields of activity most important to the normalization of life in Equatorial Guinea  namely  health  education  agriculture and  above all  the economy-the decisive factor in the entire process of our reconstruction and development.9.	Today we can be proud of having worked honestly and resolutely  facing every difficulty and overcoming all kinds of obstacles to achieve some positive goals along the Ions and difficult road of reconstruction. Our achievements can be seen by all in Equatorial Guinea  and it would be too much for me to try to list them here  achievements which  I must add  would not have been possible without the decisive support of the international community.10.	When  in order to bring about the economic relaunching of Equatorial Guinea and in response to the pathetic appeal made by my country  the United Nations approved the holding of an international pledging conference at Geneva  we could not have guessed the significance it would have for our country. That Conference  held at Geneva in the month of April last-and attended personally by Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  President of the Republic-represented for my country a propitious opportunity for us to present in a clear  concise and detailed manner to the international community an inventory of our most urgent needs and the projects we have for solving them gradually  and at the same time to request assistance from international financial circles in obtaining contributions for the financing of those projects.11.	Through not only the assistance but also the interest and understanding of the international community  we were able to revise our forecasts  which were a source of great satisfaction to us  and we are very grateful to the countries which attended the Pledging Conference and showed interest in several of the projects we submitted there. We are also grateful to the governmental and non-governmental organizations which also showed an interest in our projects and to the United Nations system which  with special zeal and sincerity  worked ceaselessly to ensure the smooth running and success of the Conference  whose results are already being made visible in Equatorial Guinea through the large number of representatives of countries and international organizations who have come to maintain the first contacts and evaluate on the spot the possibilities of carrying out the proposed projects within the context of that Conference.12.	I have been specially asked by the President of the Republic to avail myself of this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Government and people of Equatorial Guinea  our sincere gratitude to all those who participated in or contributed in any way to that Conference  and our thanks for the fruitful results it achieved. It is an obvious proof of solidarity which the people of Equatorial Guinea will never forget  and we are confident that the spirit of that Conference will be kept alive and fervent  and that there will be increasing interest in assisting our country both on the part of the countries which attended the Conference  and on the part of those which  while not having been able to attend  feel a sense of solidarity with the cause of my country's reconstruction.13.	One of the most serious injuries suffered by the people of Equatorial Guinea during the dictatorship was the undisguised and unprecedented suppression of our fundamental rights  leaving the citizen of Equatorial Guinea deprived of his minimum rights. There are numerous examples that bear eloquent testimony to the acts of the past regime which with impunity cruelly jeopardized those rights. Therefore  one of the main goals of the Supreme Military Council  when it took power on 3 August 1979  was to restore those fundamental rights to the people of Equatorial Guinea; and from that very year a gradual but firm process of democratization of the country was initiated and measures adopted for the scrupulous and strict respect of the human person. On past occasions we listed in various statements the measures we have taken  from the liberation of all political prisoners to the drafting and presentation to the people of a Constitution  which our Government has been implementing faithfully  to comply with the promise and commitment entered into before our people and history.14.	Indeed  the Government of the Supreme Military Council  faithfully following the line of conduct it established when it first came to power  and in compliance with General Assembly resolution 34/123 which established the programme for the gradual democratization of our country  has lived up to its promise made to the people on the occasion of the second anniversary of the  freedom cooup   and has drafted the text of a constitution which  in order to comply with the requirements of our time regarding guarantees of human freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  it submitted for revision to United Nations experts appointed for that purpose by the Division on Human Rights.15.	On 2 August 1982 that Constitution was officially and solemnly presented by Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  President of the Republic  to the people of Equatorial Guinea. On 15 August the people was consulted in a popular referendum about whether or not it accepted the text of the Constitution. On 21 August  the National Referendum Committee announced the official results of that referendum.16.	It is my pleasure here to announce with pride to the international community that the people of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  in a referendum conducted through a direct  free and secret ballot  has provided itself with a new democratic constitution  supported by an overwhelming majority of 95 per cent of the votes cast  or the basis of a 96 per cent voter turnout.17.	On the same occasion  and in accordance with another provision of the Constitution  Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  by the acclamation of the people and in expression of its free will  was charged with guiding the sacred destiny of Equatorial Guinea for the seven years following the adoption of the Constitution.18.	That massive  unanimous election of Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo to the nation's highest office was free from any trickery and resulted from the desire of the people of Equatorial Guinea to maintain continuity in the process of democratization it has undertaken  and that the same guiding hand should complete it  before proceeding to the general elections to take place at the end of the seven-year term of the presidential mandate.19.	Our Constitution  the basic code which now rules and guides the sacred destiny of my people  provides for a Council of State  a People's House of Representatives  a Court of Justice  a National Council for Economic development and Community Councils. The latter are adapted to our national situation for democratization by giving the power structure its roots in the communities  in the countryside.20.	We think we have kept our word to the international community  given in the Assembly  and are pleased to have done so before the time set in a programme drawn up in collaboration with the United Nations. Our devotion to the people  and our historic commitment to it  have enabled us to provide that people  only three years after taking power  with a democratic constitution  with all the organs and conditions required to ensure scrupulous respect of its basic rights and the enjoyment of a state of law  in keeping with the standards of the second half of the twentieth century.21.	We are fully convinced that  just as it responded massively and affirmatively in favour of the Constitution  our people will also be able to live up to it by safeguarding and respecting it  so that  with the Constitution as our cornerstone and beacon  we shall go forward together in peace and national harmony to accomplish the very difficult task of reconstructing the country.22.	Basic difficulties-such as those we face in the area of food and  above all  in restoring the country to economic health-have shown us that our strength is limited  although our efforts are enormous. We are therefore certain that we cannot travel this hard road on our own  without the steadfast assistance of the international community  whether bilateral or multilateral.23.	Regarding bilateral relations  we have sought to break with the isolation which the past regime imposed on our people for more than a decade  and we have not only succeeded in re-establishing international credibility and trust  but have greatly strengthened the links that unite us with neighbouring countries  with the African continent  and the world in general  without ideological or bloc discrimination.24.	in this connection it is my honour to mention the excellent relations of co-operation between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea with Spain  whose assistance has always been decisive for our country  as well as the relations we maintain with France  the United States of America  the People's Republic of China  Morocco  the Federal Republic of Germany  Switzerland and Egypt  to name but a few. These are countries whose co-operation has already taken positive form in Equatorial Guinea.25.	Our relations of co-operation with the neighbouring brother countries of the United Republic of Cameroon  the Republic of Gabon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria are excellent  for those countries have spared neither effort nor moral and material means to encourage us and spur us on to continue resolutely the great task of reconstruction express  before the Assembly  our deepest gratitude to them. We have signed agreements on bilateral co-operation with Sao Tome and Principe.26.	As to the community of Hispanic nations  we are aware of the affinities and identity which unite us to it  and we are making every effort to achieve greater integration and to establish solid links with our brothers in Latin America and the Caribbean region. There are already joint projects with the Argentine Republic  and our ties with other countries such as Venezuela  Cuba and Mexico  are strengthening and are becoming increasingly positive.27.	In a world like ours in the second half of the twentieth century  our concerns can only grow. We believe that this rostrum-the Assembly-is the most appropriate place to denounce the alarming and growing abandonment by nations of the principle of dialogue in favour of the spirit of war and confrontation. The cold war  which  during the post-war years  had itself been a threat hovering over the peoples  has dangerously given way to the proliferation of armed confrontations.28.	National leaders are growing more intransigent  and the results of this are there to be seen: self-destruction and the tens of thousands of human beings who are paying with their lives for wars waged for sterile claims. Such problems are of profound concern to my Government; they are to be seen far beyond the walls of this Hall  and it is imperative that practical solutions be found. I refer especially-but only by way of example-to the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the question of the Malvinas  the occupation of Cyprus  the situation on the Korean peninsula  a practical satisfactory solution for which has been sought since 1966 without success  the untenable status of Namibia.29.All these problems have a significant effect on the noble principles of the self-determination of peoples  respect for human rights and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  principles to which my Government adheres and abides by. Along with this  there is the constant tension in the Middle East  which has become more acute with the invasion of Lebanon and the killing of Palestinians by Israel forces  which constitute flagrant flouting of the inalienable rights of an entire people. Further  terrorism runs rampant in Europe.30.	The African continent continues to be the theatre for military operations and adventures by non-African Powers. Those Powers are fomenting discord and confrontation among our States  in order to weaken us and freely to exploit our resources  imposing on us truly humiliating trading conditions.31.	The tensions which exist are well known and do not need a special review at this time  for they are always a part of the daily life of our continent and pose a grave threat to the Organization of African Unity [OAU]- This is not the time for a detailed analysis of this tragic problem  for we believe that that analysis and a solution to the problem are an inter-African responsibility.32.	Nevertheless we appeal to African States to show maturity and find a single firm and decisive solution to the crisis  one respecting the integrity and inviolability of the fundamental principles of the charter of the OAU. We cannot permit the disintegration of the OAU because our solidarity would thereby be profoundly affected  as it is our best weapon in our struggle against the political  economic and social injustices from which the African continent suffers.33.	We are pleased at the return to order in Chad and we wish that brother people peace and prosperity.34.	In accordance with this line of thinking  the people of Equatorial Guinea  in the person of its President  Colonel Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  whom I have the honour to represent in the Assembly  is in favour of finding immediate and positive solutions to these disputes by way of dialogue and mutual understanding  involving the consistent  clear  and literal implementation of the relevant resolutions on these disputes adopted by this great Organization.35.	As Vice-President of the Supreme Military Council  and having the honour of representing the President of the Republic  it remains only for me to reiterate to the Assembly that my Government is resolutely determined to promote the social and economic development of our country  strictly and faithfully to comply with the process of democratization which we have started  to respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to make every effort to help establish solid foundations for peace in the world."
"58",2805,"GRC",37,1982,"  Your election  Sir  to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a tribute to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and recognition of your vast experience. It is also a guarantee that the work of this Assembly will be conducted effectively and with wisdom. Please allow me to congratulate you most warmly. On this occasion  I should like also to express my warmest wishes to the outgoing President  Mr. Ismat Kittani. He has earned the gratitude of this Assembly for the exemplary way in which he guided its work  for his constructive initiatives and for enhancing the prestige of his high office. It also gives me particular pleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. In this first year of his term in office he has carried out his mission with dedication and unusual skill  thereby justly winning for himself great trust and high esteem.173.	The President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  Mr. Ellemann-Jensen  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark  has presented to the Assembly  at the 8th meeting  the views of the 10 members of the Community on the main international problems. I should like to state here  however  that the foreign policy of the Greek Government is basically guided by absolute respect for the principle of the non-use of force in international relations. Consequently  we attach great importance to the promotion of detente and disarmament as well as of international co-operation. We also support in the strongest possible terms any effort towards enhancing respect for human rights all over the world. At this point  I should like to analyze in detail the position of my Government on problems which are of particular interest to Greece.174.	In the first place  there is the problem of the Middle East. Apart from its major international importance  it is of special interest to Greece  not only because of our geographical proximity to the region where the crisis is evolving  but also because of the traditional bonds which link us to the Arab world. This explains the many initiatives taken by my Government in the past few months  within the European Community as well as other international forums  with a view to promoting the Palestinian cause and restoring peace in Lebanon.175.	The opening of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly has been marked by an appalling crimeóthe massacre of hundreds of innocent Palestinians in the camps of Beirut. The precise circumstances of this cold-blooded slaughter will not be known until an appropriate inquiry into the matter is conducted.. However  it is an undisputed fact that the massacre occurred in an area under the firm control of the Israeli army. Therefore  Israel cannot escape the blame for what has happened.176.	My Government has repeatedly condemned in the strongest terms the Israeli invasion in Lebanon. When the special United States envoy  Mr. Habib  managed to arrange a peaceful lifting of the siege of west Beirut  we felt hopeful that events in the Middle East might take a constructive turn. Our optimism was short-lived  since in the aftermath of the assassination of the President-elect of Lebanon the Israeli forces  violating the Habib agreement  invaded west Beirut  throwing the door open to the appalling massacre of Palestinian civilians that followed. My country was quick to request the Security Council to take adequate and effective measures to safeguard the civilian population in Lebanon.177.	However  there are still a few encouraging signs. I am referring to the Reagan plan  which could be considered as the first step of a process which might lead to a solution to the Palestinian problem. I should also like to stress in this context the proposals of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  which were announced a little later. I emphasize the fact that the Arab countries which participated in the Conference were unanimous in putting forward a series of constructive proposals aimed at a comprehensive solution which would be satisfactory for the Palestinians.178.	This is a time for action  not only by the parties to the conflict but also by the international community as a whole. The position of the PLO should be enhanced to enable it to play a more meaningful part in the peace process if we do not wish to see the strong feelings of frustration and despair of the Palestinians after their recent experiences in Lebanon find their expression in a new wave of international violence. In this connection we think that along with the recognition of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish their own independent State  the PLO should be recognized as their representative  with the right of full participation in the peace negotiations. In stating this we think that Israel's right of existence should be affirmed beyond any doubt  together with its right to live in peace along with the other States of the area within recognized and secure boundaries. Israel should realize that it will achieve its security not through the use of force but only through dialogue and nego-tiations.Recent events have proved that stability in Lebanon has a direct bearing upon the search Mr a peaceful settlement of the Middle East question. For that reason  as well as for the sake of solidarity with Lebanon  the population of which has suffered so cruelly  we must encourage all steps leading to a stable Lebanon through the return of normality in that country and the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government over the whole of its territory. It is in that spirit that we greet the election of a new President and earnestly hope that this development will mark the beginning of a new era in that country.180. The problem of Cyprus is of paramount importance to the Greek Government  both because of the well-known links between the peoples of Greece and Cyprus and because Greece is one of the guarantors of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus under the terms of the 1960 Treaties.181.	The main components of this problem could be summarized as follows: More than 36 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus is occupied by Turkish troops. Consequently  the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is unable to exercise its sovereign rights over the whole territory of the Republic. Thousands of Greek Cypriots have been displaced and live as refugees in their own country. On the other hand  the Turkish Cypriot minority expresses deep concern over its own security. Similarly  the Greek Cypriots are deeply concerned over their own security because of the permanent threat which materialized in a dramatic manner through the Turkish invasion and subsequent occupation of the island. Moreover  we cannot overlook the determining factor of the Cyprus problem  namely  that 80 per cent of the population of the Republic of Cyprus are Greek Cypriots whereas only 18 per cent are Turkish Cypriots. Although eight years have already elapsed since the 1974 invasion  the intercommunal talks  which have been going on ever since under the auspices of the Secretary-General  have failed to produce any results.182.	Faced with those realities and with such an ominous deadlock  the Prime Minister of Greece  Mr. Andreas Papandreou  made a constructive proposal a few months ago the substance of which is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus and the expansion of the United Nations peace-keeping forces  in an effort to allay the fears that the Turkish minority might otherwise feel for its security. In this regard the Greek Prime Minister specified that Greece is prepared to make a substantial financial contribution in order to meet the additional expenses that such an expanded peace keeping force would require. Once the foreign troops are withdrawn and an expanded United Nations force is in place  the conditions will be set for truly constructive talks to start between the two communities with a view to achieving a just solution to the Cyprus problem acceptable to all. The final goalis the safeguarding of the independence  territorial integrity  unity and non- aligned character of Cyprus  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Assembly.183.	The Middle East and Cyprus problems are not the only ones which have resulted from the resort to force in contravention of the principles and obligations of the Charter. Other major international crises are also the result of the illegal use of force which has led to the continuing occupation of the territory of other countries  notwithstanding the repeated unanimous condemnations of the Assembly and its calls to put an end to such occupation  as in the case of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. Greece has consistently and firmly condemned all acts of invasion and foreign occupation  regardless of who the aggressor is.184.	What I have just said does not mean that we do not sympathize with the struggle of peoples which have been denied their fundamental right to self- determination. It is in this context that my Government lends its moral support to national liberation movements. I wish at this point to express more particularly the concern of the Greek Government at the situation in Central America and more specifically in El Salvador and Nicaragua and at the threat of regionalization of the conflict in El Salvador. Greece calls for a negotiated political settlement in El Salvador and expresses its firm belief that the Frente de Liberacion Nacional Farabundo Marti and the Frente Democratico Revolucionario should be included in such a settlement as representative political forces.185.	In the same spirit  we condemn in the strongest terms the continued illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa  express our firm support for the efforts of the Western countries which make up the contact group and urge them to do whatever they can to enable Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to be implemented without any further delay. It is encouraging that these efforts have recently led to encouraging progress and that as a result the independence of Namibia has come much closer than it has ever been before.186.	The Secretary-General submitted to the Assembly his courageous  comprehensive and fore- sighted report on the work of the Organization. He refers  in no uncertain terms to the decline of the Organization  and I fully share his assessment. I feel compelled at this juncture to express the profound disappointment of my country at the fact that the United Nations has failed to contribute to the maintenance of peace and to protect the sovereignty of Member States. I am afraid that I am stating the obvious when I say that if this trend continues the Organization  which was created to fulfill the hopes and expectations of mankind  which had been devastated by the Second World War  will be transformed into a decorative international bureaucracy. This is not the moment for me to deal with the causes of the crisis. However  all agree that the responsibility of the great Powers for the decline of the Organization is not small; nor is that of many States which demonstrate their contempt for the fundamental principles of the United Nations.187.	Greece  a traditionally peace-loving country  has followed with genuine interest recent developments concerning disarmament  and particularly the proceedings of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament which was convened a few months ago. Unfortunately  despite the fact that nobody denied the urgent need for disarmament  the special session did not produce the results for which we all hoped. Nevertheless  it should not be forgotten that it demonstrated the determination of all peoples to live in peace  without the scourge of war. All Governments  and especially those of the super powers  should understand the real meaning of this message and increase their efforts. Practical steps should be taken urgently to promote detente and cooperation among States and to open the way for the adoption of effective measures of arms control and disarmament. The efforts should be directed to both nuclear andconventional disarmament. It is essential to remember that the former cannot be achieved satisfactorily unless it is coupled with disarmament in conventional weapons and other weapon;  of mass destruction.188.	In this spirit we welcome the negotiations which are currently going on in Geneva between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. We earnestly hope that they will result in positive developments. For our part  we are opposed as a matter of principle to the division of the world into antagonistic blocs. It is an integral part of our long-term policy to overcome this division. In this connection we express our appreciation to the non-aligned movement for its role in furthering the cause of peace. We cannot but congratulate its members on their decision to keep away from the military blocs.189.	Peace would not be complete  however  if it were not accompanied by respect for human rights and by the development of economic co-operation between countries. Democratic Greece  because of its age-old cultural and national traditions  is strongly and unshakably committed to respect fbr human rights. Nobody has ever been persecuted in Greece because of race  religion or creed. It is with deep regret  therefore  that we note that in several countries people are being tortured  disappear without leaving a trace or are deprived of their fundamental rights. Furthermore  some countries  on the pretext of resisting interference in their internal affairs  refuse to co-operate with the appropriate international organs for the control of human rights violations. Greece condemns any form of racial discrimination  in particular the policy of apartheid pursued by the South African Government notwithstanding the persistent demands of the international community that it be ended immediately.190.	The adverse economic situation prevailing throughout the world has caused a serious setback as regards North-South issues. The recessionary tendencies in the developed market economies  which are far from being resolved  preclude any immediate relief for the developing countries  whose already weak and vulnerable economies should be propelled forward at an acceptable pace. The North-South dialogue appears to be moribund. Immobility and stalemate have become the norm.191.	Thus  it is all the more to be hoped that at this session the Assembly will finally bring about the agreement on the launching of the global negotiations that has eluded us for so long. The meetings of Cancun in October 1981 and Versailles in June 1982 represent serious attempts to give impetus to the global negotiations. Endeavors in that direction must continue within the United Nations and should be the responsibility of all Member States. The developed world in particular must assume its appropriate share of that responsibility. My Government will lend its support to any effort to that end. It is more than obvious that failing to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor nations will only increase political instability and endanger peace all over the world.192.	The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  held at Nairobi  represents a global challenge in trying to find new ways for increased utilization of such sources of energy. The meeting of the Interim Committee  which was held in June in Rome  has created a positive climate for the continuation of the consultations regarding the implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action.?193.	A strong and more vibrant United Nations should carefully examine possible solutions to the multitude of economic problems facing the world today  and the Organization needs to be put to more practical use.194.	It would be an omission if I did not refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Greece  being a maritime nation  welcomes the conclusion of the work of the Conference. We consider this an important development  which will  we hope  greatly contribute to the solution of existing differences between countries and strengthen international co-operation. We urge all States to sign and ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?195.	In the course of this statement I have expressed the disappointment of my country over the poor per-formance of the United Nations  and particularly its failure to discharge its major missionónamely  to help maintain world peace and protect the sovereignty of its Member States. However  I feel compelled also to express the warm wish that the United Nations shall gradually overcome its weaknesses  so that it manages to fulfill the mission entrusted to it by mankind. Despite its many shortcomings  the Organization remainsóshould remainóa great hope of peace-loving people the world over. In this context I assure the Secretary-General that he will have the earnest support of my Government in his noble endeavor to restore the prestige and effectiveness of the Organization."
"59",2848,"GRD",37,1982,"The delegation of the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada wishes to join all those delegations which have extended their congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. The success of this session will be measured by the yardstick of the Assembly's ability to steer us back to the paths of brotherhood  international understanding and peace. The experience  wisdom and diplomatic skills of the one who guides the deliberations of the Assembly will constitute a critical factor in achieving any measure of success. Mr. Hollai's unanimous election is not only a deserved tribute to his widely acclaimed talents as a diplomat but also an acknowledgement by the international community of the invaluable contribution made by his country  the socialist Hungarian People's Republic  in favour of peace  justice and social progress. We are confident that his distinguished record makes him eminently qualified for his challenging task. My delegation also wishes to express its sincere appreciation of the manner in which Mr. Hollai's predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  met the daily demands of his office  with courage  even-handedness and an air of quiet and effective diplomacy.88.	My delegation further takes this opportunity to say a special word of greeting to the Secretary-General on the occasion of the first regular session of the General Assembly since he assumed office. The elevation of Mr. Perez de Cuellar to that important position has been and always will be a source of great pride and satisfaction to us  the peoples of that part of the third world that the renowned statesman and freedom fighter  Jose Marti  called ""our America"". After a mere few months in exercise of his functions it is already appropriate to take note of his untiring efforts in furthering the cause of peace and the objectives of the United Nations. For this we express ;o the Secretary-General our deep appreciation.89.	This session is taking place at a critical moment in the history of our planet and of mankind. It is a time when there are dangers born of a deep-seated international economic malaise  with threatening storm-clouds resulting from the dangerous arms race  above all: from the cruelty and callousness which comes from man's apparent inhumanity to his brother and his neighbour  which threaten to engulf the world and annihilate us and our vaunted civilization. Exactly one year ago  in my address to the Assembly at the 33rd meeting of the thirty-sixth session  I expressed dismay  as did other delegations  frightening state of international relations. Today  12 months later  this session is being held with the global situation not less but more alarming than ever.90.	Today the United Nations has become  in more ways than one  mankind's hope for survival and social advancement. The Organization must not only channel and accelerate the search for peace but also preside over the ushering in of a world economic ordering of resources which will allow the poor and the weak to live  not merely survive. But  in addition  the Organization  by the very ideals enshrined in the Charter  by its noble concept of economic and social development seen in the outreach of its specialized agencies and bodies such as UNDP and UNESCO; provides guidance for each individual .political authority represented in this Hall and appeals to aspects of the internal policy of every Member State.91.	We in Grenada are not only conscious of the relevance to our experience of the declarations on the rights of man and of society  for these  after all  are a product of the collective wisdom of the representatives of mankind assembled here; we are not merely aware of the evolution within the United Nations specialized agencies of a preference for development geared towards the satisfaction of people's needs and people's aspirations our entire revolutionary political process  which triumphed in March 1979  focuses on such pronouncements and our developmental model is constructed on the foundations of people-oriented programmed and activities. The internal achievements of three and a half years of the People's Revolutionary Government bear ample testimony to this fact.92.	We are engaged in an experiment in popular and participatory democracy where the people gather in their localities  as do their delegates at the zonal and national level  to discuss  debate and make their own proposals on every aspect of government policy  including the national budget. There is freedom of expression Car all our people based on a low guaranteeing democratic ownership and control of the news media. We have made rapid strides towards guaranteeing in practice employment for every man and woman able and willing to work Also  we are moving towards the point where Grenada can provide free and modern health services for all its citizens  ample food and nutrition for ail  adequate and decent housing for all  and ensure the extension of the basic amenities of modem living to everyone. There is free education up to the secondary school level  and our national literacy campaign and adult education programme are aimed at wiping out illiteracy and raising the educational standard of every worker and peasant to sixth-grade level by 1990  in accordance with the objectives and programmes set by UNESCO.93.	So the struggle goes on  the struggle to transform the society  to improve the unacceptably poor quality of life  and to achieve material and spiritual development and economic and social justice for all our people.94.	Our approach to the question of relations with the world around us involves a thrust compatible and in consonance with our political preference for genuinely democratic structures and people-oriented attitudes towards development. While we aim therefore  in the true spirit of the family of the United Nations  to build normal state-to-state relations with all peoples  some of the main pillars of the edifice of our foreign policy remains as follows: those of non-alignment  anti-imperialism and good neighbourliness; the struggle for world peace and security; the determination to support the struggle of those who are denied their sovereign right freely to choose their path to development; and full support for the demand for more democratically structured international financial institutions and a just and equitable ordering of the global economic system.93. Grenada is aware that the absence of those elements within international relations inhibits its own growth. The rate of advancement of our small island nation  like other third world countries with special disadvantages  would be severely restricted if there were no peace or atmosphere of tranquillity and detente. In addition to strong moral and political considerations  our development is adversely affected to some degree if the peoples of Namibia and Palestine are denied the opportunity to release their energies and the resources available to them into the common pool of South-South co-operation. And development will remain a dream for Grenada unless a way can be found to usher in a new order of relations between our commodity prices and the prices of the goods we import.96.	The problems of Grenada reflect the present state of the international economic situation. In the first place  the expanding indebtedness of the developing countries cannot be over-emphasized. The current levels of this debt  along with the recent trends in the terms of trade and international interest rates  have become a nightmare to many countries in the developing world. For instance  the price now being fetched for cocoa  one of Grenada's basic exports  is half of what it was two years ago.97.	In many cases third world countries  especially small islands and small land locked States  are attempting through even further external borrowing to cover the deficits in their external accounts  caused partly by imported inflation  high energy costs and the openness of their economies.98.	This problem of external over-indebtedness is made worse by the rise of protectionism on the part of some developed countries. These protectionist trends are becoming stronger each day-as was evidenced in the struggle the third world was obliged to wage in negotiating the third multi-fibre agreement in December 1981. In our view  due to the interdependent nature of the world economy  it is necessary for the developed world to open up markets to the exports of the developing world. Prohibitive tariffs  subsidies which violate the principle of the international division of labour and quota restrictions on many commodities  including sugar  should be removed.99.	Another major problem is the power and dominance of the transnational corporations in the economies of developing countries. It is part of the neo-colonial legacy left to developing countries from years of colonial and imperialist domination.100.	It is within the context of this unjust international economic order that my Government sees the need for the reopening of global negotiations. My Government is convinced that only through the early adoption of proposals for a new international economic order can there be a framework of principles to solve these complex and vexing problems which now affect the international economic system.101.	In our opinion  the failure of the global negotiations so far stems from the intractable position taken by a few developed countries  particularly that of a major country. These countries are firmly opposed to any structural transformation of the present inequitable international economic system  and are only prepared to allow marginal reforms that gradually incorporate selected countries chosen solely on the basis of political considerations.l02. The continued resistance to negotiations by certain developed countries is a strategy to perpetuate and increase the economic dependence of the developing world. My delegation echoes the call of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs  held at New Delhi to the Group of 77 to remain firm with regard to its agreement on the basic objectives of the global negotiations. In this regard  my Government welcomes and is greatly encouraged by the fact that a number of countries have achieved or are approaching the level of economic assistance to the developing world laid down as a target by the United Nations. We are also heartened by the recent decision of the Government of France to increase its volume of aid to the developing world in spite of the global economic crisis and  beginning in January 1983  to extend its development aid programme to include Caribbean countries for the first time.103. The demand for a new international economic order must also have as one of its objectives the reform of the two most important monetary institutions for the developing world-the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In order that these institutions may provide greater and more effective flows of finance there is a need for a change in the content of their programmes and the quantum of fund resources made available under current quota policies generally applied to small island and small land-locked economies. There is an urgent need for a reappraisal and restructuring by the Fund in three basic areas; liquidity and balance-of-payments support  the indices of conditionally  and the nature and phasing of adjustment over both the short and medium term.104. On the issue of the reform of the World Bank  the People's Revolutionary Government has taken note of the several areas of the Bank's operations where action has been taken or is under way to implement reform. However  there is one important area of World Bank reform where no action has yet been taken. That is the desire for fairness in the criteria and mechanics for the allocation of assistance by the World Bank and the International Development Association to developing countries and efficiency in the disbursement of such assistance. The Brandt Commission's recommendations on this matter indicate that the present concentration of staff -95 per cent of whom work in Washington at the Bank's headquarters-tends to make the World Bank remote from the problems and attitudes in borrowing countries. In addition  the Bank's articles of agreement anticipated a decentralization of its activities  but that has not yet happened. This decentralization would  among other things  have enabled the Bank to attract and retain a wider range of staff from developing countries.103. The People's Revolutionary Government is firmly convinced that only a reform of IMF and the World Bank along the lines just mentioned can assist the developing countries  including small island and small land-locked States  in their struggle to overcome external indebtedness.106.	In order to allow for stability and economic growth in most developing countries and to ensure that transfers of appropriate technology can be implemented successfully  it is necessary that the level of development assistance be greatly increased. That can be done through a reformed World Bank and IMF. Indeed  the economies of some developing countries are threatened with total collapse unless there are greater development assistance flows.107.	In our opinion  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea can be a catalyst for peace  serving to eliminate potential conflicts between neighbouring States. We view it also  of course  as providing a welcome opportunity for economic development through the exploitation of our marine resources. The Grenada delegation is therefore happy that the Convention has been adopted and will be a signatory to it in the near future.108.	With respect to South-South co-operation the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada recognizes that despite the potential  progress has been slow. This is not surprising  however  given the dependent nature of the relationship between developed and developing countries. There is an urgent need  for instance  to address the problem of air and sea transport facilities necessary for realizing the goals of greater South-South trade and cooperation.109.	The High-Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries  held at Caracas in 1981  did  however  begin the process of defining more relevant concepts and operative measures  including the creation of an institutional framework that would permit developing countries to carry forward the programme for economic co-operation among developing countries with greater dynamism than in the past. With proper follow-up action this goal could be realized.110.	Even as much of the international community continues to suffer from the debilitating economic crisis  it is being further pauperized and deprived of the benefits of much of its economic and other resources by the persistent squandering of massive sums on sophisticated armaments which threaten the world and its peoples with extinction. Over the past few years  mankind has been forced to listen to gruesome accounts of the production of increasing quantities of monstrous weapons  and has been constrained to contemplate  in apparent helplessness  its own destruction. In this frightening context  Grenada appeals to the nuclear Powers to reverse the present trend of nuclear proliferation and to begin the process of meaningful arms control and arms reduction.111.	Grenada sees no logic in the concepts of nuclear first strike or limited nuclear war. Such formulations are inherently contradictory  if not reckless  and suggest a willingness on the part of one nuclear Power to experiment with its nuclear toys. Therefore  Grenada applauds the bold undertaking by the Soviet Union at the second special session on disarmament not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. We recognize the positive impact of that obligation and call upon other nuclear States to respond in like manner  in the interest of preserving world peace. Once again  Grenada calls for the purposeful ratification of the SALT II agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. Grenada is resolutely committed to the process of lessening international tension and the promotion of world peace and disarmament. As a result  Grenada will support any serious proposal from any quarter aimed at bringing an end to the arms race and achieving world peace and social progress.112.	The world has just witnessed the worst episode of damage and genocide since the Nazi era. This shameless act of cruelty comes as a direct result of the irresponsible arming of Zionist Israel. The extent of United States economic and military support to Israel is irrefutable. Since June of this year  the sovereign territory of Lebanon has been the testing ground for all sorts of American and Israeli arms  to the detriment of thousands of human lives and of Lebanese cities and villages. As the world witnessed this despicable act of genocide and plunder  and was enraged thereby  the United States shrugged its international responsibility and failed to restrain its Zionist ally. In short  the two had become one in the exercise of the so-called strategic alliance.113.	Of course  the massacre of hundreds of innocent  helpless Palestinian refugees in their beds is an integral part of that scenario and cannot be divorced from it. In this regard  Grenada joins the international outcry against such butchery. We solemnly condemn Israel for its invasion of Lebanon and the death and suffering it has meted out to the Lebanese and Palestinian people.114.	Grenada is staunch in the belief that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon must be respected and demands the withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces. We sincerely hope that the Lebanese people will move towards national reconciliation and address themselves to the honourable task of national reconstruction. Accordingly  Grenada calls upon the international community to render all possible assistance to the people of Lebanon at this critical time.115.	It is well known that the Middle East conflict derives from the expulsion of the Palestinian people from their homeland. Therefore  the conflict situation existing in that region can be resolved only through the settlement of the Palestinian question. Grenada urges an expeditious settlement of this matter in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.116.	We recognize the signal importance of the peace proposals put forward by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in September. These proposals represent a reasonable basis for a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict  and Grenada is proud to give them its total support. At the same time  Grenada cannot accept in their entirety the proposals submitted on 1 September by the United States President  Ronald Reagan  on the issue  since they offer no solution to the key issue of the creation of an independent Palestinian State. This plan also seeks to marginalize if not negate the role and importance of the PLO and is  therefore  untenable and manifestly short-sighted.117.	The United Nations has recognized the PLO as the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people. Unfortunately  the State of Israel and its powerful patron do not respect this decision. However  it must now be clear to such forces that the expulsion of the PLO from Beirut and its dispersal throughout the Arab world do not amount to its defeat. In reality  the blood of the Palestinian martyrs and patriots serves as a fertilizer that nourishes their just cause. Grenada wishes to reaffirm its resolute solidarity with the PLO and the Arab people of Palestine and condemns most vehemently the atrocities committed against these people. We also reject the expansionist and oppressive policies pursued by the Begin-Sharon regime in the occupied territories.118.	War continues in the Gulf area much to the detriment of the peoples of that part of the world and to the apparent delight of imperialism. We call upon Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease hostilities  settle their disputes through peaceful means and properly direct their resources to the task of national reconstruction.119.	It is well known that the inhabitants of the People's Republic of Kampuchea are shaping a new society through various democratic structures. We categorically dismiss the imperialist-sponsored ""Kampuchea Coalition Government in Exile"" as an unmasked attempt to hide the bloody hand of the Pol Pot clique and to give legitimacy to their counterrevolutionary activities. Grenada reiterates its support for the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.120.	The situation in the Korean peninsula continues to be a threat to world peace. Grenada urges the speedy reunification of Korea. We also demand the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from the peninsula.121.	Grenada is hopeful that a meaningful political settlement will be achieved in Cyprus without further delay and that the country's sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity will be fully restored and respected.122.	Similarly  we support the call for self-determination for the people of East Timor.123.	It is clear that some members of the so-called contact group on Namibia have lost all contact with reality and have resorted to dilatory tactics in the negotiations for independence for Namibia. The unique electoral device of one man-two votes as posited by the contact group is clearly inimical to the interests of SWAPO and has been rightly rejected by the frontline States. The improper intervention into the negotiation process by the United States  through its irrelevant demand for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a pre-condition for the granting of independence to Namibia  is largely responsible for the present impasse. The United States position is also inconsistent with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and is an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Angola.124.	Besides  South Africa has been covertly preparing to alter the internal Namibian constitution and administration  in an attempt to erode SWAPO's support and delay the granting of independence to Namibia by ignoring demands for elections supervised by the United Nations. The treacherous incursions into Angola at critical points in the negotiating process must be interpreted in this context.125.	Grenada emphasizes its resolute support for SWAPO and stresses the inalienable right of the Namibian people to self-determination and full independence. Grenada further calls upon the United Nations to take expeditious action to bring about independence for Namibia  since it is clear that the negotiations are at a standstill.126.	The situation in southern Africa is characterized by South Africa's determination to destabilize regional States through economic pressure and sabotage  direct military intervention and the sponsoring of mercenaries. The experience of States like Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe  Zambia  Botswana  Lesotho and Seychelles attests to this truth. Grenada urges southern African States to strengthen the structures of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference. At the same time  we emphatically denounce South Africa's repeated attacks on these States  its support for disruptive groups and bandits and its policy of economic destabilization.127.	In South Africa itself  the monstrous apartheid system has been better armed and  no doubt  is more firmly entrenched-for the time being. Our black brothers and sisters are held in veritable concentration camps. Black workers are paid starvation wages for long hours of hard labour. Their trade unions are outlawed and their dedicated leaders are hounded like beasts. Yet  when we hear homilies about the rights of trade unions and the importance of upholding workers' democracy  the South African abuses are never highlighted. Faced with this difficult situation  ANC continues to be the vanguard for the liberation of the oppressed in South Africa. Grenada pledges its continued support for ANC and our brothers and sisters of South Africa in their struggle for human rights and majority rule.128.	The issue of Western Sahara has led to unfortunate developments within the GAU which directly threaten to compromise its future. Grenada respectfully urges its African brothers and sisters to resolve speedily the dispute over Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the POLISARIO Front and the Government and the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic in their just struggle for self-determination  national independence and sovereignty.129.	The yearning of third world peoples for peace and stability has given increasing popularity to the concept of regional zones of peace. Parallel to our own struggle in the Caribbean and Central American region  our brothers whose shores are washed by the Indian Ocean have been calling for their region to be recognized as a zone of peace.13C. Conscious of the warmongering tactics of certain imperialist elements in that part of the world  Grenada hails the determined efforts of the Governments and the peoples of Mozambique  the United Republic of Tanzania  India  Democratic Yemen  Mauritius  Madagascar and Seychelles in this direction. We fully support their common demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Indian Ocean; the non-introduction and non-deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction; the cessation of military manoeuvres by the allies of South Africa and Israel; and the right of States to be free from the threat of invasion by mercenaries.131.	This vexing question of mercenary activity continues to threaten the peace and stability of a number of poor  developing countries  as evidenced by recent attempts by imperialist-backed mercenaries to overthrow the Seychelles Government. Despite limited attempts by some countries to deal with this problem at the national level  the international community lacks effective and comprehensive machinery for this purpose.132.	Grenada and other countries of the hemisphere are particularly conscious of this problem  since the likelihood of mercenary invasion in our region  backed by certain imperialist State entities  is quite real.133.	We once more register our support for the Roc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries. However  we note the inability of that Committee to complete its assignment thus far. Once more we urge that the work be expedited so that effective measures can be taken to outlaw the recruitment  training  assembly  transit  financing and use of mercenaries. The situation is one of urgency.134.	In the Latin American and Caribbean region  the militaristic policy of the largest Power in the hemisphere seems aimed at determining all issues on the basis of brute force and ruthless economic might-hence the threats to Nicaragua  Cuba and Grenada. The continued economic blockade and military threats against Cuba; the ever-increasing threats against Nicaragua  including the training and use of mercenaries from bases in neighbouring States; the attempts to destabilize the revolutionary process in our own country  Grenada; the illegal and provocative violation of our air space-all of these militaristic postures display an amazing and unfortunate lack of understanding on the part of the United States. We condemn and deplore all efforts to pursue militaristic policies and policies of confrontation in the Latin American and Caribbean region.133. With respect to the so-called Caribbean Basin Initiative  it is our view that this constitutes an attempt to sow the seeds of divisiveness  and thus extend hegemony over countries in the region. The ""donor country"" seeks by its so-called gifts to hold an entire region to ransom by making a mockery of the concept of ideological pluralism subscribed to by CARICOM member States and by the United Nations system. This exposes the utter contempt with which it views the sovereign and independent processes of the developing countries of the region.136.	Grenada is seeking its own path to development and exercising its sovereign right to find its own solutions to the problems which have for centuries confronted its people. We therefore reject the arrogant condescension of those who seek to dictate rather than discuss  to isolate those with whom they disagree and to attempt to make pawns of sovereign  independent peoples.137.	We insist on the inalienable right of every country  irrespective of its size  to be master of its destiny. Recent events in Western Europe have clearly shown that  in the interests of development  countries will defend their sovereign right to conduct business wherever they wish.138.	Intent on seeking an improved quality of life for its people  and concerned about the integral development of the Caribbean region  Grenada repeats the call for the Caribbean to be declared a zone of peace  independence and development. This proposal was first accepted in 1979 at the La Paz meeting of the Organization of American States. At the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of Foreign Ministers of Caricom in March this year  Grenada reiterated that call. The Caribbean must not be a zone of militarism  tension and confrontation.139.	Grenada issues a strong call for negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom to resolve the issue of the Malvinas Islands. Only through genuine negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations can there be a satisfactory solution to the problem. The sad issue of the Malvinas provides one of these inadvertent lessons of history which developing countries would do well to note. In the final analysis our interests lie in recognizing our own unity in diversity  in recognizing the need of the countries of  Latin America and the Caribbean to create mechanisms for dealing with problems peculiar to us.140.  Grenada wishes to reiterate that one of the firm principles on which its foreign policy is based is anti-colonialism. Therefore we declare once more our unswerving support for the people of Puerto Rico in their just struggle to attain self-determination and independence. We have another call for the elimination of this cancer of colonialism from the Caribbean. We also express our very deep concern over events in Central America  where scores of people have lost their lives or have been forced to flee their homeland in search of peace. In the light of Israel's present deplorable role in the international arena  we further express our profound concern at the presence of Israeli military advisers in Central America.141.	We also wish to express our unshakeable solidarity with our Chilean brothers and sisters who are heroically resisting a brutal regime and many of whom have been driven from their homeland to languish in exile.142.	My Government wishes to express its total support for the struggling people of El Salvador. It is our conviction that justice and peace will ultimately triumph in that long-suffering country.143.	Once more we wish to declare our unstinting support for the independent Caribbean nations of Belize and Guyana in their determination to preserve full territorial integrity. We call on all parties concerned to resort to measures as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to the disputes; any other approach to solving these disputes will be counterproductive and catastrophic.144.	We reaffirm our full support for the just claim of Bolivia to regain its access to the sea. We recognize that that country's development is seriously impeded by a lack of such facilities.145.	I now turn to an issue of increasing urgency on the international scene  one that affects my country most intimately. It is the question of the special problems of small Island and small land-locked developing States. For three years  including twice before in this forum  Grenada  supported by others within that category  has called the attention of the international community  and in particular the richer and technologically advanced nations  to the peculiar circumstances and needs occasioned by the phenomenon of smallness. Addressing the Assembly at the 27th meeting of the thirty-fourth session  our Prime Minister  Maurice Bishop  called for smallness to be recognized as a new dimension in economic relations and urged a heightened awareness of the inherent handicaps.146.	Last year  at the 33rd meeting of the thirty-sixth session  we went further. My delegation  in an effort to sensitize the international community to these issues  enumerated the economic and social consequences of smallness in the present world economic system and elaborated in addition a minimum programme for ongoing assistance to those States.147.	Last year also  at the meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Australia and the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in Saint Lucia  my country continued its appeal to the international community for special consideration in the face of these characteristic developmental problems of this group of countries  namely  small States.148.	More recently  at the meetings in London and Toronto of Commonwealth Finance Ministers and the World Bank and IMF  respectively  Grenada and other members of this specially disadvantaged group raised again this pressing and critically important issue. We have taken the initiative and are strongly convinced  in the light of the current international economic situation to which I earlier referred  that there is a need for a special working conference in 1983  involving the United Nations and its development agencies and the major international financial institutions  like the World Bank  to examine the economic problems of this group of countries and to make practical recommendations for their solution. Out of that conference should come an international action programme with a specific time-table for implementation. For example  consider the matter of hurricanes and other natural disasters which frequently devastate the economies of small States in one blow. Often international relief  always so deeply appreciated  takes months to arrive-hence the need for a rapidly deployable rehabilitation scheme for such contingencies. Therefore  we appeal to all our brothers and sisters in small island and small land-locked developing States and also the international community for support on this vital matter  since any improvement in our economic situation must have a positive effect on the wider global community.149.	In conclusion  my delegation wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Even in the face of the crisis in international relations  we are steadfast in the belief that the United Nations system constitutes the ultimate guarantee for peace and international security. For our part we wish once again to express our willingness to engage in dialogue at any level whatever with a view to promoting regional peace and co-operation  thereby contributing to the construction of a more just and peaceful world."
"60",2893,"GTM",37,1982,"On behalf of the Guatemalan delegation  over which I have the honor to preside  I wish to express to you  Mr. Hollai  congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly. Such a high distinction is well deserved recognition of your human act professional qualities and your profound knowledge of the problems being discussed in the Organization. I am convinced that under your able leadership our tasks will attain the very best results. Mease rest assured that you may count on the whole hearted cooperation of the Guatemalan delegation. I also wish to express my delegation's recognition of the work accomplished under the direction of Mr. Kittani as President of the previous session. My delegation greets with special satisfaction the Secretary General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  that illustrious Latin American diplomat  who is indefatigable in his efforts in search of a more effective role for the United Nations in its endeavors to attain international peace  understanding and harmony. As regards the national policy of my country  I wish to declare that the present Government of the Republic of Guatemala  which assumed power on 23 March of this year to put an end to a practically untenable situation stemming from corruption and lack of respect for the will of the people as expressed at the polls  received the immediate assent and approval of the entire Guatemalan people and met with expressions of international acceptance and satisfaction. The goals of the Government of Guatemala are basically to bring peace to the country  which is now in such a serious state of upheaval  especially in some areas  as a result of actions by subversive groups which have sown terror among the population and caused incalculable personal and material damage to inhabitants  forcing them to abandon their places of origin  disintegrating families  causing suffering  desolation and death. My Government is trying to bring into active productivity and the benefits of progress through policies  projects and development programmes  a great mass of the native population which has lived a forsaken and marginal existence and thus to eliminate as much as possible the enormous social differences that now prevail. It is trying also to reduce the causes of dissatisfaction and frustration in various sectors of the population  to bring about respect for universally recognized human rights  and observance and full exercise thereof  to accelerate the process of integrated and harmonious development for the entire country  to reactivate the country's economy and to create everywhere the conditions necessary for the country  to move towards a political event in which citizens may freely choose their new authorities and thereby return to constitutional normalcy. On coming to power the new Government of Guatemala  which is presided over by General Jose Efrain Rios Montt  outlined 14 points containing its aspirations and the guidelines to be followed in order to achieve full wellbeing for the people of Guatemala. Those points are as follows: first  to make the people aware that the authorities are there to serve them and not the people to serve the authorities; second  to bring about the reconciliation of the entire Guatemalan family for the benefit of peace and national concord; third  to ensure the security and tranquility of the individual  through absolute respect for human rights; fourth  to restore individual and national dignity; fifth  to develop a nationalistic spirit and to create the foundation for the participation and integration of the various ethnic groups that make up our nation; sixth  to bring about the economic recovery of the nation in keeping with the free enterprise system  through the controls required by the present state of the nation; seventh  to restructure the judicial power  with the participation of the Bar Association  in order to adapt it to present circumstances and ensure that it Motions in accordance with ethical  moral and juridical norms; eighth  to eradicate administrative corruption and promote among civil servants a genuine spirit of public service  which constitutes the foundation of a national Government; ninth  to encourage among the various pressure groups which represent national activity a new development oriented reformist and nationalistic spirit; tenth  to strengthen national integration  efficiently utilizing the cooperation of other States and international organizations  at the same time pointing out certain problems of the State in its foreign relations; eleventh  to improve the standard of living of the people in order to reduce existing differences; twelfth  to restructure the electoral system so that as a true democratic institution it represents the political participation of the people and so that their wishes are not frustrated; thirteenth  to reorganize the public administration so that government programmes are carried out in a dynamic way and to ensure its efficiency and control its regular functioning  thereby avoiding administrative anarchy; fourteenth  to restore a constitutional form of government for the country within a fixed period of time  so that Guatemalans will know and demand their rights and know their duties and obligations within free democratic institutions. To attain those objectives the Government of the Republic of Guatemala has since coming to power taken steps to cleanse the public administration  reduce public expenditure through a policy of austerity  promote investments  increase exports of traditional and nontraditional products and to provide immediate help to the villages affected by subversive violence. At the political level  a Council of State has been created  with members representing all the sectors of the country and constituting an advisory body of the Government of the Republic and a balancing factor within it. It should be emphasized that this is a body which  for the first time in the history of the country  comprises the various ethnic elements which make up the nation  so that they now have a forum in which to put forward their problems  needs and desires and the aspirations of their respective communities. In the future they will participate with all the other sectors of the nation in the decision making process  so that we are better able to define the destiny of the Republic. The President of the Republic  in his address at the inauguration of the Council of State  said: The political concept which at present we define as Guatemalan reformism or reform will be valid only when the various objectives materialize and become legal fact. These objectives  reached over the short  intermediate or long term  will be the framework upon which the roof of our nationality will rest. Among other general objectives  since the detailed objectives will be established by mutual agreement and depending upon the encouragement provide I by the participation of those sectors concerned in the development of our nation  we point out the following. First  the Council of State shall legislate on the privileges and exemptions of Guatemalans  enhancing and reinforcing in this legal body all that pertains to human rights. These rights must be examined  publicized  taught and practiced and their principles should serve as the basis for all types of legislation. The present Government is committed to the inclusion in the fundamental laws of Guatemala of everything that pertains to human rights. Secondly  the Council of State shall propose the legal procedures through which political development may be guaranteed with the utmost security and respect for social stability. To this end  basic agreements must be reached to ensure the democratization of the country  thus establishing its own system  efficient and reliable  just and flexible  capable of meeting the problems inherent in our national identity  and a strong State which will be representative  consolidated and dynamic. Thirdly  the Council of State shall  furthermore  draft a provisory law for the purpose of electing a Constituent Assembly which will broaden political life by the authentic representation of all Guatemalans  promoting participation by the people and consolidation of the State by encouraging the expression of public opinion and organizing large numbers of people and social groups in order to establish a more united society which will emphasize our common interests and ensure the enjoyment of harmony with freedom among its pluralistic constituents. In view of the frustrations suffered by the Guatemalans  the repeated and successive contradictions inherited from previous Governments  the lack of an overall strategy on the part of the political authorities to deal with subversion; the lack of solutions to our basic problems; the total lack of any ethical or moral example set by those leading or claiming to lead the nation; and in view of the obvious irresponsibility in the management of the national economy and the widespread corruption  the Guatemalan army commits itself to lead the country  the President asked me to state before the Guatemalan people  with firmness and a vocation to serve  towards a democratization process which will create the conditions and legal machinery required for the establishment of a Government that will represent legitimacy and put an end to corruption. The Guatemalan army firmly rejected the disruptive activities of individuals or institutions  as well as the corrupting effects of any demagogy on the part of those who that upon themselves rights which are only the result of their own frustration  irresponsibility or ignorance. Corruption in former regimes led Guatemala to a process of decay  not only politically but also socially  spiritually and morally  and to the loss of the ethical values that are essential to people's lives. For this reason  the Government of the Republic has encouraged a dialogue between the people and the authorities; and it is hoped that by example  new attitudes and the implementation of a new philosophy of Government  these intrinsic values of our people will be gradually restored  so that together with material development can also be a change in the ethical and spiritual standards  which will unquestionably enable Guatemala to see its future more clearly  recover its identity as a nation  and shape its own destiny. Our national problems are difficult  we shall need sacrifice  effort  work and good will on the part of all Guatemalans to see our country through. It is to these noble tasks that we are presently devoted  tasks that will undoubtedly also require international understanding and cooperation. The stage which Guatemala is presently going through is critical because the structures  resources  values and principles that held good are now being judged and analyzed so that we can apply them in future and gain a clear and revised image of our situation. We are in fact a country where there is a great deal to be done. And so it must be when a people decides to face the responsibility of building its own history. From experience we have learned that if we do not take the making of our own history into our own hands  others will do it for us in their own way  which implies an ominous fate for a people which respects itself: intervention. The historic commitment of the present Government of Guatemala is to consolidate the peace and security of the nation; to solve the serious economic crisis which is affecting Guatemala  as indeed it is affecting the entire world  because of an economic recession which in Central America has become aggravated by internal causes; to restructure and incorporate large sectors that are representative of the country and which have been unjustly left out in the past and have not participated in the democratic decision making of the nation  but which under a new and safe electoral system will for the first time freely exercise their right of universal suffrage  thus ensuring the self determination of the people of Guatemala and ruling out the electoral fraud which in the past has been the means of diverting our democracy from its true course; to return to a state of law and to install a democratic Government representative of all the people  a process whose gradual development will be completed by the beginning of 1985. We are convinced that all sectors of the country will patriotically cooperate in this enterprise to implement a true democracy involving the representation and participation of the people of Guatemala. That is our commitment  and those are the firm steps we shall take towards the future of Guatemala in the search for a better national and international destiny. From this rapid glance at the transformation which has taken place in my country  it can be inferred that its international policy will also be different from now on. Without underestimating the sacred concepts of the sovereignty and independence of nations  the Government I represent is aware of the interdependence of nations in the economic  political and cultural fields and it recognizes the need that our problems a id our differences be resolved in the concert of nations  in open discussion  in the best way  on the basis of respect and trust. In addition to the circumstances just described  we have also had to deal with a national disaster in the southern part of the country  brought about by an atmospheric depression  causing loss of human life  crops and property. All this has brought a shadow of mourning over Guatemala. I wish to take this opportunity publicly to express  on behalf of the Government of Guatemala  our appreciation for the prompt and effective help we have received from friendly Governments and international organizations. As regards the foreign policy of my country  the Government of Guatemala has since the day it assumed power on 23 March this year  seen the necessity of revitalizing our democratic institutions and restoring the fundamental values of the people and the dignity of the nation  and it has declared its intention of abiding by and complying with the international commitments acquired by Guatemala and maintaining full respect for the legal rules governing relations between States  as well as cooperating closely with the organizations that concern themselves at the international level with human rights and guard and protect their exercise. The Government of Guatemala intends to strengthen its bonds of friendly relations and cooperation with all countries with which such relations already exist and to extend them to all countries which love peace and democracy and which desire such relations  in order to achieve the principles of progress within the international community. Guatemala also wishes to confirm its trust in international organizations and its decision to comply with commitments undertaken in terms of the principles and the Charter of the United Nations and those of the charter of the Organization of American States and to reaffirm my Government's support for the United Nations as the principal instrument for maintaining peace and strengthening international security. As regards our Central American policy  Guatemala pursues a policy of fraternity with the countries of the region  as we have the same origin  we acceded to independent life at the same time  we make up a geographic unit  we share the same history  we speak the same language  we have the same traditions and customs and we face similar problems. Maintaining utmost respect for the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other countries  Guatemala seeks a rapprochement with the sister nations of Central America. The terms of this rapprochement can best be summarized as respect for the highest values of humanity  namely peace  justice and freedom  and the building of economic  legal and political mechanisms for the development of the Isthmus  to promote cooperation among our nations  to strengthen the bonds among our peoples and to engage in a joint search for a more promising future for the area  which of late has seen 50 many upheavals. At the Latin American level  Guatemalan policy is aimed at reaffirming its faith in the inter  American system  the objectives of which are outlined.in the charter of the OAS; our international policy at the regional level is one of interrelation  solidarity and cooperation with the countries of the region. We believe that Latin America must play its proper role  within the world community  for it is a continent that has struggled for the principles of freedom  social justice and dignity and a region that has a geo political influence of undeniable importance within the world community. Guatemala has faith in the historic destiny of our America and believes that by strengthening relations in the hemisphere within the framework of the QAS  Latin America will be in a position to promote gradual  independent and sovereign development for its peoples and to secure for them the conditions necessary to derive maximum benefit from their natural resources and to utilize the advances of science and technology. As far as world policy is concerned  Guatemala supports those democracies which respect the dignity of the human being. In the economic field  Guatemala  as a developing nation  shares the just aspirations of the third  world countries and  as a member of the Group of 77  we share the concern of poor nations with regard to the obvious international injustice evident at many levels but fundamentally in the areas of international trade and economics. As regards human rights  the Fundamental Statute of Government  which constitutes the highest legal instrument regulating the actions of the Government of the Republic of Guatemala  provides that respect for human rights is one of the basic principles of its internal organization and of its international relations. The same Fundamental Statute of Government defines human rights and elaborates on them in its articles  covering basic human rights  civil and political human rights and social  economic and cultural human rights. The Government of the Republic respects those rights within the country and internationally it is cooperating with the organizations created to ensure their observance. In line with this policy  the Government of the Republic extended a cordial invitation to the whole Inter American Commission on Human Rights to visit Guatemala to ascertain that those rights were being observed  within the context of the national situation. This invitation was accepted with pleasure and the visit took place during the week of 20 to 26 September this year. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights publicly recognized that its members enjoyed full cooperation and broad freedom during their stay in Guatemala while carrying out an in depth investigation of human rights in my country. They met with officials from the Government  institutions  associations  representative groups and political parties  as well as with individuals and legal entities who wished to file complaints. They travelled to the interior of the country  visiting the villages of their choice  to interview the inhabitants and exchange impressions with them and to view on the spot their problems and their living conditions from a human rights standpoint. The report of the Inter American Commission on Human Rights  once the procedural requirements laid down in its rules and regulations have been met  will be made public by the Commission and may be read by the entire international community. At the end of their visit the members of the Commission made recommendations to the Government of Guatemala  which are at present under consideration for appropriate implementation. Within the jurisdiction of the United Nations  the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint a special rapporteur to investigate the human rights situation in Guatemala. The Government asked the Secretary General to propose the name of a candidate for that post. The person proposed has already been appointed and has been accepted by my Government  and he will be given full cooperation and freedom for the fulfilment of his mission. There have also been interviews and conversations with the Working Group to examine questions relevant to involuntary or enforced disappearances of persons  established by the Commission on Human Rights  and the information requested concerning cases under consideration by it has been submitted. It has been offered our full cooperation for the fulfilment of its mandate. This attitude by the Government of Guatemala reflects its sincere mention to improve the human rights situation in the country and to request the assistance of the relevant international organizations in order to make human rights in Guatemala more effective every day. I turn now to the problem of the Malvinas Islands. Following the decision of the Republic of Argentina to reincorporate the Malvinas Islands within its sovereignty  Guatemala confirmed its position in support of that sister nation's legitimate rights over those islands and endorsed its determination to claim sovereignty over them. My country  in public declarations and in statements both in the Security Council and at the twentieth consultative meeting of Foreign Ministers convened by the OAS in accordance with the Inter American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty  expressed its views in connection with the Malvinas Islands  reaffirming its solidarity with the Republic of Argentina and recognizing the latter's full rights to territorial integrity. In the Security Council itself Guatemala stated: It is inconceivable that the colonialist system  which is fortunately in its death throes throughout the world  including our continent  should have sprung to life  allowing a colonialist empire to impose its interests upon our America to the detriment of a Latin American country  whose right to sovereignty over the full extent of its territory has been internationally recognized. We believe that this matter should be dealt with through negotiations so that the vast majority of the States that make up this international community may maintain their faith and belief that international justice lives and prevails  even when what is at stake are the interests of great Powers which seek to impose their will by means of their military might. If this does not come about  Latin America will consider this action against Argentina as a serious threat to all of Latin America too and very disturbing for the rest of the world  which might suffer similar treatment if an attempt were made to subject them to similar circumstances. We have witnessed the anguish of a Latin American republic being attacked by an extra continental Power in violation of international law  and we have also been grieved at the fact that Argentina did not receive the response of solidarity which it should have in this case and provided for in treaties which up to now have been in full force and fully complied with. As the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Guatemala  I had the honor to sign together with the Foreign Ministers of other Latin American countries  a request for the inclusion of an item on the Malvinas Islands in the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly  to be discussed in plenary meeting. None the less  I now urge the countries involved in the controversy to resume as soon as possible the required negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations for the purpose of resolving that dispute. The peaceful settlement of disputes is and must continue to be  within the United Nations  perhaps the most powerful instrument for achieving peace and security. The General Assembly has not discussed the question of Korea in the pa x years. Guatemala feels that it should be for the Koreans themselves to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Korea and that the Organization can help to create a favorable climate in which to resume inter Korean talks rather than engage in an unproductive debate on the question. Nevertheless  in view of the tense and unstable situation prevailing at present in the Korean peninsula  my country is of the opinion that resumption of the dialogue between North and South Korea is urgent  so that  through direct negotiations and without outside pressure or interference  they may find a solution to their differences. To that end  it is essential that North Korea make the political decision to return to the conference table as soon as possible. Guatemala believes that  irrespective of the main objective that total reunification of the Korean peninsula be achieved  both South Korea and North Korea  as a means of relieving the existing tension and creating conditions favorable to the stability of the area  could be admitted as Members of the United Nations  pursuant to the principle of universality provided for in the Charter. In regard to disarmament  with which the United Nations has concerned itself since its creation my delegation would like to quote the statement by the President of Guatemala sent as a contribution by my country to the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second special session devoted to disarmament: Guatemala  whose people and Government are deeply committed to peace  deems it appropriate to express its ideas to this forum convened to discuss all aspects of disarmament. Guatemala considers that the arms reduction campaign is vital for the peace of the world  the development of States and the prosperity of peoples. It is necessary to express openly the dangers inherent in the continuation of the arms race and to dispel the hope that peace and security can coexist with the accumulation of vast quantities of means of destruction. General and complete prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is of paramount importance  since it helps to reduce the risk of nuclear war which would mean a holocaust for mankind. My country believes that both atomic and nuclear energy should be used only for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of the human race. Guatemala considers that a lasting peace can: be secured only through general and complete disarmament under effective and strict international control and not through a balance of armaments between the great Powers. Disarmament is one of the objectives proclaimed by the United Nations for over three decades  but despite the numerous initiatives adopted  by the Organization  the world is witnessing a frenzied arms race. Although the great Powers should be primarily responsible for disarmament  Guatemala believes that it would also be desirable to ban sophisticated weapons in Latin America as a way of contributing to universal disarmament and of increasing the resources allocated to economic and social development. The Treaty of Tlatelolco  to which Guatemala is a party  is a very useful instrument for preventing Latin America from being converted into a depository of nuclear arms or a test site for atomic weapons. I feel it is appropriate to underscore the great importance of the highly industrialized countries understanding that if  instead of devoting large sums of money to the production of weapons of mass destruction  they were to channel those resources to poor countries to help them in their efforts to achieve integral and harmonious development  the major scourges of hunger  unemployment  malnutrition  illiteracy and precarious living conditions which prevail in the third world would be considerably reduced. Peace and social justice  which are the greatest aspirations of mankind  can be achieved with the active participation of all nations with a view to establishing a new international order and creating for present and future generations a more human and balanced world based on  solid foundations of equality and dignity. Guatemala believes that all the problems of disarmament should not continue to be viewed in the traditional way  but that it is necessary to extend the field of knowledge as to the attitude of certain Powers and countries which unconditionally serve their hegemonistic interests by providing subversive movements with arms  munitions  military training  logistical support  money and international patronage. If a global analysis of matters related to disarmament is not carried out   various initiatives to reduce military expenditures and calls to Powers to halt their arms race deal with only one aspect of the problem but overlook the other aspect  which is the supplying of arms to subversive factions so that they may continue to use terrorism and armed struggle as means to win power  at the resulting cost of human lives and suffering and hardship for the civilian population  as well as the unavoidable use of resources to fight subversion  which could otherwise be used for works of public benefit and major social interest. Guatemala notes with satisfaction that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  after holding several sessions  has succeeded in producing the text of a Convention on the Law of the Sea. My country  like others  sincerely regrets that a text which has the subject of protracted negotiation has not been adopted by consensus because some States have reservations concerning some of the provisions of the instrument  basically those concerning the exploitation of sea resources beyond national jurisdiction. Guatemala urges those nations to show their goodwill by making concessions in their political attitudes  so that the Convention on the Law of the Sea may be strengthened through its implementation by all the States Members of the Organization. Guatemala voted in favor of the Convention and will sign it when it is open for signature by States. As regards Belize  Guatemala reiterates and maintains in this Assembly its reservations regarding the unilateral granting of independence to Belize by the United Kingdom  ignoring Guatemala's legitimate rights to that Territory  which was the subject of dispute under an international legal controversy  in accordance with the peaceful procedures of the Charter of the United Nations. That dispute remains unresolved because of that unilateral and illegal act by the United Kingdom which has created a permanent situation of insecurity in the area. We feel it indispensable to resolve this controversy through negotiations and by means of a peaceful solution that is equitable to all parties  including basically the rights of Guatemala  which are founded on solid historical  geographical  legal  political and moral arguments. 170. Guatemala  confronted by this unacceptable action  considers that the way in which independence was granted to Belize was in violation of international norms; therefore  it does not recognize that independence  it does not recognize Belize as a State  nor does it recognize its sovereignty or its borders  or its membership in the community of nations. That will continue as long as a fair  equitable solution preserving Guatemala's legitimate rights over the Territory and the interests of the population of Belize is not found. 17l. Guatemala has asked the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland not to disregard its historical responsibility in this matter and to continue direct negotiations so that a peaceful and at the same time equitable and honorable solution may be found for this age old controversy. The noble purposes of the United Nations will not truly be achieved the large majority of mankind ceases to suffer from poverty  hunger  ignorance  illiteracy  unemployment  malnutrition  precarious living conditions  lack of housing and many other hardships. If all human beings have a right to happiness  material progress and intellectual  moral and spiritual advancement  the main tasks of the United Nations must be to strengthen international cooperation and to create the conditions necessary to exercise those fundamental rights. My delegation believes it essential to initiate global negotiations on cooperation for development in the economic field  since everybody is aware that it has not been possible to reduce the gap between developed countries and developing nations. On the contrary  the economic and monetary crisis has of late merely worsened those adverse effects on the sensitive economies of developing nations. No effective solution has been found for the problems of commodities  international debts  balance of payments  protection of the purchasing power of developing countries  trade and transactions  transfer of technology  increase of actual available  resources  and access to capital markets. Although Guatemala believes that the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for resolving questions affecting the future of all the countries of the world  we admit that the Organization has not always acted with the promptness and effectiveness needed to solve the crises threatening world peace. This situation occurs because it is difficult to strike an accurate and practical balance between human rights  the interests of States and the principles and purposes of the Charter. We have thus noted that the Security Council and the General Assembly have not always made the same assessment of situations that threatened international peace and security. The Security Council itself has to some extent distorted its role by using procedures of informal consultations among its members  instead of concerning itself  as it ought to  with handling matters falling directly within its jurisdiction and finding adequate solutions for them. My country saw a good example of that when we submitted to that body our petition opposing the admission of Belize to the United Nations. The Security Council  in open violation of the principles of the Charter  refused to be seized of the matter. It did so without any reason  forgetting that there had been an open controversy to be resolved within the principles of the Charter. It is necessary to establish a solid basis of equity and justice for the development of international relations. My delegation believes that we must return to the sources that gave birth to this Organization. The light which then shone at San Francisco  when the Organization was created  should become a beacon for present and future generations; one which will light our way and enable us to build a better and more balanced world  one founded on the pillars of fraternity and solidarity  where peace  social justice  freedom and dignity to which all human beings without exception are entitled will prevail."
"61",2938,"GUY",37,1982,"My first and pleasant duty is to extend warm felicitations and congratulations to the President  a distinguished son of Hungary  upon his unanimous election. I and the other members of my delegation pledge our full cooperation with him in his efforts to make this session of the Assembly a successful one. May I at the same time pay a tribute to Mr. Kittani of Iraq who  with patience  tact and wisdom  guided the Assembly through the various and bewildering demands of the last year? We owe him a debt of gratitude. May I also reiterate my congratulations to the Secretary General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru  on his election to this most important office at this most critical period? I have personally had the pleasure and good fortune of working with him in earlier years when he gave dedicated and unstinting service to his country and to the Organization. The seriousness and forthrightness which characterize the approach of the Secretary General to the challenges facing the Organization and its Member States have won praise and well deserved recognition within the Organization as well as outside it. We wish him every success.The Secretary General aptly observed in his frank and perceptive report on the work of the Organization we are perilously near to a new international anarchy. Guyana shares that assessment. The world economic crisis deepens even as political relations are beset by tension and turbulence. Within recent years there has been an intensification of global crises  political and economic  and a manifest trend towards the exacerbation of existing situations and the creation of new ones  of so called local and regional conflicts  some of them with devastating effect. Turbulence is pervasive. No region  indeed no country  has escaped unscathed. More than ever before States need in their bilateral relations to be conscious of the impact of their national policies on others and to take the appropriate and necessary steps to avoid conflict preserve pluralism and promote security mid the economic and social development of peoples throughout the world.Underlying current global tensions is the heightening of the contestation between social systems. Nowhere is that more clearly reflected than in the increase in expenditure on  and the sophistication of  armaments and weapons systems  fuelling the movement towards conflict and global conflagration. The language of cooperation has been superseded by that of confrontation and the relations among the great Powers are now dangerously adversarial. Thus military and political rivalries have reached a new level  creating in their wake deep fissures in international relations and the frustration of the process of democratization of those relations.Our global political preoccupations are matched by economic preoccupations; equitable international economic relations are necessary prerequisites to political stability. The present international economic system is undoubtedly in disarray and its debilitating effect on all States  especially on the small and the weak  is manifest.The solution to that state of affairs demands collective  reasoned efforts But the global community has not responded in that manner often enough. Instead of a greater surge towards multilateralism in international economic relations  there is today a retreat from it  resulting in frustration and impasse. Meanwhile  efforts to fashion solutions upon partisan  bilateral criteria are being renewed. Indeed  the retreat from multilateralism that threatens economic relations among States has been finding expression in a reassertion of the dominance of single minded ideological approaches to economic development  in essence a return to economic determinism. In the retreat from multilateralism  in this return to economic determinism  we are faced today with a dual tragedy. There is a steadfast refusal to remodel existing international institutions in a way that would render them more responsive to the serious problems which imperil us all and  more particularly  the developing countries. Simultaneously  we witness a tendency to deny those multilateral institutions the resources required for their normal operations. In that regard the position of UNDP demands our special attention and we must urge a genuine commitment to meaningful resource allocation to allow that agency to continue its useful work in an effective manner.The disturbing trend towards a bilateral resolution of global economic woes is demonstrated in other ways. We cannot ignore the evidence of three years of continued stalemate in the effort to launch the global round of negotiations. There have been periodic signs during the process which indicated movement but  just as rapidly  there has been another impasse. The failure to agree on that launching has seriously weakened the much needed to undertake collective solutions. The consequence is a growing indication that the global manifestation of the economic woes can be set aside until the national endeavors at a solution have been pursued. Thus the absence of global negotiations to help to resolve global problems of a structural nature has resulted in almost a total dearth of measures to address the immediate issues which beset the global community. The individual  partisan adjustment measures are being forged with an increasing incidence of the attendant burdens  costs and pains of that adjustment being borne by the developing countries.183. The problems of depressed prices for commodities  the prevalence of inflation and high interest rates  the barriers to trade expansion and the chaos that characterizes the international financial system have been repeatedly assessed  examined and analyzed from this rostrum over the last few days. Those analyses notwithstanding  we in the developing countries are acutely aware of the limits to growth we now face as a result of those problems. Nowhere are those limits more manifest than in our efforts at debt management. The problems posed by cur spiraling debt burdens present us with tremendous difficulty. Efforts at adjustment to inflation in the developed world have had a very grave effect on its economies. All of these problems high rates of interest  mounting debt burdens and the very nature of the international financial system demand that we seek collective redress. It is our most compelling concern and one that necessitates urgent and immediate consideration. For our part  we in the developing world have been willing to seek ways and means to contribute collectively to the solution of the global problems  as evidenced in the Caracas Programme of Action on economic cooperation among developing countries. Our attempts to pool our individual strengths and resource bases and thus promote our collective self reliance are noteworthy and offer promise for the future. But  as has been noted on repeated occasions  economic cooperation among developing countries  South South cooperation  is but one part of the whole. It is not a substitute for genuine progress in North South relations. The quest for solutions based  on multilateral and collective methods should be pursued unceasingly.Guyana notes with satisfaction the successful conclusion of the negotiating sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the emergence of a final text which truly reflects the concerns of many who have labored long and hard establish an international legal regime for the ocean space. It is Guyana's hope that when we meet in Jamaica to sign the Final Act and Convention  the number signatories to the Convention will be a source of great satisfaction to those whose primary motivation over the past several years has been the promulgation of just and equitable arrangements for the most effective use of the sea and the utilization of its resources for the benefit of all mankind  without discrimination.It is  not unnaturally  a source of profound concern that some States should have seen fit to stand aside from this historic effort. It is also a matter for regret that a few developed States have moreover chosen instead to conclude between them a mini multilateral treaty in defiance of the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the world's States.If I now tum to international political relations  it is to say that these have deteriorated markedly over the past few years. The diagnoses of the malaise afflicting international relations are many and varied. They range from the crisis in the multilateral approach in international affairs to the proliferation of armaments with the concomitant incentive and urge to utilize them; the collapse of cooperative endeavors evolved in the aftermath of the Second World War so called; an increasing disregard for the fundamental norms and principles of international law; and a widespread tendency  too widespread to resort to lawless conduct based on confrontation  threats and violence and  unhappily  intervention.These negative manifestations have both encouraged and facilitated behavior antagonistic to full respect for the sovereignty and independence of States small States in particular.Interventionist behavior is undoubtedly on the increase. It is at once cause and effect of the crisis in international relations  a distinguishing feature of many conflicts. The extant cases are numerous in the Middle East  in Europe  in Africa and in Latin America.Nonintervention in the affairs of other States has served as one of the main pillars and guiding principles of a system of stable international relations. The proscribing of intervention is at the core of several international instruments adopted by this world body over the years. The most recent of these is the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States  adopted at the thirty sixth session. This Declaration represents a comprehensive instrument codifying the rights and duties of States that inhere in the principle of nonintervention.Yet  despite its existence as a well established and fundamental principle of international relations  nonintervention has increasingly been respected more in the breach. The whole gamut of interventionist techniques  ranging from overt military action to the more insidious and subtle forms of indirect pressures and destabilization tactics  has been brought into play in recent years.The motivation for intervention varies from case to case. Yet certain broad patterns are clearly discernible. Some manipulate local situations of controversy and exploit international conflicts to  serve perceived broader geo strategic interests. Further  intervention is of times designed to frustrate national liberation and the struggle against colonialism. No less problematic is interventionist behavior undertaken in pursuit of expansionist ambitions territorial  ideological and economic.Some of our countries possess enough human and material resources to ensure for their people an adequate and satisfying standard of living. Yet some of these very countries  in what can only be seen as a fit of greed  seek to covet the territory and resources of their neighbors. In pursuit of their expansionist claims  such countries disregard hallowed principles of an international legal edifice painstakingly constructed over the years.But even as we resolve to banish intervention as an instrument of policy in relations among States  it becomes imperative to strengthen and advance the process of collective security and disarmament. The second special session devoted to disarmament  held here last June  did not realize the high hopes of our peoples for a world free from the specter of the catastrophic uses of the destructive weapons at man's disposal. This happens at a time in which we witness the proliferation and perfection of a plethora of weapons systems possessing mass destructive capability.It is indeed a sad commentary on the position of some major Powers that in the face of a clear demonstration of the public throughout the world in favor of disarmament  these Powers have not exercised the necessary political judgment to facilitate agreement on the various disarmament issues and the preparation of a comprehensive programme on disarmament.The recent horrors which accompanied the ruthless Israeli invasion of Lebanon and senseless slaughter of innocent men  women and children in west Beirut heighten the necessity for a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Middle East situation and the Palestinian question. There has undeniably been a quickening of the conscience of peoples to the urgent need to terminate the Palestinian diaspora and to bring about the creation of a homeland for the Palestinians in Palestine  as envisaged by early resolutions of the Assembly.Let me repeat the position of Guyana: the acquisition of territory by force cannot be condoned; the Palestinian people  led by their authentic representative  the PLC  must have their national rights restored; and all States in the region should be enabled to live in peace and security.We must be equally firm in dealing with the racist entity in Pretoria. The independence of Namibia must be achieved in conformity with Security Council resolution 435 and there must be no question of further conditionality’s. South Africa must be made to vacate Namibia and to do so quickly. At the same time  South Africa must show full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring independent African States. Within South Africa itself  the system of apartheid must be condemned. The members of the international community individually and collectively must desist from giving the racists in South Africa support to maintain their oppressive policies.Unhappily  the tragedy of a divided Cyprus remains  despite the fact that the Assembly in its resolution 3212 set an adequate framework for the withdrawal of foreign troops and the reconciliation of the communities in the territory. Guyana gives every encouragement to the Secretary General to continue unceasingly in his search for an urgent solution. We also support the proposals made by the President of Cyprus before the Assembly.Likewise the people of Korea deserve our support for the peaceful reunification of their territory without outside interference. Guyana continues to urge the implementation of the provisions of the 4 July 1972 joint communique? And the more recent constructive proposals advanced by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.We are particularly concerned about the continuing war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We call for strict implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council relating to this matter  in particular resolutions 514 and 522.Central America and the Caribbean indeed  Latin America is a state of ferment. Threats of destabilization and armed intervention are mad in relation to Central America and the Caribbean. Indigenous impulses for change are being violently confronted by a tandem force of local interests and their external supporters. Deliberate policies of pressure and intimidation are implemented  policies aiming at ideological conformity. Guyana firmly believes that a system of peaceful and stable relations in the Latin American and Caribbean region must of necessity be premised or? an end to all types of economic pressures and political interference and on respect for ideological pluralism. The Caribbean must be made a zone of peace.In his statement to the Assembly at the 5th meeting  the Foreign Minister of Venezuela adverted at length to the relations between our two countries. Unfortunately that presentation contained egregious distortions; it was contumacious  and it bordered on calumny. It was tendentious and selective in its account of history.Last year  in addressing the Assembly my Prime Minister  Mr. Ptolemy A. Reid  laid bare the history of our relations with Venezuela. The nature of those relations has been profoundly affected by a Venezuelan desire to redraw the boundary between our two countries  a boundary which was settled by Treaty in 1899 and demarcated on the ground between 1901 and 1905.The Foreign Minister of Venezuela stated that Venezuela's claim is based neither on territorial ambition nor on covetousness of the wealth of others but on the need to correct an historical wrong perpetrated against it. And this Venezuela asserts as the successor to Spanish colonial imperialism. He also asserted that Guyana refuses to understand the need for this correction because it wishes to enjoy the fruits of British colonial imperialism.Guyana hardly needs to reject these pejorative Venezuelan asseverations. Moreover  our reputation as an anti imperialist nation is well known. The anti imperialist policies my country pursues are in accordance with the tenets of the nonaligned movement  of which it is a full member The Foreign Minister of Venezuela  in disavowing any motive of covetousness and expansionism  and in persisting in his country's territorial claim  asserts that no exploitable mineral resources have been discovered in the Essequibo region  which Venezuela claims. On the contrary  to give but a few examples  oil has recently been discovered there; our long established gold and diamond mines are developing as centers of economic activity; and there has been an intensification in the evaluation of our uranium potential. And Venezuela knows this.With these activities and the potential which exists  can we accept Venezuela's portrayal of the Essequibo as a land without exploitable mineral resources. And are we to understand that its claim to this land  whose people are moreover of a different culture  is motivated simply by a desire to redress an historical wrong. We are convinced that the Venezuelan territorial claim is an unjustified attempt to satiate a thirst for the land and resources of ethers.The Venezuelan Foreign Minister also asserted that there has been no aggression by Venezuela against Guyana. I cannot permit that statement to go unchallenged. Indeed it must be categorically rejected. Let the record speak.Can Venezuela deny that its troops are still in occupation of Guyanese territory that it violently seized in 1966? Can Venezuela honestly and I stress the word honestly deny that there have been numerous violations of our air and land space by Venezuelan aircraft and armed forces? And what of Venezuela's actions against us in the economic field. Can Venezuela deny that it has been endeavoring to dissuade Governments and organizations both in the developed and in the developing world from participating in Guyana's economic development  especially in that part of our territory that it claims'? Does Venezuela deny that in June last year  as we were preparing for a global conference on new and renewable sources of energy  its Foreign Minister wrote to the President of the World Bank opposing the construction of a hydroelectric facility in the Upper Mazuruni region of Guyana on the political ground that the proposed dam was to be located in the area claimed by Venezuela and that it was not economically important to Guyana? And can it deny that such action was after the World Bank had itself assessed the project as being economically and technically feasible? Is that not economic aggression?There are several international treaties and legal instruments that relate to the border between Guyana and Venezuela. The most important one is the Arbitral Award of 1899  which all parties  in ' eluding Venezuela  had by an earlier treaty agreed to accept as a full  final and perfect settlement. Pursuant to that Award  as I stated earlier  the boundary was demarcated on the ground and registered in a separate Agreement in 1903. There is also the Geneva Agreement of 1966  which has as its purpose the solution of the controversy which has arisen as a result of the Venezuelan contention that the Arbitral Award of 1899 is null and void.Under the Agreement Guyana and Venezuela were required to choose one of the means provided in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations for the settlement of the controversy. Venezuela proposed negotiation; we proposed judicial settlement  and recommended the International Court of Justice. Unfortunately  Venezuela not only challenged our competence to suggest the International Court of Justice but persistently refused to consider our proposal for a judicial settlement. As a consequence our two countries are now  in strict accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreement  required to consider the selection of an appropriate international organ to choose the means of settlement.From the inception of the Geneva Agreement in 1966 there have been repeated violations of it by Venezuela. I have already alluded to some of them. Notwithstanding those provocations  Guyana remains willing  in keeping with its policy of respect for legally binding treaties and peace and good neighborliness  to continue to honor the Geneva Agreement and to fulfil its obligations under it. On Friday last Guyana proposed to Venezuela that our two countries  in fulfilment of that Agreement  seek to agree on an appropriate international organ to choose a means of pacific settlement.There are a number of organs of a regional nature  some of which may not be acceptable to Venezuela and others which may not be acceptable to us. However  there are three organs of such a wide international character that in our opinion any of them should be acceptable to both parties. These organs are: the International Court of Justice the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.We are therefore now suggesting for the consideration of the Government of Venezuela recourse to one of those organs. It is Guyana's belief that their international character recommends them as suitable. We put our confidence in them. We trust that Venezuela would be prepared to do likewise.Let me repeat what my Prime Minister said at the thirty sixth session of the Assembly: We have no other wish than that of establishing a regime of peace  harmony and friendship with the people of Venezuela  with whom we share aspirations for a just and satisfying life and with whom we can together make a contribution to our development and that of our region and our continent.To that goal Guyana remains committed.In the complexities which beset the international community the nonaligned movement continues to play an influential and beneficial role. As we speak out against intervention and interference  the nonaligned are aware that external efforts to divide and subvert us will continue. But we must stick resolutely and uncompromisingly to our principles and our policies.Despite its imperfections  the United Nations system still offers mankind the best hope for international relations based on the rule of law. In his courageous report on the work of the Organization the Secretary General not only has analyzed the weaknesses of that system but has also made constructive proposals for the improvement of its vitality and the enhancement of its effectiveness. The decline in its authority and the credibility dilemma facing the United Nations are as much functions and consequences of certain deficiencies of the system as of the growing propensity of an increasing number of nations to marginalize the Organization or to ignore its decisions.We owe it to ourselves and to the Secretary General to ponder seriously his assessment of the international situation  his views on the crisis of confidence facing the United Nations and the various ideas he has submitted for reinvigorating the process of multilateral diplomacy. We believe that the opportunity to do so which this session provides should be fully utilized. Guyana supports his proposals. We are particularly interested in his argument for a role for the Security Council which emphasizes a preventive  rather than a reactive  orientation.As my President said in a statement on 5 October 1982 in Brasilia:I believe the time is ripe for us to examine once again the possibility of establishing a United Nations security force with sufficient authority and strength to forestall aggression and prevent disputes from degenerating into armed conflicts.Man's impulse is to survive and to live in peace with his fellow man. Our task as representatives of Governments is to give effect to this impulse. The pursuit of this task requires us to undertake serious dialogue  to act in concert  to adhere to the norms of international law and to make a reality of peaceful coexistence. History  I suggest  would indeed be unkind to us if we did not seek to build a world that is safer and in which justice prevails."
"62",2982,"HND",37,1982,"On behalf of the people and Government of Honduras I should like most sincerely to congratulate you  Sir  on your fitting election as President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. I would likewise express our gratitude to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who in the discharge of his duties  in a particularly difficult year  demonstrated great ability  firmness and diplomatic tact. As a Latin American I am also very happy to greet Mr. Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary General  who  with the valuable cooperation of a Secretariat dedicated to the lofty ideals of the Organization  has given dynamic direction and impetus to the many activities that have been entrusted to him.The creation of the United Nations inspired great hope among the peoples of the world. The Organization established the instruments of peace and cooperation that were needed to help a world that had been afflicted by war. Although the ideological rivalry of the super Powers soon paralyzed valuable initiatives and on many occasions brought us to the brink of war  it is nevertheless true that the United Nations  as a forum for open discussion  made it possible for mankind to survive. There have been many important achievements over the years  but we are now once again living in an era that requires Member States to make a conscious effort to strengthen the role of the United Nations and its main bodies in the quest for international peace and security.Today's world weighs heavily on our conscience. Endless conflicts persist without a proper solution  including recent conflicts  as well as internal and international tensions in various parts of the world  which make it difficult to view the future as sounder and more secure. Along with this disquieting situation  we have witnessed a tremendous growth of the power of destruction of conventional and other weapons in a frenzied arms race.The world situation appears even bleaker when we realize with great concern that the means of preventing or solving conflicts are inadequate  haphazard and slow and  what is even worse  are disregarded or ignored by some States or rendered ineffective because of the obstacles created by attempts to achieve power.4The fragile nature of the present international structure shows that  in the face of the threats to international peace and security  we must display good sense and fulfil our basic responsibility towards mankind by making every effort to foster and strengthen procedures for the prevention and solution of international conflicts. There is no doubt that this task must be undertaken on at least two levels: first  by the member States of the international community  and  secondly  by global and regional international organizations.In the first instance  individual States must display a political will for peace in order to solve their conflicts and must lend their support to ensure that neighboring or friendly countries involved in an international crisis situation achieve a peaceful solution; they must help in the implementation of resolutions adopted by various international bodies aimed at the settlement of conflicts between States and abide by the decisions of international organizations.In the second instance  we must make an effort to strengthen and improve the means of obtaining peaceful solutions already available to all States Members of the United Nations  while at same time trying to find new and imaginative formulas that will contribute to the prevention and settlement of conflicts.My country has at past sessions of the General Assembly emphasized that the future of mankind depends upon real possibilities for effective negotiation and consultation to deal with conflicting international interests. I must therefore at this time express the strongest support of the people and Government of Honduras for the courageous initiative of the Secretary General in his report on the work of the Organization  concerning the strengthening of the role of the Organization for the sake of peace. Honduras congratulates the Secretary General on his timely report  and calls upon all Member States to pledge themselves to the honorable mission of revitalizing the juridical  institutional and diplomatic means available to the Organization fully to implement the principles  goals and objectives laid down in the San Francisco Charter.To follow our words with deeds and translate our thoughts into action  Honduras has taken an audacious step to help bring about peace in Central America  particularly since the election of the new constitutional and democratic Government of Roberto Suazo Cordova. This pacifist tradition is deeply rooted in our history and in the conscience of our people. Honduras is the central country of our region  having borders with El Salvador  Guatemala and Nicaragua. The waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific bathe our shores.In the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth century  Honduras suffered the adverse consequences of its geographic position and its soil was used as a battleground in the disputes of opposing political factions in neighboring countries or conflicts between States. These political upheavals in Central America deeply affected the Honduran population and the ensuing internal wars caused grief and destruction. Fortunately  the experiences of our history to which I have referred helped us to overcome these problems and the Honduran nation emerged strengthened and we were enabled to substitute civilized  democratic  political dialogue for confrontation.The manner in which our economic structures developed helped us avoid the establishment of a dominant class possessing most of the national wealth. The main items we produce fell to the monopoly of foreign interests  particularly as regards export  and drained our country of capital. Consequently the economic disparities which exist in Honduras have not resulted in an unbridgeable gap between the different sectors of our society. We have no hegemonic oligarchies  no indigenous aristocracy. It is therefore not surprising that those who have achieved economic  professional or political success are often people of humble extraction  who have learned and succeeded through hard work.These harsh conditions are reflected in various actions taken recently. No one is unaware of the fact that the countries which have suffered most acutely from the impact of recession  are  like ours  countries of the American continent which lack energy resources. Nevertheless  Honduras has made an enormous internal effort to readjust its economy and to meet fully all its economic and financial commitments  which has enabled us to protect the stability of our currency and the image of a country which takes seriously its responsibilities vis a vis the international economic community.In the social field  we are proud of our free  strong and pluralistic trade union movement. Our farmers have been organized for more than two decades and the various farmers' associations and unions have more than 100 000 members. We also have numerous professional organizations of technical experts and craftsmen  and people involved in small   medium  and large scale industry  as well as associations of students  teachers  businessmen  farm workers  cattlemen  and others. Four political parties represent different trends of thought in our legislative system and people of all walks of life are members of our judicial system. For more than 30 years we have had labor laws to protect our workers and for 20 years we have had a process of agrarian reform and a system of social security. The freedom of the press is unlimited and fundamental human rights are fully protected.In saying this I do not imply that we have solved all our problems; far from it. I am merely saying that we live in a society governed by the law  that there is a plurality of interests which find expression in the framework of freedom  and there are more things uniting us than there are separating us. We live in a society which is open to peaceful change and dedicated to the improvement of its democratic institutions.The political  economic and social development of Honduras has created a reality which is unique in the Central American region. Despite many short  comings in social services in the field of health education  housing  nutrition and other areas  the Honduran nation has achieved high standards in certain fundamental areas which enable us to look with optimism.The Hondurans embrace the creed of peace through justice  and justice through freedom. Hence  those who are familiar with our people know that we reject violence in all its forms. More than any other Central American people  Hondurans practice dialogue in the settlement of their disputes. We support the electoral process for the establishment of a government  in the belief that there is support in our society for all political sectors involved in running the affairs of our community.These values of the Honduran nation were reaffirmed in the re establishment of democracy which began in 1980  when the people were called upon to elect a National Constituent Assembly  and 84 per cent of the electoral population of Honduras went to the polls. Not even countries with the oldest democratic tradition can boast such vigorous popular participation. There is no doubt that this overwhelming expression of the sovereignty of the people is an outstanding example for the future of our country and of Central America.One year later  in 1981  the Honduran people demonstrated even more vigorously their confidence in the free electoral process. Observers from almost all parts of the world witnessed a new  exemplary  civic event  namely the establishment of the political and legal system which now governs the destiny of our country.The Honduran people  on the basis of its sovereignty  calls for a return to a climate of political understanding  social peace and respect for human dignity  at a time when we are witnessing in our region the tragedy of violence and social upheavals.The situation in my country is in stark contrast with the abolition in other States of the region of individual and public freedoms and the denial of the peoples' right to self determination.For these reasons  the democratic process which began in Honduras so successfully undoubtedly represents renewed hopes for peace and freedom which are bound to exert a positive influence in our tormented Central America.Honduras  its people and its Government  are fully aware of the circumstances which threaten peace at home and abroad. They are equally aware of their role in the current situation in the region. The President of my country  Mr. Roberto Suazo Cordova  upon coming to power  stated that Honduras did not want to become the arbiter of the region and its anguish  its hopes and its expectations  for that is not its function. But Honduras ardently desires to help bring about stability and harmony  in keeping with its devotion to the principles of non intervention and self determination  and to help Central America to become a region of peaceful coexistence  whose people and leaders will establish and maintain understanding on the basis of effective dialogue. The President of Honduras wants Central America to be a zone of peace  not to see it tormented by bellicose disputes and polarizing confrontations. In that vein  the foreign policy of Honduras is based on the simple but preeminent principle of the internationalization of peace in that troubled region of our continent.Based on our desire to adopt concrete measures in Central America to relieve the tension and dispel the violence of irreparable consequences  Honduras has presented a peace initiative which has received broad national and international support. It consists of six points which  in the view of my Government  cover the main questions to be discussed. This  however  does not exclude the possibility of considering others aimed at the same goal of achieving peace in the region  which may come from other States equally interested in achieving the same goal. Honduras has proposed the following six points.First  we propose that the bases for general disarmament in the region be immediately established. This would imply not only a halt of the arms race which has created so much tension and instability in Central America and in continental relations  but a real reduction of military equipment and manpower to ensure that countries possessing armed forces maintain them at the level strictly necessary for the defense of their territorial integrity and sovereignty and the maintenance of public order  and that they abide by the universally established criteria recognized by every democratic society based on the rule of law. There should also be agreements on the types of weapons whose limitation on proscription would be determined in this general disarmament plan.Secondly  we propose that agreement likewise be reached on an objective and reasonable reduction in the number of foreign military and other advisers  or any other elements which are liable to cause concern or unrest  or undermine the identity of any nation.Thirdly  we propose that there be a survey of and agreement on the required machinery to ensure  by means of international supervision and monitoring  to which Honduras will submit  that countries of the Central American region fulfill their commitments and responsibilities. This system of supervision and monitoring would be applied to countries where there exist conflicts and difficult situations likely to affect peace in the region  especially in ports  airports  borders and strategic areas. My country is ready to open its territory without any reservations to any form of international supervision for the purpose of achieving and maintaining peace.Fourthly  we propose that there be consideration of and agreement on the most appropriate procedures and mechanisms to put an end to the traffic of arms in the region.Fifthly  we propose that recognized boundaries and the traditional lines of jurisdiction of the States of the region be fully respected so as not to endanger peace through new disputes which might arise with regard to land or sea.Sixthly  we propose that a set of guidelines be drawn up for a permanent multilateral dialogue on the basis of this initiative  thus to promote political understanding internally  to achieve a democratic and pluralistic system and assure respect for public freedoms and the right of the peoples to express their will freely.We affirm that the arms race constitutes an inherent threat to the future of nations and the survival of mankind itself. We therefore believe that the excessive expenditures in war equipment should be used to combat poverty and misery and to promote the well  being of the people  to lend technical and scientific assistance  to overcome conditions of backwardness facing developing countries and to help in the establishment of a new international economic order so as to reduce the tensions that aggravate the tragic problems of our times.This is the struggle that we are engaged in to achieve domestic as well as international peace; but I must state clearly and unequivocally that we have fallen victim to certain problems which stem from the internal problems of neighboring nations which are threatening our own security now. Honduras is being threatened by terrorism in which the direct participation of outside elements has been demonstrated  and which undermines fundamental human rights and attempts to undo the entire democratic process which we are building. The recent acts of terrorism have been denounced by our people who most energetically reject violence as a means of political action whose sole purpose is to destroy social peace and jeopardize human dignity.The Honduran people want to live in peace  work in peace  build in peace  bring about change in peace and know that the road of peace was built to be used for peace in this democracy in which we live today.The Government of Honduras expresses the hope that the international community  represented in the Organization  will devise and adopt multilateral legal instruments which will eradicate the underlying causes of terrorism and will fight and impose sanctions on this dreadful scourge  one which offends the conscience of civilized nations and of the peoples who strive to build a better future based on peaceful coexistence  understanding and solidarity.Honduras wants to devote all of its strength to the consolidation of political democracy and economic and social development. We want and need a climate of peace and security  stability and harmony  to strive to overcome the present economic crises in our country and at the same time achieve social justice by means of peaceful change. We would like to devote our limited material resources to combat poverty and promote the well being of our people rather than to compete in a ruinous arms race. We do not want an armed peace for Central America  nor a balance of power based on the possession of sophisticated weapons of destruction.Honduras extends its hand to the countries that are ready to associate themselves with this effort for peace with justice and freedom.Together with Costa Rica  Honduras has endeavored to find formulas to solve the conflicts in Central America peacefully and democratically. A meeting of foreign ministers of several Central American and Caribbean countries was held in San Jose on 4 October last  to consider ways and means truly and effectively to achieve these goals. A particularly significant issue was the establishment of a forum for peace and democracy with a mandate to carry out the peace initiatives based on agreements between States of the region.This meeting of democratic countries emphasized the need to help establish peace in the region  to promote and. consolidate a comprehensive system of institutions in the countries of the region and to create an appropriate scheme for intra regional and international cooperation in various fields on the basis of peace  security  democracy and development.Tins new vigorous effort is made in the context of the Honduran peace proposal  sincemultilateral dialogue on a permanent basis is the fundamental requirement for the achievement of appropriate and lasting solutions We would like to express the hope that the Government of Nicaragua will support this new initiative and the principles which have inspired it  for we believe that a Nicaragua which will establish and guide its revolutionary process along the path of democracy  pluralism and non alignment is essential for the political stability and the peace and security of the Central American region.The Secretary General asked me today  without prejudice to other ongoing initiatives  to meet at Headquarters with the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua. I have accepted this fraternal invitation of the Secretary General to demonstrate quite clearly once again  in this Hall where we gather in the pursuit of peace  justice and cooperation  the unswerving desire of the Government of Honduras to hold a dialogue for a global exchange of views on the problems which affect the Central American region.I have tried to explain in plain and simple terms what Honduras consists of and what its contribution is to the cause of peace in Central America. The international community will judge us on the basis of our actions. Before I refer to other matters in the general debate  I should simply like to repeat  with all the strength that my Government is capable of demonstrating  that we shall continue to conduct our affairs in accordance with the principles of nonintervention  respect for the right to self determination of peoples  the territorial integrity of every State and  especially  our respect for the us^ of peaceful means to solve disputes. I am simply emphasizing the words of the President of Honduras  Roberto Suazo Cordova  who  addressing himself recently to the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela  affirmed that The Honduran people will never resort to aggression or threats against any of our neighbors because we firmly believe that any dispute between States can be settled peacefully.My Government trusts that all Central American States will identify with this postulate and that  setting aside claims of supremacy and dangerous ideological confrontations which are alien to our spirit  our destiny and our history  a free and democratic Central America will see its efforts crowned with peace.There are many political  economic and social issues on the agenda of the General Assembly on which we should like to express our objective views which guide us. in our participation in the work of cooperation that motivates the United Nations. Our country will continue to make its enthusiastic contribution to the Group of 77  over which we have presided on two occasions in various forums. Honduras will also be present as an observer in the meetings of the non aligned movement  aware that  in political and economic matters  both groups agree on principles of justice in keeping with the growing aspirations of the developing world.The climate of mistrust and underlying hostility between the major political and military blocs of East and West this year have darkened the picture. The limited achievements of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is an eloquent statement on the real intentions which seem to guide the super Powers at this time.The principles of international law enshrined in the Charter have continued to be ignored in various situations  sacrificed to the most blatant form of power politics  and the Security Council has been paralyzed during grave conflicts because of a total lack of agreement on the objectives and the actions to which it could have legitimately committed itself.This atmosphere of tension and lack of effectiveness has further complicated the solution of problems which are within the competence of the Security Council  thus prolonging existing conflicts and failing to avoid the emergence of new crises and international confrontations.In the Middle East  conflicts have worsened. Hence  in the past few months we have witnessed the invasion of Lebanese territory by the armed forces of Israel  which  engaging in heavy fighting with Syrian and Palestinian military units  have occupied part of that territory and for several weeks encircled its capital  Beirut  causing destruction  desolation and death. This tragic situation was further aggravated by the massacre of refugees  which caused indignation in the international community and deeply moved the Honduran people. My Government  which is attached to the values of respect for the human person  most vigorously condemns this tragic holocaust.The Honduran Government firmly condemns the use of force in the settlement of international conflicts and rejects with equal vigor the corollary that the acquisition of territories by occupation can be justified.Similarly  our Government believes that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to have their own homeland should be achieved through serious comprehensive negotiations and the open and firm support of the international community.The right of Israel to exist and live in peace with its neighbors within secure and recognized boundaries  which Honduras has always supported  can and must be coupled with the rights of the Palestinian people to self determination and the establishment of their own State.In southern Africa  the hopes raised five years ago by the plan of Western Powers for Namibia  supplemented by the Security Council  have given way to profound disillusionment  creating a dangerous climate which could lead to new acts of aggression. In our view  there is no other way but to persist in achieving the holding of free elections in Namibia as soon as possible and  therefore  we lend our support to fresh negotiations to put an end to the illegal occupation of the Territory by South Africa.The world problems to which we referred earlier cannot conceal the important fact that conflicts emerge and develop basically in a regional context and that according to the letter and spirit of the Charter it is first and foremost for the members of each region and regional machinery they have established to solve conflicts with a full sense of responsibility.Because of its global character  the process of decolonization must be in conformity with the peculiarities of history and geography. Thus  in our American continent  a problem at once colonial and regional has been deeply felt recently by our peoples. We refer to the colonial situation of the Malvinas and the grave crisis and armed confrontation of last April and May between the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Honduras recognizes the sovereign rights of the Republic of Argentina over the Malvinas and supports its claim. Honduras believes that every conflict between States can be settled by negotiation; therefore  it rejects the use of force in any international conflict. Honduras is in favor of a speedy negotiated solution between the parties which would give sovereignty over the Malvinas to Argentina.Our people is united in the quest for material and spiritual advancement and the consolidation of Honduran nationhood through sound institutions based on justice  freedom and national harmony.We are also united with regard to external matters. It is not a mere whim to insist on peace; nor is it Utopia. Men of good will and generous thought know how to achieve it. Leaders who forget that the supreme mandate is to secure the well  being of those they govern through respect for their dignity and the practice of harmonious coexistence  will inescapably be drawn to the exercise of tyranny which is doomed to failure. The lessons of history are many and Honduras has learned from them. We have chosen to take the encouraging and promising road of democracy and peace."
"63",3051,"HTI",37,1982,"On behalf of the Government of Haiti and in my own name  Sir  I wish to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. I am sure that you will demonstrate those outstanding qualities that won you this distinction. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kittani  Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq  for the discreet and able manner in which he presided over the work of the thirty-sixth session. I should particularly like to join preceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General  whose election to head the Organization is unquestionably a source of deep satisfaction for all third-world countries. May I take this occasion to emphasize the high quality of his report on the work of the Organization  a report which lucidly depicts the shortcomings of the United Nations  as well as the overriding need to strengthen its decision-making machinery.This session has opened in a tense atmosphere dominated by a note of anguish in the statements  which have persistently reflected the international community's concerns about the general deterioration in the political and economic situation throughout the world.While the industrialized countries may perceive current economic problems more in terms of cyclical or less extreme fluctuations  the third world as a whole-particularly the least-favoured countries- still believe that the structural imbalance between North and South has become even greater and is now dangerously close to the point of collapse. Most third world country delegations  from whatever continent they may come  have spoken with one voice from this rostrum of the tragic expansion of areas of poverty in their respective regions. They have described the growing distress of impoverished populations desperately trying to eke out a meagre existence which becomes more precarious with every passing day. Hence we small nations have no illusions when we wonder about our future.For almost a decade now  negotiations on the establishment of a new economic order-one that would be more just  more harmonious  but also more efficient-have come up against a lack of true political will on the part of the rich countries to make the adjustments essential to any genuine effort at solidarity. Clearly  there is no real prospect for altering the current international order. The institutional  financial and technical measures required for sustained expansion of the world economy and for a swifter growth in the developing countries are still being awaited. Meanwhile  the terms of trade are deteriorating at a catastrophic pace  and third-world debt has now risen to $600 billion.At the same time  there is no growth in official development assistance  which has never reached that famous target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the rich countries  or less than 5 per cent of annual arms expenditures. Indeed the Brandt Commission' noted ironically that the machinery of death was that which involved the greatest and most dynamic transfer of technology. Even the new law of the sea  which is based mainly on the concept of balanced participation in the exploitation of common wealth  is challenged because of the regrettable selfishness of certain industrialized nations.It is also most distressing to note that no systematic campaign has been undertaken to explain to the people of the rich countries that effective solidarity with the poor countries is less a moral imperative than an irreplaceable factor for economic growth at the world level; for there is no better way of stimulating the production and distribution of goods and services than a determination to satisfy the basic needs of billions of individuals who have not yet enjoyed the material benefits of even the most elementary progress. There is no nobler task than that of contributing to the betterment of human beings who have been left on the sidelines of progress by hunger  ignorance and disease.It is time for the collective conscience of the industrialized countries to stop looking upon international co-operation as a burden on the rich  as alms given to those countries that are supposedly incapable of looking after their own future. It is time for the people in the rich countries to understand that the new international economic order will not jeopardize the prosperity of the countries of the North but will rather give a new impetus to the world economy and provide for more equitable distribution of the fruits of growth.A/37/PV.27The Republic of Haiti remains convinced that the market economy  which at the national level has in some countries been able to adapt to the requirements of more human socio-economic development  will al so at the international level find the necessary resources to establish a new kind of relationship that is more just and more beneficial. To that end more appropriate and generous action is required on the part of the public authorities of the industrialized countries. World phenomena have to be analyzed more objectively and to be less influenced by national experiences that are hard to imitate in different circumstances. To sum up  we need courage  imagination and a better sense of international solidarity. Some rich countries do not lack those qualities  and we should like to pay a tribute to them here.The problems of the developing countries  to which we have referred briefly  assume the dimensions of a real tragedy in the case of the least developed. In the last decade their per capita gross national product in real terms rose by only $11. Closer to us  the combined effects of world recession and inflation and the recent spiraling of interest rates  along with a collapse in the price of commodities  have tragically emphasized their economic vulnerability and paralyzed their ability  which was already rather pathetic  to import those goods that are essential to their development.Admittedly  the fifth session of UNCTAD  in Manila in 1979 and the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  in Paris in 1981 did decide to launch a new programmer and set forth a number of objectives that were ambitious and realistic  including the figure of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of donor countries for official development aid to the least developed countries. Unfortunately the commitments formally entered into on those occasions have not yet been fulfilled. Thus it seems difficult for us today to speak about a real desire to stabilize export earnings  to increase external assistance qualitatively and quantitatively.How  under these circumstances  can we hope  as we had hoped  to eliminate the category of least developed countries and ensure that by the end of the 1980s they will have joined the ranks of the developing countries? How can we not doubt the ability of the international system to provide elements for the solving of the problems of the third world  even if it was impossible to take adequate action for this small group of least advanced countries?The Republic of Haiti  which more than any other country has throughout its history as a sovereign nation experienced the cost of isolation and exploitation resulting from the selfish game played by the big Powers  solemnly repeats its appeal for a truly constructive North-South dialogue. President Jean-Claude Duvalier has said that:""The Republic of Haiti continues to believe in the future of global negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order which would enable the poor populations of the third world to attain a threshold of development compatible with the dignity of the human race and the right of every individual to a decent standard of living.""Yet above all the third world countries must understand that if they want to progress towards prosperity they must first of all rely on themselves and fully shoulder their collective autonomy. They must systematically explore the tremendous potential of co-operation among developing countries in the financial  technical  trade  industrial and cultural fields. The Republic of Haiti reiterates its absolute belief in active and intelligent harmonization among the nations of the South based on mutual respect and understanding to generate concrete actions that would be of mutual benefit in an intraregional and interregional context.Beyond the ideological positions that are inevitably stated in the general debate  every statement here reflects the collective aspiration to an international political order that would bring peace and progress. However  the state of the world today clearly shows if not the failure at least the profound inability of mankind to face successfully the many sociopolitical upheavals that are characteristic of our age. There are so many problems that have not been solved  and they create new divisions and increase the tension which here and there has led to permanent situations of crisis  overt or latent. Despite the belief constantly expressed by Member States in the values of the Charter  the machinery for peace and international security seems to be blocked  as can be seen from the world situation today.In the Middle East the situation remains explosive. Recent events in Lebanon and their hideous cruelty continue to horrify the conscience of the world and confirm  if there were any need for that  that action by the Organization is necessary to establish overall peace in the region. Contrasting with this background of absurd violence  some bilateral and multilateral initiatives have been taken. They are worthwhile and encouraging  and we trust that they can bring about a resumption of dialogue  which is so necessary for peace and essential in dealing with the fundamental issue of the future of the Palestinian people.The Government of Haiti remains firmly convinced that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide the basis for an overall settlement of the Middle East problem. The Haitian Government believes that the search for peace necessarily involves all of Israel's neighbors recognizing and respecting its right to exist within secure and recognized borders. Likewise we believe that there can be no question of challenging the right of the Palestinian people to real self-determination within a physical  legal and administrative framework that is in keeping with its legitimate aspirations.Latin America is also going through a turbulent period  and there is an atmosphere of uncertainty because of the consequences of the conflict relating to the Malvinas Islands and the difficult situation in Central America. The recent war in the South Atlantic and the bloodshed it involved highlighted the remnants of a way of life that has clearly passed. Indeed it placed a severe strain on the peace of the region and undermined the solidarity of the continent.The Republic of Haiti  faithful to its past and respectful of its traditions  has never hesitated to oppose all forms of colonial domination  and naturally expressed its solidarity with the just claims of the Republic of Argentina. The Government of Haiti  aware of how fragile are victories imposed by force  believes that the United Nations can play a decisive role in the search for a negotiated and peaceful solution which would make it possible to establish the definitive bases for a mutually acceptable agreement. That is why we joined in the initiative of Argentina and Mexico in calling for the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an item on the Malvinas Islands.Central America remains the theatre for many conflict situations resulting from ideological tensions  which have once again created hotbeds of crisis that could endanger regional peace and security. The Republic of Haiti  which has always refused to view regional problems simply in the context of the power balance between East and West  cannot but express its deep concern over the manifest symptoms of the alarming deterioration in relations between some fraternal countries in Central America. We call upon all States in the region to reject the sterile option of a dangerous arms race. We would go along with any proposal to strengthen regional stability and security on the basis of the great principles of international morality and law. In that way an atmosphere of peace could be established that would be favorable to economic development  which is indeed the real problem of the region.As regards Asia  the Government of Haiti is carefully following the courageous initiatives of the Republic of Korea for the reunification of the Korean nation. We regret the halt in negotiations between the two Governments and urge them to go beyond their differences of view in order to arrive at satisfactory results. That  of course  can be done only by the Koreans themselves. However  the United Nations could  with the agreement of the parties  take action to provide a propitious framework for the resumption of talks.The Haitian Government welcomes the initiative to regroup the Cambodian liberation forces within the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We lend our full support to the various United Nations initiatives for a settlement of the conflict  which must necessarily include the total and final withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from the territory of Kampuchea.Similarly  the Government of Haiti strongly condemns the continued occupation of Afghanistan by foreign troops and urges the establishment of conditions which would effectively enable the Afghan people to choose their kind of political society freely  without any outside interference.The negotiations on Namibian independence  despite optimistic statements of members of the contact group  have made no progress and are simply marking time. Some people insist on making the Namibian question one aspect of East-West confrontation  but that is completely unjustified. Meanwhile  the South African regime  encouraged by the differences of view that have developed within the contact group  is increasing its diversionary tactics in an attempt to delay the inevitable outcome.The Haitian Government believes that any swift solution of the Namibian problem necessarily involves the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which reflects the international consensus on the need for immediate independence for Namibia under the leadership of the patriotic liberation forces of the South West Africa People's Organization. It is upsetting to see that South Africa  despite the measures taken against it by the United Nations  still continues openly to defy the international community by pursuing its apartheid policy.Thirty years have passed since the General Assembly began its consideration of the item on racial conflict in South Africa. Just before the end of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination it seems to us indispensable that the United Nations should proceed at this session to a serious evaluation of the efforts made to date and  if necessary  define a new strategy for the complete elimination of the system of apartheid.Such action would seem to us particularly timely because this year  proclaimed by the General Assembly as the International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa  is also the seventieth anniversary of the African National Congress  for which the Haitian Government would once again express full support in its difficult struggle against the usurpation of political and economic power by a racist minority.The Haitian Government once again condemns the South African regime's continuing strengthening of its arsenal of repressive laws. It also condemns the South African policy of bantustanization and those who go along with it  because it is a systematic undertaking to dehumanize the black people of South Africa. The Haitian people and Government  expressing their solidarity with the black majorities in South Africa and the people of Namibia in their legitimate aspirations and struggles  once again urgently appeals to the international community to ensure that the sanctions adopted to make the South African regime less intransigent are fully implemented.I have given a short account of the feelings  wishes and positions of the Haitian Government on some of the major issues in the international arena. I would emphasize above all our unwavering conviction that the current system of international relations must be replaced by a new order of justice  collective economic security and true co-operation  with respect for the self-determination and dignity of each people. Clearly  it would be an illusion to believe that our wishes could be fulfilled in a single morning. That would mean simply disregarding human nature and forgetting that history does not follow a straight path and time is needed to bring it back to its true course. However  all progress made  every step taken  is a victory for peace and justice over a world of hatred and violence. We must therefore work courageously  patiently and with dedication to respond to the aspirations of the anguished peoples who are listening to us.The Republic of Haiti  which has always been inspired by the code of honor and solidarity  will lend you  Mr. President  and all the bodies of the United Nations  full and whole-hearted co-operation in order to give life  however partial  to the hopes placed in our work."
"64",3097,"HUN",37,1982,"On behalf of the Hungarian delegation  Sir  I offer you heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are pleased at your election to that high post  for it is an expression of international recognition both of socialist Hungary's peace-loving foreign policy and of its activities in the United Nations. It is our sincere hope that under your guidance the General Assembly will carry out the tasks of this session successfully and in a constructive atmosphere.2.	The thirty-seventh session of the General As¬sembly is taking place in an international situation full of controversy and fraught with dangers. Since last year  subversive activities threatening peace and security have been stepped up; tension connected with certain specific events continues to grow.3.	The main reason for the deterioration in the international situation is that extremist imperialist circles are striving to upset the balance if power which has emerged between the two world systems. They are striving to attain military supremacy  and to that end have started to arm themselves on an unprecedented scale. They are seeking to establish international conditions in which they can impose their will on other States. I could give many examples of the way in which existing crises have worsened and in which new crises have emerged  aiding and abetting the reactionary forces.4.	The extremist imperialist circles are systematically seeking to impair relations between the socialist and the developed capitalist countries  and to destroy the results which have been achieved in the development of East-West co-operation on the basis of mutual interests. In order to attain their goals  they are exerting growing pressure on the developing countries and on the liberation movements. They have been launching campaigns of slander and propaganda against the socialist and other progressive countries and have been ceaselessly attempting to interfere in their internal affairs on various pretexts.795.	We are convinced that it is in the interest of the peoples of the world to put an end to these processes. It is promising to note that more and more countries and larger and larger masses of the people are op¬posing the unbridled arms race  the policy of force  sabre-rattling and measures aimed at creating tension.6.	My Government decisively condemns the attacks launched against detente and the attempts that are being made in poison the international atmosphere and to step up the arms race. We consider that our most important foreign policy task in the present situa¬tion is to make the greatest contribution we can to the safeguarding of peace throughout the world  to the improvement of the international atmosphere  to the strengthening of international security  to the promo¬tion of the cause of disarmament and to the strength¬ening of friendship and multilateral co-operation among States and peoples. We constantly advocate this in international forums and in bilateral relations. We consider that every opportunity should be seized to expand international co-operation and that increased efforts should be undertaken to find constructive solutions to the problems that stand in the way. Thus  we attach particular importance to the maintenance of the bilateral relations which have evolved during the past decade on the basis of the principle of the peace¬ful coexistence of countries with different social systems. Moreover  we deem it necessary to intensify political contacts and dialogue and to broaden eco¬nomic and other relations which serve our mutual interests.7.	In order to achieve these goals  we must continue to strengthen the role of the United Nations so that it can be more effective in bolstering the cause of peace 8.	The Hungarian People's Republic is a staunch champion of disarmament and of the limitation and reduction of armed forces and armaments. My Govern¬ment takes active part in various international disarmament forums and also seeks in its bilateral relations to promote the cause of disarmament. We are convinced that none of the pressing problems of peace can be solved by armaments. Stockpiling weapons will not result in more stable  guaranteed security or peace  even for the countries which possess those weapons.9.	Today's balance of military power in the world is characterized by parity between the Soviet Union and the United States  and between the Warsaw Treaty countries and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NAO]. There is now approxi¬mate parity in both nuclear and conventional weapons. That parity is an historic victory for the countries and peoples which are fighting for socialism  progress and peace; they therefore advocate maintaining it  and strive to ensure that it is maintained at the lowest possible level.10.	Hence the socialist countries  together with other peace-loving countries  in the United Nations and in all other international forums  are making constant efforts to curb the arms race which has reached senseless proportions and to achieve tangible  sub¬stantive results in the field of disarmament. That goal is served by a number of proposals and draft treaties submitted at this session of the General Assembly which prescribe specific commitments.11.	Naturally  given the state of armaments today  peoples of the world and peace-loving Governments are concentrating first and foremost on eliminating the danger of nuclear war. My Government also gives priority importance to nuclear disarmament. We are anxious to see the urgent adoption of measures and the conclusion of international agreements that would reduce the arms race and at the same time be specific steps towards nuclear disarmament.12.	We consider the general and unilateral commit¬ment of the Soviet Union as being a significant con-tribution to the cause of peace and disarmament  and welcome it  namely  that in no circumstances would it be the first to use nuclear weapons. If all nuclear Powers were to make that commitment  in practice that would mean that the use of the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction would be impossible. Trust amongst States would be signifi¬cantly increased and we could hope for the success of disarmament talks with justifiable optimism.13.	We regret that the nuclear Powers which have not yet taken this step are adhering to their plans for manufacturing new types of nuclear weapons  and some of them are still continuing to disseminate the absurd doctrine of a limited nuclear war.14.	From the point of view of strengthening universal peace and security  relations between the Soviet Union and the United States are of decisive importance; hence their talks to limit and reduce strategic nuclear weapons  as well as medium-range nuclear missiles  are particularly important. It is urgent that practical agreements be reached as soon as possible in those talks  oh the basis of the principle of equality and equal security.13. In the struggle against armaments an important role would be played by a ban on nuclear-weapon testing in all spheres. Along with many other coun¬tries  we were amazed at the recent decision of the United States Administration not to resume the trilateral talks on a general and complete ban on nuclear-weapon testing. We follow with anxiety the fact that there is an increase in the number of indi¬vidual countries which intend to become nuclear- weapon States. We consider that one of the most pressing tasks which demand tremendous responsi¬bility is the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. That is why the United Nations should also strive to bring that about.16. The goal of fostering nuclear disarmament requires that in addition to efforts towards resolving the baste problems  it is necessary to use all other opportunities which directly or at least indirectly could promote a reduction of the nuclear threat. In this respect we believe that further efforts should be made to reduce the deployment of nuclear weapons  to create nuclear-free zones and zones of peace  to guarantee the security of countries which do not possess nuclear weapons and to prevent the accidental use of nuclear weapons.17.	The Government and people of the Hungarian People's Republic express regret that because of the existing unfavorable international situation and the lack of political will among certain influential Powers  the second special session devoted to disarmament did not yield the expected results. However  one should not underestimate the significance of the fact that at that session the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations unanimously expressed their concern at the threat of war. They clearly stated that the elimination of the nuclear threat was the most urgent task of this period.18.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic constantly devotes great attention to European security and co-operation. Although our country is small  still  as far as we can  we too promote the practical implementation of the recommendations and spirit of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki. Our delegation to the Madrid session of the Conference  which is to resume its follow-up to questions of European security and co-operation next November  will work in the interest of guaran¬teeing a constructive spirit for the talks and the adop¬tion of a meaningful  balanced and purposeful final document.19.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is anxious that the Madrid session should conclude its work successfully. We consider it partic¬ularly important that that Conference should adopt a decision to convene a European conference on confidence-building  security and disarmament. The delegations rf all countries participating in the Madrid Conference should be guided by a will to achieve agreement. The responsibility of the participating coun¬tries is particularly great  since the shaping of the international political situation and prospects for disarmament depend to a large extent on how rela¬tions evolve among the participating countries and what sort of co-operation will be established among them.20.	The growth of international tension has been fostered also by the fact that in effect no progress has been made in eliminating pockets of tension that have either long existed or recently emerged. Furthermore  in some places the situation continues to worsen  and the prospects for settlement are becoming ever more remote. My Government believes it abso¬lutely urgent to adopt specific steps speedily to eliminate pockets of tension and local conflicts and to resolve controversial issues by peaceful means.21.	It may seem strange that in this context I should also mention Europe. In the past  we used to talk about Europe as a region of peace and tranquility. However  events that have occurred in recent years —the decision by NATO to station 572 medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe  the American refusal to ratify the SALT II agreement  the Western plan for a vastly accelerated arms build-up and the inadmissible Western interference in the events in Poland—have increased tension in our continent to a significant degree. We hope that the ongoing Soviet- American talks will ultimately yield results that will foster peaceful co-operation among the European countries.22.	The extremely tense situation in the Middle East that has evolved in recent months has created profound concern. That region has for many years been the source of one of the world's most tragic crises. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic and public opinion in our country most vehemently condemn the aggressive expansionist policies of Israel and its barbaric war against the Lebanese and Pal¬estinian Arab peoples which  together with the imperialist maneuvers designed to achieve a total domination over the Middle East  has created a serious threat to peace and security for the peoples in that region and for the entire world. We express our sympathy for the victims of the terrible tragedy that has occurred in Lebanon  and we continue to support the just struggle of the Arab peoples. Our people learned of the bloody massacre in Beirut with indigna¬tion and we vehemently condemn that evil deed. The United Nations should take decisive measures to restrain Israel  which has consistently disregarded Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and which regularly violates the elementary norms of international law.23.	The aggression against Lebanon is a new and premonitory proof of the fact that the policy of separate dealings and the blatant use of military force cannot lead to any real settlement of the Middle East crisis but  on the contrary  will lead to an exacerbation of the situation in that region. The Hungarian Govern¬ment will continue to advocate a comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East crisis and the establishment of lasting peace in the region. It firmly believes that in order to achieve this it is urgent that there be a complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arab territories that have been occupied since 1967  as well as from Lebanon; that there be a guarantee of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to create an independent Palestinian State; and that there be international guarantees for the security and inde¬pendent existence of all States in the region. It supports the idea of convening an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  in order to promote a comprehensive and just settlement. The six-point proposal of the Soviet Union that was put forward by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Presidiums of the Supreme Soviet  Leonid Brezhnev   meets all those requirements  and we therefore believe it to be acceptable for the resolution of the problem.24.	The development of the international situation has been adversely affected by the baleful influence of circles seeking to maintain and to worsen tension and which continue artificially to support the inclusion of the so-called Afghan and Kampuchean questions OH the agenda. With regard to Afghanistan  my Govern¬ment continues to maintain its firm position that the key question is a cessation of the interference by the forces of international reactionary forces in the internal affairs of that country. We support the pro¬posals of the Government of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union designed to bring about a political solu¬tion of the situation prevailing around Afghanistan. We have followed with interest the activities of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General. We hope that the States directly concerned will find a way to resolve the problem by talks  which must include recognition of the legitimate Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan as well as guarantees for the security of that country.25.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  as is well known  feels solidarity with the countries of Indo-China. It welcomes and supports the proposals of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the three Indo-Chinese countries dated July 1982  which show that those countries are seeking peace and dialogue on substantive matters  as well as friendship and co-operation with their neighbors. The attempts being made through the vestiges of the former regime  which formed the so-called coalition government  to undermine the legal order of the People's Republic of Kampuchea are doomed to failure. We are convinced that recognition of the existing political realities is the only right way to guarantee peace and stability in that region.26.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic supports the proposal of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic for the convening of an international conference of the Asian and Pacific countries to discuss questions relating to the conclusion of a convention on the non-use of force and mutual non- aggression. Among the factors hindering an improve¬ment in the international situation we should mention the problems created by the Korean question  which has remained unsettled for so long. My Government continues to support the just struggle of the Demo¬cratic People's Republic of Korea and the cause of a peaceful and democratic unification of the two parts of the country free from outside interference. My Government regards as of particular importance the restitution of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its Government's policy of non- alignment. It supports a peaceful solution to the ques¬tion of Cyprus through negotiations that would serve the interests of both communities in that State in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolu¬tions  and it supports efforts undertaken in that direction.27.	At this session of the General Assembly  many speakers will undoubtedly express their just concern about the fact that with a view to securing their interests imperialism and neo colonialism are in¬creasing their pressure on the developing countries and the non-aligned movement  and that they are trying to frustrate the success of the national liberation movement. In this forum  I should like to reaffirm the support of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic for the struggle of peoples for social progress  national independence aid self-determination and our opposition to colonial oppression and neb- colonialist aspirations. We are decisively opposed to racial discrimination and condemn the policy of apartheid?28.	We feel that the United Nations must adopt more decisive and effective measures than it has done so far to eliminate once and for all the vestiges of colonialism in order to guarantee the rights of all peoples to self-determination.29.	The South Atlantic armed conflict which took place in recent months with regard to the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands also has shown how many complex and far-reaching international problems can be created by the vestiges of the colonial system and what a serious threat they can constitute for peace. We consider that that problem too should be resolved through negotiation.30.	Notwithstanding the derisions of the United Nations and all efforts made thus far by the progressive forces in the world  the South African racist regime continues to occupy Namibia. The situation which has emerged in southern Africa poses a serious threat to international peace and security. That is why one of the most urgent tasks is to resolve the fate of Namibia  to guarantee the independence of that country. My Government supports the just struggle of the Namibian people which it has been waging  under the leader¬ship of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its sole legitimate representative  against the South African occupiers to win genuine indepen¬dence for the country. Hungary rejects the Western maneuvers  the aim of which is to maintain foreign domination  both political and economic  and to pre¬serve the influence of the South African racist Govern¬ment. We favor the implementation of the United Nations plan. The basis for a negotiated settlement can only be Security Council resolution 433 (1978)  which should be implemented without any change or distortion.31.	Nowadays we often receive news about pres¬sures and threats aimed against Cuba.  Nicaragua  Grenada and other Latin American countries  about the heroic struggle of the patriots of El Salvador and of actions against the dictatorial regimes in many coun¬tries of Latin America. We believe that in this region of the world  too  we should respect the right of peoples to self-determination.32.	We believe that the non-aligned movement is an important  positive factor in international life. We were concerned that recently imperialist machinations to shatter the movement have been stepped up. We believe that the non-aligned countries can maintain and strengthen the anti-imperialist unity of their movement in this situation too  and can remain true to their well-tested principles.33.	My country is very concerned about the un¬hampered development of mutually advantageous international economic  trade and financial relations. I must note with regret that the tension in the inter-national situation has long had an unfavorable influence onall fields of international economic  trade  financial and scientific and technological co¬operation. We decisively reject the policy of economic sanctions against the socialist countries  the policies of embargo  boycott and discrimination. Such policies have not been successful in the past  and at the present time no one will be able to move the socialist countries away from the path of building a new society and promoting progress. Such attempts can only lead to a worsening of the international atmosphere. All this not only has an unfavorable impact in relations between East and West  but does damage to the interests of the developing world and further delays the establishment of a new  just inter¬national economic order  based on democratic prin¬ciples.34.	My Government believes that the difficulties in international economic co-operation should be eliminated and that countries of the world  both large and small  should equally  without any discrimination  enjoy the mutual advantages which result from the international division of labour.35.	Despite the more tense international situation and the unfavorable political processes taking place in the world  we believe that the possibilities of peace¬ful development have not yet been exhausted. This view is imposed by common sense and by the interests of the peoples of the world. We are convinced that joint actions by all the political elements and serial forces desirous of maintaining peaceful international relations and co-operation among States can  in the final analysis  overcome the determination to seek confrontation To bring about that end my country is prepared to join with all countries who are conducting a sober  responsible policy. It is in that spirit that our delegation will act at this session of the General Assembly."
"65",3144,"IDN",37,1982,"I should like at the outset  on behalf of the Indonesian delegation and on my own behalf  to extend heartfelt con-gratulations to Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His vast experience and the competence that he has exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy give us the assurance that under hi guidance solid and substantive progress will be achieved during this crucial session.206.	With one regular session and no less than four special and emergency sessions  the past year has indeed been an exceedingly busy and demanding one for the outgoing President  Mr. 2smat Kittani. He has discharged his manifold responsibilities with great skill and patience and has contributed substantially to what has been achieved in difficult circumstances. We wish to register our deep appreciation of his leadership.207.	In the course of the past year the cause of international peace and security has  regrettably  suffered further serious setbacks. Compounding this trend  the world economy continues to deteriorate and global economic co-operation has been stalemated  while the United Nations itself has been repeatedly bypassed. Resort to force to settle disputes  despite the Charter provisions to the contrary  has continued unabated and has even increased. Detente  always fragile and too limited in scope and substance to begin with  is now a shambles and each local conflict now potentially poses a greater threat to world peace than ever before. In South-West Asia  South-East Asia  the Middle East  Africa  Central and South America and other regions people continue to suffer the consequences of violence and conflict. Yet  despite the devastation and hardship that are visited upon both the victor and the vanquished in war  States persist in their preparations for military confrontation.208.	Local and regional conflicts have become increasingly intractable owing to the marked tendency of the major Powers to view those conflicts from the perspective of their global rivalries and to link eventual solutions to their wider strategies of mutual containment. As a result  the risk of the lesser Powers and the countries of the third world being dragged into the East-West polarization have grown correspondingly.209.	It is manifest that in an increasingly insecure and perilous world the present international system has proved to be incapable of dealing effectively with the multitude of problems. Indeed  the international community has long recognized this reality by calling for the restructuring of the prevailing system and the establishment of a new international order. However  despite the new political realities in the world and the growing consensus on change  the present system is being perpetuated  to the detriment of the newly emergent States. It is only by recognizing the interests of the developing countries and their vast potential for contributing to a more peaceful and prosperous world of genuine independence that we can begin to address the global problems before us.210.	It is our deep conviction that as long as the great Powers seek to enhance their security in disregard of the interests of the smaller Powers  the question of universal collective security envisaged in the Charter will continue to elude us. One of the cardinal features of the new international system must be greater equality and a greater voice in decision-making on vital issues for all members of the international community.211.	The multiple crises afflicting our world today and the perception of a growing paralysis on the part of the United Nations in the attempts to find effective solutions to them have further deepened the crisis of authority in which the Organization has found itself for quite some time.212.	In this context  I should like to express my delegation's great appreciation of the frank and lucid report of the Secretary-General  which highlighted the alarming erosion of the Organization's influence over issues of world peace and progress. My Government shares his concern for whathe has rightly called the crisis of the multilateral approach in coping with the myriad of problems that confront us. It is only through a renewed commitment and dedication to the multilateral approach through the United Nations  through dialogue and negotiation  that we can reverse the dangerous drift towards global disorder  heightened polarization and the revive of blatant power politics.213.	It is imperative to restore the capacity of the United Nations to fulfill its mission as outlined by the Charter  and our first task must necessarily be to ensure a strengthened role for the Security Council in settling conflicts. One essential component for such a strengthened role  in our view  should be the establishment of workable machinery for the conciliation of disputes and the diffusion of crises before they become full-blown wars. But for this and other improvements in the operational procedures of the Security Council to become possible  there should first be a conscious readjustment in the nature and extent of the commitment by Member States  especially by the permanent members of the Security Council  to the wider global responsibilities inherent in our common acceptance of the Charter.214.	In his report  the Secretary-General has gone beyond analyzing the difficulties the Organization is facing and has suggested a number of pertinent ways in which Governments of Member States could assist  in particular  in developing a more viable system of collective security  in strengthening United Nations peace keeping operations and in enhancing the validity and utility of United Nations organs as negotiating forums. It is appropriate  therefore  that at this critical juncture in the life of the Organization we  the Member States  likewise move beyond the perfunctory expression of praise and support for the Secretary-General's initiative and make active conceptual and concrete contributions to the elaboration and the early realization of the required reforms. As far as Indonesia is concerned  it stands ready to extend its full co-operation towards this end.215.	It cannot be said that the past year has witnessed any impressive progress on the main issues confronting us. Indeed  the lack of progress is distinctly disappointing and is in strong contrast to the obvious urgency of these problems.216.	Among the central issues confronting the international community  particularly in my own region of South-East Asia  is the plight of Kampuchea.217.	The situation in Kampuchea has not changed substantially and remains a matter of serious concern to all of us. Indeed  no meaningful progress has been achieved in seeking a political solution of the problem. Foreign troops are still in Kampuchea  despite repeated calls by the international community for their total withdrawal. The United Nations supervised election to enable the people of Kampuchea to determine their own future has not taken place. The efforts by the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to seek a political solution have yet to yield meaningful results.218.	Despite the lack of progress  however  the national forces of Kampuchea have formed the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  which is a clear expression of the will and determination of the Kampuchean people to regain their sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. It is important to note that the Coalition Government has pledged to work for the implementation of all decisions of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea. It remains the sincere conviction of my Government that it would be in the interest of all the parties to seek a peaceful and negotiated political solution to the Kampuchean problem and that the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea provide the best forum to seek the achievement of such a political solution.219.	The Association of South-East Asian Nations  is committed to seek a just political solution to the conflict. Once the Kampuchean question isresolved  we are confident that suspicion and mistrust will be removed from the area  thus paving the way for the resumption of a meaningful dialogue and co-operative relations among the States in the region. We could then look forward with greater confidence to the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia  thereby fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of all peoples in the region for stability  progress and prosperity.220.	The crisis in Afghanistan has also affected the process of detente. Indeed  it has exacerbated tension and anxiety throughout the world and has hindered the resolution of a number of issues of world-wide concern. In line with United Nations efforts  the non- aligned movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have reiterated the urgent need to seek a comprehensive political solution to the problem on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan. The Secretary-General has also taken constructive steps in seeking a solution of this problem. We believe that any such solution should ensure that the Afghan people wilt be able to determine their own future  free from foreign intervention and interference.221.	Since June 1982  the world has witnessed with anger and dismay the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. We were shocked at the toll in human lives  especially all the Chilean population and the incalculable deduction it has wreaked on Lebanon. My Government has strongly condemned Israel's aggression against the Lebanese and the Palestinian peoples and demanded the restoration of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon. In his National Day speech on 17 August President Soeharto reiterated.'Our stand remains as clear and unambiguous as before: that is  we continue to be on the side of the Arab nation in its struggle against Israeli aggression and stand should 2r to shoulder with the Palestinian people in their legitimate quest for self- determination and to regain their homeland .'222.	The appalling massacre of the Palestinian civilians in west Beirut  which is a direct consequence of Israel's invasion  has evoked universal condemnation. The resumption of the seventh emergency special session last week and the adoption by consensus of resolution ES-7/9  in which the Assembly calls on the Security Council to investigate the circumstances and extent of the massacre  was a reflection of the world's horror over the massacre  for which Israel cannot evade responsibility.223.	It is clear that the aim of the Israeli invasion was to destroy the national identity and aspirations of the Palestinian people and their sole and legitimate representative  the PLO  as the standard bearer of Palestinian rights to sovereignty and statehood. Israel cannot take upon itself the function of a policeman in the Middle East  violating as it pleases the territorial sovereignty of its neighbors  destroying the people of Palestine and imposing its will on the Arab world. Israel's expansionism and arrogance must be stopped.224.	My delegation believes that the only hope for peace is for Israel to accept Palestinian independence and sovereignty as called for and supported by nearly all mankind. The question of Palestine remains at the heart of the conflict in the Middle East  and without a solution to this problem no comprehensive settlement can ensure peace in the region. The realization of a just and lasting peace requires the unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem.225.	We commend the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held Fez this month  which has demonstrated the unified approach of the Arab States to the problem of the Middle East. The meeting enumerated /4/J7/6P6] serious and reasonable proposals to achieve a solution of the Palestinian question. On the other hand  as a power which could restrain Israel's aggression  intransigence and expansionism  we believe that the United States should continue to insist on Israel behaving in a more responsible and peace-loving manner  befitting a Member of the United Nations. It is our sincere hope that the proposals of the Fez Summit will receive a positive response from all the parties concerned so that the long-standing conflict in this region will soon be resolved  thereby inaugurating a new era of peace for the region as a whole.226.	The second special session on disarmament which was convened  with great expectations  to follow up the decisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the general Assembly  adopted in 1978  has become a casualty of the present climate of distrust and tension and has degenerated into a series of platitudes  devoid of substantive commitments. The inability to adopt a comprehensive program of disarmament at the session  regarded by many States  including my own  as crucial to our efforts for an integrated approach  was a great disappointment. It was  moreover  regrettable that some of the leading Powers disregarded their commitments undertaken in the 197% Final Document and were unwilling to use the United Nations as an instrument for genuine disarmament effort. These developments have prevented meaningful progress in stemming the tide of the arms race.227.	Despite that failure  however  the session has served as a focal point for widespread expression of public concern about the arms race  and in particular about the danger of nuclear weapons. The proposals for a ban on the use of nuclear weapons  and for a freeze on their development and production  and the renewed call for a comprehensive ban on nuclear- weapon tests  fully reflected world opinion. It is our hope that the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union will be pursued with a sense of urgency and lead to meaningful limitations and significant reductions in nuclear weapons. The nuclear Powers should  moreover  recognize that it :s no less important to pursue multilateral negotiations  by enabling the Committee on Disarmament to discharge its responsibilities and renew efforts to negotiate on the priority issues.228.	There is a growing apprehension that the region of the Indian Ocean is rapidly become the focus of a new cold-war rivalry between the super-Powers. As a littoral State  Indonesia is convinced that the convening of the International! Conference on the Indian Ocean is ar\ essential step towards the establishment of a zone of peace. We are fully aware of the ramifications of the conflicts and tension that engulf the region. It is precisely for this reason that the Conference  as stipulated in relevant General Assembly resolutions  should be the forum to discuss all relevant issues  with a view to opening the constructive dialogue that heretofore has eluded us. It is a truism that the convening of one conference might not suffice to resolve all the problems pertaining to the Indian Ocean. However  the Conference should be a first step towards improving the political and security climate in the region.229.	In recent months the international community has witnessed renewed large-scale military operations by South Africa against SWAPO in a desperate attempt to eliminate the sole authentic and internationally recognized representative of the Namibian people. It should be noted that there is nothing new in these South African tactics. The racists in Pretoria have on numerous occasions used their military forces to thwart any progress in the negotiations to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).230.	South Africa has clearly demonstrated that it is prepared to use every maneuver  and to exploit every opportunity to employ force  to undercut all efforts towards a negotiated settlement leading to the establishment of an independent Namibia.231.	The most expeditious means to bring about Namibian independence is contained in the Arusha Declaration and Programme of Action on Namibia adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia in May this year. It urged the Western contact group to accept SWAPO's constructive proposal for the early implementation of the United Nations plan and to exert firm and genuine pressure on South Africa. In this regard  my delegation will firmly oppose any effort by South Africa to impose any fraudulent electoral  constitutional or political schemes  and any pretext to link the solution of the Namibian problem to any other issue that would be in contravention of resolution 433 (1978)  all of which are designed to perpetuate South Africa's domination of the Territory. Furthermore  at the Arusha meeting my delegation endorsed the call for a Geneva-type conference at which all outstanding issues should be discussed and resolved together in a comprehensive manner. The early scheduling of such a conference may help intensify current efforts to overcome South Africa's intransigence. Despite the many obstacles that continue to block the way to securing Namibia's independence  the negotiating process has shown some signs of progress  as noted in the Secretary-General's report. Every effort should be made  however  to compel South Africa to negotiate in good faith and within the guidelines established by resolution 435 (1978).232.	It is disturbing to all of us that  despite the condemnation of the system of apartheid by almost all Member States  South Africa continues to ignore the repeated appeals of the international community to end the practice of233.	Guided by the important decisions adopted at the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  held in Paris in 1981  my delegation is convinced that the international community should intensify its solidarity with the people of South Africa by maintaining and strengthening the agreed set of sanctions designed to isolate South Africa in all spheres of international relations.234.	On 30 April 1982 the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adopted a comprehensive Convention on the Law of the Sea.^ This was a monumental achievement in multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. The fact that the draft Convention was adopted by 130 countries and was opposed by only 4 indicates that each provision is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the States in the world. It is conceivable that  taken separately  all provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention are not acceptable to a particular country. But taken as a whole  being a compromise text in a package  the text is obviously acceptable to the world community. My delegation believes that the Law of the Sea Convention is extremely important to maintaining law and order in ocean affairs as well as to promoting national development and management of ocean uses and resources. My delegation therefore would like to appeal to the small number of countries which have not adopted the Convention to reconsider their position  so that the Law of the Sea Convention  being the product of long years of negotiation  can become truly universal in nature and application.235.	Concurrent with the continuing critical climate in international politics  the international economy has plunged to one of the lowest depths in several decades.236.	Aggravating the situation is the serious erosion of multilateral economic co-operation  mainly through the regressive policies of some developed countries  which run counter to the basic goals and objectives of an increasingly interdependent world.237.	The seemingly hopeful signs generated at the Cancun and Versailles Economic Summits in seeking a breakthrough in the stalemated global negotiations have proved to be illusory. It has to be acknowledged that there was indeed some movement towards launching the global negotiations through an enabling resolution. However  the informal consultations so far have regretfully not yielded any substantive progress. My delegation endorses the search for new initiatives to reach a consensus on some crucial procedural issues. These efforts can be successful only if some developed countries demonstrate the political will to take positive step towards an early launching of these negotiations.238.	An important feature underlying the economic system today is that of interdependence. We believe that interdependence does not imply only a mutuality of benefits for both the rich and poor countries. It also means that the self-sustained economic development of the developing countries could contribute towards the economic well-being of the developed countries.239.	We are pleased to note that there has been a gradual increase of understanding by some developed countries on the inevitability of interdependence. It is our sincere hope that these countries would be willing to undertake the adjustments needed to achieve this concept.240.	We are convinced that piecemeal  domestic- oriented and bilateral remedies for our global problems are a futile exercise in a world of increasing interdependence. Restructuring  therefore  under the aegis of our universal body  the United Nations  should no longer be deferred.241.	Having said that  I wish to emphasize that this does not mean that the global negotiations or the efforts to launch them should in any way divert our attention from the ongoing negotiations in other sectoral forums.242.	The restructuring of international trade is a vital vehicle for achieving self-sustained development. And above anything else  access to markets is crucial. Regretfully  the escalation of protectionist measures practiced by some developed countries has seriously eroded the efforts of the developing countries to expand their exports. The sharp deterioration of their terms of trade continues to aggravate their already serious economic plight.243.	In this context  the forthcoming ministerial meeting of GATT provides an excellent opportunity and a historic turning point for the establishment of fair international trading practices. Such action is imperative for the expansion of trade of the developing countries.244.	The sixth session of UNCTAD  scheduled for late next spring at Belgrade  will  we believe  be of crucial importance for remedying the central problems and the current disruptions in world trade and development which could lead to the revival of the world economy. If  however  the impasse continues with no concrete results emerging from these important meetings  we will once again be witnessing another lost chance in which the international community will have failed to grasp the opportunity for progress.245.	Given the slow pace of the North-South negotiations  the measured progress of collective self-reliance among developing countries is more indispensable now than ever. Indonesia is committed to this process  not only because it is transforming the patterns of development  but because it constitutes an essential ingredient for the rapid advancement of the developing countries.246.	In this connection  we endorse the results of the meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee on economic co-operation among the developing countries held in Manila in August. Its recommendation to start negotiations on a global system of trade preference among developing countries and the development of food security reserves deserves our particular attention. In our opinion  the implementation of the global system of trade preference  through a gradual approach  will ultimately help the efforts for trade expansion among developing countries.247.	In so far as co-operation on food security reserves is concerned  we believe that it can best be implemented through sub-regional and regional arrangements  which could then be extended on a world-wide scale. We in ASEAN have initiated such an arrangement and are in the process of trying to develop further the ASEAN food security reserve co-operation.230. Turning briefly now to some social aspects of the United Nations activities  the preparations for the International Youth Year in 1985  which are now in progress  are commendable. An increased participation of non governmental youth organizations in the International Youth Year would greatly encourage them to share in the responsibilities of solving global youth problems and thereby help to promote world peace. Such an exercise would also increase their ability to participate in the national youth development program. The Indonesian Government  therefore  fully supports the Specific Programme of Measures and Activities.251.	With reference to the status and role of women  there is an increased recognition of their contribution towards development as reflected in the Mexico  World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women-Year. This positive trend is further stimulated by the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of AH Forms of Discrimination against Women. We sincerely hone that the 1985 World Conference on the United Nations Decade for Women will be able to review and appraise constructively the implementation of the Plan of Action.252.	This year that has witnessed its abundant share of world-wide turbulence and tragedy  and the inca-pacity of the United Nations to prevent them or to provide timely redress  and there is always the temptation to lapse into cynicism and disaffection. But the reforming impulse  the hopes and yearnings of peoples everywhere for a more peaceful  just and prosperous world order based on the ideals and principles of the Charter remain alive and cannot be quieted.253.	Indonesia remains convinced 'hat despite its present inadequacies  the United Nations still represents the best instrument to transform these hopes into reality and to fashion at least the minimum conditions for a better life for all in the decades to come. Therefore  if the Organization is to fulfill its role as the focal point for the global management of the critical problems of our time  it is imperative that a new sense of purpose be instilled in its mechanisms and procedures so as to prevent it from degenerating into a sterile debating forum. My delegation further believes that in this effort the non-aligned movement to which Indonesia belongs could and should make an important contribution  both at the conceptual level and in initiating concrete proposals  as it has consistently done in the past on the global issues of peace  security and international economic co-operation.254.	In a rapidly changing world of disparate interests and contending visions  the only alternative to re-storing the United Nations as a relevant organization capable of meeting the challenges of our time is to allow an unmanaged and uncontrollable slide into international chaos and anarchy. As the Secretary-General has warned  we appear to be perilously close to that point.255.	Thus  for once  the task before us should not be seen in terms of a demand by one side and an act of generosity by the other. For it may not be just our mutual interest that is at stake  but our common survival  and none of us can afford to evade this challenge and refuse to bear this responsibility."
"66",3191,"IND",37,1982,"Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the general Assembly. We are gratified that a representative of Hungary  with which we enjoy close and cordial rela¬tions  has been chosen to preside over our delib¬erations.44.	I would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the resolute and efficient leader¬ship provided to the Assembly during its thirty sixth session by your predecessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani.45.	I would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General  Mr. Perez de CueHar  who has won our admiration and acclaim for his efficient stewardship of the United Nations this year and for his skilful handling of several crisis situations. We wish him greater successes in the future.4b. India approaches the present session of the General Assembly with renewed commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. The efforts of the United Nations to bring these prin¬ciples into the realm of reality deserve the support of each one of us  for mankind has a great stake in its success. Our endeavor to contribute to its success  therefore  is dictated by our own will to survive and to pursue our path towards progress in a congenial international climate  free from domination and exploitation.49.	Building up self-reliance internally and main¬tenance of an independent policy externally have been the twin objectives of the Government if India since our independence. Traditions inherited from our ancient past still remain with us  but the leaders of modem India have succeeded in inculcating a spirit of adventure and inquiry in our people  making them receptive to evolving contemporary ideas. In this sense our tradition itself has not remained static; it has enabled change to come about  with stability and continuity being retained all the time. Side by side with the development of a rural economy  which provides sustenance for the majority of the people of India  we have built a modem industrial infrastructure which enables us to keep pace with the spectacular scientific and technological advances taking place in the world. Our mixed economy  in which the public sector occupies the commanding heights but the private sector provides the majority of the means of produc¬tion  has proved its resilience and strength. Foreign collaboration and technical co-operation have pro¬vided an impetus to our development  but both have operated within the framework of our own national priorities  determined by an integrated planning process. The stability that we have acquired through our democratic institutions  which give our people a sense of deep involvement  has proved propitious for our progress.50.	In his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has painted a grim picture of the world that we live in today. Things have come to such a sorry pass that unless they are checked  we will  he feels  approach ""a new international anarchy"". These are somber words  coming as they do from the Secretary-General. In his very first address to the General Assembly  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had warned us that it was becoming increasingly apparent that if we did not proceed speedily enough towards a world order  we would be left with no order in the world. If after 37 years of its existence  the Organization is unable to offer anything more than mere palliatives  the time has indeed come for a reassessment  some soul- searching and  above all  concrete remedial action. The Secretary-General's hands need to be strengthened so that he can advise  and if necessary  even prod the Security Council into action  to prevent outbreaks of fresh conflicts. For it is painfully obvious that the Security Council  the discharge of whose responsi¬bilities is predicated on the principle of concurrence among its permanent members  stands paralyzed and immobilized because of the inability of the permanent members to rise above their narrow national objectives to harmonize their positions in the cause of peace.51.	Although all of us  being representatives of nation States  believe strongly in the well-known attributes of national sovereignty  it should not be difficult for us to see that the common good of mankind ought to have a certain overriding priority in the scheme of things. In any event  national interest cannot be inimical to the common good of humanity: the two have to go hand in hand and be combined harmoniously  despite some seemingly disadvanta¬geous positions in the short run at the national level.52.	AH of us are committed to the goal of general and complete disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. People in every part of the world have become acutely aware that  through no fault of their own  they would perish if strategies nuclear deterrence were tested out  since they would obviously be tested out on them. They also know only too well that after a nuclear conflict either they would not be living at all  or  if they do live  that life would be so horrible that death would be preferable to it. It is this awareness that has forced multitudes of people  irrespective of color  creed  religion  nationality or political persuasion  tc go out on to the streets to urge sanity in dealing with matters of life and death. Their loud and clear voices signify that there could be no agenda more urgent than that for devising immediate measures for nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war.53.	In response to this overwhelming popular senti¬ment the world over  the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  presented at the special session on disarmament this year a concrete program of action which included the negotiation of a binding convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons  a freeze on the production of nuclear weapons and fissionable material used in the manufacture thereof  the suspension of nuclear-weapon tests  and the resumption of negotiations for concluding a treaty on general and complete disarmament. India submitted a number of proposals and draft resolutions to facilitate the beginning of a serious nuclear disarmament program. Yet the opposition of nuclear-weapon States prevented the Assembly at the special session from taking any concrete steps in this regard. The so- called consensus document that finally emerged was so insipid as to be meaningless. In the circumstances  India had no choice but to disassociate itself from the conclusions in the document.54.	The outcome of the special session was perhaps yet another instance of what the Secretary-General describes as the lack of capacity of the Organization to come to terms with the present reality. Never¬theless  we shall not despair  despite the attempts of a few but powerful nations to hold peace hostage to their nuclear arsenals and to their own perceived security interests. There have been  however  some positive albeit feeble indications of late. We welcome the evolution in the attitude of some nuclear-weapon Powers. It is our earnest hope that at this session India's proposals will be considered in all serious¬ness and that decisions will be taken that will rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.55.	It is gratifying to think that in a world teetering on the brink of nuclear disaster the vast majority of humanity prefers  wisely  to keep out of military alliances devised by great Powers. The non-aligned nations know perfectly well that military alliances and interlocking arrangements do not guarantee peace and stability  but on the contrary  serve as a potential invitation to intervention and involvement in strategic conflicts. The preservation of peace  therefore  is at the core of the philosophy of non-alignment developed by our founding fathers. It becomes more and more relevant with every passing day. Its practice has enabled India  as our Prime Minister pledged at the time of our independence  to look at the rest of the world with clear and friendly eyes: clear since we are not obliged to look through alien glasses of any hue  and friendly since we believe that mutually beneficial relations can be forged on the basis of equality. Non- alignment  which in our lexicon is a synonym for freedom of thought and action  has invested our inde¬pendence with meaning and content. It has also sharp¬ened our determination to oppose the evils of im¬perialism  colonialism  racism and all manifestations of foreign domination. The value and relevance of out non-alignment have been demonstrated not only by the increasing number of adherents it has found  but also by the qualitative change that it has helped to bring about in international relations.56.	Despite manifest diversity in political and eco¬nomic outlook and an understandable preoccupation with regional problems  the essential unity of purpose of non-aligned countries remains intact on matters of vital and crucial global interest and concern. The unique bond among them is the voice of sanity which they have raised with consistency and determination. In turn  this unity has sustained the prestige and influence of the non-aligned movement through the constantly shifting patterns in international relationships. India is honored that in these difficult times it has been called upon to host the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries. While we are naturally grateful for this opportunity  we are mindful of the tremendous responsibility it entails. With utmost sincerity  I promise that India will do all in its power to be worthy of the trust which the movement has reposed in it.57.	Our neighborhood  the South Asian subcon¬tinent  is currently going through a process of regional co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit. India is gratified at these very desirable developments  which are in consonance with its own efforts over the years to build bridges of understanding among the coun¬tries of the region. True  external interference and intervention continue to sow suspicions and inflame passions. An unprecedented build-up of sophisticated arms  unrelated either to reasonable needs or to per¬ceived threats  still points to the continuance pf strategic consensus situations so detrimental to regional independence and harmony. Yet one can perhaps hope more than hitherto that the subcontinent will be able to usher in an era of peace which is more comprehensive than the mere absence of war  and encompasses relationships of positive friendship and co-operation.58.	The slender thread which the Secretary-General has found in the search for a political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan is another development that has been welcomed in our part of the world. There is universal reaffirmation of the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States  as also of the introduction of foreign troops into any country. Here again  given the prospect of success of the Secretary-General's effort  India feels gratified that its own approach to finding a political solution has been vindicated.59.	We commend the commencement of the Geneva talks and trust that they will pick up momentum hereafter  to enter substantive areas. We feel it is high time they did  and our feeling is in line with what the Afghan people urges.60.	Geographically distant from us but equally close to our hearts are the friendly people of Kampuchea  who are struggling valiantly to remove the ravages caused by a heartless dictatorial regime. The advent of an alliance of convenience  whose real content is too thinly veiled to need any unveiling  should not distract our attention. Once the fear of the return of the holocaust is removed and the threat to their terri¬torial integrity and sovereignty is ended  the people of Kampuchea will be willing—nay  eager—to get foreign troops to leave their sail. The expedients improvised for seating the forces without legitimacy in these chambers can hardly help either the process of healing the wounds of Kampuchea or of finding an acceptable political solution. What is needed is the ending of confrontation in South-East Asia  which alone could have a welcome impact on the stability and prosperity of the entire region.61.	The security environment in the Indian Ocean region has further deteriorated because of the increased build-up of the military presence of great Powers  contrary to the wishes of the non-aligned littoral and hinterland States. The implementation of the historic general Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  adopted in 1971  has remained a distant dream. Theories of balance and doctrines of deterrence are being advanced in order to justify the introduction of sophisticated weaponry into the area.62.	The Conference on the Indian Ocean  originally scheduled to be held in 1981 in Colombo  is still post¬poned at the behest of those who are far removed from the area. Simultaneously  efforts are afoot to subvert the fundamental elements of the Declaration set out in the 1971 resolution and to distort its essential framework. We believe that the time has come for the commencement of the process of the elimination of foreign military presence from the Indian Ocean  that the Colombo Conference should be held come what may  in accordance with the new schedule  and that it should address itself to the question in a forthright manner.63.	The shifting of fortunes in the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the colossal loss of lives and property has once again highlighted the futility of war as a means of settling disputes. I personally have had the experience of participating in the peace-making effort on the basis of a mandate given to my colleagues from Cuba  Zambia and the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO] and to me at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at New Delhi in 1981. My colleagues and I are convinced that  while there can be no victor or vanquished  the damage inflicted on each other by these two neighbors will only weaken their ability to meet the challenges that face them as developing countries.64.	The recent conflagration in West Asia resulting in the virtual destruction of Beirut and the horrid genocide of the Lebanese and Palestinian population have shaken the conscience of mankind to the very core. It was nothing short of a holocaust  imposed  strangely and ironically  by none other than Israel. Ironically  again  the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut  to save innocent civilians from further suffering and devastation  itself led to the gruesome massacre of Palestinians in Shatila and Sabra. Israel's respon¬sibility  indeed complicity  is self-evident. Those who had undertaken to protect the Palestinian and Leba¬nese civilians in Beirut in the wake of the PLO's withdrawal must also share the blame for the criminal bloodshed.65.	The dispersal of the heroic Palestinians will neither weaken their will to fight for their inalienable rights nor bring peace to the area. Occupation of the land of its neighbors will not guarantee Israel's security; the effect  if anything  will be just the oppo-site. A comprehensive solution consisting of Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  the establishment of a Palestinian State and mutual guarantees of security among the States of the region must be achieved. There now seems to be greater understanding of the fact that no com¬prehensive solution will be achieved without the active involvement of the PLO  the representative of the Palestinian people. In the gory drama in Lebanon  the PLO has demonstrated great heroism and courage. The PLO and other Arab nations have since shown great statesmanship in evolving and adopting the Fez Charter""  the Final Declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  whose proposals deserve very serious consideration.66.	In recent weeks there have been important proposals made by world leaders. They vary in approach and content  but fundamental to all of them is the recognition that the uprooted people of Pales¬tine should secure their legitimate rights. In this case  as with other problems  the slowing down of the effort to find a solution often results in the creation of vested interests in the continued non-solution of the problem. This leads to prevarication and circum¬vention and a long stalemate. This has happened in West Asia  with the disastrous consequences which we are now witnessing. Therefore the quest for a comprehensive solution should be pursued relent¬lessly. Instead of indulging in a fine-print scrutiny of the various plans mooted so far and losing valuable time in endless discussions  immediate steps should be taken at the United Nations to devise a suitable mechanism for finding a permanent solution to the problem of West Asia. This is the very minimum that needs to be done in expiation of the rivers of innocent blood that have been allowed to flow in Lebanon.67.	Racism and colonialism still rage in southern Africa today  with little progress either in the elimina¬tion of	or in the liberation of Namibia. The people of South Africa remains in bondage  despite the universal condemnation of the obnoxious discriminatory laws of the Pretoria regime. We have been awaiting the outcome of the contacts being conducted by the five Western States for the imple¬mentation of the United Nations plan for free elections in Namibia. The South West Africa People's Organiza¬tion [SWAPO]  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  which negotiated in good faith for a cease-fire and free elections  has reason to apprehend that South Africa and its supporters have been creating an illusion of progress in these talks merely to link up the situation in Namibia with extraneous issues. The international community will  as it must  intensify its demand for punitive action against South Africa under the Charter  if the current efforts for a negotiated settlement fail to achieve results. South Africa's supporters will find it difficult to shield it from the wrath of the world for very long.68.	Several old items on the agenda continue to engage our attention. Thus the situation in Cyprus  unfortunately  still remains frozen. In spite of repeated calls of the movement of non-aligned countries and the support of the international community in general the relevant resolutions of the United Nations have not yet been implemented. We trust that the inter- communal talks will soon bear fruit and the question resolved free from external interference and in accor¬dance with decisions of the United Nations.69.	More recently  despite the efforts of our sagacious Secretary-General  conflict and bloodshed in the South Atlantic could not be averted.70.	In Central America there are dangerous portents of intervention and destabilization. The United Nations cannot remain a mute spectator and must lend support to all efforts for dialogue and negotiation to create mutual confidence and to resolve outstanding disputes.71.	It is with great satisfaction that we note the long and at times difficult negotiations successfully con¬cluded with the adoption of a universal and compre¬hensive Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Convention is a symbol of shared expectations of the international community and represents a major con¬tribution to world peace and the new international economic order. Later this year  in December  in Jamaica the Final Act will be open for signature. It is our earnest hope that the Convention on the Law of the Sea will be endorsed by all States with prompt signatures and ratifications.72.	International co-operation for development is the topic of our age. We strongly believe that our approach to development and co-operation will have to be informed by certain objective and fundamental considerations. First  the arms race is not compatible with the movement towards a more stable global development and sustainable international order. Secondly  the international community cannot aspire to durable peace so long as a major component of it remains underdeveloped. Thirdly  orderly develop¬ment and continued progress can take place opti¬mally only in an atmosphere of harmony and co-oper¬ation. Fourthly  co-operation demands that the privileges which the developed countries have been enjoying so far should not be turned into rights and that the concerns of the developingcountries be taken into account.73.	Some months ago  in a special session  the General Assembly brought out clearly the close connection between disarmament and development  but failed to draw the requisite conclusions from it.74.	A year ago the two co-Chairmen of the Inter¬national Meeting on Co-operation and Development  which was held at Cancun  referred to the North-South relationship as one of the most serious challenges to be faced in the coming decades by mankind  together with the maintenance of peace. The theme of Cancun was ""Co-operation and Development"". Regrettably  there was no agreement as to how the real challenge of the North-South relationship was to be met  though  as our Prime Minister observed after the Cancun meeting the door was kept open for dialogue.75.	One can only hope that world statesmen will take an enlightened and long-term view of history. We also need to promote world-wide political under¬standing  with the involvement of the public  of the connection between the North-South relationship and the maintenance of peace. This would contribute significantly to generating the requisite political will that is sorely needed to overcome the present paralysis in the North-South dialogue.76.	Viewed against this background  it is most dis¬heartening that the adverse effects of the continued deadlock on the negotiating front have been com¬pounded by an actual deterioration in the North- South relationship. As the report of the Committee on Development Planning on its eighteenth session^ has illustrated  there is both qualitative and quantita¬tive deterioration in multilateral economic co-oper¬ation. Examples of this are increasing protectionism  high interest rates  fast-diminishing concessional assistance  the secular decline in prices of many commodities  difficulties in access to the international capital market and the injection of non-economic factors and political considerations in the functioning of multilateral economic institutions. For the first time since the Second World War  the developing countries  taken as a group  have registered a fall in their per capita output.77.	Two years ago the Assembly adopted the Inter¬national Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. However  it remains a paper document. There is all round failure on the part of the developed countries to fulfill their commitments. There is no agreement  even on the procedures for the global negotiations that were expected to contribute to the implementation of the Strategy.78.	Recent developments show that while the devel¬oping countries do have a conciliatory approach  there is not enough encouraging response from the devel¬oped countries. Several of them are not negative  yet there are some that are not even prepared to think in terms of a consensus that can bind the North and the South. They are still to be convinced that com-prehensive and global negotiations will in the long run facilitate the emergence of a viable co-operative relationship among the nations of the world. As for the developing countries  they are not interested in a zero- sum game  but in a positive-sum approach. They are conscious of the fact that the progress in regard to the achievement of the new international economic order is inextricably linked with the world economic recovery program. Thus  today world economic problems can be solved only by joint actions. There is no alternative for the international community but to move beyond the present stalemate to more fruitful  durable and just international economic relationships.79.	Let me now turn to the current problems arising from the pursuit of anti-inflationary policies  protec¬tionist trends  high interest rates and the drying up cf the sources of concessional flows. The anti- inflationary policies that have been adopted by some developed countries are not conducive to growth and employment. Consequently  there has been a decline in the price per unit of exports by developing countries of their raw materials and primary products. The exports of industrial products of developing countries have been adversely affected by growing protectionism. The high interest rates are causing serious problems in regard to debt burden and access to international capital markets. The International Development Association [IDA] is in deep trouble. All this makes the task of developing countries extremely difficult. The situation is particularly grave for oil-importing developing countries in regard to their balance-of-payments position and the development of their energy resources  which require large capital outlay.80.	We should thus lose no time in devising feasible strategies that are complementary to those predicated on global negotiations for restructuring international economic relations. Urgent steps need to be taken for a world economic recovery program and for building upon the limited gains that have been secured through North-South co-operation. Agreement should be sought wherever possible. Detailed guidelines for further work should be drawn up so as to facilitate thorough discussions and eventual agreement on all connected matters at the sixth session of UNCTAD  where this matter will be high on the agenda.81.	Numerous international conferences have stressed the need for making efforts concurrent with global negotiations in order to achieve progress in areas of critical importance to developing countries such as food  energy  trade and financial flows. The Versailles Economic Summit had outlined certain practical areas for action. We would urge developed countries not to use lack of progress on global negotiations as an alibi for inaction. We expect that they would translate their suggestions into concrete and co-operative programmes of action that would contribute to the development of the developing countries.82.	A broad consensus now exists  and indeed  this was one concrete gain in Cancun—on evolving a strategy to increase food production. We hope that a well-thought-out international program would emerge in this regard. Efforts must continue to devise a global strategy for food security and for constant updating of measures and actions. It is important to reach agreement on an international wheat trade agree¬ment for stability of supplies and prices.83.	In the field of energy the most important task is to help oil-importing developing countries to exploit their own energy resources. At the same time  much greater research activities and financial resources are needed for developing alternative sources of energy. Ongoing studies should be completed early in regard to the securing of financing for an increased pro¬gram of energy investment through an energy affiliate of the World Bank or a special fund  or other agreed arrangements.84.	A further expansion and liberalization of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] compensatory facility is called for. Indeed  we need to give greater consideration to the establishment of a completely new commodity-related scheme. Predictability in the earnings  supply and demand of commodities is an objective which we should seriously pursue. This calls for adequate and effective price stabilization arrange¬ments.85.	The deterioration in the world trading situation is especially affecting countries with relatively low per capita income. The international trading regime which has emerged neither adheres to the principles and rules envisaged by GATT  nor is it responsive to new circumstances. What is necessary is the most careful consideration of the requirements of an international trading order that will be efficient  equitable and effectively promote the development of developing countries. For this there should be a return to a set of agreed principles in international trading relation¬ships  particularly through practical support for the principles of multilateralism  non-discrimination  non- reciprocity vis-a-vis developing countries  trans¬parency and predictability consistent with special and differential treatment to developing countries. Progres¬sive liberalization of the trade in textiles  clothing  the leather industry and other consumer durables is a matter of great importance to the industrial develop¬ment of developing countries. The developing coun¬tries possess comparative advantages in these areas. We expect that the GATT ministerial meeting and the sixth session of UNCTAD would agree on con¬crete measures in this regard.86.	The situation created by the second massive oil price rise is qualitatively different and more acute than that faced by the world community at the time of the first energy crisis less than 10 years ago. The growth momentum of the developing countries was then maintained through flows of international finance on suitable terms to the countries most adversely affected by the crisis and through new modalities of concessional developmental assistance. No similar effort is visible today or even being considered. Instead  private capital and investments are suggested as a solution to the problems of developing countries. While private capital can be useful in certain areas  experience clearly shows that it cannot provide resources for long-term development aiming at social improvement and stability with low or no market profit. It cannot alleviate the balance-of-payments burdens of developing countries. Above all  multi¬lateral aid should not be made conditional on cor¬responding in flow of private investment. Similarly  the increasing recourse to exclusive bilateralism continues and must be resisted to the extent such bilateralism tends to obstruct multilateral co-operation and is pursued at the expense of the latter.87.	Thus  the international monetary and financial system is increasingly pushing developing countries towards adjustment policies that seriously undermine their stability. This is happening at a time when the oil-importing developing countries are making efforts against such heavy odds as increasing exports during a time of declining world demand  raising higher and higher resources domestically in order to finance the same volume of imports; and bringing about reduction in already low levels of consumption in order to increase investments and savings. There is a limit to which our countries can be pushed.88.	Co-operation among developing countries is now viewed both as an essential component of the new international economic order and as an important instrument for bringing it about. Three years ago  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Havana had agreed on policy guidelines for reinforcing the collective self- reliance of developing countries. We note with satis¬faction that a process has now been set in motion which is continuously enriching the concept  practice and content of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries.89.	Concomitant support measures by international organizations would be of great help in technical preparations for major South-South undertakings such as  for instance  the establishment of the global system of trade preferences among developing countries and the setting up of a South-South bank. We believe that economic co-operation among developing coun¬tries can make a significant contribution to world economic recovery. We trust that the Assembly will give due and favorable consideration to these matters.90.	This is not the moment to think in terms of mutually exclusive alternatives. The present sorry state of affairs can be repaired only by action on all fronts. We need bilateral as well as multilateral co-oper¬ation  official development assistance as well as private flows of capital  North-South co-operation as well as South-South co-operation  global negotiations for restructuring international economic relations as well as concurrent efforts for securing progress in sectoral areas. Let us  therefore  not engage in futile debates  but work honestly to secure concrete results. I trust that our deliberations in the Assembly will lead us to this path.91.	The German philosopher Hegel believed that a notable contribution of man to civilization was the creation of the nation-State  which provides the individual with theopportunity of finding the full satisfaction of his needs in co-operation with pie community. This Organization  composed of 157 nation States  represents the quintessence of the civilization that mankind has labored hard over the centuries to build. The Prime Minister of India  Shrimati Indira Gandhi  recently observed:""One of the most fascinating riddles of history is what makes a group of people share a sense of common destiny. Almost always this is the result of being together in hardship and humiliation; often it comes from being summoned to a heroic effort by a great figure or group of people who inspire them with a vision of truth or glory''.The community of nations  as practically every distinguished speaker has stressed in the Assembly  is confronted with an economic  political and moral crisis. Such adversity should  instead of dividing us  reinforce our resolve to seek and secure our common destiny. With such a distinguished gathering of leaders from all over the world who have addressed and are going to address the Assembly  we cannot afford to fail in finding that vision of truth and glory. I should like to conclude with the conviction that if we pledge to act together  we will overcome the crisis that faces us today."
"67",3237,"IRL",37,1982,"First I should like to congratulate the President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly on his election. I am quite sure that he will carry out his functions as President with great success. I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  who presided over the last session with distinction and leadership. I wish  too  to join in congratulating the Secretary- General. Although he has not yet been one year in office  he has already established a justly deserved reputation for integrity and for his efforts to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for peace.2.	I want also to associate myself with the views already expressed by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark  Mr. Elle- mann-Jensen  on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community  to which Ireland belongs.3.	As we begin this annual session of the General Assembly the international outlook is gloomy  even more gloomy than it was one year ago. Over the past year relations between the major Powers have deteriorated and this has had an adverse effect on many other aspects of international life. Furthermore there are at this moment several wars and conflicts taking place—between Iran and Iraq  between Ethiopia and Somalia  in Afghanistan and in Central America. In recent months the world has also seen a war that should not have happened over the Falkland Islands and an invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces which has led to tremendous loss of life and brought great tragedy in its wake.4.	At the world level the arms race continues  and the level of nuclear armaments is greater than ever before. Conventional armaments  too  are a major item in world trade. They now occupy second place after oil. And these are weapons which are actually being used in conflict in many parts of the world.1775.	In economic matters  too  the world outlook is exceedingly gloomy  more gloomy perhaps than it has been for many years. The major industrialized coun¬tries are suffering through a serious recession  with high unemployment  inflation and high interest rates. The less developed countries are poorer than ever before  and many relatively prosperous countries which appeared to have good economic prospects have now run into major difficulties. These trends  if left unchecked  could threaten the stability of the whole international monetary system.6.	It is clear that the problems facing the world community in this month of September 1982 are indeed formidable. In many areas of international life it would be no exaggeration to speak of the present situation as one of serious crisis.7.	What of the means available to the world com¬munity to deal with these serious and critical problems? How effective are the Organization and the procedures which have evolved since the Second World War in promoting a sense of community and a common response to international problems?8.	Here too  I believe  we can speak of a crisis. The events of the past year  and of the past six months in particular  seem to many people around the world to have called most seriously into question the effective¬ness and relevance of the whole United Nations system as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the development of inter¬national co-operation.9.	We have available to us at the beginning of this session a most important document: the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. It is  I venture to say  one of the most important documents of recent years. Ireland is extremely grateful to the Secretary-General for his analysis  his insight and his courage.10.	I know that many important problems are already on the agenda or will be raised in the course of the session. But I strongly believe that in a deeper sense the real question before us at this the 1982 session of the General Assembly is how we respond  individually and collectively  to the very basic issues raised by the Secretary-General in his report.11.	The report itself is short  and all of it is of interest  but the core of the report is a serious warning that the world is now embarked on an exceedingly dangerous course and that we are perilously near to a new international anarchy. The present crisis in the multilateral approach in international affairs and the crisis of confidence in the United Nations as an instrument for the maintenance of peace and security are evidence of this. I believe the Secretary-General was right in his warning that the most urgent goal at present is to re-establish the fundamental concept of the Charter of the United Nations: that of collective action for peace and security.12.	We all need to remember that the United Nations in its origins was not simply an idealistic concept. It was a serious organization of States with a very serious purpose. It grew cut of one major war—the most disastrous in human history—and it was designed to prevent another. It began as an organization of limited membership  but it has now become an almost universal world body  and it must be strengthened and made more effective if it is to deal adequately with world problems.13.	I have little doubt that most  or perhaps all  of us who come here to this rostrum to speak during the next few weeks of general debate win speak highly of the Secretary-General's report. This is what it merits. He has clearly identified for us the problems  and he has gone farther by pointing «ut and proposing a whole series of measures which  if implemented  would do much to improve the capacity of the United Nations to keep the peace and to serve as a forum for negotiations. On behalf of my Government  I warmly endorse his ideas and proposals. in par¬ticular  I agree with him when he urges a more sys¬tematic use of the Security Council; a more active approach to conflicts so that it is not left to the judgment of the conflicting parties whether or not the matter should be raised in the Council; a greater use of fact-finding missions and missions of good offices; and a greater use by the Secretary-General himself of his power under Article 99 of the Charter to bring issues to the attention of the Security Council. These  and the many other useful ideas in the Secretary- General's report  should in our view be considered at a meeting of the Security Council held at high political level  as the Secretary-General has also proposed. From such a meeting could emerge an improvement in procedures and  far more important  a new sense of commitment.14.	Those are only some among the many wise ideas which the Secretary-General has put forward. It is most important that he has invited us to debate  and to think out seriously with him what needs to be done. I think that we owe it to him not simply to speak warmly of his report or of some of his ideas and then leave it stand as just another document. Rather  we must each contribute what we can to the debate  and we must then together ensure that the end result of all this debate over the coming weeks will not be words only but actions which each of us will take  in so far as it is open to us to do so.13. In contributing to this debate on what is needed to strengthen the United Nations  I want to emphasize three points which Ireland considers particularly important at the present time of crisis.16.	First  as I have already said  we need a new and continuing commitment from every Member State to strengthen and improve the United Nations system and make it increasingly relevant and effective. A particular commitment will be needed from the great Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council and which have a very special role in the ' system. Ireland  for its part  though it is a small country  willingly makes such a commitment. We will do everything we can to sustain and support the United Nations. We will work with others in every way open to us to make it more effective.17.	Secondly  there is a need to carry through this commitment in practice. That means that wherever there is a situation of conflict between Member States all those involved must be ready not only to invokethe Charter  as they now do  to justify their actions but to use the procedures of the United Nations to the full before resorting in the first instance to their own strength to vindicate their rights.18.	Thirdly  there is a special need for the Security Council and its permanent members in particular  to be willing to follow through on the decisions which the Council takes in order to ensure that they are implemented. Nothing contributes more to an impres¬sion of ineffectiveness and irrelevance than an inability or failure of the Council to do so. This has been particularly evident over recent months.19.	Because of its importance  I should like to spell out this third point in more detail. Under the Charter  the Security Council has power  through a whole range of measures  to impose its decisions and to exercise authority. Many of us would like to see a greater measure of agreement within the Council  and among the permanent members  on the use of that authority to resolve international conflicts. We have come to accept  however  that there are many issues con¬cerning which the Council cannot agree in the first instance on what should be done. But  when the Coun¬cil does agree and does adopt a resolution in relation to a conflict  it must also be ready later  if necessary  to consider the measures which may be needed to ensure that the decision is implemented. If the Coun¬cil repeatedly fails in this  it will soon lose all authority. The case is even more obvious when  as has happened several times in recent months in regard to Lebanon  the initial Council decision was unanimous.20.	These are three points which Ireland  as a small country which has always tried to uphold and support the United Nations and contribute to its effectiveness as best it can  would think to be fundamental.21.	But what specifically should now be done  and by whom? I repeat that it is not enough to commend the Secretary-General's report: we must act on it. I would hope therefore that when this general debate is finished  and when all delegations that wish to do so have stated their views  there can be serious con¬sideration of how best to proceed.22- In particular  I believe that it would be important ^hat the Security Council—to the effectiveness of which much of the document is directed—should consider necessary action. For its part  Ireland  as a member of the Security Council until the end of 1982  would be willing to support and work for such con¬sideration among members of the Council with a view to finding the best way to translate ideas into action. There is no more important task before us at the present time.23.	The need to restore respect for the Charter and for the authority and status of the United Nations is mcst forcefully demonstrated by recent events in the Middle East. The situation there  already complex and seemingly intractable  has been greatly aggravated by Israel's invasion of Lebanon and its continuing presence there. Many resolutions of the Security Council  despite the authority which they carry under the Charter  have been defied or ignored  and have remained unimplemented for over four months.24.	Israel's invasion of Lebanon  carried out in the name of its security  has brought with it death and destruction. Israel has continued its occupation  an occupation which  I must say in all candor  shows no sign of ending despite the repeated calls of the Security Council; despite the stated wishes of the Government of Lebanon and  not least  despite Israel's own claim that it does not covet even one inch of Lebanese territory. In the past few weeks  the situation has deteriorated even further. The occupation of west Beirut  with the declared objective of main¬taining law and order  has brought in its train deeds that have shocked the world.25.	The Irish Government and people are horrified at the wanton murder of Palestinian civilians in the Shatila and Sabra camps  and we join in condemna¬tion of those who perpetrated those dreadful crimes. The murder of the Palestinian civilians  whoever carried them out  took place when Israeli forceshad assumed control of the area  and Israel must accord¬ingly carry considerable responsibility.26.	The people of Lebanon have suffered much in recent years. They must be enabled to re-establish the authority of their central Government. The full sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon must be restored. To this end  the Israeli forces must withdraw immediately from Beirut as a first step to their complete withdrawal from all Lebanese territory. Withdrawal by Israel from Lebanon was unanimously demanded by the Security Council nearly four months ago. We believe that all foreign forces whose presence has not been authorized by the Government of Lebanon should now leave Lebanon.27.	Lebanon has been a casualty of the wider conflict of the Middle East  and that conflict remains un¬resolved. What is now needed is real progress towards negotiation aimed at reconciliation of two basic rights: that of all States  including Israel  to exist within secure and recognized boundaries; and that of the Palestinians to self-determination and statehood  if they so wish.28.	Such reconciliation cannot be achieved through efforts to suppress or abridge the rights of other parties. The bloody events of recent months testify to that reality. The parties should now accept that those basic rights must be reconciled within the framework of a comprehensive and negotiated settlement  with the direct participation of all concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  whose role in representing the Palestinian people we recognize.29.	Despite the events of recent weeks  there is also encouraging evidence of a new willingness to break the deadlock which has prevented progress towards a comprehensive and just solution of the Middle East problem. The initiative announced by President Reagan on I September provides a significant oppor¬tunity to make progress in the direction I have out¬lined. The declaration adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  must also be regarded as an important and substantive contri¬bution to a search for an equitable settlement. And because both these developments together offer hope for the future  they deserve the most serious considera¬tion by all the parties concerned.30.	The United Nations has over the years played an important and at times crucial role in the search for a peace settlement in the Middle East. It has served to set forth proposals and principles for a settlement; it has been a forum for negotiations; and it has actively helped to maintain peace through its peace-keeping and observation missions. I believe that the United Nations can and should play a role of similar im¬portance in the future. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have set down fundamental —even if now incomplete—principles for a settlement. These principles must be augmented and completed. The recent joint initiative by France and Egypt in the Security Council provides an opportunity for dis¬cussion at the appropriate time on how these prin¬ciples might be completed. But this elaboration of  so to speak  a juridical foundation alone will not be enough.31.	As the Secretary-General stated in his report  ""It is absolutely essential that serious negotiations on the various aspects of that problem involve all the parties concerned at the earliest possible time."" I urge that careful consideration be given to two points made by the Secretary-General concerning a possible role for the Security Council in this regard. First  the Security Council is the only place in the world where all the parties concerned  and particularly Israel and the PLO  at present sit at the same table. Second  given a will by the parties to negotiate seriously  it should be possible within the Security Council to work out procedures and rules  new if necessary  to govern substantive negotiations.32.	Recent events in the Middle East  in particular in Lebanon  have focused attention on the peace¬keeping role of the United Nations. The development of peace-keeping is  I believe  one of the most im¬portant achievements of the Organization  and it gives effect in a practical and tangible way to the commit¬ment of Member States to the Charter. Peace-keeping activities have increased in scope and significance over the years and have evolved in response to the needs of particular situations. Precisely because the concept of peace-keeping is still evolving  I believe it is necessary to keep it under review. In the light of events in Lebanon in particular  we should determine where weaknesses exist and decide how they can be remedied.33.	Ireland's experience in United Nations peace¬keeping over the years leads us to draw certain con¬clusions about the circumstances in which it can make a useful contribution and about the political and prac¬tical conditions necessary for peace-keeping to function effectively. First  peace-keeping operations are intended to assist in the control of conflict and in the search for a peaceful solution. It follows that they are essentially a temporary measure and only one part of a peace-making process. Efforts to resolve the causes of the conflict must continue. Secondly  peace¬keeping missions must have the consent of the coun¬tries in whose territories they are stationed and the co-operation of all the parties concerned. This dis¬tinguishes peace-keeping from peace-enforcement. Thirdly  the peace-keeping force must have a clear and unambiguous mandate. Fourthly  the force must have freedom of movement throughout the area assigned to it and must have conditions of adequate security for its personnel. Fifthly  United Nations peace-keeping operations must at all times have firm support and backing of the Organization—in particular of the Security Council and its members— and a  strong and assured financial basis.34. The events in Lebanon demonstrate the im¬portance of these five conditions. It is clear that  in the case of UNIFIL  these conditions were not fulfilled. Despite this  UNIFIL played an indis¬pensable part in controlling conflict up to the Israeli invasion last June. Even now UNIFIL  in its reduced and limited role  maintains stable conditions in its area of operations. But this is quite inadequate. If UNIFIL or other United Nations forces are to play an effective role in assisting the Government of Lebanon to restore full Lebanese sovereignty  independence and terri¬torial integrity  the Security Council and the interna¬tional community must ensure that the conditions I have listed already are fully observed.33. I should like to pay a tribute to the courage and devotion to duty shown by all those involved in United Nations peace-keeping operations  particularly in UNIFIL and UNTSO. Several Member States  including my own  have suffered through the death and injury of their soldiers serving under the United Nations Hag in the cause of peace. I extend my sympathy to the relatives and the comrades of Com¬mandant Nestor and the other observers killed by mine explosions in Beirut in the past few days. United Nations peace-keeping forces have shown resilience and constant courage in the face of very difficult circumstances. It is for us to show respect for that courage by acting to bring about effective conditions in which they can discharge their vital task.36.	In the 1960s and 1970s  after years of confronta¬tion and cold war  East and West seemed to be edging towards recognition of their common interest in avoiding war and in promoting mutually beneficial co-operation.37.	The situation today is very different. Mutual suspicion and growing confrontation have replaced the cautious confidence of the 1960s and early 1970s and the limited co-operation that had been achieved. The decline in the political relations between East and West  particularly between the super-Powers and the alliances  has also affected arms control and disarma¬ment negotiations. There will now be a further escalation in the arms race unless urgent and sustained efforts are made to reach agreement in current nego¬tiations.38.	We believe it is necessary to build upon common interests and to enlarge the areas whereconflicting interests can be reconciled or accommodated. Dialogue between East and West must therefore continue through bilateral and multilateral channels. And if such a dialogue is to lead to substantive results  all sides must be willing to act with restraint and realism.39.	On the political level  the crisis of authority in Poland and the sustained repression of elementary social and civil rights contrary to the Helsinki Final Act^ undermine the credibility of detente. As long as those conditions remain  they will hinder progress on a wide range of East-West negotiations including  in particular  the discussions at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Likewise  the Soviet invasion and continuing military occupation of Afghanistan must inevitably have a similar adverse effect.40.	None the less  it must be emphasized that sus¬tained efforts at arms control and disarmament are valid for their own sake. It is indispensable to try to contain  reduce and ultimately eliminate the threat posed by the arms race  particularly in nuclear weapons. It is also necessary in the meantime to ensure that new weapons and technologies do not undermine or destabilize the already fragile strategic relationship. It follows that while the adverse political climate is bound to complicate existing negotiations  arms control and disarmament efforts—bilateral  regional and multilateral—should nevertheless not be subordinated to the solution of wider political problems.41.	My Government was very disappointed at the outcome of the recent twelfth special session  the second special session on disarmament. But we cannot abandon efforts to achieve realistic goals aimed at putting an end to the arms race and reducing arma¬ments—both nuclear and conventional. World opinion  increasingly concerned about the threat posed by nuclear weapons  demands that we redouble our efforts. My Government will always support genuine and realistic arms control and disarmament proposals.42.	The highest priority must be given to nuclear disarmament in order to halt and reverse the ceaseless build-up of nuclear arms. It is our earnest hope that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on intermediate and strategic weapons will reach an early and successful conclusion.43.	I should like to reiterate the proposal for an agreement on a moratorium on the introduction of any further strategic nuclear weapons or delivery vehicles  proposed by the Prime Minister of Ireland  Mr. Haughey  during the twelfth special session. The moratorium would be for an initial period of two years but would be renewable by mutual consent. An agreement along these lines would  I believe  be a significant step towards the restora¬tion of confidence.44.	A comprehensive test-ban treaty  or at the very least a moratorium on all nuclear tests  remains an urgent necessity. An end to testing would slow down the rate of qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and would be a valuable contribution by nuclear States to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.43. There are  of course  many other areas in which progress must be made. I would highlight in particular the need for a chemical weapons convention  the banning of all weapons from outer space and progress on conventional disarmament.46. If the outlook elsewhere is more sombre and troubling than it was a year ago  the prospect for Namibia seems more hopeful. The Israel Government is concerned that the momentum of the negotiations to implement the United Nations plan for Namibian independence should not be lost. Ireland has fully supported the efforts of the Secretary-General  the contact group of five Western States  the front-line States and the South West Africa People's Organiza-tion [SWAPO] to secure implementation now. In our view  any further delay will endanger the prospects for a peaceful settlement. It is vital that the Assembly at this session focus its efforts on assisting the Secre¬tary-General to bring about a settlement.47.	Throughout the long history of the effort to help the people of Namibia win freedom and live in peace  it has been clear that a settlement through negotiation is possible only if there is a sincere desire on the part of all concerned to achieve this. The implementation of the United Nations plan based on Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) would enable the international community to discharge its unique responsibility for Namibia and to demonstrate that the machinery of the United Nations can be used effectively to resolve a major international issue.48.	The United Nations plan does not and  indeed  cannot contain a blueprint for the future relations of all the States of southern Africa and it will not resolve all the issues in the region. But its implementation would be an important step in that direction. If South Africa now obstructs its implementation  thereby preventing a peaceful conclusion to the decolonization process in southern Africa  it will bear a heavy responsibility for the conflict and suffering which may follow.49.	At the root of the dangerous and tragic situation in southern Africa today is the policy of pursued by South Africa. This system of institu¬tionalized racial discrimination is unique and is rightly the object of universal condemnation.50.	Ireland condemns South Africa's apartheid system unreservedly and we are committed to opposing it strongly and actively  working in concert with the international community  The pass laws  banning and detention regulations all continue to result in intense human suffering. This year  when Nelson Mandela will have spent 20 years in goal  we are particularly concerned at the plight of political prisoners  including those members of the African National Congress who are currently under sentence of death. We urge the South African Government to commute those sentences.51.	There is some evidence of increased debate among the white community in South Africa—for example  in the search for new constitutional struc¬tures. Unfortunately  this does not address the core of the problem or the basic framework of the apartheid system. The crisis that South Africa faces is now so deep that only a radical new approach can avert a further descent into violence.52.	In seeking to divert attention from its internal problems  it seems that South Africa may be endeavoring to destabilize neighbouring States. We view with the utmost concern any actions having that objective. We will continue to support the efforts of the front-line States to consolidate their hard-won independence.53.	Over the past year  conflicts in Latin America were also a matter of concern to the international community. In the view of my Government  the armed conflict over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) earlier this year was an unnecessary conflict. We very much deplore the use of force contrary to the principles of the Charter  the failure to comply with Security Council resolution 502 (1982) and the fact that a peace¬ful solution offered through the United Nations did not prove possible. It is our hope that the parties will be able actively to pursue a peaceful settlement of their continuing dispute.54.	The Irish Government and people are also con¬cerned at the instability  the violence and the viola¬tions of human rights in Central America. We are convinced that it is necessary to remedy the under¬lying economic and social causes of tension in the area  to end all foreign interference and to seek political solutions to conflicts in the area through dialogue and negotiations.55.	There is a growing acceptance that the interna¬tional community has a responsibility for the remedy of serious human rights abuses. I welcome the personal commitment repeatedly expressed by the new Secretary-General to the human rights program of the United Nations and his efforts to strengthen the Secre¬tariat in that field.56.	It is necessary for continued progress that inves¬tigations of human rights abuses should be seen to be fair. It is also important that States concerned in investigations should co-operate with the Secretary- general  or other appointed personsin the implementa¬tion of our decisions  bearing in mind the primary responsibility of States to ensure that human rights are respected within their own areas of jurisdiction.57.	The Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief  adopted last year by the General assembly is an important addition to the several human rights instruments adopted since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Ireland believes that further steps should be taken to draw the attention of the peoples of the world to this Declaration.58.	In the historical perspective  we have indeed seen considerable progress in the area of human rights. But serious violations of human rights in many parts of the world continue to affront our sense of the value of the human person. Massacres of large numbers of innocent civilians have taken place recently in Lebanon  Guatemala and E! Salvador.59.	There are other countries where we have less certain knowledge of such appalling violations of the right to life but where there is reason to believe that such violations do indeed take place. There are still other areas where civil and political rights are suppressed sporadically or even on a systematic basis. Abuses of human rights  such as disappearances  are a most troubling recent feature.60.	A general report by the Secretary-Genera! on the international human rights situation to the As¬sembly at regular intervals could help the international community to recognize at an early stage the emer¬gence of a pattern of such abuses and thus to take effective action against them;61.	The world at present has major problems in the economic field. Of particular importance is the problem of development  which is at once a political and an economic issue. Because of this and because of its universal nature the United Nations has a vital role to play in the North-South dialogue. There is an urgent need to promote the changes necessary to redress the structural imbalances in the world economy and to accelerate the rate of growth in developing countries.62.	The economic difficulties facing all countries remain serious and are likely to continue for some time. Large fiscal deficits  concern about inflation and tight monetary policies have raised real interest rates in the industrialized countries to unprecedented levels. These measures have far-reaching conse¬quences  depressing the export earnings of hard- pressed developing nations and curtailing their already low growth rates. Low-income countries have been particularly hard hit by the recession in the indus¬trialized countries. Poverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy remain daily realities for the vast majority of the world's population.63.	Ireland fully supports the central role that the United Nations system has to play in any realistic program for global recovery. In particular  we urge that the challenge of furthering and deepening the relationship between developed and developing nations be met by the early launching of global negotiations. We believe that the industrialized nations must now do everything possible to ensure that a new and effective dialogue with the developing countries gets under way.64.	In the longer term we look to the sixth session of UNCTAD in June of next year to improve under¬standing of the real problems of developed and devel¬oping countries  to promote the revival of the interna¬tional economy and to give a new impetus to the progress of developing countries.65.	I am pleased that the lengthy work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been concluded with the adoption by the overwhelming majority of the States represented here of the text of the Convention on the law of the sea.^ It is indeed an achievement of which the United Nations can be justly proud. Our task  however  is not finished. The adoption of the Convention is only the first step in the process of giving to the provisions of the Con¬vention so painstakingly negotiated the status of generally accepted guiding rules for theorderly use of the seas and their resources. In the course of the negotiations it was constantly stressed by all the parties involved that the Convention is a carefully balanced package which should not be the subject of piecemeal acceptance by States.66.	We must now ensure that the integrity of this comprehensive Convention is maintained. We must also ensure that the new international body which it established  the International Sea-Bed Authority  can begin to function at an early stage. It is the hope of my Government that such will be the support for the ' Convention that the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the Interna¬tional Tribunal for the Law of the Sea can be convened quickly to facilitate the smooth functioning of the Convention and the effective operation of the bodies which it establishes.67.	I therefore urge all Member States to support the Convention and endorse its provisions by signing it at the earliest possible time. It is the intention of the Irish Government to do so.68.	I would like now to turn to a particular difficulty which we face in Ireland and in relation to which I ask for your sympathy and your understanding. I refer to the Northern Ireland situation.69.	I do not need to dwell on the tragic effects of the continuing unrest in Northern Ireland. Since the out- break some 12 years ago of the present cycle of violence  up to 2 400 people have been killed and over 25 000 people have suffered serious injury. The destruction of property has amounted to hundreds of millions of pounds.70.	The economy of Northern Ireland has suffered heavily and remains in decline. Among the worst effects  however  has been the damage to the social fabric of society. A new generate t is now growing up in Northern Ireland in conditions in which violence and confrontation  hatred and division  form part of the pattern of everyday life.71.	Nor has the burden of the unrest been confined to the six countries of Northern Ireland alone. Death and destruction have taken place in Britain  and in financial terms the cost to Britain has been a heavy one. We in the rest of Ireland have also suffered death and destruction  and the Northern Ireland situa¬tion has involved for us an additional expenditure of over 100 million pounds each year on maintaining security.72.	Common sense should compel us all  if only on the ground of our mutual interests  to seek a just and lasting settlements of this intolerable situation  a settlement which  if it is to be effective  must take into account the fundamental nature of the problem. The Irish Government  for its part  has declared this task to be its first political priority.73.	The roots of the problem lie in a complex of historical circumstances in which social  religious  economic and political factors have all played their part. We believe  however  that in any objective analysis of the problem one factor emerges clearly and inescapably: the constitutional arrangements made in the 1920s have failed to provide a just and workable basis for peace and stability in Northern Ireland.74.	The experiment of partitioning Ireland has obviously failed. The consequences of that failure include the tension in Northern Ireland which has erupted into violence in almost every decade since the island of Ireland was divided. The development of the full economic  political and social potential of the island as a whole has been slowed down as a result of partition. Barriers have been erected where none should exist; the small island of Ireland has an artificial political division  and within Northern Ireland itself a community of one and a half million people is split by dissension that is irrelevant to the demands of today.75.	The Irish Government  on whose behalf I address you today  seeks to remove all barriers and divisions within Ireland. We seek to do so only through peaceful means. We condemn utterly and reject totally violence and terrorist activity no matter what its source. The atrocities committed by men and women of violence on all sides are inherently evil. They are also ultimately futile and counterproductive as a means of promoting political change. They serve only to increase bitterness  to deepen intransigent attitudes and above all to post¬pone the day of settlement. The road to peace lies only in the removal of barriers and in the coming together of all the Irish traditions.76.	We believe that the way forward is for the two Governments—the Government of Ireland and the British Government—to work together to this end. Two years ago we moved in that direction when both our Governments accepted  in the context of the Northern Ireland situation  the need to bring forward policies to achieve peace  reconciliation and stability and to improve relations between our two countries. This development and the subsequent progress in identifying concrete areas of co-operation were widely welcomed as holding out the hope of a new and positive relationship between our two countries  breaking down barriers and creating a dialogue of understanding and good will in which the Northern Ireland problem could be effectively tackled.77.	We shall persist in our efforts to win widespread support for our policy which we are convinced offers the only prospect of an effective long-term solution. Our objective is to bring about the emergence in Ireland of agreed political structures which will accommodate the different but complementary Irish traditions.78.	We ask Britain to join with us in working towards the achievement of that objective and  in doing so  remove the last barrier to the development of normal relations between the peoples of the two islands. And we ask all Governments represented here today to assist us on the difficult road towards reconciliation  peace and stability."
"68",3284,"IRN",37,1982,"I quote from the Holy Koran: ""We verily sent our messengers with clear proofs and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance that mankind may observe equality and justice."" I wish to extend by congratulations to yon  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your abilities and merit  as well as your experience in various international fields will no doubt contribute greatly to the solution of important difficulties and problems with which the General Assembly is faced at the present session. I wish success to you and to representatives attending this session-although there exist many signs that can create doubts about the success of this session of the Assembly  because in our tormented world-in which at any moment the disappointing news of the aggressive  expansionist spirit  the violation of rights  oppression and tyranny may be heard from everywhere-there remains little room for hope for this session's success.The outlook for the days ahead and for the international situation is bleak. World tensions are increasing and the arms race  despite the repetition of slogans  is mounting rapidly. Basic and fundamental principles of the Charter are openly being trampled  having been disregarded by certain aggressive and expansionist countries. Poverty and starvation prevail in the oppressed third world countries while the deepening gap between rich and poor countries is widening and the oppressive and unjust relations between the countries providing raw materials and the industrial world are each day worsening. Six hundred million people in the world are suffering from hunger and famine  and each year millions of people die of various diseases.In such conditions  the arms race  which is extended to the other countries of the world by the super-Powers  has destructive effects on the developing and backward countries  which are the main victims of the prevalence of terror in the world; it thus brings those countries to the brink of disaster and annihilation  and leads to the rapid depletion of their natural and human resources. Consequently  such countries  instead of remedying the deprivation of their enslaved masses and providing for their physical and mental welfare  have put all their wealth and resources at the disposal of the avarice and ambitions of the super-Powers.What is more important is that  apart from material and economic poverty  our world today is suffering from cultural poverty  which is far more regrettable than the other difficulties and problems. Lofty human values have been deformed by the greed and avarice of the world-devourers and have fallen victim to false and hollow materialistic criteria. How regrettable it is when we  from our historical experience  come to see that values like freedom  social justice and democracy are being misused  that crimes are being committed in the name of liberty and human rights  that concepts like social liberty and justice have become means of suppression  oppression and tyranny  and that nothing is said about spirituality and religion.  which can and should provide a sole basis of social relations and pave the way for the growth of human society. In fact  apart from all racial  national  linguistic and geographical differences  human beings share a common nature which  if developed  can lead to the attainment of true unity among all the people of the world.Four years ago a revolution took place in Iran which  if I wished to define it in one sentence  I should describe as a development experienced as a result of which the people of Iran were brought back to their God-seeking nature and their own inner selves. Our Revolution is cultural in its nature and qualities and now Islamic culture  which is the same as the revolutionary culture  prevails everywhere in all its dimensions. The Islamic Revolution of Iran  as a movement which has created fundamental changes in our society  laid new foundations in contemporary Iran  the dimensions of the foreign policy of which are resistance to oppression and tyranny  support forthe oppressed nations and the tyrannized masses in the developing countries  non-reliance on foreign Powers  rejection of all forms of domination and being dominated  respect for other countries' sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  on a basis of reciprocity.One of the most important slogans of our Islamic Revolution  ""Neither East nor West""  which is in fact the application on the international scene of the sacred and fundamental words ""There is no God but Allah""  guides our foreign policy and draws its main lines of action. By depending on that slogan we not only rated ourselves from the domination of world- devouring America but also kept ourselves  despite all the difficulties and hardships created for us  from falling into the lap of the other super-Power. We therefore value highly our sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and allow no country to interfere in our internal affairs.Our revolution considers man's prosperity in the whole of human society and the establishment of peace and justice  the supreme objective in relations among nations  to be its ideal  and independence  liberty and justice to be every man's right. It also believes that the breaking of the bonds of the international exploiter's domination is attainable only through the firm determination of the deprived masses and their unity.The struggle against world imperialism and Zionism is a long  hard and complicated one which is not limited to political  economic and military dimensions; the cultural dimension of this struggle is equally important. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will use all its capabilities in this struggle  relying on the lofty teachings of the school of Islam  which fosters man's development.Now  as we speak of the importance of struggling against world imperialism and Zionism  we have in mind the most recent crime against humanity of American imperialism and occupier Zionism committed in the Islamic world  while other Powers remain silent. Thousands of children and innocent  defenseless old women and men have been drenched in blood in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in west Beirut by a group of dishonorable Zionist terrorists  who attacked Moslems in the most terrible manner. This is not the first crime committed by Israel nor will it be the last.The whole world remembers that the Zionist regime since its illegitimate inception  which was the outcome of the imperialist Powers' compromise  and the open usurpation of the Palestinian lands  has never ceased to commit brutal crimes against the Moslem Palestinians being subjected to tyranny. The tragic massacre in the Deir Yassin and Kafr Qasim villages  in which the Irgun terrorist groups killed even the animals  is not yet forgotten. Today we are witnesses to the fact that a person who has committed the most cruel crimes against the people of Palestine has once again  as Prime Minister of the Zionist regime  committed one of the most terrible crimes in human history and  with the full support of American imperialism  revealed to the entire world his wicked nature. Thus the tragedy of the tyrannically treated and deprived people of Palestine and Lebanon entered a new stage  in the midst of a conspiracy of silence by the big Powers and reactionary countries-or possibly amid astonishment caused by so much atrocity and cruelty.136. In the meantime the Zionists and the imperialists  without paying the least attention to the feelings and opinions of the peace-loving peoples of the world  have outdone each other in making impudent comments. While the Zionists are openly justifying their massacre of the tyrannically treated people of Palestine and Lebanon and the total eradication of those nations  and their American masters are expressing satisfaction over the efficiency of their modem weapons in the massacre of the innocent people of Palestine and Lebanon and the destruction of west Beirut  their reactionary mercenaries in the region  following the agreements reached at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  have endorsed the existence of Israel and recognized it.The treason and the compromise of certain unpopular dependent regimes have ensured the success of imperialism and Zionism in expelling the Palestinian combatants from Beirut and scattering them throughout various countries.The massacre of the deprived people of Palestine and the Moslems of west Beirut after the expulsion of the PLO combatants proved the legitimacy of the position we have taken against the expulsion conspiracy. The bitter experience of humanity in 35 years of Zionist usurpation and domination in Palestine has shown that aggression is the innate quality of Israel  and compromise with such an element is disastrous. As we have frequently stated  we can be sure that the Israeli criminals will not content themselves with the massacre of innocent people but will consider that as only a prelude to their great plot to threaten and eliminate the Palestinian cause and establish the influence of world-devouring America over the whole region. Their objective is to convince the countries of the region that plans of the Camp David type and the support of America are the only way to settle the Middle East crisis and that those who do not accept such a solution are doomed to annihilation.We believe that the expulsion of the Palestinian combatants from Lebanon not only is not the end of the affair but will be the beginning of a new phase of the long struggle of the Arab and Moslem nations. Although the existence of hypocritical  reactionary and xenophile rulers in certain countries of the region creates difficulties for the Moslems in the attainment of their sacred objectives  and although these unpopular rulers  with their shameless compromise with America and its illegitimate child  Israel  are a disgrace to Moslems  the forces of the people will rise up and finally demand of their rulers why they remained silent in the face of the cruel massacre of the people of Lebanon and Palestine and did not fulfill their duties in this connection.If the large quantities of arms that have been bought with the riches belonging to the deprived peoples are not to be used today  when Moslems are suffering from such disasters  when should they be used? The Moslem people of such countries have the right to ask why Moslem riches should be used for the purchase of airborne warning and control systems and scores of other types of sophisticated weapons which not only are not used for the protection of Moslem interests but also lead to ever further consolidation of the domination of American imperialism.When will the countries of the Middle East region wake up and come to feel the threat that is menacing the basis of their existence  their independence and their Islamic cultural identity? The Lebanese tragedy is only one example of the destructive qualities of America which have made the political system of that country the greatest threat to human survival.The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  on the basis of its anti-oppression and anti-imperialist qualities and nature and its policy of support for the oppressed nations  which are derived from the lofty teachings of the Koran  once again declares that it strongly supports  within all its possibilities  the rightful and legitimate struggle of the Moslem people of Palestine to return to occupied Palestine and expel and annihilate the usurpers of that land and destroy the basis and foundation of the Israeli regime  which is Zionist racism. Despite our two-year-long involvement in a war imposed on us  we have never failed to fulfil our Islamic and humanitarian duties as regards Palestine and the Middle East issue. Our consistent position in the face of the Zionist regime's aggression against the peoples of Lebanon and Palestine has been to support the oppressed against the oppressor and against oppression. To show our sincerity  suffice it to mention that we entered on the scene of the war against the savage attack by Israel on Lebanon and on Palestinian  Syrian andLebanese combatants and dispatched our forces to the scene of battle against Zionism  despite our serious need for them in the war which had been imposed on us. We took this measure as an Islamic and religious duty. We were the only non-front-line country that embarked on such action against the Zionist regime.We believe that the root solution to the Palestine problem and to the whole Middle East crisis can be found only by placing emphasis on the fact that the problem is an Islamic one and through an endeavor to create a unity of views among Moslem forces. For that reason  the Islamic Republic of Iran has always tried to emphasize the Islamic dimension of the problem  and the proposal made by Iran for the formation of a united Islamic front against Zionism and imperialism is in fact nothing but a way of emphasizing the Islamic nature of the Palestine issue.Just as the Palestinian revolution and the people of Lebanon have been the target of the destructive conspiracies of American imperialism and its agent  the usurper Israel  so the people of Iran  too  have had the experience of plots designed for them by the criminal America. With the victory of the Islamic Revolution of Iran  the interests of world imperialism were seriously endangered and threatened with annihilation  and the political equations and military calculations were totally upset in that part of the world. Therefore it was predictable that the newly established regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran would be attacked from all sides. The aggression by the Iraqi regime against our Islamic homeland  which began in September 198C  was the most important link in the chain of the imperialist conspiracies against our country  the main objective of which was to topple the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was in fact an effort made by imperialism to protect its interests and ambitions and to prevent the spread of the Islamic revolution in that part of the world. From the very first days of the victory of the Islamic Revolution  the Iraqi regime  with a view of paving the way for the implementation of its own evil intentions and the achievement of the imperialist and Zionist objectives  embarked on a course of committing all sorts of crimes and provocations  including sabotage. The expulsion of tens of thousands of the oppressed people of Iraq to Iran; the creation of disturbances against and restrictions on Moslem clergy; attacks on Iranian schools and the imprisonment of teachers  of whose fate nothing is known; the granting of asylum to Iranian anti-revolutionaries; broadcasts of radio programmes in various languages with a view to waging a propaganda war against the Islamic Republic of Iran and  especially  provoking our Arab-speaking fellow countrymen living in the Khuzistan Province into separating that Province from the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran; the assigning of invented Arabic names to Iranian cities; the publication of geographical maps in which parts of Iranian territory were removed and then included in other countries  such as Iraq itself; the dispatch of saboteurs; the strengthening of secessionists and the blowing up of oil pipelines-all those are only a few examples of such actions.The Iraqi regime  which derived no advantage from such crimes  committed with a view to weakening and toppling the Islamic Republic of Iran  started its vast surprise attack on the territory of Iran with the intention of attaining  in addition to that goal  its other goals-namely  the occupation of fertile border lands  and especially the productive Khuzistan Province  obtaining control over the rich oil resources of that Province and gaining sovereignty over the whole Arvand Roud.During the first weeks of the war  the Iraqi regime succeeded  owing to our special internal situation and post-revolutionary conditions  in occupying parts of Iranian territory  but the unyielding resistance of our combatants at the battlefronts very soon made Saddam's regime understand that its calculations had been all wrong. America  with its hopes of toppling the Islamic Government through Saddam's invasion dashed  has now embarked on a more dirty course: the planting of bombs in populous quarters of Tehran  as the result of which hundreds of our innocent fellow-countrymen have been wounded or martyred.The recent explosion in central Tehran  which was similar to previous crimes committed by world imperialism's agents  aroused no reaction on the part of the so-called human rights groups and organizations and once again showed the entire world that such persons and organizations that defend human rights start thinking of their humanitarian duties only when one of the perpetrators of such crimes is punished. Touching confessions made by some of the so- called People's Mujahiddin terrorists and perpetrators of recent explosions in Tehran show that within one month 33 assassinations were committed by one of them and 19 assassinations by another. But the groups and individuals that defend the rights of such persons  when horrible crimes have been committed by these terrorists  forget that the victims of these crimes are also human beings and also have rights. From this rostrum we extend an invitation to all free human beings  to all those who want to discover the truth  to pay a visit to Iran to see for themselves on the spot the enormity of the crimes committed by the agents of American imperialism and bear witness to the wrath and hatred of the masses in their millions.The Iraqi regime  in the course of this war  has not hesitated to commit the full gamut of crimes against the defenseless people  the innocent civilians  of the occupied regions; there is nothing comparable except the crimes committed by the Israeli aggressors in west Beirut. Violation of the women and children of the occupied regions; repeated bombardment of hospitals  schools and government offices; pounding with missiles of the residential areas of large and populous border cities; torture and killing of revolutionary guards  as proved by documents which undeniably exist: those are only a few examples of these innumerable crimes. AH these acts openly violate the Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  its two Protocols of 1977 and the Charter of the United Nations. It is indeed strange that that regime  claiming that the measures taken by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to defend itself violate the principles of the Charter and threaten international peace and security  has now  on the basis of that pretext  requested the inclusion of a new item in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly.171 The Iraqi regime's proposal for a cease-fire and its claims to have withdrawn from Iranian territory are not motivated by that regime's goodwill or the desire to bring the war to an end. Rather  they are an attempt to save itself from the perilous situation it has created in trying to overthrow the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iraqi claim concerning the unilateral establishment of a cease-fire and the cessation of military operations apparently means transferring Iraqi forces to the strategic zones belonging to Iran and pounding the residential areas of Iran from the air and the ground. Here mention should be made of the fact that the ending of the war depends on the fulfilment of all the conditions announced by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the total elimination of Iraqi aggression and its results. If that is not done  Iraq will be responsible for the consequences of the continuation of the war and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be obliged to continue the war until the complete realization of the rights of the Iranian people; it will never give in to the logic of  on military treaties have led to unhealthy and destructive consequences in the course 8f the 37 years since the inception of the United Nations and have constantly kept the entire world on the brink of the abyss of war. During that time  we can think of hardly any period free from regional wars  threats and tension. We therefore believe that the attempts at domination by the super-Powers should be brought to an end by collective action on the part of the dominated countries.We believe that the strengthening of the non- aligned movement  with emphasis on the principles of non-alignment  will pave the way for the liberation of the tyrannized nations from the domination of the super-Powers. We also believe that this movement  as an important political force  can play a constructive role in dealing with the great problems and difficulties facing the world at this juncture.That is precisely why the super-Powers want to weaken  distort and annihilate the movement. Hence  we should struggle with all our might  on the basis of respect for the principles of the movement and inspired by its ideals  against the imperialism of the East and of the West and assist the oppressed and deprived nations to establish a new economic order in the world.In the present circumstances  with the world in a critical and difficult period and the United Nations practically paralyzed and disabled as a result of the attempts at domination by the super-Powers and the existence of the unjust right of veto in the Organization's decision-making process  the role of the non- aligned movement in confronting world crises and tension can be more effective and significant than ever. Under such conditions  member States should place great value on the ideals and principles of the movement and should work towards consolidating it with a view to maintaining its dynamism and vitality as well as its true substance.The sense of responsibility shown by the members of the non-aligned movement as regards the movement's destiny and future in connection with the changing of the venue of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries from Baghdad made us more hopeful than ever about the future of the movement. We believe that that development made the non-aligned movement successful in its historical ordeal and made it better prepared to fulfil its future responsibilities.The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  following the principles of its ideology concerning support for the justice-seeking struggles of the oppressed nations against the oppressors  severed ails its political and economic relations with the racist regime of South Africa from the very first days of the victory of the revolution. We have always condemned and denounced in international circles the policies of the minority racist Government  which hurt the common conscience of human society. The current year has been declared by the United Nations as International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa. We hope that firm and collective measures are taken to solve this difficult problem.While supporting the legitimate rights of the tyrannized people of Namibia  we call for the withdrawal of the occupying forces of the racist Government of South Africa from Namibia and demand that all African revolutionary countries and institutions that have taken part in efforts relating to this problem increase their efforts. Besides  by condemning the suppression of the oppressed black majority of South Africa  who are the principal owners of that land  we declare our all-encompassing support for those freedom fighters. We vehemently condemn the United States and other Western imperialist countries that  in contravention of the United Nations Charter and resolutions  extend military  economic and political support to the racist regime of Pretoria. We support the front-line countries  such as Angola and Mozambique  in their struggle against South Africa. From our standpoint  the conspiracy of world imperialism against the deprived people of the African continent  especially the plot to boycott the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at Tripoli in August  is one of the links in the chain of th3 imperialist plot designed to dominate Moslem and oppressed countries of the world.In connection with the Afghanistan issue  the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the military invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and the imposition of an unwanted regime on the people of that cautery should not be viewed only from the standpoint of the violation of the independence and territorial integrity of the Moslem people of Afghanistan. This aggression has trampled underfoot human honor and the traditions  customs and culture and  most important of all  the faith and religious beliefs of that nation. The Islamic Republic of Iran  as a result of the common culture  language  traditions  history and  most important  the religion it shares with the tyrannized people of Afghanistan  cannot remain silent in the face of this aggression. That was why Iran was the first country to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We consider necessary the complete  unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghanistan  non-intervention by other forces in the internal affairs of that country  the return of the Afghan combatants to their homeland and the restoration to the people of Afghanistan of their right to determine their destiny; without these  there can be no settlement of the Afghanistan issue. In this connection  we reject any negotiation conducted in the absence of the true representatives of the Afghan people.We consistently support the struggles and efforts of the freedom-seeking countries of South and Central America  especially the revolutionary people of Nicaragua  against the interference  conspiracy and attempts at domination by America. We also support the legitimate struggles of revolutionary forces in El Salvador and other countries of the region against the tyranny and oppression of despotic regimes.The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the British military attacks on the Malvinas Islands and the co-operation of America and Britain in that connection  and considers them as an example of imperialist  dominance-seeking policies of colonizers in that part of the world.We support the wish of the Korean people for the reunification of the two Koreas and believe that the presence of American forces in the Korean peninsula is an obastacle to that unity. We call for the withdrawal of imperialist agents from the region.Here  we once again declare our full support for the Sahraoui and Moro liberation movements  as well as other anti-imperialist and liberation movements.The tensions existing between East and West and the rivalry of those two blocs in exploiting the people and resources of third world countries are the cause of many of the present difficulties in the world. The tensions can be eased through disarmament and a freeze on the arms race. But  unfortunately  neither of the super-Powers is prepared to give up its arrogance in the interest of humanity. For this reason international efforts for disarmament and a freeze of the arms race have been deadlocked. As a result  a great part of the manpower and financial capacity of the countries of the world is still being used for the arms race. At a time when millions of people of the third world are suffering from poverty  hunger and disease  each year $650 billion are used for arms manufactured solely for the annihilation of humanity. This is done at a time when  by allocating the budget of several strategic bombers to fighting certain diseases that each year take hundreds of victims from among the deprived peoples  those diseases could be eradicated.The second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  in which much hope had been placed  proved unsuccessful. The failure of that session should be considered not only as a warning for world peace and security but also as a disaster that shows the seriousness of the international situation caused by the aggressive nature and expansionist ambitions of the super-Powers for the maintenance of their domination and influence over other countries of the world. The super-Powers still continue to increase their production of arms and escalate the arms race  and thus brought the last session of the Committee on Disarmament  held at Geneva  to failure.Intensification of the arms race consumes the resources of third world countries that should be used for their prosperity and to end their deprivation. Instead  the profits go to the super-Powers  which substitute confrontation and conflict for amity and understanding in international relations. Therefore it lies with third world countries  thanks to all the experience they have gained from various imperialist strategies  to put an end to the differences created by imperialist forces and  by making use of their financial resources for their national well-being  take the first step for the eradication of this unjust order that has cast its shadow over the world.The serious crisis that dominates the world economy is a deep and structural one. The increased deficit in the balance of payments  the negative changes in the terms of trade  the lack of financial capital for long-term  infrastructural and productive investments  the lack of access to global markets for offers of goods and services  the lack of transfer of technology and  finally  the brain drain only some of the difficulties that third world countries encounter owing to the world economic crisis.The main cause of this crisis is rooted in the unjust capitalist economic order and exploitative policies that world imperialism is implementing for the sake of preserving its material interests and political and cultural hegemony at the international level. The economic and political policies of the Western industrialized countries  particularly those of the United States  are so shortsighted and narrow-minded that they reject the slightest legitimate wish of third world countries even for the smallest change in the oppressive world economic order. Among the measures adopted against third world countries are the negative reactions to the call for negotiations to establish a new international economic order  the creation of a variety of obstacles to the fruitful conclusion of the negotiations for establishing a financial system for the transfer of science and technology to third world countries  postponement of talks and exertion of pressure on other industrialized societies aimed at undermining the talks and causing a deadlock.On the other hand  Western industrialized societies  especially America  by taking advantage of their dominant economic situation  by adopting and implementing oppressive policies  by imposing economic restrictions and sanctions  as well as by employing harsh commercial protective strategies against developing countries  endeavor to prevent the latter's economic  political and social development. By exerting control over international organizations  such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  and by opposing just and basic changes in the management of those organizations  the United States and other Western industrialized countries have persistently tried to impose on third world countries monetary and financial economic policies which protect imperialist interests  without any concern for the existing social and economic conditions and needs in developing countries.By imposing divisive measures and vicious political and economic maneuvers on third world countries  American imperialism  along with other Western industrialized countries  makes every effort to divide third world countries and preserve the oppressive  exploitative economic order. Efforts made to impede multilateral negotiations and collective action are blatant examples of such divisive strategies.We are of the opinion that as long as inhuman and merely materialistic viewpoints dominate the world economic order or the economies of countries and human beings  and organizations and Governments  particularly in Western industrialized countries  are limited to satisfying materialistic and consumer needs  the world economic and political crisis will not only fail to improve but will actually deteriorate. Along with the cancerous increase in consumption and development of the economies of the Western industrialized countries  we shall witness the poverty and economic paralysis of the majority of the peoples of the world. The poverty and economic weakness of third world countries are directly related to the unsound development of the economies of the Western industrialized countries and their wasteful and dissipated use of economic resources. Therefore  we believe that global changes in production  trade and consumption should take place so as to change present world economic relations and order for which man's dignity and honor in relation to the new order should basically be taken into consideration.In the consultative seminar of the South  held in New Delhi  we said that the third world countries should form a united front to co-ordinate their economic policies against the countries of the North. To achieve that objective  the creation of a permanent secretariat to review the difficulties and present proper solutions is vital. We believe that it is only through unity and collective pressure that deprived and economically backward countries can open the way to the initiation of international negotiations  totally and basically to change the world economic relations and order without being influenced by any pressure from the super-Powers. Enough has been said and heard in this connection  and now it is high time to take practical measures.Considering the influence of the super-Powers in the United Nations  the Organization has become a means to exert political pressure on those countries that are struggling against the 'imperialism of the East and West and Zionism. This colossal machine is put in motion only when the interests of one of the big Powers necessitates it. And if a solution is not found  the world will not be far away from international anarchy and chaos. In this connection  many examples can be cited.In September 1980 the Iraqi regime attacked Iran and drowned thousands of innocent civilians in blood  displaced millions of our fellow countrymen and razed the cities located in the part of our territory that had been under its occupation for 22 months. It seems as if in the course of those two years the colossal machine of the United Nations was in a deep sleep and no one was thinking about the establishment of a just and honorable peace  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the maintenance of international security  as stipulated in the Charter. But as soon as our combatants were able by their devotion and selflessness and the sacrifice of thousands of men  to expel the aggressive enemy from most of their soil  they embarked on the course of administering justice and ensuring the security of the borders. And then  all of a sudden  the mission of the super-Powers for the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security was propounded. It is not known where these awakened consciences and missions were during the two years that had passed since the beginning of the war and the oppression and tyranny to which the people of Iran were subjected. Is it not the case that now that the interests of the superpowers  which supported the Iraqi regime with their money and weapons  are threatened  the members of the Security Council have started to think about adopting a resolution  commiserating about peace and including an item in this connection in the agenda of the General Assembly?I shall give a better example. On 18 September 1982 one of the most shocking crimes in human history was committed in Beirut before the very eyes of the world and the United Nations. Israeli criminals  assisted by mercenary phalangists  having committed crimes in southern Lebanon for several months and despite their false promises that they would not occupy west Beirut  attacked that area and slaughtered hundreds of defenseless and unarmed Palestinian and Lebanese men  women and children. If the United Nations and its Members firmly believed in the mission stipulated in the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security  they would have had to take measures-if only because of the wounded international conscience-to punish that seed of evil- doing  insecurity  warmongering and aggression  within the context of Chapter VII of the Charter. Perhaps it is forgotten that Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter even exist. Is it not one of the conditions for membership in the Organization that a Member must be peace-loving? Did not the General Assembly in its resolution ES-7/4 of 30 April 1982 recognize Israel to be non-peace-loving? The provisions of Article 6 of the Charter suffice to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then why is warmongering Israel still a Member of the United Nations? If proper action is not taken in this case or in similar cases  the concept of collective action for the maintenance of peace and security  contained in the Charter  will not be applied. And if serious measures are not taken in this case for the elimination of the unjust privilege of veto  the confidence that the deprived and tyrannized nations of the world should have in the Organization will not be created and the shortcomings to which the Secretary- General has referred in his report will not be eliminated. We should not forget that the Charter and its monopolistic privileges are the outcome of the post-Second-World-War situation  much of which no longer pertains  and the international atmosphere and the United Nations structure have changed too. Nor can international law  on the basis of the principle of unilateral and unequitable privileges that have proved to be destructive. We hope for the day when Member States  with realism and understanding of this fundamental development  will bestow upon the United Nations the role that benefits it."
"69",3331,"IRQ",37,1982,"It is  Sir  a pleasure to express to you on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq and on my own behalf warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am sure that you will conduct the proceedings of this session with all the wisdom and knowledge you are known for  and I wish you success in discharging the duties of your high post. May I also express our appreciation for the Great Spirit of co-operation which the General Assem¬bly showed Mr. Kittani  President of the thirty-sixth session. We are satisfied that he enjoyed the confidence and appreciation of this esteemed body  which made it possible for him to perform his functions most efficiently at the last session. I would also take this opportunity to express whole-hearted congratulations and best wishes for success to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as Secretary-General. I am confident that he will be able to fulfill the functions of his distinguished post and to deal with momentous international events requiring him to exercise all the virtues of knowledge  patience and wisdom for which he is known.67.	The world is going through a delicate and fright¬ening era unprecedented since the Second World War. Undoubtedly the tense world situation  with all the grave consequences that could flow from such a state of affairs  is being steadily exacerbated because of the intensifying rivalry among the great Powers  which jeopardizes world security and peace and disturbs the confidence of peoples and their aspira¬tions to achieve detente and peaceful coexistence. This hazardous phenomenon engulfs the third world coun¬tries  particularly the non-aligned ones. It presents them with the dangers of confrontation and the devastating effects of tensions  and it threatens to expand the centers of polarization by luring third world nations and bringing pressure to bear upon them in a bid to exhaust material and human resources that otherwise would be used to achieve security  stability and development for those nations.68.	What the great Powers and colonial States are reluctant to accept is the fact that the non- aligned nations  which forced their way to freedom and sovereignty through decades of struggle and a deter¬mination to achieve full independence and to exer¬cise their free will  are determined not to form part of military blocs that are engaged in global conflict and to steer clear of the currents generated by the centers of polarization. No wonder  then  that conflict persists between the non-aligned movement on the one side and colonialism  including Zionism  on the other.69.	Iraq  being a non-aligned State  backs the policy of independence which any State might pursue. It maintains that all States should manage their affairs on the basis of the fundamental principles of the United Nations and in accordance with their legitimate national interests that are compatible with those principles  regardless of the requirements of bloc policies and cold war. That would serve the cause of maintaining world peace and encouraging the trend towards progress and freedom  as well as political and economic independence  and the cause of extending the principles of justice and equality to all nations  regardless of size  affiliation and of any power con¬siderations.70.	Iraq abides by the principles of non-alignment and wishes to advance the non-aligned movement  to maintain a sound relationship among its members and to promote its effective role in international relations. Iraq is also determined to implement those principles in order to ensure security  justice and economic well-being. Thus  over 10 years ago  Iraq offered to host the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Baghdad. Indeed  it was those very principles which prompted Iraq not to insist that the Conference be held at the scheduled time and place  despite the elaborate preparations made for it  including the drafting of relevant declarations and documents  and despite the fact that all the administrativeand technical requirements had been met. Iraq had earlier sent out invitations to all heads of State or Government of countries of the movement and  in fact  had received answers accepting the invitation from the great major¬ity of them. Thus  Iraq honored all its obligations towards the movement and the Seventh Conference.71.	What should  however  be emphasized in this regard is that Iraq did not  from the outset  present its bid to host that non-aligned conference in order to gain publicity or as a national objective. Rather  Iraq's initiative came to underscore its international good name  not to create one by so doing. Iraq viewed the matter with a sense of responsibility and concern for the well-being of the movement  both at present and in the future  for non aligned principles constitutes a major component of our foreign policy and we believe that the strength and dignity of Iraq are identi¬cal to the strength and dignity of the movement.72.	Being proud of our commitment to the movement and anxious about its future and the development of its capability to face world events and in order to avoid possible division in the ranks of the movement's members  we declared our intention not to insist on holding the Seventh Conference in Iraq  as we recog¬nized that some circles within the movement took seriously  either in good faith or otherwise  the black¬mail and attempts at obfuscation carried out by Iran. There is no doubt that Iran's behavior simply demonstrates the short-sightedness of the rulers of Iran and their ignorance concerning the importance of the non-aligned movement and their lack of belief in ft. One cannot rule out the possibility that Iran's objective is to undermine and weaken the movement and to diminish its role as an effective Power in inter¬national relations by resorting to blackmail and threats as well as by encouraging the enemies of the movement to belittle it.73.	The non-aligned movement considers the ques¬tion of Palestine to be its problem and is committed to supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people to realize their inalienable national rights. It empha¬sizes that that struggle is one of the responsibilities of the non-aligned countries. Obviously  the question o? Palestine is at the core of the Middle East problem and represents the essence of the Arab-Zionist con¬flict. Unless a just  comprehensive and lasting solu-tion is found that is acceptable to the Palestinian people and satisfies their national aspirations  peace cannot be established in the area and a state of con¬tinuous conflict will persist  with all its continuing implications for world peace and security. Meanwhile  lot it be known that might no matter how over¬whelming  will not dampen the zeal of patriotism and will not suppress the revolutionary urge of the people. Therefore  to achieve genuine peace in the area  the Zionist entity must withdraw unconditionally from all occupied Arab territories and the estab¬lished inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to return to their homeland  Palestine  should be restored as should their properties  their right to exercise self-determination and their right to establish their own independent  fully sover¬eign State. Moreover  Jerusalem must be recognized as part of occupied Palestinian territory and the Zionist entity must withdraw from it. There should also be recognition of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and it should be enabled to exercise its right to participate in all conferences and activities relating to the question of Palestine on an equal footing and standing with all parties concerned. Further  existing Zionist settle¬ments on Arab territories must be removed  and the policy of establishing new ones there must be discon¬tinued. In addition  confiscation of Arab land must cease.74.	The latest form of brutal aggression by the military forces of the Zionist entity was the war of mass annihilation against the PLO and the helpless  homeless refugees in camps in various parts of Leba¬non. That war was launched in the first week of last June and continued through the last week of August. There then took place a massacre such as has never been witnessed in modem times. Those racist mali¬cious forces brought destruction to all the towns and villages of southern Lebanon and slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians and Lebanese  who were buried under debris in mass graves. Those forces wrought devastation and havoc in that part of Lebanon  which is an independent neutral State  a founding member of both the United Nations and of the non-aligned movement. The forces of the Zionist enemy unleashed the burning fire of its military machine from land  air and sea at Palestinian refugee camps  killing unarmed children  women and the elderly  destroying plantations and reducing buildings and houses to rubble. Those forces pursued their crimes in west Beirut and its suburbs  exposing their latent hatred to the extent of cutting off water  medi¬cine  food and electricity from the residents while bombarding the city with heavy artillery and con¬tinuing air and sea attacks for many hours daily for several weeks. Many shells and rockets were fired indiscriminately at residential communities and civilian installations  causing the loss of thousands of human lives; it will not be possible to assess the amount of property destroyed for a long time.75.	The barbaric invading forces did not stop at genocide and brutal acts committed throughout Lebanon. They also organized a massacre in Beirut on 16 September 1982. Over 3 000 unarmed Palestinians were annihilated for no reason except that they were Palestinians. This racist massacre outraged the entire world  including even the traditional friends of the perpetrators. The damage at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps is a disgraceful stain on the history of mankind that will never be forgotten. The inter¬national community is called upon to take  through the international organs of the United Nations  the appropriate deterrent measures  to condemn cate¬gorically the actions and policies of the Zionist entity  to impose sanctions that are proportionate to its horrifying acts  and to consider seriously disqualifying it as a Member of the Organization  for its presence here constitutes a challenge to the Charter as well as to all human norms and conduct.76.	The Foreign Minister of the Zionist entity declared on 6 September 1982 that the condition which his Government set for withdrawal of its forces from southern Lebanon and the termination of its military occupation of the area was agreement by Lebanon to sign a peace treaty with the Zionist entity. He also said that certain agreements needed to be introduced regarding southern Lebanon  to ensure the security of the State of Israel. At the same time  the Zionist Minister of Defense declared that the invading forces would remain deployed in southern Lebanon for at least 15 years. In our view  such a condition and determination illustrates the intention of the Zionist entity to proceed with its expansionist plan of annexing parts of southern Lebanon  including control of the Litani River and other water resources  as one further step towards the realization of Zionist ambitions for the establishment of Greater Israel.77.	Hence  in view of this grave situation  we believe that the United Nations should live up to its respon¬sibilities and stand firmly by the side of Lebanon as a free  independent and fully sovereign State and a founding Member of the United Nations  and should ensure the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist entity behind the Lebanese borders. Also  the Security Council  in particular  should take appropriate action to eliminate aggression against Lebanon should the Zionist entity refuse to withdraw immediately and unconditionally from Lebanese territory. In our view  the appropriate action which the Security Council should take is the imposition of deterrent sanctions against the Zionist entity. Fore¬most among such sanctions should be the suspension of its membership in the Organization and the imposition of a comprehensive embargo against it. This would  of course  require a show of will by the United States to act seriously in the exercise of its responsibilities as a great Power claiming to have an interest in the question of security and peace and alleging concern for the good name of the United Nations. It is indeed high time for the American Administration to recognize- that its policy towards the Arab Zionist conflict are not serve the interests of the American people and is in contradiction with their renowned traditions. Thus it is incumbent upon the United States Government to uphold justice and equity and to display courage and political will  free from the pressure of the Zionist minority.78.	The danger of the Zionist entity in the Middle East is not limited to aggression committed at such time and place as it might deem proper in order to achieve its colonial expansionist goals  thus jeopar¬dizing peace in the area and impeding the development programmes required for the resurgence of the Arab nation and its economic and social progress. In fact it goes beyond all that to threaten to continue its intensive effort in developing the Zionist nuclear program for military purposes and using it against the Arab countries. It is no longer a secret that the Zionist entity has now acquired a number of nuclear bombs and weapons  with the relevant systems to direct and deliver them against any part of the Arab world. It is indeed regrettable that no great Power has paid serious attention to this imminent danger which threatens more than the Middle East. The great Powers cared neither about the non-accession by the Zionist entity to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons nor about its non¬compliance with the Treaty safeguards. Furthermore  the Zionist entity refused to allow IAEA to carry out inspection measures in regard to the Zionist nuclear reactors and programmes. Thus the Zionists were encouraged by this to escalate and intensify their aggression against the Arab nation  as they had learned from repeated experience that any aggres¬sion committed by them would pass without serious attention being paid to it by the great Powers  espe¬cially the United States of America  and would not result in any sanctions or other practical action  regardless of the dimensions of the aggression and even if it involved human loss.79.	The clearest evidence proving the deliberate cover-up of the repeated Zionist acts of aggression by some great Powers and their failure to shoulder their responsibilities was the raid by Zionist planes of American manufacture on 7 June 1981 on the Iraqi nuclear installations  despite the fact that those instal¬lations  as certified by IAEA  were meant for strictly peaceful purposes and were subject to regular inter¬national inspection.80.	Iraq firmly adheres to the principles of the Charter which call for the policy of the charter which use of force  settlement of international dispute by peaceful means and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. Although Iraq strove to establish good relations with Iran after the fall of the Shah's regime  all cur endeavors were in vain in persuading rulers of Iran to cease their acts of provocation  aggression ant3 interference in our internal affairs  as well as to fulfill their international obligations towards Iraq.81.	That remained our approach in dealing with Iran even after it started its armed aggression against Iraq on 4 September 1980. Since that day  the Presi¬dent of the Republic of Iraq. Mr. Saddam Hussein  has stressed the fact that we look forward to enjoying relations of good-neighborliness with the countries of the region  including in particular Iran  and that Iraq has neither any territorial ambitions in Iran nor any intention of waging war against it  nor does Iraq intend to expand the scope of the conflict with Iran beyond the defense of its rights and sovereignty. But the armed Iranian aggression against us has continued at an intense level to this very day  while the Iranian regimehas declined to respond in a spirit of constructive co-operation to any of the international endeavors to settle the dispute and has turned down all the peaceful initiatives put forward by Iraq to reach a just and honorable solution. The rulers of Iran favor the continuance of aggression  and that can only be interpreted as evidence of their desire for expansion at the expense of our country; as at first stage  to be followed by Iran's overrunning the Arab countries of the Gulf region  including Saudi Arabia  for the purpose of colonial expansion and the con¬solidation of a reactionary regime and in order even¬tually to force our region back into the Dark Ages  in which racism and religious intolerance would reign supreme.82.	Our peace initiatives with Iran were submitted at a meeting of the Security Council on 12 July of this year  at which meeting the Council adopted resolution 3 64 (1982). Iraq welcomed that resolution  whereas Iran rejected it. It is well known that between the eve of the adoption of that resolution and 30 July the Iranian regime launched a series of massive military acts of aggression against Iraqi territory to the east of Basra  an account of which is contained in docu¬ment A/37/428. It should be recalled here that the Arab countries took a unified position in support of Iraq at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held in Fez early this September  after the expansionist intentions of the Iranian regime had become crystal¬lized in a tangible fashion. The Arab Summit Con¬ference adopted a clear and firm decision expressing the Arab countries' support for and solidarity with Iraq and their willingness to implement the Common Defense Pact of the members of the League of Arab States. The entire region would be in a new and dangerous situation were the Iranian regime to proceed further with its plan. We should like to draw the attention of the world public to th s development  which is obviously fraught with potential dangers. The full responsibility for the consequences of a possible confrontation between Iran and the Arab States as a whole would therefore be Iran's alone.83.	At a time when efforts to settle the dispute and stop the fighting are being made by the United Nations  which is a source of hope in all peace-loving nations  the Iranian regime is carrying out a further act of aggression against the central sector of Iraq. By the morning of 1 October 1982 Iran had made four large- scale attacks. The Security Council discussed this matter on 4 October and unanimously adopted resolution 322 (1982)  in which the Council recalled its two earlier resolutions and urged Iran once again to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations by settling the dispute by peaceful means and emulating Iraq's co-operative attitude to the Council.84.	My delegation will explain to the General Assem¬bly in detail the peace initiatives Iraq has taken in order to reach a just and honorable settlement of the dispute with Iran when the Assembly debates agenda item 134  entitled Consequences of the prolongation of the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq . At this juncture  I should like to say that Iraq has given adequate proof of its good intentions and of its. Sincere desire to see peace and security estab-lished m our region  which is of significant importance to international peace and security. The rejection by the rulers of Iran of all peace initiatives indicates that they lack a sense of responsibility for security and stability in the area  and this could exacerbate the disturbances and tension there  lead to an escalation of the conflict and jeopardize international peace and security. I would also like to stress that should Iran continue its intransigence and its rejection of the call for peace and persist in its aggression  Iraq would inevitably have to resist that aggression by all the means available to it in the exercise of its legitimate right to self-defense. In the mean time  we believe that the Iraq-Iran dispute warrants the General Assembly's maximum attention and care  since it represents a test of its will and of the strength of the Charter. By the same token  any success in this endeavor will enhance the chances of peace and will prevent further deterioration of the situation in that sensitive and dangerous part of the world.85. Racial crimes  including the policies of Zionism and political doctrines based on racial discrimination are still being committed in many parts of the world  in spite of the fact that such crimes violate the Charter  the principles of non-alignment and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although the Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is now drawing towards its end  and although it has produced some positive results  certain regimes—especially the Zionist entity and the racist minority regime in South Africa—still refuse to accede to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of In this regard  a more serious position against them should be adopted  with stronger condemnation  in order that the peoples of South Africa and Namibia  along with all the liberation movements in Africa and Latin America  may achieve their aspirations to freedom  inde¬pendence and self-determination.36. It is important to recall that the reactionary racist regime in South Africa violates all values  and that it was owing to its antagonistic stand that the most recent meeting  held at Geneva  on the imple¬mentation of the United Nations plan for the inde¬pendence of Namibia proved abortive. We must also mention the conclusions of the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  which was held in Paris in 1981  and commend the declara¬tions it adopted/ which  in keeping with the Charter  reject racist concepts.87.	Furthermore  we should like to draw attention to the fact that a number of Western countries  and the Zionist entity  boycotted that humanitarian con¬ference. While the great majority of the States Mem¬bers of the United Nations supported General Assem¬bly resolution 36/172  which calls for comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter against the racist regime in Pretoria  the same group of Western countries and the Zionist entity continue to take negative positions. That confirms their collusion with the racist regime in South Africa and their deal¬ings with it in the economic  trade  diplomatic and military areas  as well as the development and co-ordination of joint action with that regime in the nuclear field  including the production of enriched uranium. Obviously  such behaviour on the part of Western countries and the Zionist entity constitutes a flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 418 (1977) and of the relevant General Assembly resolu¬tions  and encourages the racialist regime in Pretoria to pursue its policy of aggression against the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  and to disregard any action  even if adopted by the overwhelming majority of Members of the United Nations.88.	The practices of the racial minority regime in Pretoria are not limited only to the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  but also include the artificial creation of crises and other conditions  as well as the recruit¬ment of mercenaries to commit military aggression against many independent peaceful African States  especially Angola  Zambia  Zimbabwe  Lesotho  Swaziland and Seychelles. Apart from violating the security and sovereignty of the countries of the region such acts of aggression always result in the killing of large numbers of unarmed civilians and poor peasants and in the destruction of their homes and farms.89.	We therefore appeal to the international commu¬nity  and especially to the Western countries which are permanent members of the Security Councill  not to block the efforts made to put an end to the aggres¬sion by the racial minority in South Africa  through the imposition of legitimate sanctions against that regime under Chapter VII of the Charter.90.	The world economy is passing through a very serious stage  in which a heavy burden is being placed on the developing countries in particular. The dimen¬sions of the situation are reflected in: receding eco¬nomic activity and growth; increasing balance-of- payments deficits in the developing countries and a decline in the prices of their export commodities; rising unemployment figures; monetary inflation; the adverse effects of high rates of interest in the world markets on foreign loans to the developing coun¬tries; a weakening of the flow of multilateral assist¬ance on favorable conditions; dwindling supplies of foodstuffs; increasing protectionism exercised by the industrial countries against exports of the developing countries; harsh and unfavorable conditions for the transfer of technology to the developing world; deliberate control of raw material prices with adverse effects on the terms of trade of the developing countries; and the recurrent application of irrespon¬sible concepts  such as gradualism  selectivity and discrimination  which are being introduced by the industrial nations in their trade transactions with the developing world. AH those factors impede the efforts made by the developing countries to secure their economic growth  to continue interest payments on their foreign debts and to meet their basic needs for imported goods.91.	The developing countries sought seriously and sincerely to maintain a constructive dialogue with the industrialized countries in a bid to restructure the world economy on just and balanced terms. But the industrial nations were not responsive to such endeavors and initiatives. On the contrary  some of them even opposed any international action to improve the world economic situation. Among the vital issues raised by the developing countries was the initiation of global economic talks within the frame¬work of the United Nations. Ever since the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  held in 1980  obstacles have remained in the way of initiating those important and essential negotiations. There¬fore  Iraq and all other developing countries support the call for starting those talks as early as possible  and we urge all States that oppose them to reconsider their positions in the interests of us all.92.	The Group of 77 this year submitted constructive and moderate proposals to resolve the question of starting such negotiations  but those proposals did not suit some industrial nations.93.	The problems of debts and cash liquidity which face the developing countries have become so dan¬gerous and pressing as to require an overall solution. In our judgment  the industrial countries bear great responsibility in this connection. At their recent annual meeting the World Bank and IMF recommended some measures to alleviate the financial burden weigh¬ing on the developing countries. Those measures  however  do not go far in addressing the essence of the problem  a problem which is due basically to the failure of the existing world monetary system to develop along with the changes that have been taking place since the Second World War. Moreover  those measures constituted a mere reaction to the crisis  which is assuming intolerable dimensions  and there fore cannot be considered as remedial measures in the true sense of the word.94.	Iraq was among the first countries to diagnose the nature of the economic problems that are plaguing the world. That is why the President of the Republic of Iraq has proposed the establishment of a world fund for long-term assistance to developing countries. The proposed fund would help them to cope both with the effects of inflation passed on to them by the industrial countries  and with the increasing bill for their oil imports. This vital plan  which was wel¬comed at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Havana in 1979  was the subject of extensive discussion by experts of the Group of 77 at a meeting they held at Baghdad in March 1982. An outline of the fund was drawn up and later approved by the co-ordination and follow-up Committee of the Group of 77  which met at Manila in August this year. That Committee decided to recommend the inclusion of the Iraqi proposal in the list of items to be discussed in the global negotiations. We now trust that the industrial¬ized countries will seriously consider this plan  which we hope will eventually be translated into action.95.	Economic co-operation among the developing countries has undoubtedly become more important in recent years. Iraq  as a developing country  views this matter as a major component of its foreign policy  and it contributes to many regional and international funds. We also try to help to enhance and promote such co-operation through bilateral agreements. I should like to recall in this regard that the High- Level Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries held in Caracas in 1981 approved an overall program for such co-operation and that the developing countries are in the process of implementing it.96.	We catll upon all the industrial nations and the international institutions to take all possible action to ensure a constant and increasing flow of assistance to the developing world to help to maintain that co-operation. At this point we must emphasize  however  that the expansion of economic co-operation among the developing countries does not relieve the industrial countries of their responsibilities towards the devel¬oping nations."
"70",3378,"ISL",37,1982,"As we come to this session of the General Assembly  the international situation is in some respects more serious than it has been since the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the Organization. The quantity of armaments is much greater  weapons are more devastating  hunger more severe  destitution more extensive  and the curse of unemployment more far- reaching than ever before since the establishment of the Organization. We have certainly made some gains and that we must not forget. But much more glaring are the cases where success has been limited  or when no results at all were achieved. I intend to deal with a few of those aspects here.283.	When I addressed the General Assembly in September 1981 meeting  I referred to a number of provisions of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I compared the words to the deeds. In the past year there has been a continual deterioration in these matters in many parts of the world. Amongst the most serious events are those in the Middle East and in Poland  although they are different in nature. But  regrettably  a number of further examples could be cited.284.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General raises a matter of great concern  namely  the increased lack of respect for Security Council resolutions. I endorse whole-heartedly his words of warning that we are perilously near to international anarchy. The structure of the Organization  and in particular the veto  has been both its strength and its weakness. Changes in that basic structure could result in the collapse of the Organization  and therefore I do not regard such changes as being open to debate. But it is evident that the ability of the United Nations to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes is virtually non-existent when a State with veto powers perceives its direct or indirect interests threatened by actions of the Organization. Such situations occur more and more frequently. In addition  there is an increasing tendency by other States to feel that they are strong enough to defy the unanimous decisions of the Security Council. They are confident that the unity of purpose of the Organization is not such that words will be translated into action. That trend must be reversed. It cannot be achieved by amending the Charter of the United Nations but  rather  as a result of nations becoming increasingly cognizant of the danger to world peace if those developments continue.285.	At the recent meeting of the Nordic Foreign Ministers  the strong support of the Nordic countries was reaffirmed for the United Nations and for measures aimed at settling international disputes by peace-ful means  in accordance with the principles of the Charter concerning respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all States. In that context an appeal was made to all States to respect the internationally accepted rules guiding relations between States. It was declared that the Nordic countries would continue to work to strengthen the United Nations as a universal organization for peace. Further-more  the ministers were in agreement on the need to examine and to discuss with other States measures which could strengthen the ability of the Organization to act in conflicts and crises. I draw attention to those statements of the Nordic Foreign Ministers and reiterate the appeal contained therein.286.	The situation in the Middle East has been discussed in the United Nations from its inception. But still we seem far from a peaceful solution of these disputes  which constantly poison the atmosphere and cause the inhabitants of the region suffering and death. That tragedy culminated in the massacre in the refugee camps in Beirut earlier this month. All those who wish to uphold respect for the Charter must insist on an independent investigation of that crime as soon as possible.287.	The invasion of Lebanon by Israel is one more episode in a long history of revenge and retaliation in the Middle East. At the same time  it is a tragic example of the disrespect for Security Council deci-sions to which I have referred. I declare my full support for the United Nations resolutions condemning the invasion and occupation of Lebanon by Israel and its refusal to abide by the Security Council resolutions.That behavior increases the difficulty of attaining a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the disputes in this area. Such a solution must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and must safeguard the security of all States in the region  including Israel  and ensure justice for all peoples  including the Palestinians. In that connection  I would also emphasize in particular the necessity for realizing the legitimate national rights of the Palestinians through the exercise of their right to self- determination  including their right to participate in negotiations on their own future.288.	I welcome the proposals for a solution of the major problems in the Middle East which have been put forward by the President of the United States and the Arab Summit Conference. It is still too soon to predict whether those proposals can form a basis for negotiations by all the parties  but I sincerely hope that they will. Indeed  many elements of both proposals are worthy of further consideration.289.	I should like to turn briefly to a number of other questions  questions which are the most blatant examples of the disrespect for the equality  sovereignty and political independence of all nations. These are principles which should be respected under the Charter of the United Nations but which are in fact disregarded in practice when the more powerful States perceive their interests to be better served thereby.290.	The situation in Afghanistan has not improved since we met here one year ago. The military occupation has now lasted nearly three years. Efforts continue with limited success to force the submission of the people and compel them to resign themselves to the situation. Repeated United Nations resolutions are disregarded. Much the same can indeed be said of war- torn Kampuchea.291.	Just over two years ago  new waves of freedom spread through Polish society. The people sought a greater voice in their own affairs. Agreements were reached with the authorities on a slight relaxation of controls and the establishment of free trade unions was allowed. These tendencies towards freedom were to be short-lived. They ended with the imposition of martial law on 13 December 1981.292.	A list of this kind could be long. There are many States which suffer under totalitarianism and oppression where the principles of the Charter are ignored.293.	While such situations recur at short intervals  it is extremely difficult to lower the tension in international relations and to proceed to effective and realistic measures to promote and preserve peace and security in accordance with the fundamental aims of the Organization. Such measures are indeed essential now.294.	The quantity of armaments is of a much greater dimension and weapons are more menacing than those the world has ever seen before; but still the frantic arms race continues. The debate on who is the most powerful could no doubt go on a J in/M/Mm. In fact  the debate would probably not be resolved unless the unthinkable should happenóthat the big Powers put the matter to the test. It is not likely that many would be left to judge the outcome  and the winner would not be in a very much more enviable position than the loser. The weapons of mass destruction can at any time bring total devastation to mankind. The nuclear Powers carry a heavy burden. They are  indeed  responsible for the fate of the world.295. Mankind has but one option. The only alternative which would not sooner or later lead to destruc-tion is effective and genuine agreements on arms reduction as a first step on the long road to total disarmament  which should beóindeed must beóthe vision of those who believe in the high principles of the Charter.2%. The demand for realistic action on disarmament is more pronounced now than it has been for a long time. In that light  it is tragic to have to admit that the second special session on disarmament yielded practically no results. We must therefore hope and trust that concrete results will be achieved in the negotiations between the United State s and the Soviet Union on reducing stockpiles of a number of the main types of nuclear weapons  in the negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions and in the work of the Committee on Disarmament and  of course  at the Madrid Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  should it result in an agreement on a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. The implementation of disarmament must be based on reciprocity. Anything else would be neither realistic nor justifiable. The aim should be to achieve a balanceónot a balance of terror  but a balance based on a reduction  not an increase  of arms.297.	As a representative of an island nation which depends for its existence on the living resources of the sea  I am bound to express grave concern about the increased armaments in the oceans and  in particular  the enlarged fleets of submarines armed with nuclear weapons. Even in peacetime  an accident under adverse conditions could destroy the economic basis of such nations. Thus I would emphasize that the proper response to the opposition of people in continental Europe and America to an even greater increase in the number of nuclear missiles in their countries is not to move these weapons to the oceans but  rather  to agree to a real reduction. Only thus will the threat posed by such weapons be diminished.298.	As regards the law of the sea  I would call on those countries which are still not prepared to agree to the Convention to reconsider their position. Through the participation of all nations in the Convention on the Law of the Sea  we can avoid severe conflicts between individual States on various law-of-the-sea issues and thus take an important step towards the world structure to which we aspire in the Charter.299.	Earlier  I dealt particularly with States and their relations with other States and the lack of respect which is all too often evident in those relations. It is a fact that it is usually the individual human being who is the victim in such circumstances  although in the name of safeguarding the interests of one State against another. But it is the responsibility of each Stateóand indeed an obligation undertaken by all the States Members of the United Nationsóto ensure respect for the individual and for human rights. That obligation is unfortunately not complied with by a large number of Governments which here represent the inhabitants of their countries. This is even true of many Governments which in other respects abide by their international obligations.300.	In referring to fundamental human rights  I include therein the right of every human being to an equitable share in the world's resources. Other human rights are of little avail to those with no prospects but starvation. It must therefore be one of the principal aims of the Organization to strive to ensure that every child bom in this world has sufficient food and health care and education in accordance with his or her ability. The mottes of this session of the General Assembly might  indeed  be decreased hunger  lower military expenditures and increased respect for international obligations."
"71",3425,"ISR",37,1982,"May I join the representatives who have preceded me in this debate in offering to the President their congratulations on his unanimous election to the high office of President and to you  Sir  to that of Vice-President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My delegation trusts that the President will guide this session with fairness and wisdom. I have noted with great interest the contents of his thoughtful statement at the opening of this session  and especially his cogent reference to:  the inclusion in the agenda of items on so-called crisis situations that produced nothing but sterile debate and diverted attention from the real crises threatening the world with an escalation of the conflict .58.	The annual general debates at the General Assembly provide an occasion for surveying the state of the world  the working of the international system during the preceding year and for a public airing of the hopes and concerns  the expectations and anxieties of our nations. Such a survey will show that the prospects for a better life and for peace for the peoples of the world have hardly been advanced this past year  while new difficulties have been added to the old unresolved problems.59.	Major international problems of an economic  social and military nature have also grown at a rapid rate  and the international system has not been able to cope with them. Many essential problems have not reached the United Nations agenda at all. With regard to others with which the United Nations did engage itself  its contribution has been far from encouraging. Thus  universal disappointment has been caused this year by the failure of the special session on disarmament and the stalemate in the North-South dialogue.60.	The world scene is constantly threatened by simmering conflicts  some of which remain dormant for the time being while others are on the verge of eruption  their solutions eluding international statesmanship.61.	In Afghanistan  the aggressive invasion  occupation and strife continue unabated. A permanent member of the Security Council continues to ignore numerous United Nations resolutions.62.	In both the Horn of Africa and Western Sahara conflicts persist  and the seeds of future violence and bloodshed are being sown with no success achieved through international efforts to defuse those potential volcanoes.63.	Kampuchea remains occupied by Vietnamese troops who have disregarded calls for a withdrawal by the United Nations  ASEAN and other bodies.64.	Only recently we witnessed the violent eruption of the old conflict over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Although the United Nations has been involved for years in the question of the sovereignty over those islands  it was unable to prevent war or to stop it.65.	In our region instability is endemic. It arises from a variety of causes  which must be recognized for what they are. In most countries great poverty exists alongside the immense wealth of some of the oil- producing States. Some Governments are alarmed at the rise of fanatical fundamentalist movements. Most countries are governed by regimes that retain absolute power in their hands  and any expression of criticism or opposition is ruthlessly suppressed. Talk of Arab solidarity and unity often conceals or is refuted by a reality of constant strife  tension and friction between neighbouring States.66.	The Moody and senseless war between Iraq and Iran rages on. It has already exacted many thousands of casualties and consumed several scores of billions of dollars which could well have been utilized for development and social progress.67.	Lebanon is beginning to emerge from a seven- year-old conflict in which the Lebanese were occupied and ravaged by their Syrian neighbors and their unwelcome guests  the terrorists of the PLO.68.	I do not mention these conflicts and the chronic instability which produces them in a spirit of criticism or denigration. They are part of the reality with which everyone concerned with durable peace and security in the Middle East has to contend. No magic formula can change this situation or solve the problems that created it.69.	Nevertheless  there are those who suggest  whether out of naivety  ignorance or ill intent  that a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute would bring peace and stability throughout the Middle East region. The recent events in Lebanon alone demonstrate the fallacy of this suggestion. Some Arab Governments could not resist the temptation to utilize the services of terrorist organizations to settle their scores with other Governments. A small defenseless State  Lebanon  with a weak Government  became an ideal battleground for this purpose. This was compounded by Syria's designs on Lebanon's independence and integrity. The resultant explosion had little or no connection with the Arab-Israeli conflict. The same applies to the Iraq-Iran conflict  the tension between Jordan and Syria and the endless disputes between Libya and the rest of the Arab world.70.	It is frequently claimed that the fault lies  not in the United Nations system  but in its Members  that the Organization merely reflects their failings. This is of course true  but it is equally true that a system which encourages contention rather than compromise  boycott rather than co-operation  confrontation rather than negotiation  hardly meets the needs of a world as diverse as ours in race  religion  culture and social and political practice.71.	Particularly and unnecessarily disruptive is the undue politicization of the United Nations specialized agencies. Instead of devoting themselves to the social  humanitarian  scientific and technical tasks which they were set up to perform and which most of them perform well when allowed to do so  these agencies are only too frequently subverted and misused for partisan interests. Can it be doubted that this is one of the causes for the failure of the United Nations system to contribute effectively towards halting the crises and deterioration in the world economy?72.	I feel that it is appropriate for me at this juncture to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  who has provided us with much food for thought in his provocative and imaginative report on the work of the Organization. I represent a country which most certainly can be said to be reluctant  to resort to the Security Council or to use the machinery of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has cogently set out the reasons. I can assure him that the Government of Israel will support constructive and effective measures advancing the prospect of a world in whichóto use his languageóthe small and weak have reliable defense and shelter. At the same time  we shall warn against and oppose steps designed to exploit and abuse the Secretary-General thoughtful proposals as one more tool of political warfare.73.	The principles  upon which the United Nations was founded  as well as the Charter  should have moved the Organization and its Membersóas far back as 30 years agoóto take a stand against the denial on the part of the Arab world of the right of a Member State  Israel  to exist in security. When the United Nations ignored this inalienable obligation  it did so at its peril  undermining its own credibility and moral power. Since then  the United Nations has lacked the courage to rise and condemn any act of aggression  threat  violence  blackmail and terror  both direct and indirect  towards Israel by the Arab States and their accomplices.74.	The Assembly has even chosen to reject the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egyptian peace treaty and has ignored the completion earlier this year of Israel's withdrawal from Sinai. It has devoted much time to other  apparently more congenial  aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict.75.	Among the thousands of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council or any other United Nations body during the past 30 years  one will find hardly a single decision or resolution that explicitly condemns by name any Arab State or organization for attacks on Israel or Israelis. During these 30 years  have Arabs never practiced military attacks  terrorist actions  hijacking airplanes  taking hostages  not to speak of the placing of embargoes and blockades and any similar hostile act which international law would even define as a casus belli the Arab States and their terror organizations always appear to be innocent and injured; offended but never offending.76.	United Nations documentation is replete with anti-Israel resolutions  which have increased yearly in both number and length  overflowing with distorted suppositions  arbitrary statements and one-sided and destructive recommendations and decisions. Even the discussion of the establishment of a nuclear- weapon-free zone in the Middle East did not escape the bane of politicization and partisanship. The consensus attained on this issue in the Assembly in 1980 was wrecked last year. We hope that it can be restored  and we stand by our statements made here in the past. None of the many differences between the States of the Middle East should be permitted to stand in the way of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This we owe to our children and their common future. The Government of Israel stands ready to begin negotiations to this end with all Middle Eastern States at once  anywhere and without pre-conditions.77.	Double standards and distortion have spread from General Assembly and committee discussions to other United Nations bodies  including the Security Council  and from there to the directives given to the United Nations forces and instrumentalities in the Middle East. A notable case is the misuse of UNRWA. That Agency was charged with the rehabilitation of refugees but became a tool to preserve the refugee camps  in which idle people were subjected to incitement and coercion in the service of terrorist organizations.78.	The specialized agencies  such as WHO  ILO and so on have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda warfare against Israel  overstepping their areas of responsibility and competence. Last week at the General Conference of IAEA great damage was done to the integrity of that Agency and the whole United Nations system when the credentials of the delegation of Israel were rejected in a blatant exercise of political abuse and discrimination.79.	The accumulated effect of these distortions and shortcomings could be clearly seen in Lebanon. There developed a threat to Israel  as well as to the welfare and independence of Lebanon  a base for international terror and a large heavily armed force which was being put into action in constantly escalating attacks on the villages and towns of northern Israel.80.	Benefiting from the respectability and prestige bestowed by United Nations resolutions  the PLO entrenched itself in Lebanon and set up a pirate State within a State  forcing a regime of terror on the Palestinians and Lebanese. The PLO's terrorist bases  designed for attacks on Israel and to serve international terror  operated and grew unhindered within camps marked by UNRWA signs and enjoying welfare payments contributed for humanitarian purposes. Behind the backs of the United Nations peace-keeping forces in southern Lebanon the terrorists built a military infrastructure and huge arms stores  in preparation for a combined Arab assault against Israel from the north and the east.81.	Had we allowed United Nations resolutions  as distinct from the Charter  to determine what might or might not be done in Arab-Israeli relations  our future would have been destruction. Those resolutions allowed Arab countries to pursue their belligerence against Israelómilitary  political  economic and so forthóand the PLO could continue its terror warfare against Israel  Israelis and Jews  without any restriction by the United Nations. The enemies of Israel felt that they could embark on a full-scale military attack whenever they judged the hour to be right  knowing full wel that the United Nations would not move a finger to stop them.82.	It is sufficient to recall United Nations behavior in 1967  when discussion in the Security Council of the warlike steps Egypt had carried out in May and June 1967 was prevented. It is enough to be reminded of the apathy with which the United Nations reacted when Egypt and Syria broke the cease-fire and launched a co-ordinate surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur 1973.83.	Even the information at our disposal before the Peace for Galilee operation in early June did not foresee all that we found in the terrorists' bases  headquarters  arms and ammunition reservoirs  operational documents and so forth. We received concrete proof of planned  large-scale aggression which was to have taken place in the near future.84.	Lebanese and also Palestinians who for years suffered from PLO terror and feared to divulge what had happened to them are now free to unmask the true face of the PLO in action. They corroborate our gravest suspicions.85.	The entire international community has the responsibility and should have the courage to stand up and formally ban PLO terrorism and expel its representatives from every self-respecting State and every international body. The United Nations and its agencies cannot begin the process of rehabilitation and revitalization as long as such organizations and their representatives are permitted to set foot in a civilized forum.86.	Thirty-seven years ago  with the defeat of nazism  we all believed that the civilized world had learned the lesson of anti-Semitism that led to its most terrible expressionógenocide. Unfortunately  this monster is raising its ugly head once again. Often  attacks on Israel or Zionism in international forums serve as a transparent mask for anti-Semitism. The State of Israel  which is the fulfillment of the Jewish national movement  cannot and will not passively accept a resurgence of this evil ideology. We call on all self- respecting people and Governments to join in a renewed solemn undertaking to stamp out anti-Semitism  in all its forms and expressions  from human society.87.	It is a stain on our civilization and on the Governments directly concerned that Jewish communities in the Soviet Union and in Syria remain deprived of their human rights  especially the basic right to leave and take up residence in countries of their choice. The State of Israel  national homeland of the Jewish people  cannot and will not rest until these rights are granted.88.	Just four years ago the leaders of Egypt  Israel and the United States concluded an historic agreement at Camp David. Egypt assumed the role of pioneer among Arab States. The two neighbors accepted each other's right to exist behind secure and recognized borders. The negotiations were long and arduous. Israel's sacrifices and the risks it undertook in the implementation of the Camp David accords were heavy. A framework for general peace was pains-takingly devised. Egypt  Israel and the United States repeatedly countered criticism of the Camp David accords  emphasizing that these accords were the only agreed  and therefore the only viable  path to peace between Israel and its neighbors.89.	Our approach is practical and realistic. We are ready to renew negotiations toward the establishment of the self-governing authority for the Arab inhabitants of Judea  Samaria and Gaza District  as provided for in the autonomy plan. The representatives who will be elected to the administrative council will be empowered to speak for the population and negotiate on the future status. There is a great deal of logic in the provisions specified in the Camp David agreement that the final status of these areas should not be negotiated at the present stage. We remain convinced that to focus now on what is beyond the horizon is a sure way of inviting failure.90.	Israel would welcome additional partners to the process  as provided for in the Camp David accords. We firmly believe that agreement is achievable. There is no need to introduce new concepts and approaches which were discarded or not accepted at Camp David. We are not prepared  for instance  to reopen the debate on issues  such as the creation of a second Palestinian Arab State  which were rejected at Camp David in favor of more realistic and acceptable solutions.91.	As for the refugee status in which many Palestinian Arabs have been kept over all the years since 1948  this is shameful testimony to the cynical exploitation of human suffering for political ends by Arab Governments. The number of Palestinian Arab refugees in 1948 was about 350 000. There is no lack of land or financial resources in Arab lands  including Palestinian territory in Trans-Jordan  to provide them with homes and employment. Israel did as much and even more  with meager resources  for some 800 000 Jews who left or fled from Arab and Moslem lands after 1948. The humanitarian aspect of this problem could have been solved several times over in the intervening years.92.	In addition to creating a Palestine problem and using it as a weapon against Israel  Arab Governments instituted a boycott against Israel in almost every sphere of human endeavor and supported the terrorist organizations' attacks on Israel. Against this background of active and sustained belligerency  it is ludicrous to search for moderation in possible hints contained in Arab summit resolutions  including the recent one at Fez. Any change toward moderation must first be reflected in deeds and facts.93.	The Arab leaders responsible for this campaign against Israel have inflicted much suffering on the Palestinian Arabs without bringing them any closer to a solution of their problems. History will record the fact that Israel did more for the Palestinian Arabs and their welfare than their Arab brethren.94.	Israel remains faithful to its commitment under the Camp David accords. Israel has cautioned against attempts to reinterpret  renegotiate or bypass them. These accords are the only accepted blueprint for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Pressing Israel for more territorial withdrawals will not bring peace. Indeed  there is no peace without security  and further territorial amputations negate security. Those of Israel's neighbors who seek peace and coexistence will find Israel a willing partner. But those who think that they can weaken Israel while dangling the word  peace  as a bait are deluding themselves. The reward for peace is peace itself. There can be no greater recompense in such a vital and noble cause.95.	The foul massacre of civilians in the camps at Beirut brought a wave of shock  outrage and revulsion in Israel. The perpetrators of this crime are well known. They were not Israeli. Nevertheless  there were manifestations of blind hatred and false accusations leveled at Israel from a number of quarters. Such actions are outrageous and deserve universal condemnation.96.	AH those who proceed along this path must realize that by such action they are weakening the chances of peace and encouraging those elements in the Middle East whose interests are served by radicalization and violence. The Middle East is sorely in need of good counsel  moderation  much patience and a sincere desire for coexistence of diverse ideas  ideologies  faiths and communities. Israel  for its part  is ready to participate in and contribute to the creation of such a reality and atmosphere in the Middle East."
"72",3472,"ITA",37,1982,"Allow me  first of all  Sir  to convey to you  on behalf of the Italian Government and on my own behalf  most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. We are pleased that this honour has been conferred on the representative of a nation with such great traditions. Your vast experience of the workings of the United Nations is a guarantee of the successful performance of the delicate task entrusted to you.102.	I should also like to express our sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who fulfilled the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly last year at a particularly challenging time for the Organization with great dedication and skill.The deep appreciation of the Italian Government  and my own appreciation  also goes to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who  in nine months since he took office  has so completely fulfilled the hopes placed in him. A worthy representative of the illustrious Latin American legal tradition  and particularly the Peruvian school of international law  he has tackled the difficulties which the Organization has had to overcome in this period of his term of office with wisdom  equanimity and  above all  a keen sense of justice. In his search for the road to peace  in his indefatigable championing of negotiated solutions and in his firm defence of the principles of the Charter  the Secretary-General has had and will continue to have the full support of the Italian Government.103.	The international situation during the past year has been growing steadily worse: hotbeds of tension  sometimes turning into violent struggles and wars -with immense losses of human life and acute suffering-have  in fact  constituted threats to the peace and security of the world.104.	The United Nations is all too often faced with serious restraints. Even in its most committed actions  it seems unable to fulfil the expectation that it should not only be the forum of major international debates but also the institution capable of acting effectively to prevent or to extinguish conflicts. This must not discourage us. It is the specific duty of us all-in taking note of this disquieting reality-to analyse in depth  with proper realism  the causes of these limitations  and to give careful but dynamic consideration to the most effective means of enhancing the role of the Organization which  in an international situation characterized by an increase in hotbeds of war  is finding it hard to promote a more equitable international order and is often powerless to prevent violations of the peoples' sovereignty  of freedoms and of human rights.105.	In suggesting this I am fully mindful of the recent detailed report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. The ideas underlying this report naturally elicit a deeply felt and positive response from my country.106.	In fact  we share  on the whole  the perceptive evaluations he has made of the causes most frequently responsible for the limited effectiveness of United Nations action. In particular the slow recourse of Member States to the mechanisms provided for in the Charter and the failure to adapt national policies to the specific provisions of the resolutions adopted  especially those adopted unanimously  are in our opinion most often and most directly responsible for the failure of United Nations action.107.	Even though it was signed 37 years ago  the Charter still provides means for prompt and effective action in order both to prevent international crises from arising-before situations have crystallized  sometimes irreversibly-and to ensure the rapid return to a state of normalcy in the areas concerned.108.	It is therefore not outside but fully within the Charter that the study I just mentioned would seek ways of restoring active vitality and decisive effectiveness to the Organization. Such a conscientious analysis could  in our opinion  give rise to a more binding system of collective security  the most solid foundations of which would be constituted by greater understanding among Member States in general and  in particular  those with seats on the Security Council.109.	In fact  only the United Nations  constituted and consolidated around an ethical and normative system of peaceful and civilized international coexistence  can point out the difficult but necessary course  not based on the mere reality of the balance of forces but guaranteed by the rule of law and by considerations of justice. It is to this goal that our common efforts must be directed  benefiting from the growing maturity of conscience evident on all sides  and not forgetting that the initial and the most concrete means of expressing our will for peace is constituted by a balanced reduction of nuclear and conventional armaments.110.	Italy is convinced that the way to peace is to be found primarily through development. Hence the need to allow each country to pursue the development course best suited to its own requirements  while respecting its own traditions  and to participate adequately in the global world process of production and distribution of goods.111.	The recent Toronto meetings marked a positive stage within the framework of the North-South dialogue. My country  together with other members of the European Community  has made a concrete effort to solve the problem of financing the sixth replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA) and thus to guarantee adequate aid flows. The understanding concerning the start of negotiations for the further financing of the seventh replenishment of IDA also constitutes a major advance. The problem of the Eight General Review of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] Quotas  even if not finally resolved at Toronto  now appears in a more favourable light as a result of the agreements reached there on the consideration of increased quotas  which we favour.112.	But solution of these and other problems regarding relations between industrialized and emerging countries requires a more rational and adequate negotiating framework. That is why we remain convinced of the urgent need to initiate the global negotiating process. The important developments of the last few months  as reflected in the submission of the draft resolution by the developing countries and in the results of the June Versailles Economic Summit  should induce us to take the present opportunity to reach an agreement. More important than the excessive refinement of the text of a resolution is the setting in motion of a negotiating mechanism and to begin  together  the global study of North-South relations with a view to their improvement and development.113.	On the basis of these assumptions  as well as for other idealistic and humanitarian reasons  my country has decided to make a particular effort in appropriating  for the three-year period 1981-1983  some $4 billion for development co-operation  notwithstanding the considerable economic difficulties which we  too  are facing.In this context ample priority will be given by Italy to assistance to the less developed countries  particularly in the agro-industrial sector. In April of this year a high-level technical meeting was held in Rome  in preparation for a subsequent meeting at the political level  to discuss in depth the problems of hunger m the world. That meeting showed that there was broad agreement on the most suitable and effective  as well as the most modem  means of action to combat that scourge. The purpose of this initiative launched by Italy at the Ottawa Economic Summit meeting of industrialized countries in July 1981 was to promote a set of joint initiatives while broader discussions would develop in the framework of global negotiations.118.	I would also recall that my country has reached agreement with UNICEF and WHO on a five-year programme  1982 to 1986  involving $100 million that will help to reduce infant mortality in 15 developing countries.119.	I should also like to mention the outline agreement signed in Washington with the World Bank  whereby the Italian Government will make available to that institution-inaddition to the regular contributions already made by Italy-a sum of approximately $400 million in assistance loans and grants over a three-year period.120.	The last specific action  in chronological order  by Italy is the initiative  in collaboration with FAO  to alleviate the food problem in eight countries of the Sahel. Altogether this programme will cost $500 million  to be provided entirely by my country  over a period of five to seven years.121.	With these initiatives Italy intends to carry out  in the immediate future  an even more organic policy of co-operation  in collaboration with United Nations agencies and programmes  based on a realistic and effective strategy for action that will directly and fully involve the developing countries themselves as partners. South-South relations  in which we see the prospect of concrete and substantial developments in the years to come  should also be encouraged.122.	Italy will continue to provide financial support for the growth of the developing countries with a view to attaining even before the end of the decade the goal of assigning 0.7 per cent of the gross national product to development  in accordance with the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.123.	The creation of a better international order presupposes the commitment of all States-whatever political-institutional pattern they follow  in keeping with their respective needs and traditions-to respect human rights  which represent the highest value that our society is required to protect.124.	These are the beliefs of Italy  a nation that can speak in the name of its ancient traditions as well as its active and highly dedicated present. It has known 3 000 years of history  difficulties  disputes and wars  but in the Mediterranean region  from which I come  in the course of encounters and  admittedly  clashes between different civilizations originating in three great continents  there has been growing consideration for the values of the human being  his rights and his freedom everywhere in the world  and we are proud of that fact.125.	However  it is in this very area of age-old civilization that in the last few weeks human rights have been totally ignored and trampled underfoot. The images of the tragic events in Lebanon are still vividly and horrifyingly impressed on our minds. Following the assassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel and the entry of Israeli troops into west Beirut  in flagrant violation of Israel's commitments  there was a tragic increase in violence. In connection with the Sabra and Shatila camps one of the most bitter pages in recent history was written. It revolts the conscience of the world and it arouses feelings of indignation and the strongest condemnation against those directly and indirectly responsible for the slaughter  as well as feelings of pity for the innocent and helpless victims. This is a lesson which should induce everyone to reflect on the inhuman and monstrous consequences which await those who repeatedly take the path of violence.126.	Since in too many areas there is still a disturbing discrepancy between theoretical affirmation of principles and their concrete application in regard to human rights  Italy deems it essential that the United Nations be enabled to have a more direct and incisive impact on the work of verifying effective respect for such principles. The lack of a suitable and prompt response to the intolerable defiance inherent in the persistence  and indeed the spread  of flagrant and serious violations in many countries is highly damaging to the prestige of the United Nations.127.	We certainly do not consider that an organizational adjustment is an adequate response to one of the most serious problems of our time  the solution of which depends on the ever increasing maturity of our common sensitivity and on the courage  never clouded by opportunism  to denounce any violation of human rights.128.	On East-West relations  Italy continues to pursue a firm  responsible policy and is therefore always ready to take part in a constructive dialogue. Detente must be preserved and indeed given a new impetus. Italy is convinced that there is no alternative; therefore  wherever possible  it works with the utmost commitment for the fruitful resumption of the process of detente. Sometimes more recent and very serious events may make us forget or may divert our attention from the events which have most affected the increase in tension between East and West and are decisive elements in the disquieting international situation facing us today.129.	In view of its gravity  the Afghan problem must continue to be a focal point of our debate at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and for United Nations action in general. Three years have now elapsed since the Soviet invasion  but the resistance of the proud Afghan people to a regime imposed from outside is stronger than ever. The tragic odyssey of those long-suffering people  great numbers of whom have been forced to leave their homeland and seek refuge in neighbouring countries  troubles us profoundly. We have to note with deep regret that there has still been no response to the appeals and the constructive proposals made by the General Assembly  the non-aligned movement  the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the countries of the European Community with a view to the restitution of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination and the re-establishment of that country's traditional status as a an independent  neutral and non-aligned State. Therefore we fully support continued pursuit of the Secretary-General's initiative concerning tripartite negotiations in Geneva.130.	The Polish problem  not only because it is being enacted only a few hundred kilometres from our borders but also because it involves our culture  affects us directly as Italians and Europeans concerned with the construction of an open Europe committed to human rights  peace and progress. The Italian Government and Italian public opinion is deeply concerned about the drama of the Polish nation  whose courageous search for valid and autonomous forms of renewal has been violently interrupted.131.	Unfortunately even the most recent events confirm that there has been no significant development in that area  which is still the scene of a series of challenges to the Polish people's aspiration to freedom  ranging from the persistence of martial law to arbitrary arrests  and contacts between the Government and the bodies most representative of the people have not been resumed. Only a resumption of dialogue and the participation of all the vital forces of the nation can give the support of a consensus to economic revival and social peace.132.	But the situation in Poland is not the only obstacle to the process of detente  the momentum of which unfortunately diminished following the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki. Serious blows have been struck at the foundations of world peace by changes in the balance of forces to the advantage of the East. These balances must be restored. That is the firm resolve of my Government. Italy is ready in this context to make its full contribution to the study and solution of the problems deriving  above all  from the accumulation of all kinds of armaments  often in excess of any reasonable or legitimate national security need. In that spirit and in expectation of general and complete disarmament under strict international control  my country participated with hope and commitment in the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We are not taking a sceptical view of that session. We merely say that efforts should be continued and intensified.133.	In this connection  I should like to confirm that my country considers that the solution must be sought in the direction of the zero option  with the aim of ensuring the total elimination by both the Soviet Union and the United States of the lethal and destabilizing medium-range missile systems. Also  as regards the strategic arms reduction talks  Italy is determined to make its own contribution both in the framework of Atlantic consultations and through appropriate bilateral channels with the two Powers involved.134.	While recognizing the objective difficulties in arriving in the near future at a verifiable treaty on the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear tests  I confirm that my country attaches paramount importance to that objective. However  we must not neglect the very serious issue of chemical weapons. Italy is also committed to progress in negotiations on the subject of conventional weapons  particularly as regards initiatives aimed at limiting and reducing international transfers of that type of weapon.135.	The crisis in the process of detente unfortunately had negative repercussions on the follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held in Madrid  which after three postponements was approaching a positive outcome. Our concern for safeguarding the process of that Conference  because of its world-wide as well as European importance  led us to agree to a further postponement until the beginning of November  which is now close. We hope that the General Assembly will encourage the European countries to create  in keeping with the provisions of the Final Act of Helsinki  the necessary conditions for the proceedings to be resumed and to move towards a positive conclusion.136.	Unfortunately  the persistence and aggravation of focal points of tension in many parts of the world inevitably cause serious apprehension among the entire international community. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark  in his capacity as current President of the European Community  expressed here  at the 8th meeting  the anxiety which we all feel over the world situation and identified and commented in depth and with lucidity on those international problems which  because of their gravity  must be brought to the attention of the Assembly.137.	I am thinking first of all of the Middle East  an area of traditional and direct responsibility for my country  situated as it is in the centre of the Mediterranean region. A moral and political judgement on the recent tragic events in Lebanon is not enough. There must be concrete action if this vicious circle is to be broken. Aware of this fact  Italy made direct efforts with a view to the adoption by the United Nations of measures to deal urgently with that situation. A first important step was the strengthening of the United Nations observer contingent  decided upon by the Security Council in its resolution 521 (1982).138.	In view of the gravity and urgency of the situation and bearing in mind the fact that the consultations held by the Secretary-General had shown that it would be difficult to reach agreement quickly on the deployment of an international force  and also in response to appeals received  Italy decided to take the initiative in ensuring the speedy reconstitution  together with the United States and France  of the multinational force for Beirut  which will act with United Nations observers upon the formal request of the Lebanese Government and in conformity with the objectives of resolution 521 (1982).139.	Following wing the most dramatic phase of the crisis  it will be necessary to proceed rapidly to the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and all other foreign forces stationed in Lebanon against the wishes of the lawful authorities of the country  so that the Lebanese Government can exercise its authority fully over the entire national territory. Only thus will Lebanon be able once more to become an element of stability in the region.140.	We must  however  never lose sight of the comprehensive peace settlement that we have long advocated  both on behalf of Italy and in the context of the European approach to the problems of the Middle East  as the sole solution capable of bringing lasting stability to the entire region. This can be achieved only by seeking an equitable solution to the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict  giving equal weight to Israel's right to be recognized and accepted by its neighbours and to exist within secure and guaranteed boundaries and to the right of the Palestinians to see the fulfilment of their national aspirations. We are thus more convinced than ever of the need to facilitate a start to negotiations that can involve all the leading protagonists in the Middle East conflict. It is particularly necessary that the Israelis and Palestinians should be able to move beyond the logic of confrontation and violence and become aware of the existing realities in the area as a prerequisite for reciprocal recognition  even if it is conditional.141.	Italy looks with interest and appreciation to the possibilities of a breakthrough and the important pronouncements in the recent statements made by the President of the United States  which contain more specific details regarding a solution to the Palestinian problem and give greater prominence to that problem in the general context of the Middle East question.142.	The leaders of the Arab countries  meeting at Fez a few days ago  on the commendable initiative of the King of Morocco  put forward interesting new ideas based on the Fahd plan  ideas which we appreciate and which suggest a high degree of restored unity in the Arab world based on positions which are not extreme but in fact show a trend towards a certain negotiating flexibility.143.	It must be noted that in the Arab world  Egypt -even at the cost of isolation-has set a good example  which certainly gives it a prominent role in those developments. I should like also to mention the contribution made by Jordan to this greater search for negotiated solutions.144.	Recent statements by the leadership of the PLO -which  in Italy's view  continues to be a key factor in future peace negotiations-statements endorsed by Arafat himself at a meeting I had with him some days ago in Rome  show signs of an increased awareness on the Palestinian side. We hope that this development in the Palestinian position  which we have duly noted  will be further consolidated so that in the occupied territories it will be possible to make progress towards the establishment of a Palestinian homeland through the exercise of a free choice by the Palestinians of their own destiny made in full awareness of the realities of the area and the importance of gradualism. This means abandoning any attempt to dispute Israel's existence or to threaten its security. We are convinced that the time has come for Israel also to show determination to enter a new phase of negotiations and peaceful settlement  rejecting the alternatives of confrontation and military action.145.	Italy views also with great apprehension the continuation of the tragic and disastrous conflict between Iraq and Iran. We are aware of the appalling suffering and destruction which the war has brought to the two warring countries and we intend to act in all suitable forums in an endeavour to expedite a peaceful solution to the conflict  in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and in line with the statement issued by the 10 members of the European Community on 24 May 1982.146.	Close to the area of the Middle East  in the Near East  there is another crisis-in Cyprus  more limited but for us Mediterraneans a source of serious concern. On 2 July 1982 I visited that island in order to contribute to a speedy solution to the Cyprus problem. That visit afforded a useful opportunity for closer study of the individual aspects of this question with a view to ascertaining what concrete openings could be discerned in the long-standing intercommunal talks. It also provided an opportunity to reiterate Italy's readiness to assist the Secretary-General and his representative in Nicosia in their difficult task of mediation in the negotiations between the two Cypriot communities; their dialogue is useful in itself because it serves to release much tension. The positive change in climate in Greek-Turkish relations could also facilitate rapprochement in the positions of the two sides in Cyprus.147.	Also in connection with the efforts made to create suitable conditions in the Mediterranean for peaceful and profitable collaboration between all the coastal States  we should mention the interest with which the Italian Government views Malta and the consolidation of its position as a neutral nation  whose development along lines of genuine non-alignment we welcome and sincerely encourage.148.	There is another region  the Horn of Africa  with which my country has strong ties and which unfortunately has not yet overcome the serious crisis affecting it. Our commitment to the development of these peoples  both bilateral and multilateral  is growing and in fact we feel that such development is the basic problem to surmount. We feel also that  in a spirit of mutual respect and consideration for the principles established by the Organization of African Unity [(241/]  collaboration and negotiation constitute the means for overcoming the present crisis in the Horn of Africa. However  in recent months we have seen a further violation of frontiers-this time to the detriment of Somalia-which is most worrying and which still persists. Everyone must shoulder his responsibilities and an end must be put to those acts of war.149.	To the south on the African continent  despite South African military initiatives in Angola  which we firmly condemn  efforts to pave the way for Namibia's independence as provided for by the United Nations have advanced considerably  although too slowly since 1982 is almost at its end and that goal has not yet been attained. We hope that the necessary trust between the parties will grow during this final stage and serve  among other things  to protect southern Africa from the impact of world tension.150.	The region of the South Atlantic has also been troubled by a serious armed conflict in recent months. Ever since the outbreak of the Anglo-Argentine crisis in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  Italy has actively endeavoured to avoid any deterioration of that situation-or at any rate to limit its negative consequences- in close contact with the Governments of the members of the European Community  with the United States and with many Latin American countries  which have similarly attempted to divert the crisis towards a peaceful solution.151.	I recently visited Latin America in the hope that  while taking account of my country's position in the course of the conflict  Italy or I myself could help to restore  in the common interest relations between South America and the European Community.It is our firm belief that relations  co-operation and understanding between the countries of Europe and Latin America  which are linked by common ties of culture  language and civilization  are essential for world equilibrium.152.	With regard to the specific problem of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  Italy's position has been to condemn the act of aggression; it has been and remains in favour of a resumption of the dialogue between London and Buenos Aires  naturally without any pre-conditions concerning the subject under dispute  within the framework of the United Nations and with the possibility of recourse to the good offices of the Secretary-General.153.	Another region of the world of concern to our country is Central America  where  to the local causes of the crisis-found in the age-old but currently unacceptable conditions of cultural  social  political and economic deprivation in which the people are living-have been added recently  following inadmissible foreign interference  the consequences of East-West rivalry.154.	For our part  we believe that every effort should be made to take the uphill path to peace and  consequently  we are in favour of multilateral and bilateral initiatives in this direction  as well as of the assistance programmes thus far implemented to help the countries of the region  to which we hope that the European Community can also contribute.155.	With regard to Asia  the situation in Kampuchea  another independent and non-aligned country that has fallen victim to military occupation  continues to interfere with the development of relations among Asian peoples. My Government considers that the solution of this crisis must be based on the emergence of a sovereign  independent and neutral Kampuchea with a politically representative Government free from any military presence.156.	Also in the context of Asia  I should also like to recall that  unfortunately  the Korean question remains unresolved. The Italian Government would welcome the initiation of a dialogue between the two States aimed at arriving at an agreement guaranteeing peaceful coexistence with a view to the reunification of the peninsula.157.	The peoples consider that the United Nations should eventually become the parliament of concord  peace and co-operation. That is a most noble undertaking  but certainly a very difficult one. We  the States Members of the United Nations  wiser through the painful experiences of our past  which dictate prudent farsightedness and a responsible imagination on our part  must not dash their hopes.158.	I have already indicated that the current panorama of international society is very far from reflecting the great ideals of the San Francisco Charter and that the way in which the machinery it provided is being used is far from satisfactory. My country is convinced that  apart from other ways and means we should explore to remedy that situation  we can take a significant step forward through more intensive action in the main geographical areas  where it is possible to confront problems and relax tensions in the light of the Charter  but also within the framework of common historical traditions and common economic and social realities.159.	It is on the basis of this conviction that Italy  along with the nine other countries of Western Europe  is committed to the construction of a great economic and political community ready to collaborate with all peoples and capable of being an important factor for balance and progress in the international society-a community that wishes to participate fully in the universal dialogue for which the present forum is the United Nations.160.	With the immediate prospect of new Members  of ever-closer and interlocking ties between the countries of the Community and of the strengthening of those ties already existing between them and groups of countries of other continents  as exemplified by the Lome Convention  we see how fundamentally important integration effort of our peoples is to the realization of those higher ideals enshrined in the principles of the Charter.161.	Despite the difficulties it encountered  and precisely because of its inherent evolutionary potential  the European Community has during the past 25 years succeeded in giving fuller expression on the old continent and throughout the world to the profound sense of equality  freedom and justice of the Europeans and to their desire for a constant constructive dialogue with all peoples. This opening on the world is the comer-stone of the Community's international action.162.	For those reasons  we view with great satisfaction and interest the parallel development in other major areas in various continents of organizations which deal at the regional level with difficult and often contentious international questions  and which are united in their assessments and decisions by an awareness of shared common interests.163.	Action based on peace  justice and the well-being of peoples which is harmonized at the regional level always has its natural and preferred epicentre in the United Nations. The time is ripe for the development of active solidarity capable of enabling the United Nations to work effectively to translate the progress of the times into human terms and to organize properly the vast new potential of civilization and technology."
"73",3518,"JAM",37,1982,"I should like to begin by extending sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I feel certain that the experience and knowledge you have acquired in the course of a brilliant career will enable you to guide the proceedings of the Assembly with all the skill required in these troubled times. I should also like to express our sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who deserves our praise for the dedication and skill with which he carried out his duties over the past year  which was a particularly challenging time for the United Nations. This is the first opportunity I have had publicly to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his appointment as Secretary General. In his first year in office he has made an impressive beginning which gives encouragement and hope that during his tenure the United Nations will make greater strides towards the full attainment of its purposes and objectives. The current session of the General Assembly is being held against the background of an alarming deterioration of the international situation  characterized by global confrontation  military intervention  foreign occupation  a spiraling of the arms race  and the frequent resort to the use or threat of the use of force against the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of States all of this in the midst of a deep global economic recession. A review of the agenda for this the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly points to a growing number of items dealing with unresolved crises  and an alarming increase in the outbreaks of fresh hostilities. It is not without ironic significance that it is precisely the smaller  underdeveloped and economically more vulnerable countries of the third world  currently being buffeted by the effects of global economic recession  which art At the same time the focal points of tension and conflict  particularly in the Middle East  southern Africa  Asia  as well as Latin America and the Caribbean. For the most part these conflicts have been intensified and made worse by the intrusion of super Power confrontation  and as a consequence of flagrant disregard the principles of the Charter and the by passing of the United Nations as the proper forum within which to seek a peaceful settlement of disputes. Recent events in the Middle East  culminating in the abominable massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut  have shattered some long held illusions. But the military prowess of the Israelis has not destroyed the basic fact. That basic fact is that no lasting peace and stability is possible unless the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to statehood is satisfied. Jamaica holds firmly to that view. Equally  we believe that all States in the area are entitled to exist within their internationally recognized boundaries. We note that important initiatives have been taken by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  and by the President of the United States  Ronald Reagan  to try to give a new impetus for a settlement of the Middle East problems. It is clear that there are many obstacles ahead  but it is noteworthy that there is now at least a common factor  and that common factor is a recognition that the Palestinian people have rights which have to be satisfied. Jamaica recognizes that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Palestine could have an important bearing on the settlement of the problems of the region. The Conference output to be substantially more than an exchange of views. It should try to make specific and realistic recommendations which would be helpful in the peace making process. In fact  we are tempted to suggest that the issues with which it is dealing and the international climate are such that the Conference ought to be held earlier. It is clear that the circumstances which gave rise to the need for a conference  and the assumptions on which its convening was based  have been largely overtaken by events. Its importance and its usefulness  therefore  will depend upon itsability to seize the propitious signs. The United Nations must not cease in its efforts to find a formula for cessation of hostilities in various parts of the world. We wish to draw particular attention to the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran which has been going on for two years now and which has already taken thousands of lives  and left thousands more wounded  and we join in the pleas to both parties to end the conflict. Similarly the pivotal roles of the non aligned movement and the OAU in the anti colonial struggle and in the quest for peace  detente and disarmament must continue. The events in the Middle East and other areas demonstrate the failure to enable the peace keeping mechanisms of the United Nations to function as intended. They also underscore the need for more systematic and imaginative use of the Security Council to monitor areas of potentially dangerous conflict. Over the years the practice of the permanent members has inexorably expanded the range of their interest and has brought so many minor areas of tension under the umbrella of their perceived interest that the collective security system has broken down. It has to be noted that too often the permanent members of the Security Council resort to use of the veto with scant regard for the overall interests of the international community  and in disregard of their own obligation to maintain international peace and security. The institutional marriage of the nineteenth century concept of the Concert of Europe with the concept of collective security implicit in the Security Council  has not worked in the interests of the international community. Something has to be done to remedy this situation; I congratulate the Secretary General on his departure from recent practice by presenting to the members of the Assembly a brief  easily read  and challenging invitation that they should pause and consider the state of the Organization and decide to do something about its shortcomings. The Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization [/37/V] is a direct challenge of the most profound kind addressed to every member of this body. To the Security Council as a whole  it is a challenge to recognize how far we have departed in practice from standards which were contemplated and set for us by its founders. The report is equally a challenge to every Member. State to think again about the readiness with which we have been prepared to accept that the whole United Nations must remain flouted  ignored and powerless  if the Security Council  whose main responsibility is the preservation of international peace and security  is unable to act. Jamaica maintains that the entire United Nations collective security system should not remain hamstrung and powerless because the Security Council is deadlocked. In the name of my Government  I renew Jamaica's commitment to the provisions of the Charter. Jamaica endorses the suggestion that a workable system of collective security should be reintroduced. We solemnly commit ourselves to the search for such a process and to the effective implementation of any useful measures which may be found so as to restore to the Security Council an effective capacity to discharge its responsibility for the maintenance of peace. We urge that a meeting of the Council should be called before the end of this session of the Assembly  which should be attended at the very highest levels  and which will deal with the effectiveness of the Security Council in discharging its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security. We further urge that the General Assembly should assign the subject of the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization to a Main Committee at this session  in which the Member States would actively consider the implication of the Secretary General's report  and the action they might take when the Security Council is unable to act. Another subject of urgent concern is that of Namibia. The movement towards independence for Namibia continues to be slow  notwithstanding the hints from the contact group that progress has been made. South Africa continues to block effective action. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must be fully implemented. Jamaica does not share the view that the independence of Namibia should be linked to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The two are separate issues and must be dealt with separately. We condemn South Africa's continued military aggression and campaigns of destabilization against Angola and the other front line States. In South Africa Itself  the policy of continues to be more deeply entrenched every day. All the internal institutional changes point in the direction of a further entrenchment of this abhorrent system. Yet we are told that sanctions are inappropriate in this case  while there are exhortations to apply them elsewhere; alleged forced labour is decried elsewhere  while the brutal treatment of the entire black population of South Africa is glossed over or excused. The criteria used to assess the problems of black people are always different  and a failure to apply the same standards is always clothed in specious excuses and sophistry. We cannot allow this degrading situation to continue. Jamaica deeply regrets that the recent second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament failed to achieve any significant results  particularly as regards a comprehensive programme of disarmament. This is a major disappointment. The world community had expected much from this special session  particularly at a time when many States are embarking on dangerous rearmament programmes which they mistakenly believe will enhance their security. They must be made to realize that this absurd and perilous escalation of the arms race in both the nuclear and the conventional field consumes valuable resources which could more profitably be spent on economic and social development  particularly in developing countries  to correct the neglected problems which are the root cause of the struggles in the various regions. It is estimated that some $500 billion are being spent annually on armaments  whereas at the same time  according to the statistics compiled by the Organization  450 million people suffer from hunger or malnutrition; there is an annual infant mortality rate of 12 million babies who die before their first birthday; 42 million people are blind  or nearly so; 2 billion people do not have water that is safe to drink; 250 million people live in urban slums or shanty towns; 870 million adults cannot read or write; 500 million people have no jobs or are less than fully employed; and 130 million children are unable to attend primary schools. These statistics frighten us. This is the nature of some of the global social problems and these are what we want addressed when we say that money now spent on armaments could be better used for development. Jamaica hopes that Member States will now take increasing account of the concern manifested by the masses of people for effective disarmament measures  and that this will encourage a renewed commitment to general and complete disarmament. The World Disarmament Campaign which was approved by the special session  will certainly contribute to that end. Furthermore  the pledge by two nuclear weapon States on the non first use of nuclear weapons is also a welcome step in the right direction  and Jamaica hopes that the remaining nuclear weapon States will make similar commitments in this regard. In the midst of all these problems  we cannot ignore that singularly important achievement of the United Nations  the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 30 April 1982. Jamaica is among the developing and developed countries that welcome this event. The Convention has codified and progressively developed international law in several important areas  but I cite the following as its most significant achievements. First  the proclamation that the area beyond national jurisdiction is the common heritage of mankind is a significant landmark in the history of international relations. We believe that the regime which it establishes for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the deep sea bed is just and equitable  and will operate to the mutual advantage of developed and developing countries. Secondly  the Convention has solved the age old question of the breadth of the territorial sea by the establishment of an economic zone of 200 miles  including a territorial sea of 12 miles. It is the firm view of my Government that the Convention contains a body of rules on the rights and duties of States which is the law that governs the uses of the sea. A major achievement of the Conference which we wish to highlight is the exemplary use in its proceedings of the device of consensus as a system of decision making. It is indeed remarkable and commendable that in a Conference in which as many as 150 countries participated and which extended over eight years  the negotiations were almost entirely conducted and concluded without a vote being taken. Jamaica has a great sense of pride at having been selected as the site of the International Sea Bed Authority  of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  and of the ceremony for the signing of the Convention from 6 to 10 December 1982. I want to assure you that Jamaica is sensitive to the obligations which go with the conferment of those honours. As you are aware  the Preparatory Commission comes into being on the signing of the Convention by 50 States and will commence its work within 90 days thereafter. It is obviously essential that  consistent with the programme and objectives of the Preparatory Commission  adequate provision be made for its effective functioning. That is a recommendation of the Group of 77 which we fully endorse. We exhort all States to sign and ratify the Convention as quickly as possible so that it will enter into force in the shortest possible time. An early entry into force of the Convention can only operate to the advantage of all countries  developed and developing  particularly where it deals with the regime for the exploration and exploitation of the deep seabed. We would not wish anyone to be left in doubt as to our view that activities in the international seabed area can take place lawfully only within the framework established by the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We hope that no country or group of countries will engage in actions or adopt measures whose effect will be to undermine the Convention. We are not only beset by political turbulence and insecurity; we are confronted once again with a dismal picture of the world economic situation. The indicators are discouraging. They demonstrate the further entrenchment of world recession and stagnation. In 1981 the international economy recorded a growth of only 1.2 per cent  that is  one third of the rate achieved in the recession prone decade of the 1970s. For the developing countries  growth in 1981 was 0.6 per cent  representing a fall in per capita gross domestic product  which was a novel experience in the developing world in the post independence period. My own region  Latin America and the Caribbean traditionally an area of relatively high growth  has been severely affected. Gross national product in the region actually declined by 0.4 per cent and per capita gross national product declined by 2.7 per cent. World trade  itself a powerful determinant of the pace of economic growth  also presents a grim picture. Last year  for the first time in nearly two decades  world trade showed virtually no growth  after a minimal growth of 1.5 per cent in 1980. The situation is compounded by the alarming decline of 22.5 per cent in the prices of primary commodities between January 1981 and June of this year. Developing countries  notwithstanding the decline in their earnings as a result of this  are constrained to increase their imports in order to provide the basic necessities for their populations. The downturn in global economic activity  as evidenced in the growth and trade indicators  has caused a worsening in the debt situation and the prospects for many developing countries. For 1981 the total external debt for capital importing developing countries was in the area of $500 billion  an almost threefold increase since the latter half of the 1970s. The gravity of the debt situation is revealed by a comparison of certain features in international financing between the beginning of the 1970s and the present. During that period  the average debt service ratio of the oil importing developing countries increased from 8 per cent to 19 per cent. Average maturities on loans contracted by developing countries fell from 20 to 12.7 years  and the interest burden on developing countries  measured in relation to their gross national product  increased four times. This brief analysis of the global economy is intended to highlight the need for immediate action if we are to avert the collapse of the international system. We are all agreed on the necessity to achieve a rate of economic growth consistent with the aspirations of our peoples and the requirements for achieving international peace and security. In seeking to fulfil those objectives  we must make a special appeal to the developed countries to desist from the application of protectionist trade policies. The experience of the 1930s has shown that measures by developed countries to protect sectors in their economies that have lost their competitive edge in the international marketplace are self defeating. They serve only to contract international purchasing power and to generate unemployment in their own economies as well as in the economies of the developing world that provide markets for their exports. Jamaica is firm in the view that the marketplace and work place of the developing world hold the best solution for reflation without inflation. The unsatisfied and growing demands of the consumer market and the unsatisfied and growing capabilities of the work forces of a growing number of developing countries need only the catalyst of expanded credit resources to fuel an expansion of trade through export  led growth. Jamaica commends for the consideration of the Assembly the essential features of our Prime Minister's presentation on this subject at the joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting in Toronto in September. There Jamaica emphasized the urgency of introducing emergency measures which would be immediately implemented to assist those member countries which are on the brink of collapse and reinvigorate international trade and investment. Jamaica considers that the Fund's Eighth general Review of Quotas provides a good opportunity to create credit as a means of trade expansion. Accordingly we support the early conclusion of the review of quotas in 1983 as called for by both the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs and the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors on the International Monetary System. We fully support also the need for selective allocations and a substantial increase of quotasóan increase which in our view should not be less than 50 per cent. Jamaica is of the view that increased liquidity for trade expansion could also be accomplished by the expansion of trade credits  utilizing excess liquidity in the commercial banking system accumulated through the increased savings resulting from current anti inflationary strategies. As practice has developed  these savings are likely to be available only for short  term financing. The concern of commercial banks about current levels of credit exposure to developing countries indicates that an intermediary to trigger a meaningful flow of these under utilized resources may be necessary. One such intermediary mechanism already exists in the Bank's lending programme  through an export development fund for export trade credit. With appropriate modifications this mechanism could fulfil the purpose of a ready and available instrument to mobilize ready and available resources to be utilized by ready and available productive capacities  to expand trade  growth and employment on a basis consistent with the objectives of the adjustment process. The financial dislocations brought about by the global energy situation continue to inhibit the search fbr economic stability within the oil importing developing countries. The development of non conventional sources of energy must therefore remain a priority. Jamaica looks forward to the report on the progress made by the Interim Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy on the implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action fbr the Development of New and Renewable Sources of Energy. Jamaica is concerned that the effectiveness of the World Bank in the development process could be eroded  as evidenced in the obstacles being placed in the way of establishing an energy affiliate to support an expanded programme for energy investment. I have focused on a few of the elements inhibiting the economic growth of developing countries and hence of the global economy. It should now be obvious to all that the issues are so closely interrelated as to necessitate a coherent and integrated approach to deal with them. No one should at this stage find it useful to argue in favour of separating the concerns of the North from those of the South. The crisis in the international economy and the measure of collective fears are reflected in the concerns which all countries  including those with surpluses  have regarding the world wide balance of payments situation. The concern of the Assembly must  however  go beyond simple accounting indices. We must be aware of the implications of such indices for the quality of life of those we have the honour to represent. The global economic recession's net effect on them is increasing unemployment brought about by the weakening in the world demand for goods and services. High levels of unemployment now threaten the social and political order in both the North and the South. In the developing world  unemployment levels of up to 30 per cent are not unusual. Vast sectors of young and courageous populations have never had the chance to secure gainful employment. The employed live daily under the threat of loss of jobs because of the decline in the prices of primary products  because of bankruptcies and closure of factories and other productive operations. These are brought about by the effects of economic recession transmitted through the network of international economic linkages. We have throughout the years debated priorities from the perspectives of the North and the South and accommodation of what we have perceived as our just aspirations. I submit that we must now face up to the global priority. We must bring to bear our intellectual capacity and our political authority to halt the global economic recession and correspondingly to induce growth and development internationally. This calls fbr all of us  rich and poor  to recognize the basic reality of the 1980s  and that basic reality is the force of global interdependence. A few years ago the concept of interdependence was the basis fbr interesting but largely semantic debates. Today interdependence is an inescapable reality. The proposed global round of negotiations  which has been under consideration for the past three years  must now be recognized as offering the best prospect of bringing about the changes required to establish an economic system which can fulfil the aspirations of our time. Jamaica hopes that the sense of realism which has been shown by the developing countries on this issue will be reciprocated by the North in order to facilitate the commencement of global negotiations in early 1983. The establishment of the necessary framework must be concluded by this thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. Our obligations to each other derive from our interdependence. We simply cannot live without one another. The recognition of that fact must constantly mould our actions so as to bring about a peaceful  just and prosperous world. That is Jamaica's objective."
"74",3564,"JOR",37,1982,"Mr. President. it gives me great pleasure to convey to you in the name of the delegation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. our warm congratulations on your election to your high office. We have full confidence that your experience and competence will contribute effectively towards a successful out-come to this session. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor Mr. Kittani who presided over the proceedings of the thirty-sixth session most effectively for which we thank him. I wish to pay a particular tribute to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General to increase the opportunities for peace and to alleviate the tensions that prevail in many parts of the world. My delegation takes this opportunity to express its full support for those efforts and to pledge its full co-operation with him.40. A careful study of the agenda of this session and the grave issues contained therein. which have serious implications for world peace and security confirms the bleak foreboding which the Secretary-General has clearly and forcefully expressed in his report.41. Our world today is beset on all sides by dangers resulting from the predominance of the policies of the use of force or the threat of the use of force: instead of having recourse to  peacefulï means of 'settling problems among nations. This tendency has been intensified by a continuing and relentless arms  race. the development and acquisition of the most .sophisticated means of mass destruction and the allocation by many States of vast human and material resources to those ends. '42. We also find that the States entrusted by the Charter of the United Nations with a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security have pursued policies which are at variance with that responsibility. Some of them have resorted to the use of force while others have condoned the fact that States have committed acts of aggression and intervention in the affairs of other States.43. The failure of those States to put an end to the military option and the use of force and their condoning of the use of force by others have led to the prevalence of an aggressive attitude in relations between States and encouraged more States to take the same course.44. As a logical and ineluctable corollary of this development  the international situation has deteriorated most seriously. amounting as the Secretary-General said in his report to have brought the world perilously near to a' new international anarchy. As a result of this development the United Nations has been rendered incapable of contributing lo the solution of international conflicts. The Security Council whose principal duty under the Charter is the maintenance of international peace and security has been immobilized and prevented from performing its -ask. Its functions have been confined to issuing resolutions which remain unimplemented.45. Despite the fact that the Charter has laid down a system of collective security in the world.ï we note that the principles enshrined in the Charter for regulating relations between States have been flouted. That system has been subverted by the prevailing tendency to use force under different pretexts  whether it be a warped concept of security or alleged' self-defence. All those pretexts are actually aimed at imposing hegemony and achieving the parochial interests of those who have the force and the means of using it. Thus we see the blatant military occupation  the colonization of occupied land~. the destruction of  property and cities and interference in .and manipulation of the internal affairs of other States with a view to serving the interests and aims of the aggressor.46. It is profoundly disturbing that instead of taking immediate and decisive action to deter aggressors assist their victims and prevent the fruits of aggression being reaped some of the major Powers choose to stand idly by. to condone the aggression or even to obstruct the application against the aggressor of the sanctions fm' which the Charter provides.47. That approach. with its concomitant weakening of the united Nations has led to the dangerous situation that the world finds itself in today. It has also led all those countries that observe the Charter and support international law to lose faith and confidence that their legitimate quest for security and just solutions to their problems can be pursued within the framework of the existing international ordering the absence of such assured security  those Member States have found themselves impelled to scramble .for' arms and divert large parts of their limited resources for the acquisition of the necessary means of self-defence in confronting the policies of hegemony and domination being pursued by the more powerful States. We must state that such a development would never have taken place if the major Powers to which the Charter entrusted the maintenance of world peace and security. ~ad shouldered their solemn responsibilities and duties with firmness and sincerity.48.	The most glaring example of what I  have just described is to be found in the Middle East  where the situation is characterized by the 'use of force and the imposition of occupation. Hegemony and faits accomplis to which Israel has resorted persistently  without being subjected to the deterrent action that would force it to submit to the international will and law..49.	Israel occupied the greater part of Palestine in 1948 and in 1967 it completed the occupation of the remainder. in addition to parts of other Arab lands. In the past few months it has occupied large areas of the sister country of Lebanon rendering homeless and displacing scores of thousands of its civilian population. Israel has destroyed many of Lebanon's towns and villages. It laid siege to Beirut devastating large parts of it with unparalleled barbarism by incessant land sea and air bombardment. which claimed thousands of innocent victims in dead and wounded.50. One of the most heinous massacres in history was perpetrated against unarmed civilians. foremost among whom were women old people and children. The conscience of humanity is still overwhelmed with revulsion anger and abhorrence at dimensions of this barbaric massacre which has its precedent in earlier Israeli massacres innocent Palestinians at Deir Yassin  Qibya and Kafr Qasim.51. The main objective of these repeated massacres has invariably been to terrorize and uproot the Palestinian people and to silence them. in the vain hope' that such massacres will erase from the consciousness of the Palestinian people their yearning to return to their homeland in Palestine. and that they will abandon that homeland to strangers who falsely claim they have a better right to it than its legitimate owners.52. Israel's ability to persist in its aggressive expansionist policies of which the most recent manifestation is the victimization of Lebanon can be traced back specifically to the time when the whole world and particularly those great Powers upon which devolves the responsibility for preserving peace and security stood idly by or ignored Israel's aggression in June 1967. At that grave moment a fundamental deviation occurred in the international collective security system. When the Security Council was prevented from taking action in conformity with its established practice of linking a cease-fire with the imperative demand for complete withdrawal from all the occupied territories  Israel exploited that in order to reap the fruits of its aggression by continuing its occupation of Arab territories and refusing to withdraw from them. Moreover  Israel refused to implement Security Council resolution 242 (1967) which called upon it to withdraw completely from those territories. .53.' Israel 'has persistently sought to cover up its defiance under the guise of its security. Its supporters have sought to justify their massive assistance to it on the ground that a secure Israel would be more willing to make concessions in exchange for peace. Events have proved the fallacy of that claim.54. We have seen that the greater Israel's military power grows the more obdurate and inflexible its policies become. It stretches its concept of security to include aggression against the neighbouring Arab States. Israel's doctrine of security has become synonymous with aggression expansion and occupation. It reached unprecedented dimensions recently with the massacre of innocent civilians. The abominable events in Lebanon have revealed to the whole world and in particular to the friends of Israel. Israel's true face and have unmasked the falsehood of its security pretexts.55. Israel's definition of its security is but a slogan which it uses to cover up its continuing expansion at the expense 'of Arab territories and rights. Israel expanded since the Partition Plan of 29 November 1947 going beyond the Armistice Agreement of 1949 and the cease-fire lines of 1967 to what we see at present in Lebanon shows that Israel is in no need of security. Israel has annexed Arab Jerusalem and the Golan Heights; it has established Israeli settlements; it bombed Iraqi  peaceful nuclear installations: and  it has started to build a canal from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean. Such an expansionist Israel which has defined its perceived area of security as encompassing all the lands from Pakistan in the East and North Africa in the West is suffering from an abundance of security  not from a lack of it. That is all too dear when we take into account Israel military nuclear capability which was documented in the Secretary-General's report at the preceding session.56. It has been the consistent pattern that whenever there appear to be indications on the horizon of efforts by the international community to achieve a just. comprehensive and lasting solution to the question of Palestine and the conflict in the Middle East Israel resorts to a pre-emptive military strike in order to occupy more Arab lands in order to thwart any such international efforts and compel the world to divert its endeavours towards dealing with the complexities resulting from the faits accomplish newly created by Israel's aggression.57. Hence Israel's invasion of Lebanon and its attempts to manipulate Lebanon's political situation and internal affairs in a manner which would serve its objective of spreading its hegemony over the region. Israel was encouraged to launch its invasion by the meek reaction to its earlier invasion of southern Lebanon in March 1978 and its ability to impose its own conditions for a partial withdrawal. Those conditions included the creation of a buffer zone in south Lebanon under the control of mercenaries accountable to its will. When Israel saw that that dangerous precedent had been tolerated by the inter-national community  it embarked upon its further invasion of Lebanon  which has continued for the past several months. At the beginning of the invasion it declared that its objective was to secure a cordon sanitaire  the depth of which it would decide at will  on the pretext of an alleged need to ensure the security of its citizens in the northern area.58. Israel has only been encouraged by the launching of the two invasions to carry out further aggression. We warn the international community of the seriousness of Israel's premeditated plans and intentions regarding the Arab States. It is determined to turn its back on the principles on which a just peace could be achieved. We also warn it against Israel's efforts to impose a sham solution of its own making  the preparations for which have already been initiated in declarations by its leaders that a solution to the Palestinian problem lies outside Palestinian national soil.59.	The international community must take a firm and decisive stand in confronting these ominous plans. It most prevents the aggressor from reaping the fruits of its aggression. The international community must also compel the aggressor to respect the principles of international law and good faith in relations among nations  if we are truly committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter and to safeguarding the region and the world as a whole from the serious consequences of allowing the present situation to continue.60.	The international community  both within the United Nations and outside it  has defined the necessary bases for the achievement of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the region. These include the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since the June 1967 aggression  the return of the Arab City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty  and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including its right to self-determination in conditions of total freedom on Palestinian national soil. Israel has subverted all the international efforts aimed at the attainment of this goal. The most recent example of this was its outright rejection of the ideas put forward by President Reagan although they could not possibly be considered as prejudicing Israel's security.61. In contradistinction to these Israeli policies  which are based on the rejection of peace and attempts to achieve hegemony over the region  there is sincere Jordanian and Arab determination to achieve a just peace which would guarantee rights and ensure security and stability in the region. Jordan accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and has used its influence to persuade others to accept it and support its implementation. Jordan has also supported efforts and initiatives formulated both within and outside the United Nations to ensure the implementation of that resolution and the achievement of a comprehensive settlement  in accordance with universally agreed principles.62. Furthermore  Jordan's role was actively pursued in co-operation with sister Arab States  at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held in Fez in September  in the formulation of a collect e Arab peace initiative compatible with what the international community has resolved should be the framework for peace. We call upon the international community to support this initiative and to strive  resolutely to give effect to it since it offers an historical opportunity which has gained world-wide acceptable  with only Israel dissenting. It is a unique opportunity which must be seized by everyone in order to ensure a just peace and a comprehensive settlement of this whose question  which has threatened international security and the security of the region for the pas: 34 years.63. There is another conflict threatening the stability and security of the region in which we live  namely  the Iraqi-Iranian war that has been raging for about two years. This causes Jordan pain and grief because it involves two Islamic States. Jordan  which respects the Charter and international law and accepts its national responsibilities  supports its sister Iraq in its defence of its national territory and its legitimate rights on its land and waters. Jordan adds its voice to that of the international community in asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively to Security Council resolutions 479 (1980)  514 (1982) and 522 (1982)  as well as to the many mediation efforts aimed at ending the war between the two neighbouring countries. Jordan has also welcomed with satisfaction the initiative taken unilaterally by Iraq for the observance of a cease-fire and withdrawal of its troops to within its international borders in order to open the way for a just settlement that would prevent further bloodshed and destruction. Such a settlement would give each party what rightfully belongs to it and lead to the establishment of good-neighbourly relations between the two countries which would undertake not to interfere in each other's internal affairs.64. Several other parts of the world have been afflicted in the same way as the Middle East region. The racist government of South Africa continues to practise its hateful apartheid policies  to occupy Namibia and to commit acts of aggression against neighbouring African States.65. The international community is duty-bound to take a firm stand against the practices of this racist regime and to apply all the means of pressure available to it  including the sanctions provided for inthe Charter  to compel South Africa to comply with international resolutions.66.	We also call for the implementation of United Nations resolutions pertaining to Afghanistan and Eritrea and for respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination and to express their national will in conditions of total freedom.67.	Jordan also calls for the peaceful solution of the problem of Cyprus through the intercommunal talks under the auspices of the United Nations and within a framework which would preserve the unity  independence and non-aligned status of that country. .68. We support the solution of the problem of Korea by peaceful means through negotiations between the two parts of Korea  in accordance with the joint communique issued in July 1972.69.	It is impossible to separate the gloomy climate pervading the world today  which is based on the use of the military option to solve international issues  from the overall thrust of the arms race. The race to develop or acquire the most modem weapons of destruction  conventional as well as nuclear  has intensified the tendency to use or threaten to use force and hag compelled many States  particularly the developing nations  to seek to acquire arms for their legitimate self-defence at the expense of the satisfaction of their pressing economic and social needs. It is incumbent upon the major Powers to set an example by showing the political will to curb the arms race and to work  guided by the principles of the Charter  to averting aggression  providing an atmosphere of confidence and security for all States that respect international law. It is also imperative to transfer the enormous human and financial resources devoured by the arms race to the task of reforming the international economic order  which is exposed to huge strains and is suffering from a structural disequilibrium. This state of affairs had led many countries  particularly developing countries  into a serious situation  made them incapable of servicing their foreign debts and brought them to the verge of disaster.70.	In this statement I have reviewed some of the gravest problems facing our world today and threatening its resent and future. The family of nations  individually and collectively  must exert serious and sincere efforts to deal with the crises. We must not continue to pursue the policies that have brought the world to the state of degeneration which we are witnessing today and which the Secretary-General has strongly emphasized in his report. It is our earnest hope that the imminence of the danger will increase our awareness of the responsibilities incumbent upon the international community so that it may rise to the challenges confronting it and the world may become a better place to live in."
"75",3611,"JPN",37,1982,"146.	On behalf of the Government and people of Japan  I should like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with your abundant experience and superior wisdom the current session will be a most fruitful one. Please be assured that the delegation of Japan will spare no effort in co-operating with you as you carry out your important tasks.147.	At the same time  I should like to express our deep appreciation to the President of the thirty-sixth session of the Genera! Assembly  Mr. Kittani  for the effective manner in which he discharged his awesome responsibilities.148.	I wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Although it was only a few months ago that he assumed the highest office of the Organization  the leadership that he has demonstrated in dealing with the harsh realities of the international situation has won him our full confidence. It was a great pleasure for me to welcome him to Japan this past summer and have the opportunity candidly to exchange views on the role which the United Nations should play in the maintenance of international peace and security as well as in various fields of international co-operation.149.	In today's international community  with its deepening relationships of interdependence  there is a growing need for nations to co-operate for the attainment of world peace and prosperity. But we cannot fail to notice that tension and distrust continue to persist among nations of the world.150.	In my statement today I should therefore like first to comment on the current international situation and then to present my views on what role the United Nations should play in these circumstances.151.	I believe that one of the major sources of mutual distrust and tension within today's international community is the tendency for one country  as a means of solving international conflicts  to resort to arms and to impose its will on another country by military intervention.152.	I shall discuss first of all the situation in Asia  of which Japan is a part. Kampuchea continues to be the victim of foreign military intervention  and its people are still denied the right of self-determination. Consequently  the Kampuchean people are suffering from disease and starvation  and the flow of refugees out of the country has not yet been stemmed. Japan once again strongly urges Viet Nam to end its military intervention in Kampuchea and agree to enter into negotiations  thereby responding to international efforts toward a comprehensive political settlement  which would include the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Moreover  the United Nations should continue to explore every means of solving the problem of Kampuchea. At the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly  Japan suggested that a representative of the Secretary- General be sent to the countries concerned. That suggestion was implemented during the course of this year  and the Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea dispatched missions to search for ways of solving the problem. Japan strongly supports such United Nations efforts towards a comprehensive political settlement.153.	I should also like at this time to touch upon the situation in the Korean peninsula  which lies just across the sea from Japan. In that region  too  tensions persist  but last January the Government of the Republic of Korea made a proposal on the unification of the South and the North. I welcome and appreciate that proposal because it outlines a procedure that is of a more concrete and realistic nature than anything that has been proposed so far. It is my hope that efforts towards the realization of a dialogue between the South and the North will continue.154.	The Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan has not yet come to an end  which adds to the sufferings of the Afghan people. The Soviet Union must  above all  face up to the fact that its military activities in Afghanistan seriously damage relations of trust and confidence between East and West  and threaten international peace and security. Japan takes this opportunity to appeal once again  in the strongest terms  to the Soviet Union immediately to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and to restore to the Afghan people its right of self-determination.155.	This past year has witnessed an alarming increase in tensions in the Middle East. While Japan duly appreciates Israel's returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in accordance with the Camp David agreements  it strongly denounces other Israeli actions  such as its annexation of the Golan Heights  the reinforcement of its policy of denying the right of self-determination to the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  and its invasion of Lebanon  In particular  Japan demands that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon immediately.156.	Furthermore  the recent massacre of a great number of innocent Palestinian refugees in west Beirut is an extremely outrageous act of violence. Japan registers its indignation at this cruel act. The Government of Japan strongly urges the parties concerned to guarantee the life and security of the civilian population in the area  including the Palestinian inhabitants  in accordance with the relevant Security Council  and other United Nations  resolutions. In this regard  Japan welcomes the redeployment in Beirut of the multinational force comprising troops from the United States  France and Italy.157.	On the other hand  Japan highly appreciates  as contributing to the stability of Lebanon  the fact that Mr. Amin Gemayel has been inaugurated as President in spite of various difficulties  and it earnestly hopes that Lebanon will be united under its new President to achieve the early restoration of its internal order on the basis of national reconciliation and that it will embark on the reconstruction of the country. Japan is prepared to extend all possible co-operation to that end.158.	The recent developments in Lebanon have strengthened Japan's conviction that it is essential to bring about an early settlement of the Middle East peace problem  the core of which is the Palestinian question. In order to achieve a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  it is necessary that Israeli forces be withdrawn from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war  that the right to exist of all the States concerned be respected  and that negotiations be started among the parties concerned  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It is also necessary that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  particularly the right of self-determination  including the right to establish an independent state  be recognized and respected in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.159.	I wish to express my appreciation for the initiative President Reagan took in his Middle East peace proposal of 1 September  which squarely confronts the question of Palestine  the core of the Middle East problem. Shortly after President Reagan made his proposal  the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  adopted its own peace proposal. Japan highly values the fact that Arab countries are united in showing their will for peace. It is our earnest hope that the parties concerned will bear these proposals in mind and will resume efforts for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem.160.	The continued fighting between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq is also a source of grave concern to me. Japan renews its appeal to both countries to cease their fighting without delay and to settle the conflict by peaceful means.161.	Turning our attention now to Eastern Europe  we note that the extraordinary state of affairs in Poland persists. This threatens to endanger the relationship of East-West co-operation and exchange which has been pursued to date and is likely seriously to affect the peace and stability of the world. Japan hopes that the present problems will be resolved by the Polish people themselves and that a genuine national reconciliation will be achieved in the near future.162.	In these international circumstances  Japan is determined to maintain its basic policy of pursuing peace  of refusing to become a military Power and of contributing to the building of world peace and prosperity. In accordance with that policy  Japan has endeavoured to promote friendly and co-operative relations with other countries throughout the world.174. From this point of view  Japan sincerely hopes to develop stable relations based on genuine mutual understanding with the Soviet Union  one of its most important neighbours. However  there remains between Japan and the Soviet Union the unsettled problem of the Northern Territories  the reversion of which Japan has consistently demanded from the Soviet Union. It is due to that problem that our two countries have not yet concluded a peace treaty. Moreover  we have been confronted with the extremely regrettable situation of the Soviet Union recently having deployed and strengthened its military forces in the Northern Territories. Measures such as those in no way foster relations of trust between States. The Government of Japan strongly urges the Soviet Union to rectify this situation promptly and to come to the negotiating table with a view to settling the issue of the Northern Territories and thereby to concluding a peace treaty.173. The mutual distrust and increased tensions which prevail in today's international community contain the danger of luring mankind into catastrophe. And yet the United Nations  which was created to save mankind from such a danger  cannot claim that it has been discharging its tasks to the full.176.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has deplored this state of affairs  stating that ""... we have strayed far from the Charter in recent years.  The Security Council... all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action... and its resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored ... [The] process of peaceful settlement of disputes... is often brushed aside.... We are perilously near to a new international anarchy "".177.	It is precisely times such as these that require a serious re-examination of the ways to build relations of mutual trust between nations and to attain peace and prosperity throughout the world. It is precisely at such times that we must remind ourselves that the Organization was established with the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which has brought untold sorrow to mankind.178.	I believe that the United Nations must strengthen whatever functions it can fulfil so that mutual distrust will never again be a threat to our future. With that in mind  I should like to stress the following three requirements for developing relations of mutual trust among States through the United Nations: first  the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations should be strengthened; secondly  United Nations functions in the field of disarmament should be enhanced; and  thirdly  the United Nations role in the fields of economic and social development should be reinforced.179.	I should like first to elaborate on the question of strengthening the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations. The primary purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. However  as the Secretary-General has pointed out  the Organization has not functioned with sufficient effectiveness to that end. If we regard this situation as inevitable and simply dismiss it  the trust that nations place in the Organization will surely be lost and its foundation undermined. Accordingly I wish now to raise a few issues regarding the United Nations peace-keeping functions and to express my ideas on how to improve and strengthen those functions.180.	One of these issues relates to the role of the Secretary-General. I should like to urge that  as one of the ways in which the United Nations could function to prevent international conflicts  the Secretary-General  whenever he deems that peace is being threatened  take the initiative and immediately contact the parties concerned in an effort to prevent a worsening of the situation. I believe that all Member States should co-operate so that the authority of the Secretary-General may be utilized to the maximum extent.181.	Moreover  my Government has in the past proposed that the Secretary-General send his representative to investigate the facts In areas of dispute. I should like to stress again that the Secretary-General's authority in this regard should also be fully put to use.182.	In addition  I am convinced that the Secretary- General's authority in the field of mediation and conciliation must be strengthened. In so doing it is essential that parties to a dispute show courage in accepting and co-operating positively with the mediation and conciliation efforts of the Secretary-General or his representative. The Secretary-General has in fact dispatched his representatives to areas of concern in an effort to settle problems relating to  for example  the question of Kampuchea  the situation in Afghanistan and the conflict between Iran and Iraq; and the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General himself in the conflict over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) were particularly valuable. Therefore  although they may not always bring about immediate results  it is important that the Secretary-General's mediation and conciliation efforts be patiently continued. I believe that such efforts will contribute to the restoration and strengthening of relations of trust between parties  which serve as the basis for the peaceful settlement of disputes.183.	A second issue that I wish to raise in connection with the strengthening of the United Nations peacekeeping functions is the role of the Security Council. As we all know  the Security Council is given the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Regrettably  however  the Council has not performed its tasks effectively. I believe it is vital that the members of the Council  responding to the trust placed in them  strive to restore to that organ its functions as originally envisaged. It is particularly important that its permanent members recognize anew the significance of their duties and co-operate among themselves. In his report  to which I have already referred  the Secretary-General also points out that co-operation among the permanent members of the Council is indispensable for its effectiveness  and he makes a special appeal to them to reassess their obligations and responsibilities. I support that appeal  and would also urge the permanent members to consider seriously the need for strengthening the Security Council's functions. 184.	Lastly  while the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations have contributed to the quelling of local disputes and the maintenance of cease-fires  there is a definite need to explore ways of enabling these operations to function in a more effective  manner. These peace-keeping operations have been playing an invaluable role; but it cannot be denied that they suffer from the absence of a clear provision in the Charter regarding their activities  which means that they have to be set up each time a conflict occurs. In these times  when conflicts between nations occur frequently  it is necessary to re-examine the peacekeeping operations with a view to enabling them to be deployed with sufficient speed and efficiency.185.	A number of points could be considered  such as a system of prior registration and organization of the personnel  equipment and materials which Member States are ready to contribute to future operations; the holding by the United Nations of study and training exercises relating to peace-keeping operations; and the securing of effective financial backing In his report the Secretary-General  too  suggests that the Security Council should urgently undertake a study of how to strengthen the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. I earnestly hope that a study on the strengthening of the peace-keeping functions of the United Nations will be made  taking the Secretary- General's suggestions into consideration. Japan  for its part  is ready to co-operate more actively in the strengthening of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.186.	With regard to the United Nations peacekeeping functions  I should like to comment on the role played by the Organization in efforts to achieve the independence of Namibia. We note that in spite of the serious efforts of the parties concerned the process of elections under the supervision of the United Nations has not yet commenced. I strongly hope that the parties concerned will continue to work towards the achievement of Namibian independence  and that the decolonization efforts of the United Nations will be successful. Japan reaffirms its readiness to co-operate with UNTAG by providing civilian personnel  as well as in other appropriate ways  once it begins operation.187.	The second area that I should like to discuss with regard to strengthening the role of the United Nations is that of disarmament. Today the heightening of international tensions and of distrust among States is accelerating the arms race  and the expanded arms race in turn adds to the mutual distrust and tension  threatening the very survival of mankind. In these circumstances  it is hardly surprising that the calls of nations  including my own  for disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  have reached unprecedented levels.188.	Against this background of increased awareness of disarmament issues throughout the international community  the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second special session devoted to disarmament  was convened last June  with the participation of the Prime Minister of Japan  Suzuki  and many other heads of State or Government. Although it was earnestly hoped that at that special session the Assembly would adopt a document on a comprehensive programme of disarmament  it was regrettably unable to do so. Nevertheless  the special session unanimously reaffirmed the validity of the Final Document in resolution S-10/2  and the conviction was expressed that the deliberations at the second session would provide a powerful impetus to efforts towards promoting disarmament. 189.	Through the deliberations at the second special session on disarmament  we were once again made; to feel keenly how difficult it is to promote disarmament under the prevailing tense international situation. At the. same time  the special session provided us with the opportunity to strengthen the conviction shared by all Member States that by continuing our disarmament efforts under these   circumstances we shall further solidify the foundations of peace and security of the international community. We must not lose the momentum gained at the second special session  but must promote  step by step  international efforts towards achieving disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament.190.	At the 5th meeting of the twelfth special session  Prime Minister Suzuki reiterated Japan's national commitment to peace and its refusal to become a military power  while upholding its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing nuclear weapons  not producing them and not permitting their introduction into Japan. On the basis of this fundamental position  he proposed three principles for the achievement of peace through disarmament: first the promotion of disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament; secondly  the utilization of the human and physical resources which would be released by disarmament to alleviate poverty and social instability and  thirdly the strengthening and reinforcement of United Nations peace-keeping functions for the promotion of disarmament. Japan is resolved to continue to play a positive role in the United Nations and in other forums so that these principles can be realized as soon as possible. Japan has emphasized that a comprehensive nuclear test ban and the prohibition of chemical weapons are the most urgent tasks to be pursued by the international community and that they should be realized as soon as possible. Japan is determined to continue to contribute to the promotion of negotiations on these items in the Committee on Disarmament.191.	Moreover  Japan has been undertaking steps to implement the proposals which the Prime Minister made at the special session  particularly the proposal to install in the United Nations documentation and materials concerning Japan's atomic bomb experiences? and to extend co-operation under the United Nations Disarmament Fellowship Programme to enable participants to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.^ Following up the proposal regarding international efforts to ensure and guarantee the security of nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes^ Japan  at the 1983 session of the Committee on Disarmament  submitted an outline of a draft protocol on the prohibition of attacks against nuclear facilities. We are resolved to persevere in these steady efforts for the process of disarmament. 192.	It goes without saying that progress in nuclear disarmament hinges upon those States which have primary responsibility in this field  namely  the nuclear-weapon States  particularly the two nuclear super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union. It should be emphasized once again that bilateral efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union  together with multinational efforts  are absolutely necessary in the promotion of nuclear disarmament. The people of the entire world  fearful of the danger of nuclear war and earnestly desiring nuclear disarmament  are united in placing their hopes on the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces and the strategic arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan strongly calls upon both countries to respond to those hopes and to concentrate their efforts to expedite these negotiations so as to produce tangible results as soon as possible.193.	In this connection  I wish to recall that  as part of his official trip to Japan shortly after the second special session devoted to disarmament  the Secretary-General visited Hiroshima  where he reaffirmed his recognition of the earnest hope of the Japanese people that the nuclear holocaust will never be repeated  and expressed renewed determination to strive for nuclear disarmament. I should like to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-General and to assure him that I fully share his determination.194.	In addition to peace-keeping and disarmament  a third area in which the role of the United Nations should be strengthened is that of economic and social development. The world economy is today facing a serious crisis  one which affects developed and developing countries alike  and there is no prospect that the future will necessarily be any brighter. Developing countries in particular are suffering from a considerable slow-down in their economic growth  a deterioration in their balance of payments and an accumulation of external debt  and it was reported in the United Nations this year that the per capita domestic product of these countries as a group recorded negative growth for the first time since the 1950s.195.	This situation must not be allowed to remain as it is. My country  recognizing that the revitalization of the world economy  along with the further development of the developing countries  is essential for the attainment of world peace and prosperity  has actively participated in the North-South dialogue in various United Nations forums  including UNCTAD  and has thus contributed to the establishment of better North-South relations. It will continue to be the policy of my Government to maintain and promote constructive dialogue with the developing countries and further to strengthen co-operation to promote their economic and social development. This policy is embodied in the new medium-term target established last year  under which my Government is endeavouring to expand its official development assistance. My Government is making these efforts despite an extremely stringent budgetary situation  and we would expect that the developing countries would for their part further intensify their development efforts so that official development assistance might be more effectively utilized.	'196.	The global negotiations on international co-operation for development can be expected to play a very great role in advancing North-South dialogue in the 1980s. Japan realizes the political significance of the global negotiations and sincerely hopes that every arrangement for launching them will be completed as soon as possible. In this regard  my country strongly hopes that  the General Assembly in a spirit of co-operation  will at its current session achieve concrete results and  to this end  Japan intends to participate actively in consultations with other countries.197.	In addition to efforts to launch the global negotiations  Japan believes that all of us are responsible for assuring the success of the sixth session of UNCTAD to be held next June. The Conference has ambitiously tackled the problem of promoting international economic co-operation at the global level in the fields of trade and development  and since its first session in 1964 it has achieved concrete results. Japan strongly hopes that with such a history and such experience behind it  UNCTAD will at its sixth session seek realistic and workable solutions to the problems of trade and development  which constitute one of the most important issues facing mankind today  I wish to reaffirm Japan's resolve to participate actively in these efforts.198.	I wish also to take this opportunity to appear strongly to all States to ratify as soon as possible the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities "" the greatest achievement of North- South dialogue in the 1970s  so that this agreement will enter into force by the target date  which is the end of next September.199.	The United Nations  in protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in working to achieve solutions to social problems such as those relating to refugees  women  children  the disabled  the aging  population and the environment  is playing an important role in the world today. Japan is highly gratified that  particularly in recent years  international co-operation in these fields has been consistently productive and has contributed to the improvement and development of the welfare of mankind. We shall contribute actively to such co-operative efforts as we have done in the past.200.	In this connection  I should especially like to pay a tribute to the activities of the various United Nations organs for the relief of refugees. At present  the international community is faced with several refugee problems for which there is no solution yet in sight  in places such as Indo-China  Afghanistan  the Middle East  Poland  Africa and Central America. I recently had the opportunity to visit an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan. I must say that when I saw how the people there were being obliged to live in a state of deprivation  away from their homeland  I felt real sympathy for them.201.	I strongly urge the United Nations to make further efforts for the relief of refugees. At the same time  I fully realize that in order to achieve a real solution to the refugee problem  it is essential to deal with its root causes. Japan  for its part  has provided considerable financial assistance to United Nations activities for the relief of refugees and will continue to extend the utmost co-operation for this purpose. I should also like to reiterate Japan's continued determination to provide its economic co-operation to countries such as Thailand  which are burdened with a huge influx of refugees  and our intention to continue to accept Indo-Chinese refugees in Japan.202.	In order for the United Nations to carry out thoroughly the functions I have mentioned  it is clearly essential that its financial base be strengthened.I should therefore like to make a strong appeal to every Member State to meet without fail the payment of its assessments and to increase its voluntary contributions.203.	At the same time  I believe it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to strive to make its activities more effective and efficient. In order for the United Nations to carry out its functions effectively within the limited resources at its disposal and to retain the confidence of Member States  the Secretariat will have to make every effort to achieve greater efficiency  for example by reviewing its administrative structure and its activities  as well as by redistributing resources from activities of lower priority to those of higher priority. Needless to say  we  the States Members of the United Nations  simply must co-operate to achieve these ends.204.	In today's international community  differences in race  culture or creed often tend to foment mutual distrust  which becomes an obstacle in the process of peace and stability among nations. And yet  today  because the peoples of the world are growing ever more interdependent  no country can enjoy its own peace and prosperity unless the peace and stability of the entire community of nations is secure. The interests of each State are closely linked to those of the whole world. In this sense  today's international community can indeed be characterized as a community sharing the same destiny. We must all realize that each of us belongs to this community and must co-operate for the development of the community as a whole and refrain from pursuing solely the interests of our own country.205.	The United Nations is the only truly global organization we have. Overcoming numerous constraints and difficulties and exercising its greatest wisdom and efforts  mankind has developed the United Nations in order to pursue such co-operation among nations. We  as its Member States  are therefore duty bound to support the Organization and to make maximum use of it as the centre of international co-operation. I appeal to all Member States to build relations of trust with one another with the United Nations at the centre and do their utmost to achieve enduring peace and prosperity for humanity.206.	I wish to conclude my remarks by declaring that Japan  a country whose commitment to supporting and co-operating with the United Nations is a major pillar of its foreign policy  is resolved to make every effort toward attaining that goal."
"76",3683,"KEN",37,1982,"I should like to join previous speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Hollai on his election to the high and onerous office of Presi¬dent of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His election is proof of the confidence placed in him personally and in his country by the General Assembly. I wish him all the best in guiding the work of the session to a successful conclusion. On behalf of my delegation  I pledge our full support in all his endeavors. Also  I wish to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who successfully and with singular distinction guided the work of the General Assembly throughout the thirty-sixth session and the special and emergency sessions. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his untiring efforts and the wisdom he displayed at all times. This is also a fitting occasion for me to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and the entire staff of the United Nations for the work they have done during the past year.216.	In the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization   we note the many prob¬lems and difficulties he has identified as conflicts between national aims and Charter goals—resort to confrontation  sporadic violence and even war itself in pursuit of w at are perceived as vital interests  claims and aspirations. I wish to assure him that my country will  as always  heed his appeal to all Govern¬ments for their rededication and commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter.217.	The guiding spirit of my Government  under the leadership of President Daniel Arap Moi  is peace  democracy and justice for all under the rule of law in a system which recognizes the supremacy of Parlia¬ment. Another fundamental objective of the Govern¬ment is the improvement of the economic and social well-being of our people in unity  freedom and love for one another. All our actions—on the domestic front as well as in the international arena  are geared to promote  project and vigorously defend these goals. With all our might and within our resources  our people stand united in their resolve to ensure that our present population and future generations enjoy the fruits of peace  unity and stability while respecting the dignity of the individual in freedom. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all nations and peoples which are  in turn  willing to do the same to us in good faith.218.	As we have gathered here for the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  we cannot help looking back and taking stock of the achievements and failures of the Organization. We are certain that when the balance-sheet is drawn up the results will be unmistakably on the side of success. Whenever world peace and security have been threatened  the General Assembly has always exerted maximum pres¬sure in favor of peace  tranquility and mutual under¬standing. It is Kenya's sincere hope that the votes cast in the Assembly will continue to reflect the general will of the international community to maintain peace and security for all nations  as well as their resolve to improve the well-being of mankind as a whole. Those who are entrusted by the Charter with the maintenance of international peace should pay more attention to the resolutions that are adopted year after year by the Assembly. These resolutions truly reflect the concerns of the world community.219.	I should like first to make a brief survey of the African scene in the context of the aims and objectives of the United Nations. When my President addressed the General Assembly at the 11th  meeting of the thirty-sixth session  he indicated in his statement that at that time a number of agreed and concrete steps were being taken to re-establish peace and good order in Chad. For the steps being taken to succeed in restoring that peace and good order  it was neces¬sary for those directly concerned faithfully to adhere strictly to  and fully implement in good faith  the established programmes. Developments since then  however  have shown that lasting peace continues to elude the people of Chad.220.	In the case of Western Sahara  the way had finally been cleared for a cease-fire agreement and the holding of a referendum by means of which the people of the Territory were to determine their own future  We all know that the events which ensued led to severe disagreement among African countries and that today the OAU stands partially paralyzed because of these deep-seated differences. It is my Govern¬ment's sincere hope that the ongoing consultations among member States of the OAU will lead to the removal of the obstacles now standing in the way of unity in our continental organization.221.	In South Africa the tragedy of apartheid con¬tinues. The racist South African regime seeks to per¬petuate its illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of decisions of this body. After decades of condemna¬tion and protests by all peace-loving peoples of the world  including some whites in South Africa itself  the evil and inhuman system of apartheid Continues to flourish  even though it embraces the total denial of political rights to the majority. Opposition to apartheid is met with brutal force against defenseless people  among them children. It is a system which violates all the universal principles of human dignity on which the United Nations itself is based; yet all our efforts to get stronger action to be taken against South Africa continue to meet with resistance. We have adopted in the Assembly countless resolutions condemning the system. We have held many inter¬national gatherings which have exposed and equally condemned the evil system practiced by the racist minority bent on destroying the very tenets of civilized conduct. Are we going to step there?222.	In pursuance of its policies of seeking to per¬petuate racist domination in South Africa and to maintain its illegal occupation of Namibia  as well as to expand its political influence beyond its borders  the regime has resorted to constant acts of aggres¬sion  subversion  destabilization and terrorism against neighbouring independent African States.223.	Speaking in this Hall  our col¬league the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola out¬lined in precise terms the extent of the military aggres¬sion carried out by the racist regime of South Africa against the front-line States and the continuing military occupation by South Africa of large parts of his country  Angola. Was the General Assembly estab¬lished to listen impotently to such horror stories of aggression  military occupation and deliberate destabilization year after year without corresponding action by the world community to put an end to the shame and indignity narrated by such stories?224.	In resolution 418 (1977) the Security Council  in a modest step forward  imposed an arms embargo against South Africa. The Security Council decided that the sale of arms to South Africa represented a threat to international peace and security. We all know that it is not the sale of arms that represents the threat  for South Africa is already heavily armed and has a sophisticated arms industry of its own. Rather it is the regime itself and its policy of apartheid that represents the threat to international peace and security.225.	The time has come when the international community must wake up to the gravity of the situa¬tion in this area. There is no longer any time left for ambiguity and for prevarication over apartheid  We must therefore urge the international community  the Security Council and particularly those permanent numbers of the Council  friends of South Africa  to declare without any qualification that the situation in South Africa poses a threat to international peace and security under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter 226.	Information has come to us through the public media to the effect that the racist regime is making moves to remove petty apartheid in public places. Let us not be confused by such information. We have all along been calling for the total eradication of apartheid. My country  Kenya  will not allow itself to be deceived by such propaganda. We must reject such deceit. We must remain confident that the struggleto put an end to the apartheid system itself will succeed. We must continue to give every assistance possible to our freedom fighters in South Africa and Namibia in their legitimate struggle under the leadership of their respective liberation movements until final victory is won.227.	In the 37 years of the United Nations history voluminous records exist of the illegal and brutal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. Not content with the illegal occupation  South Africa has converted Namibia into a military base  a spring-board from which it has carried out frequent  regular  unprovoked armed attacks against neighbouring States. South Africa has  since 1966  defiantly resisted every move towards a peaceful termination of its illegal occupation of Namibia. All such proposals have been spurned with impunity by the regime. Indeed  Africa and the entire world community is bound to ask what it is that South Africa wants. Four years ago the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia was adopted by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). At the time that resolution was adopted  we had hoped that South Africa had regained its senses and was ready to co-operate in implementing a peaceful tran¬sition to independence for Namibia. Our hope has been rudely dashed by South Africa's intransigence. Instead of moving towards the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence the regime has resorted to an intensified war against the liberation forces—the forces of SWAPO—and against the neighbouring States  particularly Angola and Mozambique. Has not the time come for the United Nations to act decisively? We say yes and the time is now. Over the years in our negotiations for the liberation of Namibia we have been patient. We have shown flexibility. We have been reasonable. SWAPO has made significant concessions with regard to the unreasonable demands made by South Africa. On the other hand  South Africa has taken advantage of our patience and moderation and has in fact escalated its offensive beyond the borders of Namibia.229.	In our continued commitment to a peaceful solution the Namibian problem  Africa has not lost hope m the negotiating machinery despite the duplicity shown by South Africa. During the last eight weeks or so the African contact group has been negotiating with the five Western States for the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence according to resolution 435 (1978). Although these negotiations have been going on for some time  pronouncements coming from South Africa offer little proof that it is now ready for the implementation of Namibia's independence as laid down in the United Nations plan. Some of those involved in the negotia¬tions say that South Africa is now ready to comply with the United Nations plan. This is not the first time we have heard this. We must remain cautious about such statements  because while the current negotiations are under way  South Africa continues its aggression against Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe and indeed against all its neighbors. We have every reason for serious doubts of South Africa's sincerity in all these negotiations  given its past history of wrecking negotiations at the eleventh hour. As soon as SWAPO makes one concession  South Africa brings forward more unacceptable demands to be fulfilled as a condi¬tion for making further progress. It is therefore not difficult to see the cause of our frustration and the reasons for our impatience.230.	But we must not confuse the issue of Namibia's dependence and the territorial integrity of Angola. We should like to make it clear  as we have always done before  that the problem regarding Namibia's independence stems solely from South Africa's refusal to get out of Namibia  which it con¬tinues to occupy illegally. We shall not accept pro¬paganda conceived in super-Power context in order to justify South Africa's presence in Namibia and its continued aggression against Angola. We view the situation with great concern. By now South Africa should know that its puppets inthe so-called Demo¬cratic Tumhalle Alliance have no political support in Namibia and cannot win a fair election. These puppets will be rejected by the people of Namibia just and the puppets of Ian Smith were rejected by the people of Zimbabwe. In fact it is this fear  the fear of this truth  which frightens the racist regime of South Africa.231.	The international community must face its responsibility in Namibia squarely. We remain extremely concerned that the United Nations efforts have been frustrated by the use of the veto in the Security Council. We have the rather anomalous situation where those whose efforts for the inde¬pendence of Namibia are being spurned by South Africa are at the same time those who are protecting South Africa with vetoes against the stronger action called for by South Africa's intransigence. Something must be done to end that anomaly.232.	We in Africa have come a long way in our struggle to liberate our continent from regimes based on race and colonialism. We will not stop in our drive at the border of Namibia. That should serve as a clear message to South Africa and its friends.233.	I will now draw the Assembly's attention to one of the most dangerous areas on the international scene today. I refer to events in the Middle East  specifically in Lebanon. The situation in this area has remained tense  with violent conflicts flaring up  over the past three decades and that long-standing conflict is still not resolved. Despite the efforts of the international community over the years aimed at finding a peaceful solution  intransigence has not given way to compromise. Instead  one community has sought to annihilate another community. In the past three months  we have all witnessed a new onslaught launched by Israel in total disregard of all the rules of international law and morality. Israel arbitrarily and militarily occupied the sovereign State of Lebanon  a State Member of the United Nations. The destruction of life that has taken place in Lebanon leaver us all shocked and horrified  particularly with regard to the recent massacre of Palestinian refugees in Beirut. That indiscriminate killing of innocent people  including women and children  in the refugee coups in Beirut is a gross viola on of human rights and accepted international law and morality. As my Presi¬dent said in his statement on the tragedy  this callous and barbaric act against defenseless Palestinians  coming as it did soon after the evacuation of Palestinian military personnel from Lebanon  shocked the con¬science of the world and must be vigorously con¬demned by all peace-loving nations. President Moi has repeatedly stated that Kenya values human life and will always condemn acts which destroy life. I wish to reiterate here Kenya's conviction that no lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved without due recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to inde¬pendence and to a sovereign homeland of their own. Once again  Kenya calls for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli and all other foreign troops from Lebanese territory  in the interest of peace and stability in the region.234.	I wish to make some observations on another matter that continues to be of concern to the Organi¬zation. Kenya has supported in the past and will continue to support in the future the proposal that the Indian Ocean be designated a zone of peace. Hence  for us in Kenya  the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is not a political slogan; rather  it is imperative for our own security in our attempts to safeguard our territorial integrity. In this spirit  Kenya supports the call for an international conference to consider all the aspects of this problem. We urge all the maritime States to co-operate fully in the preparations for such a conference.235.	This regular session of the Assembly is taking place soon after the conclusion of the second special session on disarmament. I expressed the views of my Government on that matter when I addressed the Assembly at the 19th meeting of the twelfth special session. The outcome of that special session will of course be interpreted differently by different Govern¬ments  but in the opinion of my Government  the results of that session were too meager to confer upon it the label of success. Most regrettably  at the second special session on disarmament held in June and July of this year the Assembly failed to elaborate and adopt a comprehensive program of disarm¬ament. On reviewing the implementation of the recommendations and decisions of the first special session  at the second special session concrete and practical proposals for removing the impediments to progress in disarmament negotiations could not even be agreed on.236.	The continuing deterioration of the international situation and the intensification of the arms race have brought the world to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. In such a political climate  no progress can be made on disarmament negotiations. We therefore call on all States  in particular the nuclear Powers and other militarily significant States  to demonstrate the political will and firm commitment necessary for the implemen¬tation of the recommendations made and the decisions taken in the field of disarmament.237.	As stated earlier  the international political situa¬tion has not taken a turn for the better. We are disap-pointed that despite the Organization's call for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea and of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  no movement in that direction has been taken by those concerned. Similarly  the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus continue to be ignored  and the intercommunal talks which we have supported appear to be unnecessarily protracted. We also note with continuing disappoint¬ment and deep regret that the conflict between Iran and Iraq has not ended  in spite of intensive efforts from many quarters. We hope that the two non- aligned nations will allow good sense to prevail and will cease the senseless hostilities that have taken such a toll in human lives and untold economic disruption. In the same vein  we support the aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country. In our statement to the General Assembly at the 27th meeting of the thirty-fifth session  my delegation expressed concern at the unilateral suspen¬sion of the then ongoing South-North working level contacts by North Korea and urged the South and the North of Korea  the two parties directly con¬cerned  to resume the dialogue immediately in accordance with the letter and spirit of the joint communique of 4 July 1972 in order to ease tension and to improve relations. No progress seems to have been made so far  and my delegation would like to renew that appeal.238.	The Government of Kenya is gravely concerned about the critical situation in which the world economy finds itself today. The effects of the deepening reces¬sion hurt the developing countries the most  because it is those countries that experience acute problems of balance of payments  falling per capita income  rapidly rising unemployment and high rates of inflation  to mention only a few. Those problems are magnified by the reluctance of the developed countries to acknowledge the importance of multilateral co-oper¬ation in the solution of international economic problems. The transfer of resources in real terms to developing countries has been steadily declining and the growth of the gross domestic product in the developing nations has decelerated to a level of 0.6 per cent from an average of 5.5 per cent achieved during the 1970s. That trend in the world economic situation paints a very gloomy picture of the eco¬nomies of the developing countries  which are adversely affected by external factors.239.	Energy is undoubtedly an essential element of the development process  but it continues to be a very serious problem  particularly for developing nations like my own  Kenya  which are most adversely affected by the energy crisis. The need to shift the dependency of nations from petroleum to a greater reliance on alternative sources of energy was one of the points I stressed when I addressed the Assembly on 7 October 1980. On that occasion  I said  infer for It is our hope that the United Nations Con¬ference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  to be held at Nairobi in August 1981  will offer the world community a rare opportunity to find alternative solutions to our energy problems.240.	As you will recall  that Conference was held in Nairobi as planned  and its outcome was the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utiliza¬tion of New and Renewable Sources of Energy.for  As you also know  the Assembly last year took some important decisions on the Nairobi Conference on energy pursuant to the provisions of Assembly resolution 35/204. Noteworthy among the actions of the Assembly at its thirty-sixth session were the decisions concerning the financial and institutional arrangements for new and renewable sources of energy  which have to be finalized at this session of the Assembly. The Interim Committee established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 36/193 met in Rome in June of this year  but it did not succeed in its primary task regarding the immediate launching of the imple¬mentation of the Nairobi Programme of Action. It is thus clear that at this session the Assembly has to take certain fundamental decisions as a follow-up to the Nairobi Conference on energy. First  we have to decide on the question of mobilization of financial resources for harnessing new and renewable energy resources. In this regard  the role of the United Nations must be recognized  and bilateral arrange¬ments for raising funds should supplement  but not replace  multilateral arrangements. Secondly  United Nations activities carried out in implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action must be well co-ordi¬nated. In this connection  my delegation deems it necessary to establish a secretariat which would also service an intergovernmental body  which the Assembly should designate  for new and renewable energy sources. The delegation of Kenya stands ready to participate actively in the discussions of this item now and in the future.241.	Turning now to the question of science and technology for development  I should like to stress again the significance which my Government attaches to the strengthening of the capacity of the developing countries in the fields of science and technology. We have always been keenly interested and have actively participated at high governmental levels in international conferences and good-will missions constituted to discuss issues of science and technology for development  especially of the developing coun¬tries  because we believe that science and technology are crucial vehicles not only for the implementation of the Third United Nations Development Decade  but also for the early attainment of the new inter¬national economic order. It is regrettable that  three years after the conclusion of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development no substantial agreement has been reached on the establishment of a permanent United Nations financing system for science and technology for development. My Government calls urgently for the early resolution of the unresolved issues in the Vienna Programme of Action through intensified negotiations within the appropriate United Nations bodies  including the Intergovernmental Committee for Science and Technology for Development.242.	Of particular importance to my country as a developing nation is the question of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries themselves. Kenya has repeatedly called on developing nations to intensify their activities at subregional  regional and interregional levels and in all fields. It was in this spirit that we participated in the formula¬tion and adoption of the Caracas Programme of Action  the implementation of which has been enhanced by the North-South meetings held during this year  which included the meeting of the Group of 77 held last month in Manila to review the imple¬mentation of the Caracas Programme of Action. In certain regionsalso new initiatives for interregional and subregional co-operation have emerged. These have included the intensive negotiations held among 18 countries of eastern and southern Africa  including my own country  which resulted in the signing in Lusaka  in December 1981 of a treaty establishing a preferential trade area for that African region.243.	With regard to industrial development  we wel¬come the recommendations of the sixteenth session of the Industrial Development Board and call for their early implementation. We note with appreciation the full recognition in the Industrial Development Board's report on that session of the significance of the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. As the Assembly knows  Kenya will play host to the Fourth General Conference of UNIDO  in 1984  and the success of that Conference will depend to a large extent on the attitude nations display during the preparatory process for it. We there¬fore hope that this process will be intensified in order to ensure positive results from this forthcoming UNIDO Conference in Nairobi.244.	We are aware of the report submitted to the Assembly on the work of the fifth session of the Commission on Human Settlements and of the two sessions held this year by the Governing Council of UNEP. The important recommenda¬tions of those sessions need to be implemented  and for that to be done adequate financial resources are necessary. My delegation therefore calls on the devel¬oped donor countries  and others in a position to do so  to make substantial contributions towards the implementation of the planned activities in the fields of the environment and human settlements.245.	Kenya would like to see a substantial increase in the trade of developing nations in manufactures. We condemn protectionism in all its forms  and we believe that at the sixth session of UNCTAD  to be held in 1983  serious attempts will be made to tackle all the critical issues encountered by the international community in the Held of trade and development. My delegation therefore calls upon the Assembly to take concrete action at this session to ensure the success of the sixth session of UNCTAD.246.	The critical economic situation facing Africa  which is the least developed of all the continents  requires concerted international action. It was in this spirit that the Lagos Plan of Action for the Imple¬mentation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa was adopted. Kenya calls on the international community to extend the technical and financial assistance necessary for the implemen¬tation of the Lagos Plan of Action in its entirety.247.	Africa also faces acute food problems  as recent reports have shown. Food and agricultural production has drastically declined in recent years  owing  inter alia to changes in climatic conditions  inadequate investment in the food sector  and lack of storage facilities. The international community must take urgent collective measures to alleviate the critical food shortages and attain collective self-sufficiency in food  to increase food and agricultural production  food storage  and food security  as well as to increase capital from external resources. We look forward to greater assistance from both bilateral donors and multilateral sources. More assistance from FAO and the World Food Council would be greatly appreciated  particularly by the food-deficient coun¬tries of the developing world.248.	I wish now to turn to the issue of special eco¬nomic and disaster-relief assistance. My Government commends the efforts of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator. We reiterate our full support for the activities of that Office and call on all donor countries to increase their contributions to that important body in order to enable it to deal more efficiently and promptly with disasters  wherever and whenever they occur in the disaster-stricken and disaster-prone areas of the world  especially in Africa. The Kenyan delegation will continue to attach special importance to this problem and to participate actively ininternational deliberations on it.249.	One of the historic events of this decade has been the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The occasion not only marked the emergence of a new legal regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the seas  the sea-bed  and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof; it also demonstrated clearly the importance of equitable compromise in the interest of all mankind. The Convention has been the result of hard negotiations over a period  of many years  and it is Kenya's hope that even those coun¬tries which were not able to support the Convention at its adoption will find it necessary and possible to support it in future in order to ensure uniformity in its implementation and use. We also hope that the same spirit displayed by nations at the adoption of the Convention will be demonstrated by their ratification of it.250.	In this and other forums we have consistently condemned the activities of mercenaries. In the recent past we have witnessed increased use of mercenaries against the territorial integrity and independence of many developing countries. We cannot stress strongly enough the need to bring this heinous crime to an end through concerted international action. AH those participating in mercenary activities belong to States  and urgent measures are required to outlaw mercena¬ries and to stop their activities permanently. Peace- loving people everywhere are anxiously awaiting action to eliminate this heinous crime. We cannot afford to disappoint our peoples.251.	I should like to conclude my remarks by reiter¬ating Kenya's total faith in the principles underlying the Charter of the United Nations and our belief that in the end the nations of this world will have to swim together—or sink together."
"77",3754,"KHM",37,1982,"This is the sixth time in a quarter of a century that I have had the honor to come to this rostrum to defend before the representatives of Member States the interests of my country and its people.2.	Today  as on the last occasion when I addressed the Security Council  in 1979 ' following the occupation of Kampuchea by the armed forces of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  it is for the very existence of my country as a free and sovereign State that I seek to be the spokesman before the Assembly.3.	I wish at the outset to express my most respectful good wishes to the President of the Assembly. May I be permitted to salute very respectfully Mr. Kittani  and congratulate him very cordially on the outstanding leadership he provided at the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly and on his great ability  sense of fairness and integrity I extend respectful good wishes to the Secretary-General  whose high sentiments and deep devotion to the cause of justice and peace we all admire.4.	May I be permitted also to salute the delegations present here  amongst which it is my honor and privilege to count many faithful friends  in the name of my country  its Coalition Government and all patriots who struggle in acutely difficult circumstances  but with fierce determination  for the liberation of their country.5.	Contrary to certain false allegations  our Government is not a Government in exile. All its members live and fight in the interior of our national territory  side by side with our heroic fighters. For  despite the efforts of a powerful Vietnamese army in control of Kampuchean territory  we have liberated and solidly held large zones not only near the Thai frontier  but also in several regions of the south-west and the north-east of our country.6.	Last July I myself visited my compatriots in three liberated zones  travelling by car  on Coot and on elephant  deep into the interior of our country. Everywhere I was welcomed by well-armed and disciplined military units and by tens of thousands of civilians  amongst whom I had the satisfaction to note an impressive number of little children.7.	My country and its Coalition Government wish to express their profound gratitude to the United Nations for having  since 1979  rejected the pretensions of the regime installed by a foreign Power in our capital  a Power which seeks to obtain the seat of Kampuchea in the Assembly's midst. Here everyone —including those who support its candidature to this seat—knows that that regime has no real existence  that it is under the control of Vietnamese occupying authorities and that it depends in everything and for everything on the protection of two foreign nations.8.	To recognize the puppet regime of Phnom Penh would in fact mean: first  accepting the permanent foreign domination of our country  which has been a Member in its own right of the United Nations since 1953  and reducing it to the position of a colony of Powers which shamelessly violate the Charter of the United Nations and treat with contempt its resolutions seeking the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from our territory; secondly  giving to many other countries—not necessarily all of the third world—that are also occupied by foreign forces the sad certainty that they are forever condemned to an anachronistic domination; and  thirdly  augmenting the state of tension and risk of conflict in our region.9.	Kampuchea occupies on the geographical plane a strategic position of primary importance. I have sought in the past to make it a buffer State between two categories of State with opposing ideologies. We now know that the ravages of war have extended from Viet Nam to Kampuchea and they threaten to spread even further to the west.10.	Independent  non-aligned and neutral  accepting no foreign bases on its territory  my country could have constituted a major element in the peace not only of the peninsula  but of the totality of southeast Asia and even of East Asia. On the contrary  a Kampuchea becoming a colony and a military base for two expansionist and hegemonist Powers constitutes a menace  as the years of the future will prove  to the stability  peace  security and progress of nations and peoples of the entire region and could well provoke an armed conflict with incalculable consequences between the great Powers whose interests are in conflict in Asia.11.	As members of the Assembly know  I have often been the object of verbal attacks  of a mixture of contempt  sarcasm and abuse on the part of the leaders of Hanoi and their allies. I shall not reply to those attacks but shall limit myself to recalling that in Asia there certainly did not exist  before 1970  a non- communist leader who was more sincerely a friend of Viet Nam than I was  one who rendered spontaneously and voluntarily so much important help to the Vietnamese patriots of North and South in their struggle for independence in their country.12.	After the invasion of my country by the army of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam I reminded the leaders of Hanoi of the assurances of  eternal gratitude  and promises of unswerving respect for the independence  neutrality and territorial integrity  of my country given many times orally and in writing by the leaders of Hanoi  to remind them of their commitments.13.	At the end of 1979 and the beginning of 1980 I wrote three long letters to my  friend and former  companion-in-arms   Pham Van Dong  head of the Vietnamese Government  to propose bilateral negotiations between his Government and myself  either in Hanoi or in any other town of his choice  in order to resolve peacefully the differences between our two nations. I stated in my correspondence that  in the event that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam would agree to restore to Kampuchea its independence and its right to self-determination  our Government  which would result from the popular consensus  following free elections held under international control  would not fail to establish  on a basis of equality  co-operation and friendship with a Viet Nam that is a neighbor and a brother.14.	I waited in vain during the three years for a sign of good will on the part of Hanoi  accepting even accusations made by certain compatriots about my  pro-Vietnamese  indulgence. To my patient efforts in seeking a peaceful solution and re-establishment of mutual confidence by complete neutralization and international control and guarantees for my country  the leaders of Hanoi replied  or caused replies to be made  that they would not negotiate with a man  who no longer represented anything   who was  politically finished   and that the situation in Kampuchea was  irreversible .15.	Yet today as yesterday  I feel no hatred towards Viet Nam. 1 have never ceased to recognize that the geographical position of our two countries makes them neighbors to the end of time and that they are  because of this  compelled to understand each other and to listen to each other. This understanding  however  can be established only between equals and not between servant and master.16.	The present Government of Hanoi does not accept this analysis. It has chosen to forget  and how quickly  the repeated help that our people and I myself have rendered during a crucial period to the people of Viet Nam in their struggle for independence and reunification. It has also very quickly forgotten—this is even more serious—that the support ft has received in this struggle from a large part of the international community resulted from the fact that it appeared to be the innocent victim of colonialism and imperialism. Today  this very Viet Nam  restored in its territorial unity and independence  indulges  in its turn  in imperialist and colonial rule. It goes so tar in its arrogance as to make serious threats against some of the neighbouring countries  which quite rightly are concerned about its expansionism.17.	We have all noticed that in his last tour of Southeast Asia  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has permitted himself to issue  in respect of certain countries that he has visited  threats thatare hardly veiled  simply because these countries ask Viet Nam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea and to let the people of Kampuchea regain their right to self-determination.18.	The Vietnamese Minister has accused certain Governments of the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations of interfering in the internal affairs of Kampuchea  but  as we know  it is Viet Nam which has interfered in a shameless fashion in our internal affairs  occupying our country with large numbers of troops and appropriating to itself material parts of our national resources  whereas ASEAN has only asked our occupying Power to let Kampuchea become yet once more the master of its own destiny.19.	President Ho Chi Minh  at whose funeral I was the only head of State present to pay my respects  loved to say that  nothing is more precious than independence and liberty . This adage  one now sees  is to be applied  according to his successors  only to their own country  which arrogates to itself the right to confiscate the independence and liberty of its immediate neighbors—our country  Kampuchea  and an unfortunate Laos—whilst waiting to attack other nations which may be militarily weaker.20.	In so far as Kampuchea is concerned  it is clear that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam seeks to retain it indefinitely under its heel by the intermediary of a puppet Government which can refuse it nothing.21.	It is in the face of these facts and in this dramatic context that I find myself compelled to commit myself to a tripartite coalition at this juncture and to join  pacifist though I am  the armed struggle so that our country may one day become once more master of its destiny.22.	The United Nations was good enough to adopt  in 1979  1980 and 1981  precise and unambiguous resolutions showing the way to be followed to resolve with justice the problem of Kampuchea  a problem which would not exist but for the greed of Viet Nam on the political and territorial planes.23.	In 1981 the International Conference on Kampuchea was held in New York  under the auspices of the United Nations; the Declaration and resolution of the Conference^ conform to equity  justice and the Charter of the United Nations  as well as to the best interests of Kampuchea and Viet Nam and to those of the peoples of the entire region.24.	The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea cannot accept  any more than our compatriots  that another conference should be arranged by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which profits from the support of the Soviet Union and the allies of that great Power. The primary effect of such a further conference—where  naturally  the puppet regimes of Phnom Penh and Vientiane would be seated—would be to sidetrack the  situation in Kampuchea  by declaring it finalized and thereby causing to be recognized de the regime of Heng Samrin  docile creature of Hanoi. Obviously there can be no question that Democratic Kampuchea and peace-loving nations committed to freedom and justice would fall into such a trap.25.	If the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  a Member of the United Nations  really wishes to contribute to the return of peace and stability in the region  there is no other solution but to respect United Nations resolutions and participate in the future work of the International Conference on Kampuchea. It is not in any way sufficient to announce  as was done recently by Viet Nam  a  partial retreat  of its forces of occupation in Kampuchea in order to lessen the tension in our region; the reality of such a retreat has not been proved. As a matter of fact  many fresh troops were recently sent from Viet Nam into Kampuchea to reinforce the Vietnamese occupying forces.26.	I repeat that only the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces of occupation—withdrawal to be followed by free elections held under the control of the United Nations permitting the whole of our people to designate their deputies  senators  ministers  head of State and political regime—would constitute an honest solution to the problem of Kampuchea. Aslong as the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam refuses to take its troops out of Kampuchea  my Government will oppose with all its force the politics of fail accompli. We know all too well that for the past three years our country has been gagged  that all political opposition is repressed and that opponents are sent to prison or disappear without leaving a trace.27.	Chemical weapons  especially toxic gas  are frequently used against the resistance fighters and the inhabitants of villages which have escaped Vietnamese control. The forces of occupation appropriate to themselves ever more of the natural riches and goods of Kampuchea and send a growing number of Vietnamese immigrants to colonize our fertile lands and rivers rich in fish but from which the legitimate owners have been driven away.28.	Vietnamese propaganda has strenuously sought —and not without success—to make Western observers who are permitted to enter Kampuchea believe that this country  occupied but not submissive  enjoys a freedom and a well-being which it has not known for a long time. This is but a facade denounced by other journalists who have been in the region and who  in spite of multiple obstacles placed in their way  have been able to make in-depth studies of the real position.29.	I have been telling representatives that the only option which we have is to take up arms to protect our national sovereignty. I know that here and there people mock our struggle and say that we are too weak to challenge the powerful Vietnamese expeditionary forces. Weak or not  we have the sacred duty to struggle with all our strength against the occupying Power.30.	I would not predict a victory in either the short term or medium term  but I can assure representatives that we shall battle on to the end  without hate but with an unbreakable resolution. Those foreigners who impose their domination on our country and exploit it to their profit will perceive early or late that there will never be peace and that the land of Kampuchea will heat up ever more under their feet.31.	We are not making war on the Vietnamese people. We are fighting for peace and the restoration of independence and freedom to our country which is now reduced to slavery. We do not want a Pax Vietnamica  or a  Pax Sovietica but simply a peace of free men.32.	We ask nothing from others. We ask but restoration of our national sovereignty and our territorial integrity; and once that is achieved  we solemnly commit ourselves to living in perfect peaceful coexistence with all our neighbors—and first amongst them Viet Nam—as with all other countries which respect us  no matter what their political and social systems may be. Is that an unreasonable demand  an impossible pretension?33.	We proclaim solemnly before the Assembly  in conformity with United Nations resolutions  that as soon as Viet Nam has totally withdrawn its troops from Kampuchea all will be possible in friendship between our two countries.34.	We are ready to sign with Viet Nam a treaty of peace and non-aggression implying recognition and respect for the territorial integrity of the two neighbouring nations within their present frontiers. This is a just proposal that I make today to the leaders and the people of Viet Nam in the name of our Coalition Government. I am satisfied that  if they would but listen to this appeal of reason  the people of South-East Asia  as well as the peoples of the whole world  would feel the most genuine satisfaction—for not only would peace and harmony return to the Indo-Chinese peninsula but also potential major conflicts would thereby disappear.35.	Unfortunately  the reality is that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is far from seeking to explore the way of reconciliation and peace. It seeks to propagate a very curious concept of an international conference charged not to solve the situation in Kampuchea  but  to consider the security  the peace and neutrality in South-East Asia .36.	May I draw to the attention of the representatives now present that the international conference  proposed by the Vietnamese would logically mean side-tracking and avoiding the central issue of Kampuchea  because delegates to such a conference would find themselves  right from the start  required to recognize 	  the puppet regime of Heng Samrin  functioning under the orders of Hanoi and Moscow.37.	It seems evident to me  as it must seem to you  that no country which loves justice and freedom could  without reneging on its ideals  participate in such a meeting which has as its only aim to serve the egotistical interests of two Powers in their expansionist and colonialist enterprises.38.	Who  in effect  menaces the security and peace and the stability of South-East Asia  if it is not Viet Nam which  with the powerful help of the Soviets  has stationed its forces in Kampuchea  menacing henceforth Thailand and other peaceful member countries of ASEAN  as well as a number of countries further away?39.	It must be clear that any conference interested in peace and stability in South-East Asia must necessarily resolve  as a priority  the  situation in Kampuchea . This done  my country  having found its independence and its freedom to act  there would remain no problem to resolve in South-East Asia  since no country adjacent to or a neighbor of independent an/1 neutral Kampuchea has anything to fear from us.40.	ASEAN  to which I must render my most profound homage for its political sense and its courage  has refused with reason to sign the pact of non- aggression that Viet Nam proposes. Such a pact would have the same disastrous effects as that which was signed in Munich in 1938 by Chamberlain and Daladier in the hope—tragic illusion—of mollifying Hitler and Mussolini. Such a pact would be but the prelude to further aggression between countries and peoples who subscribe to it.41.	Representatives will understand why no international conference is imaginable if the first item on the agenda does not deal with the situation in Kampuchea and does not seek to put an end to the occupation and colonization of my country by Viet Nam  with the multi-faceted support of the Soviet Union. If this problem is not dealt with and resolved  there is really nothing to discuss  there is nothing to be done but to bend the knee before the diktat of Hanoi and Moscow.42.	It would be lamentable to participate in a Vietnamese conference which will have present as representatives of Kampuchea the regime of quislings of Phnom Penh put in place by the Vietnamese leaders and protected by the powerful Vietnamese army of occupation.43.	To accept the Vietnamese fail accompli in Kampuchea would be to accept the law of the jungle. This  law  is already in force in many countries which tragically today are reduced to slavery by a great Power.43. States Members of the United Nations—at least those for whom the principles of freedom  independence  justice and peace still matter—must have at heart  I am sure  the need to cry  Halt  to the Vietnamese occupation and colonization of Kampuchea by adopting the resolutions and in taking measures which would require Viet Nam  which we once respected  to return to a sense of honor which  we hope but momentarily  it has so singularly failed in.46.	We are very conscious of our limitations and of the fact that our own problems concern us in such absolute priority that we cannot pretend to concern ourselves with the problems of others. But as  of course  our country has always been a Member of the United Nations  I trust I will be permitted to indicate briefly our position on certain problems of major  importance.47.	I would at the outset express the sincere gratitude of my country and our people to nations which have generously welcomed our refugees and  in the very first place  to the Kingdom of Thailand  which has carried a very heavy burden in the name of duty to humanity in granting a haven of refuge and protection against threats to hundreds of thousands of our compatriots who fled slavery  misery and death. I thank equally  with all my heart  the other countries of ASEAN for their active support and their diplomatic and other assistance to our cause.48.	I salute also the other States which have welcomed a large number of our refugees and permitted them to escape despair  as well as the many countries which have made generous gifts and given assistance from which our compatriots have benefited and benefit today. At the same time  I salute and thank the Secretary-General  the International Red Cross  UNICEF and other humanitarian organizations for all they have done  are doing and will be doing for our refugees and other compatriots in their need.49.	I respect the Vietnamese people  dragged against their will into a colonialist adventure  although for many years now they have found themselves plunged into difficulties without number and from all sides and of all kinds  which their Government is in any event obliged to recognize  and which have provoked the tragic exodus of hundreds of thousands of  boat people .50.	I do not consider that I have a right to ask the Western Powers to cease providing humanitarian aid to our neighbors  innocent victims of the dreadful conduct of their Government. But I have the right  in the name of the people of Kampuchea  to ask all countries which are not accomplices of Vietnamese colonialism forthwith to cease granting to the regime of Hanoi financial  economic and material aid which risk being used not to help the unhappy people of Viet Nam  but inevitably to encourage their leaders to persevere in their enterprise against my people and my country.51.	We reaffirm our total solidarity with our brothers and sisters  the Afghan people  who like us are involved in a struggle to enable their country to exercise again its inalienable right to self-determination. We support equally the Lao people  our brothers and sisters  who desire to recover Lao independence and liberty.52.	We reaffirm our total solidarity with our brothers and sisters  the Palestinian people  who are suffering appalling trials for the rebirth of their country. We continue to recognize officially the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the legal representative of the Palestinian people and nation.53.	We firmly support our brothers and sisters  the Korean people  in their legitimate aspiration for a reunification of their country now divided against its will  and we warmly support the wise and patriotic proposals of Marshal Kim Il Sung  President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  so that the reunification may take place through a peaceful and independent process.54.	It is our ardent hope that the two brother countries at present in conflict with one another  Iraq and Iran  will seek a peaceful solution to their problems and realize  in peace  their necessary reconciliation.55.	Deeply moved by the unmerited disasters and innumerable loss of human lives which Lebanon has suffered—a State which heretofore was the Switzerland of the Near East—it is our ardent hope that its sovereignty and territorial integrity will at last be respected and the foreign armed forces will withdraw without delay  leaving the Lebanese people the opportunity to resolve their problems alone.56.	We renew our fraternal solidarity with the valiant people of Namibia who  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  are waging a just struggle for national liberation against the colonialist and racist regime of Pretoria."
"78",3867,"KWT",37,1982,"It is a pleasure  Sir  to see you on the podium conducting the affairs of the thirty-seventh session  whose agenda includes the most important issues  issues directly related to the security  peace  stability and future of mankind; We have great confidence that your vast knowledge and experience  and the active role played by your friendly country in international relations  wi!! help us  and you  realize our expecta¬tions of this session. In the name of the Amir  theGovernment and the people of Kuwait  please accept our congratulations on your election.166.	The thirty-sixth session was fortunate in having been presided over by a colleague who is dear to you and to us  Mr. Ismat Kittani; he played a distinguished role and one deserving of our appreciation and our gratitude.167.	Since this is the first time I have addressed the general  Assembly since the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar took office  I take this opportunity to say again that my country welcomes his accession to that high position; we wish him good luck and all success.168.	Furthermore  I must not let this opportunity pass without expressing to the former Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our thanks and appre¬ciation for his constructive and dedicated efforts to help establish world security and stability during his term of office. We extend to him  too  our best wishes in the coming years.169.	The world situation has entered on a new era of complication and confusion  which have left their mark on the noble values that mankind has accepted as its constitution  values such as those of sovereignty  independence  justice  non-interference in internal affairs  peaceful coexistence among nations  and the elimination of the pains and evils inherent in blocs and in competing selfish interests.170.	The political rivalry between the two competing camps has led to dialogue and being replaced by confrontation and estrangement  and thus has put an end to what was left of the policy of detente  with its favorable impact on international relations.171.	The increasing complications of international relations and conflicts among various interests have increasingly involved smaller nations in the spheres of influence of the super-Powers  to an extent that actually jeopardizes even the unity  solidarity and effectiveness of the regional organizations which have been playing an important role in furthering the secu¬rity and prosperity of the countries and peoples of the respective regions.172.	The confusion arising from the ambiguity of the international situation has had an obvious impact on the ability and effectiveness of the United Nations and its various organs  particularly the Security Council. In his report on the work of the Organiza¬tion  the Secretary-General was honest with him  and accurately described a fact which can no longer be denied when he talked candidly about the weakening of the effectiveness and credibility of the United Nations as an instrument for achieving peace and preventing war. We realize that the United Nations has  unfortunately  not been able  except in a few rare occasions  to act effectively to maintain peace in the world. Instead  we note that it has become a stage which the competing Powers use flagrantly as an instrument for defending their own interests by every possible means  to the extent that the Security Council has been unable to fulfil its primary responsibility—not because of remoteness from the scene of events or any reluctance to exert efforts  but because of the abuse by some of its members of their right of veto.Those members  upon whose shoulders rests a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security  have in addition used their power in the Council to prevent any collective measures from being adopted by the international community whenever such measures would affect any part of their spheres of influence.173.	There is now a very wide gap between com¬mitment to the principles and provisions of the Charter and the actual behavior of nations in their inter¬national relations. Resorting to the force of arms and military supremacy as instruments to solve problems rather than on the force of truth  justice and interna¬tional values has impaired the prestige of the United Nations  which once embodied the hopes of mankind in a society where security  prosperity  justice and brotherhood prevailed.174.	The State of Kuwait believes that this dangerous situation makes it imperative urgently to consider responsible and serious action by all the members of the international community to rekindle the commit¬ment to the principles of the Organization.175.	Since the beginning of this year the General Assembly has had to convene several special sessions to discuss the dangerous developments relating to the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. The Security Council has also met several times during the same period for the same purpose. Those two bodies have adopted resolutions  under the pro¬visions of the Charter  to deal with the flagrant aggres¬sion perpetrated by Israel against an independent and sovereign Member State—Lebanon—and against the displaced Palestinian people. That people's loss of its land and legitimate rights and its dispersal and the suffering inflicted upon it for more than 35 years have been caused primarily by the creation of Israel itself.176.	As recorded by all the Western news media  Israel's actions in Lebanon were more brutal and inhuman than anything ever witnessed by the world before—a human holocaust which did not discriminate between men  women and children  the total destruc¬tion of everything on the land  under the pretext of security safeguards  a pretext universally acknowl¬edged to be fallacious.177.	We wonder what would be the fate of the world if all nations tried to solve their security problems in this manner.178.	The horrible massacre which shocked every¬one's conscience throughout the world has once again confirmed the dimensions of the blind fanaticism and the racist Zionist hatred of the Israeli regime directed against the defenseless  innocent people in the Palestinian camps  which had been evacuated by the Palestinian fighters when they left west Beirut under guarantees from the United States of America —which is precisely why that country bears a moral as well as a legal responsibility for what happened there.179.	Hence the international community is called upon to do more than express condemnation or shed tears  because evil forces do net react to moral prin¬ciples or human feelings. It is therefore necessary to restrain them by means that are not beyond the capabilities of the international community. As usual  Israel has not respected any agreements  pledges or charters. Its behavior is not governed by any values or principles. This is clearly shown by the extent of its disregard for United Nations resolutions—which is precisely what has led us to call upon Member States  after all that has happened  to suspend Israel's membership of the United Nations as a first step as well as a deterrent to force it to obey the will of the international community.180.	The Arab land  the cradle of divine revelations which participated in bringing the principles of peace  justice and brotherhood to the peoples of the world  is victim today to the Zionist arrogance of power  with all its American arms of destruction—an arro¬gance of power that has caused such frustration among the people of Palestine and the other peoples of the region that the resultant explosion threatens tc add a new element to the present conflict of power and arms  with the emergence of bitter anger and mutual hatred.181.	While drawing the attention of the international community to this dangerous abyss towards which our region is heading and which reminds us of the tragic human conflicts of the ages  we appeal to it firmly to resist this imminent danger. It is possible to disarm the hand  but difficult to defuse hatred in the heart.182.	After what happened in Lebanon  Kuwait is convinced that the independence  security  territorial integrity and safety of the brotherly people of that country cannot be a subject for debate. It follows that the necessary measures must be taken to compel Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 308 (1982) and 509 (1982) calling for its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Lebanese territory.183.	The Palestinian people  under the leadership of the PLO  have emerged from the latest tragic events much stronger and more united and cohesive. Through its conduct politically in negotiations and militarily on the battlefield  the PLO has proved that it is the legitimate spokesman of the Palestinian people and that it is deeply committed to international responsi¬bility and its role in the preservation of peace and security in the Middle East.184.	It has become obvious from a whole series of Israeli violations  such as the annexation of Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights to the raid on the Iraqi nuclear installation and the barbaric invasion of Lebanon  that Israel's ultimate intention is to achieve one particular objective which it does not even bother to conceal—namely  the establishment of Greater Israel—and its strategy to achieve that objective has become crystal clear—namely  to use the flimsy pretext of security as a means of achieving ' its expansionist designs.185.	In their constant search for a peaceful  just and honorable solution to the Palestinian question  the Arab countries were able to manifest once again  at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held in Fez  the Arab nation's capability of living up to the situation by adopting a series of general principles as an accepted basis for a peaceful and durable solution to the Palestinian question which would safeguard the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine. Elements of the proposed settlement were inspired by the Arab countries' sense of international and historical responsibility and the principles and bases of interna¬tional charters  as well as of United Nations reso-lutions  such as the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force  the right of all peoples to full self-determination  free of any narrow or biased interpretation  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the Security Council's responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.186.	The unanimity shown by Arab heads of State in adopting the principles of the Fez Conference offers the international community a unique opportunity to move ahead on the road to a new era based on this initiative  which is rightly considered an important turning point whose meaning should not be lost on anyone and which expresses the genuine and firm desire of the Arab countries to end the conflict and preserve peace in the area.187.	It was not surprising to see that Israel rejected those Arab principles  for that rejection reflects the Israeli strategy in the Middle East—a strategy based on the consolidation of the	and the impo¬sition of new on the international community.188.	In our view  the international community must consider those Arab principles as the greatest oppor-tunity ever offered to settle the Middle East crisis and the Palestine question on a concrete and realistic basis.189.	It is the view of Kuwait that the United States  in particular  should seriously consider this Arab ini-tiative  should understand its meaning and should respond to it positively so that it will become an accepted fact which will establish truth  security and justice in a region where the clouds of injustice and aggression have been and still are looming. On the other hand  the group of European countries which had for a long time sought to participate in any con¬structive approach to settling this thorny issue should seriously consider those principles and should not let the dream of peace in the Middle East be dashed by the misleading and deceptive policy of Israel. It is within our reach to hold on to the ray of hope—to preserve it and strengthen it so that it will eventually turn into an impregnable bulwark protecting the rights of the just and preserving peace.190.	I should now like to refer to what I said at the 18th meeting of the thirty-sixth session about the establishment of the Gulf Co-operation Council  which has now become a fact and which has proved to be the right and successful instrument for developing co¬operation among member States  improving their rela¬tions  and achieving co-ordination  integration and interdependence among their peoples in all fields  thereby serving their mutual interests and strength¬ening their capability of participating in the preserva¬tion of peace and security in that vital area of the world. It has also stressed another important fact: namely  that security and stability in the Arabian Gulf area are the responsibility of its peoples and countries  which reject foreign interference from any source and under any pretext and that the member States alone have the right to defend their security and maintain their independence. The Council has also emerged in the field of Arab relations as a tributary of Arab unity and solidarity.191.	Kuwait views with great concern the ongoing war between two Moslem neighbors  Iraq and Iran  which has exhausted  over a period of more than two years  the great potential of their human and economic resources and has exposed the area more than ever before to the possibility of intervention by foreign Powers attempting to impost their hege¬mony and their influence and to international areas and internal affairs.192.	Kuwait commends the positive initiative of fraternal Iraq concerning the withdrawal of its forces to the international borders and the cessation of hostilities. It views this as an honest and genuine contribution on the part of Iraq to put a quick end to the war. We are still hopeful that neighbouring Moslem Iran will soon follow Iraq's example in this respect.193.	Kuwait fully appreciates all the honest efforts exerted by all parties concerned to find an honorable and just solution to the dispute—one which would safeguard the rights and dignity of both parties. But in spite of the fact that those efforts have  unfor¬tunately  not been successful so far  we still believe in the necessity of continuing them and even inten¬sifying them. We also hope that the supreme interest of maintaining peace and security in the area will prevail over all other considerations. We are con¬vinced that the immediate cessation of hostilities would create the right climate for the solution of all problems  in accordance  above all  with the spirit and ideals of Islamic brotherhood and with interna¬tional law.194.	The situation on our Asian continent is still replete with explosive crises that threaten our peace and security. Foreign troops are still on Afghan soil  and all the efforts exerted by the United Nations to reach a peaceful and just solution to that crisis on the basis of the various resolutions adopted by the As¬sembly are foundering. While we appreciate the par¬ticipation of the parties to the dispute in the meeting recently held at Geneva under the aegis of the United Nations  we call for an intensification of efforts at subsequent meetings in order to arrive at a solution that will safeguard the rights of the people of Afghanistan to self-determination and to establish the political system they deem suitable  free from any foreign intervention. We also affirm the right of the Afghan refugees to return to their homeland. Kuwait is con¬vinced that none of these goals can be secured without the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and non-intervention in its internal affairs.195.	We regret the failure of the efforts made so far to convene an international conference to discuss the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Kuwait has been stressing the need to convene such a conference because of its conviction that the peace and security of the Indian Ocean and the withdrawal of foreign bases from that area are vital and closely linked to international peace and security. Kuwait also reit¬erates its advocacy of the declaration of the Middle East as a nuclear-weapon-free zone in order to enable the countries of that region to concentrate on solving their development problems and carrying out their economic development programmes.196.	Like the Middle East  the African continent continues to be an arena of strife and conflict that threaten its political stability and impede its economic progress. The Middle East is plagued by an aggressive and racist Zionist regime  while the African continent is plagued by a similar racist regime that is still being imposed on the people of South Africa and Namibia despite all the international attempts to find a just and honorable solution to their problems.197.	Kuwait reiterates its support for and solidarity with the people of Namibia in their just struggle and with the black majority in South Africa as it struggles against the policies of discrimination and apartheid being pursued by the white minority in that country . We salute and support the front-line States and SWAPO for their political perseverance in attempting to find a peaceful settlement to the problem of Namibia. We also condemn the perverted methods used by the racist regime in South Africa in its attempts to obstruct a peaceful settlement to that problem. Kuwait would also urge the Western nations to exert the utmost pressure on South Africa in order to force it to respond positively to international efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just settlement to the situation in southern Africa.198.	Kuwait is also watching the development of the situation in Eritrea and hopes that a just solution that will guarantee that the people of Eritrea attain their national aspirations can be found.199.	In a few months the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Coun¬tries will convene in the Indian capital. The movement non-aligned is still? 20 years after its creation  facing tremendous challenges; it requires from its members an increased adherence to its principles and ideology. By taking the initiative of not acting as host to the Seventh Conference  Iraq has proved its earnest desire to maintain the unity and effectiveness of the movement. Kuwait believes that States members of the movement should avoid being drawn into the conflict between the great Powers  which seek to polarize those States towards one camp or the other. Kuwait also feels a special interest in the forthcoming Conference in India and hopes that its results will reflect the aspirations of the third world.200.	We cannot fail to note the sense of disillusion¬ment felt by the international community at the failure of the second special session on disarmament. The continuing development of weapons of mass destruc¬tion  the continued conducting of nuclear tests and the continued stockpiling of huge quantities of weapons has exposed the lack of political will on the part of the Powers involved to create a favorable climate for disarmament.201.	Kuwait believes that the economic problems facing today's world are for the most part caused by the tremendous costs of the arms race. We therefore call upon the United Nations to refuse to allow itself to be impeded by the temporary set-back of the failure of the second special session and to continue its attempts to achieve the cherished aspirations and dreams of mankind.202.	Through its long experience in contributing to the development of third-world countries  Kuwait realizes that the achievement of development in the developing countries is primarily the responsibility of those countries. That responsibility  however  does not release the advanced countries from their commitments to the developing nations and  conse¬quently  a formula should be worked out to co-ordinate  follow up and implement the activities of economic co-operation among the developing nations them¬selves  on the one hand  and between them and the developed and advanced nations on the other. While Kuwait fully appreciates the efforts that were made during the past year to launch global negotiations to achieve economic co-operation  it expresses its disap¬pointment at the many obstacles being placed in the way of such negotiations by the developed nations  which continue to look upon this vital matter from the viewpoint of their selfish interests.203.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea made important specific progress when it adopted the draft Convention which the Conference had been debating for more than 10 years. Kuwait  aware of its international responsibility  appeals to all nations which have not yet approved this Con¬vention to join the rest of the international community in its common conception of the organization and utilization of all the important and vital aspects of the Convention in the best interests and for the prosperity of mankind. Kuwait hopes that this Con¬vention will be ratified as soon as possible.204.	The delegation of Kuwait  while sharing the concern of the international community over the current international political and economic situation  is convinced that it is imperative to continue the dialogue and intensify the bilateral and multilateral contacts among all nations. This concern for interna¬tional peace and security  as expressed by all Mem¬ber States  makes us fully confident that  given honest intentions and explicit goals  it will be possible to realize our hopes in the establishment of co-operation among peoples and to avoid the evils of wars and disputes. Progress and prosperity will thus come closer and be more significant."
"79",3913,"LAO",37,1982,"On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  I should like at the outset to congratulate you  Comrade President  on your unanimous election to your high office for this session of the General Assembly. In choosing you  the General Assembly pays a tribute both to your country  the sister People's Republic of Hungary  whose tireless efforts in the cause of peace and socialism are well known and with which my country enjoys excellent relations of friendship and militant solidarity and to you and to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat for whom the workings of the United Nations hold no secrets. I am therefore convinced that on the basis of your vast experience and thorough knowledge of international affairs you will lead the work of this session towards fruitful results.141. I would also like to pay a tribute to your pre¬decessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani  who guided the thirty- sixth session of the Assembly  as well as the special sessions  with authority and skill.142.	I also wish to salute the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  on his election to his high office  involving great responsibility  and for his courage and untiring efforts in the cause of maintaining international peace and security.143.	Since the beginning of the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly  the international situation has con¬tinued to deteriorate and the international community has found itself faced with a number of crises. For the most aggressive imperialist factions  per¬sisting with their policy of adventurism  aggression and economic blocs  have created or rekindled hot¬beds of tension in various regions of the world. Inter¬national peace and security have never been so threatened.144.	In the Middle East  the situation remains explosive because of the policy of aggression and extermination being carried out by those who hold power ip Israel and those who support and arm them against the Palestinian and Lebanese Arab peoples. The bloody crimes committed by Israel against the Arab Palestinian and Lebanese peoples  the occupa¬tion of Lebanon and other Arab territories and the monstrous genocide committed in the Palestinian refugee camps have been condemned by the world. We express our unreserved solidarity with the Pales¬tinian Arab people and with the PLO  their sole legitimate representative  with the Lebanese people and with all the victims of Israeli aggression and barbarity.145.	For the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine and of the Middle East as a whole  which should be worked out through negotiations with the partici¬pation of all the parties concerned  including the PLO  presupposes the withdrawal by Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and recog¬nition of the right of the Palestinian people to estab¬lish an independent State the six-point proposal of President Brezhnev  as well as theproposals of the Fez Arab Summit Conference  fully support this position.146.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq has already been the cause of many losses  both material and human  on both sides and has benefited neither of the parties to it. Quite the contrary  the longer it goes on  the more conditions favorable to the intervention and interference of imperialism in the region it will create. The Lao People's Democratic Republic hopes that the two parties  both members of the non-aligned movement  with succeed in reaching a peaceful solution to their differences.147.	The undeclared war being waged by imperialism and other reactionary forces against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan poses a serious threat to its independence and sovereignty and its revolutionary achievements. The Lao People's Democratic Republic firmly condemns such acts and supports the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to settle with its neighbors by political means problems pertaining to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.148.	In the Korean peninsula  the situation remains tense. The ever-growing presence of American troops in the southern part of Korea constitutes a major obstacle to the process of the peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea.149.	In the area of the Indian Ocean  the military presence of the United States has jeopardized the convening of the United Nations conference designed to establish the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. The Lao People's Democratic Republic associates itself with the coastal countries in the region in calling for the dismantling of the Diego Garcia base and other so-called logistical military facilities. In reiterating our support for Madagascar's proposal and our commitment to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of  the Lao People's Democratic Republic hopes that the envisaged international conference will be able to take place as soon as possible.150.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic gives its whole-hearted support to the just struggle of the South African patriots against the repugnant apartheid regime and for the recovery of their fundamental national rights and supports the valiant struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  for the independence and territorial integrity of Nami¬bia. We condemn the repeated acts of aggression committed by South Africa against Angola  Mozam¬bique and other neighbouring African countries  and we reaffirm our militant solidarity with that peoples of those countries in the struggle for the defense of their independence and sovereignty.151.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaf¬firms its militant solidarity with the Sahraaui people under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front in their just struggle for self-determination and inde¬pendence.152.	The Lao People s Democratic Republic  which recognizes the sovereignty of Argentina over the Malvinas  believes that a final settlement of this matter should be negotiated within the framework of the United Nations  bearing in mind its relevant reso¬lutions.153.	The policy and actions of American imperialism with regard to Cuba  Nicaragua and Grenada should be vigorously condemned. The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its unswerving support for the just struggle of the peoples of those countries to defend their national independence and their revolutionary achievements and demands the resto¬ration of Guantanamo to the Republic of Cuba.154.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic also supports the struggle of the Puerto Rican people for its right to self-determination and independence  and that of the people of El Salvador for its freedom and democratic rights.155.	In their efforts to destroy the approximate military and strategic balance in Europe and in the world as a whole  the Unite States and other countries of NATO have been exerting undisguised pressure on Poland and have been interfering in its internal affairs with a view to perpetuating the crisis in that country. The Lao People's Democratic Republic vigorously condemns these acts and reaffirms its unswerving solidarity with the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish State in their efforts to maintain public order and to promote the normalization of the situation in that country.156.	Foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus has been preventing the intercommunal talks from making progress. In the interest of the Cypriot people as a whole  a halt must be called to this inter¬ference and the territorial integrity of the country must be scrupulously respected.157.	Peace and stability in South-East Asia are in constant danger from the expansionist and hegemonist policy pursued by the reactionaries in the Chinese ruling circles who are striving to maintain a state of tension on the Sino-Lao and Sino-Viet-namese borders by massing troops there which engage in armed incursions for die purpose of provocation and sabotage  and also on the Thai-Kampuchea border by helping the remnants of the Pol Pot forces and a handful of Khmer reactionaries to undermine the rebirth of the Kampuchean people.158.	But in spite of these hostile acts  Lao People's Democratic Republic  Viet Nam and Kampuchea  constantly motivated by the wish to live in peace  friendship and co-operation with their neighbors  and in particular with China  have over the last few years made a number of proposals  including the proposal to sign a bilateral or multilateral treaty of peaceful coexistence between them and China with a view to normalizing their relations.159.	The problems which now exist in South-East Asia have been essentially brought about by foreign interventions and interference. It is therefore of fundamental importance to proceed immediately to a comprehensive settlement of those problems. Any delay in doing this would serve only to inflame the situation which now prevails.160.	In accordance with that analysis and desiring to make an active contribution to the consolidation of peace and stability in South-East Asia  and also to promote the continuation of dialogue between the States in the region  the Foreign Minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  on behalf of the three countries of Indo-China  sent a letter dated 15 Sep-tember i982  to their counterparts in the countries of ASEAN. Its essential Content is as follows: ''""The Thai side regards the presence of units of the Vietnamese army near the Kampuchea-Thailand border as a threat to Thailand's security. Mean¬while  Kampuchea  Viet Nam and Laos consider the use of Thai territory by China and the Pol Pot clique together with other reactionary Khmer forces against the revival of the Kampuchean people a constant threat to the security of Kampuchea and other Indo-Chinese countries.""The realities of the past three years have shown that the presence of Vietnamese troops in Kam¬puchea does not threaten in any way Thailand's security. Many a time the Thai side has stated that there is no need to sign non-aggression treaties between Thailand and the three Indo- Chinese countries since there is no danger of aggres¬sion by Viet Nam against Thailand. On the contrary  the activities of the Pol Pot clique and other Khmer reactionaries based in Thailand have seriously threatened Kampuchea's security  causing a continually explosive situation on the Thailand- Kampuchea border. The recent founding of a so-called tripartite coalition Government is aimed at helping the Pol Pot clique and other Khmer reactionaries step up activities against the People's Republic of Kampuchea  undermining the revival of the Kampuchean people and aggravating the tension on the Kampuchea-Thailand border. To maintain and to give it their support  the ASEAN countries cannot avoid running Airther counter to their objective of 'founding a political solution' as they have declared. This will create a dangerous precedent for foreign intervention against inde¬pendent and sovereign nations and violate the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the non-aligned movement.""We deem it necessary to heed the security interests of Thailand  and at the same time to heed the security interests of Kampuchea. To this end  there should be effective measures to check the use of the territory of one country against the other. Proceeding from this basic stand  the People's Republic of Kampuchea proposed in July 1980 to establish a demilitarized zone along the Kampuchea- Thailand border  but the Thai side did not agree  saying that it cannot withdraw its troops from a part of its own territory.""At the recent Conference of the Lao  Kampu¬chean and Vietnamese Foreign Ministers  the three Indo-Chinese countries took notice of Thailand's stand on a demilitarized zone and put forward a new proposal to set up a safety zone along the Kampuchea-Thailand border. This proposal meets Thailand's concern that troops of the Thai King¬dom should not withdraw from a part of its territory. The new proposal only asks for the withdrawal of forces which do not belong to Thailand or the People's Republic of Kampuchea from the safety zone. The three Indo-Chinese countries voice their readiness to discuss and reach agreement with the Thai side on such concrete matters as the width of the safety zone  the scope of Vietnamese troops withdrawal from the Kampuchea-Thailand border as well as the agreement of the transfer  of the Pol-Potist and other Khmer reactionaries and refugee camps far  from this border  the three Indo-Chinese countries deem it necessary to agree on a form of international supervision of the safety.""To show their good will  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam have of late made a first step by unilaterally withdrawing some units of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. If the Thai side gives a positive response to this good will act  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will withdraw more units of Viet¬namese troops from Kampuchea.""In case Thailand refuses to establish the safety zone  the three Indo-Chinese countries are ready to discuss and reach agreement with the Thai side on any measure strictly to respect the Kampuchea- Thailand border as well as any measure including a form of international supervision to ensure peace and stability there.""Many a time the People's Republic of Kam¬puchea has stated that the agreement on this question is not related to the de jure recognition of each other. The People's Republic of Kampuchea will not let the question of mutual recognition hinder the discussion and agreement on the safety zone. The realities of the past 30 years have shown that the United States and Thailand signed with Viet Nam and China the 1961-1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos  and the United States and Viet Nam signed the Paris Agree¬ment on Viet Nam in 1973 without subsequent mutual recognition.""The ASEAN countries have stood for the con¬vening of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations to settle the Kam¬puchea problem. They have unilaterally convened this conference in disregard of the three Indo- Chinese countries' protest. This is an imposition from one side. The three Indo-Chinese countries have put forward a proposal to convene a regional conference between the two groups of ASEAN and Indo-Chinese countries. This has not been agreed to by the ASEAN countries and such regional con¬ference has not been convened.""The realities of the past three years have shown that an international conference is fruitful only when there is the agreement and participation of the directly related parties. The international conference convened by the United Nations in July 1981 only ended in an impasse. With the good will to find an issue for this abnormal situation  and taking into consideration the ASEAN countries' proposal for an international conference and the three Indo-Chinese countries' proposal for a regional con¬ference  the recent conference of Vietnamese  Lao and Kampuchean Foreign Ministers put forward a proposal for an international conference on Southeast Asia with the participation of nine countries inside and six others outside the area. (The nine former are the three Indo-Chinese countries  the five ASEAN countries and Burma; the six latter are the Soviet Union  the United States  China  France  the United Kingdom and India)..""This conference will be convened only when agreement is reached between the  directly related countries  i.e. the ASEAN-and the Indo-Chinese counties   on the composition; of Participants  agenda  place and time of the conference.""Regarding the composition of participants  there may be disagreement on the countries taking part J particularly on the representation of Kampuchea. I think that this matter can be discussed and a formula acceptable to all can be found. It should not hinder the convening of the conference. The three Indo- Chinese countries  welcome the United Nations contribution to peace and stability in South-East Asia. But the United Nations maintenance of the Pol Pot genocidal clique has inhibited its positive role.""Concerning the agenda  there may also be disagreement. I think that the conference can discuss all the problems in the region raised by each side on the principle of complete equality. For us there are many ways: an agreed agenda  an open agenda  or an agenda with agreed-upon problems and open- ended problems.""About the place  I think that the conference can meet in a South-East Asian country  a neutral country in Asia or Europe  perhaps at Rangoon  New Delhi  Paris  Stockholm or Vienna  as agreed by the two groups of countries.""As for the time of the conference  I think that the problems of peace and stability in Southeast Asia are most urgent and need to be settled  the sooner the better. Therefore I think that it should be convened in the last three months of this year or early next year.""161.	In Kampuchea  Pol Pot and his criminal clique  before being overthrown in 1979  embarked on the genocide of their own people and took the country back to the stone-age  at the instigation of foreigners. Blood  hunger and exodus were the price of this process internally  while externally bloody aggressions against neighbouring countries left an indelible imprint. Since that time the horror has ended for the Kamrpuchean people  and under the leadership of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea that people has witnessed a miraculous revival in unity and national harmony and its political  economic  cultural and social situation has undergone a striking return to normal. The conditions of life of the people are unquestionably improving; National institutions have been established at all levels throughout the territory of the country after  the general elections J in particular the Constitution and the Parliament. This legitimate Government  supported by all Kampucheans  is unremittingly pursuing a foreign policy of peace  friendship  co-operation and good-neighborliness.162.	The international community is now in a posi¬tion  knowing the facts  to draw impartially and objec¬tively a comparison between the four years of the reign of terror and genocide of the Pol Pot regime and the three years of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and conclude which has done more for Kampuchea and its valiant people and which of the two deserves the honor and the right to speak on behalf of Kampuchea.163.	For its part  the Lao People's Democratic Republic believes that the United Nations must restore to the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the sole authentic and legal representative of the Kampuehean people  its proper place in the Organization and to expel from it the representatives of the former butchers of the Kampuchean people regardless of what new guise they may appear in.164.	In so doing  the Organization would enhance its prestige and be doing simple justice to the Kam¬puchean people and  above all  to the memory of 3 million of them who were murdered.165.	The year 1982 has also been marked by the unbridled pursuit of the arms race by the imperialists and military circles of NATO. This has been brought about by the policy of confrontation of the current United States Administration and even more by its ambition to attain a fallacious military and strategic ""superiority"" over the Soviet Union  and certain strategists of the Pentagon who have gone so far as to advocate the first nuclear strike and even the pos¬sibility of a so-called limited nuclear war. In order to extract revenue from the taxpayers and to win over public opinion to this cause  there has been no end to the fables that have been concocted about the so- called Soviet threat.166.	Negotiations on arms limitations and disarm¬ament  in various United Nations bodies and other forums  in particular the Soviet-United States bilateral negotiations  have not led to any results. They either run up against the opposition of the United States and its allies or are unilaterally abandoned by them. This is what happened to consideration of the question on the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests in the Committee on Disarmament  the question of halting the nuclear-arms race and negotiations on the prohibition of the development  manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons and their destruction  for example.167.	Although the twelfth special session  the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held in June this year  yielded no con¬crete results  it was nevertheless of great significance because it showed the world which countries are working for the cause of peace and disarmament and which are striving to impede attainment of that goal.168.	President Leonid Brezhnev's message delivered at the 12th meeting of that special session announcing the unilateral undertaking by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons is an illustration of the Leninist peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union and it won the warm and total support of the Lao People's Democratic Republic as well as that of all peace-loving peoples in the world.169.	At the second special session on disarmament  the Soviet Union reaffirmed and developed its pro¬posals* for the consolidation of peace  strengthening of detente and curbing of the arms race—proposals which it had put forward at the twenty-sixth Con¬gress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Those proposals are constructive and realistic  and members of the Committee on Disarmament should examine them most seriously.170.	In the face of the ever-growing threat to inter¬national peace and security represented by the arms race  in particular the nuclear-arms race and the race in other weapons of mass destruction  the Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes any proposal aimed at eliminating that threat. As a country that was the victim of colonial and neo-colonial aggression and that lived under the constant threat of imperialism  expansionism and hegemonism  my country supports the proposal of the People's Republic of Mongolia for the conclusion of a convention on non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between Asian and Pacific States. The signing of such a convention would undoubtedly contribute to peace and co-oper¬ation in that part of the world.171.	The deterioration in the world economic situa¬tion  that has come about in the last few years was even more marked in 1982. The developed capitalist countries  whose responsibility it is to take appropriate measures to remedy this situation  were unwilling to depart from their negative attitude. This international economic crisis provoked by the devel¬oped capitalist countries has had an even greater effect on the developing countries  in particular the least-advanced among them. This serves only to stress the interdependence of the two groups of coun¬tries. The continued decline in the economic situation in the developing countries could well  over the long term  entail adverse effects for the developed countries themselves. It is therefore in their own interests to demonstrate greater political will and realism in order to restructure the present system of international economic relations which is founded on injustice and exploitation.172.	The picture I have just outlined would appear at first sight a little gloomy. Nevertheless it is encour¬aging to note that crisis mongers and fomenters of war are becoming more and more isolated and coming in for increased international condemnation and that the forces that are fighting for peace Justice and social progress  on the other hand  are becoming stronger with each passing day. This is proof that the masses are no longer willing to live with the specter of a nuclear conflagration hanging over them  in poverty and exploitation. They are calling for a halt to the unbridled arms race  for improvement of their living conditions and for a peaceful world for both their own generation and that of their children. In a word  they are calling for change in the existing international order and its replacement by a new—just  equitable and democratic—international order where relations would be based on true equality and mutually advan¬tageous co-operation.173.	By combining our efforts to respond to their call and to their needs  we would be discharging our obligations under the Charter."
"80",4003,"LBR",37,1982,"At a time when mankind is frantically searching for solutions to the problems of wars  disasters  hunger  poverty  violence and racism  it is indeed heartening that this body can meet and  with collective determination  join the crusade in the search for a nobler and dignified destiny for the human race. The task of saving mankind from wars and destruction is the collective responsibility of Kt<; world's peoples  but the role of individuals in the acceleration of this process must not be over¬looked.317.	In this regard  I should like on behalf of the Government and people of Liberia to extend to the new President of the General Assembly my warmest congratulations on his election to his high office. We are confident that his long years of experience in diplomacy will enable him to discharge  with the utmost sincerity  the responsibilities entrusted to him.318.	I should also like to take this opportunity to offer thanks to his able and dynamic predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who guided the General Assembly through the thirty-sixth regular session and the second special session on disarmament with the utmost dedication and efficiency.319.	We wish at this time to make special reference to the remarkable performance of the Secretary- General  who  after only nine months in office  has convinced us beyond all reasonable doubt that our choice was a good one. We ask him to continue to discharge his duty with the courage and convictions of his conscience. His first report on the work of the Organization outlines effectively the major problems and weaknesses of the Organization. We endorse the recommendations in his report and are convinced that  if implemented  they could strengthen the Organi¬zation and restore to it the role envisaged for it in the Charter.320.	We must pay homage  finally  to that great statesman of tolerance  integrity and devotion  the former Secretary-General  Kurt Waldheim. His con¬tribution to the progress of mankind will forever be stamped upon the minds of all those who fight for peace  justice and human decency. He came to us as a son of Europe. He left as a son of mankind  respected  admired and trusted—beautiful accolades for a man of peace.321.	The challenge facing humanity is to refine the negative instincts of man  those which allow for the domination of others  for the destruction of other peoples' cultures and values and for the development of those mental aberrations such as racial superiority  parochial and aggressive nationalisms and individual and national acquisitiveness with the attributes of exploitation  poverty and stagnation on the one hand  and affluence and indifference to human sufferings on the other. The refinement of man's negative instincts will allow for the common understanding of human problems and make more meaningful the search for fraternal relations between peoples.322.	The task of human refinement must begin at the national level  for it is at this level that the con¬sequences of negative instincts are most profound. Classes and groups which have no respect for the rights of their own people will have no regard for the rights of other peoples. It thus becomes necessary for the national entity to purge itself of the unsavory attributes of man's inhumanity to man in order to join the search for international harmony and morality.323.	My country  in answering the challenge which history has posed to us as a people  took the path of revolution to resolve the contradictions in our society and awakened the consciousness of our people to begin the frontal assault on the citadels of privilege  ethnic arrogance and elitism. We are proud to say to the world  to all men of conscience and decency  that through the struggle of our people and with the blood of our martyrs we destroyed an oligarchy which was brutal  arrogant and insensitive to the needs and aspirations of the vast majority of our people  as all oligarchies are. It is our God-given right to destroy the shackles of servitude and allow our people to begin the process of making their own history.324.	Here in this public forum  we pay homage to the memory of our martyrs  especially to the hun¬dreds killed on 14 April 1979  when the former regime unleashed a reign of terror on our defenseless people who had raised their voices to question the right of that oligarchy to increase the price of the staple food for its own profits. Eternal glory to our martyrs!325.	When people make revolution and advance society a step further  they are morally responsible to show that they are more refined  more decent and more dignified than those they overthrew. This is the only way that one can give credence to the historical movement. In keeping with our commitment to build a society where men will live as brothers and be responsible for the welfare of each and all  we decided to rehabilitate all those who had in the past participated in the maltreatment of the people or condoned with their silence the injustices in society. In this regard  my Government has released all political prisoners and thus stands as one of the few countries in the world without a single political prisoner. Also  to ease the burden of adjustment in the new society  we have returned confiscated properties to former political prisoners.326.	As a further testimony to my Government's commitment to respect the aspirations of the people  our head of State  Commander-in-Chief Samuel Doe has proclaimed 12 April 1985—the fifth anniversary of our revolution—as the date for the return of our country to a democratically elected civilian Govern¬ment. In keeping with this commitment  the Consti¬tutional Committee appointed on the first anniversary of the revolution is completing the final draft cf a new Constitution and drawing up the modalities for elec¬tions. This is the state of affairs in my country 29 months after our revolution.327.	I shall now make some remarks about the inter¬national situation. It is indeed a sad commentary on the state of world affairs that the opening of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and the first observance of International Day of Peace on 21 September 1982 should have taken place amid the ghastly specters of the Beirut massacre and the con¬tinued war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq.328.	Elsewhere  the international situation remains fraught with tension. There seems to be a gradual decline in the use and effectiveness of multilateral institutions and international organizations. Alliances and intergovernmental organizations that offered hope for a stable world order in the period after the Second World War are being threatened with disin¬tegration at the very core.329.	The non-aligned movement  which emerged to dismantle the exploitative colonial system and did indeed provide an alternative to East-West con¬frontational politics for the developing nations of Africa  Asia and Latin America in the immediate post-war era  has failed to convene the Conference of Heads of State or Government on schedule for the first time in its 21-year history because of the conflict in the Gulf region.330.	Similarly  the OAU  which has served as the motivating force in accelerating the African liberation struggle and the search for African solutions to African problems  has not been successful in convening the Assembly of Heads of State and Government this year because of the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democrats Republic to the OAU. However  we are pleased to note that efforts are being made to resolve the issue. My Government has undertaken the responsibility of consulting with other African Govern¬ments on ways to end the division within our organi¬zation.331.	Recently  our head of State sent a team of emissaries to seven West African countries to deliver messages relating to the current problem within the OAU. We are certain that in the end African maturity will prevail and the OAU will survive  strengthened in its principles and rededicated to the total liberation and unity of the African continent.332.	Meanwhile  in the international system  many States Members of the United Nations are increasingly resorting to unilateral action  often bypassing the United Nations without regard to their obligations under the Charter. Resolutions of the Security Coun¬cil and the General Assembly adopted through painstaking efforts and sometimes by consensus are being ignored by Member States under the pretext of preserving national identity and security.333.	With respect to the global economic situation  indications are that the world economy is experiencing greater instability than at any time since the Great Depression. The developed market economies are characterized by slow growth  persistent inflation  high unemployment  prolonged monetary instability  intensified protectionist pressures  structural malad-justments and uncertain long-term growth prospects.334.	For their part  many developing countries con¬tinue to experience very low or even negative per capita growth  with severe constraints placed on their development efforts by maladjustment in international economic relations  natural conditions and high energy costs.335.	Also  falling prices for commodities which are their major sources of income have impeded their ability to meet interest payments on loans  let alone repay the loans. Moreover  higher interest rates for new debts and redded access to external borrowing have all contributed to the economic difficulties of the developing countries  thus augmenting the poverty and deprivation of their peoples.336.	The optimism generated by the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun in October 1981  has yet to produce progress towards a movement in the global round of negotiations on international economic issues.337.	These trends point to a disquieting situation in the international system. For the weakening or collapse of multilateral institutions and regional organizations and the vicious cycle of poverty  with its attributes of dependence and underdevelopment  would serve to remove heretofore effective platforms upon which small developing nations exercised moral strength and courage for collective bargaining and security.338.	The potential to unleash greater horrors and sufferings upon mankind must be checked by the determined and honest efforts of the international community to reverse the present drift towards eco¬nomic and political catastrophe. My Government therefore calls on all Member States of this world body to rededicate themselves to the principles and spirit of the Charter. The desperate lality of the international situation requires a resolution of the apparent contradiction between the professed aspira¬tions of the United Nations and the unwillingness on the part of Member States to support those aspirations. A new global initiative is needed to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes in order to save the world from the ravages of war and prevent future horrors of death and destruction such as those the world has witnessed recently.339.	I tum now to the subject of southern Africa. In a world of conflicts and mistrust  it is reassuring to note the willingness to press ahead with negotiations on the part of the parties to the Namibian question. In this connection  I wish to state emphatically that my Government continues to view Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as the basis for a solution to the Namibian conflict. We welcome the initiatives of the contact group of five Western States and the African front-line States  and Nigeria  to help overcome obstacles in the path of the implementation of the resolution for the independence of Namibia. We should add that the independence of that African Territory cannot be delayed indefinitely.340.	Also  we should like to caution against linking a settlement of the Namibian question to the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. Any attempt to do that is morally wrong and dangerous  as the freedom of one people cannot be held hostage to the alteration of the sovereign decision of another people.341.	Today  millions of Africans continue to languish under the despicable system of	in South Africa. My Government considers the perpetuation of this oppressive system as an intolerable affront to the dignity of the black race. We therefore urge the international community and men of conscience every¬where to lend every conceivable support to the total elimination of apartheid in all its inhuman forms. In this regard  we welcome the launching of 1982 as the International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa in order to make world public opinion more aware of the grave situation in that part of Africa and also to win maximum international support for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist Republic  as laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter.342.	On the subject of the Middle East  the horrifying scenes of slaughter in Beirut should once more serve as a reminder to the international community never to allow historical sympathies to render us impotent in confronting contemporary aggression. The inter¬national outrage and revulsion generated by the mas¬sacre should convince those who are determined and consistent in committing such atrocities to abandon the notion that brute force is the only way to achieve peace and security. The senselessness of the massacre can serve only to intensify the cycle of violence  suspicion and bitterness.343.	My Government is convinced that the dispersal of the Palestinians or the resort to exterminating them cannot provide a solution to the problems of the Middle East. Only recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to a State of their own will lead to a lasting peace in that region. Additionally  there must be a return to the pre-1967 borders and all States in the region must be willing to recognize the right of each and all to live in peace within secure boundaries.344.	In this regard  my Government supports initia¬tives aimed at the restoration of the sovereignty of Lebanon and calls for the urgent reconstruction of that war-torn country.345.	Turning to the Kampuchean question  my Government believes that no effective solution to the problems in that troubled country can be achieved without a just and lasting political settlement. Such a political settlement should provide for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and ensure respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and the non-aligned status of that country.346.	Some of the problems that cloud the inter¬national horizon are rooted in the past. The Korean question  which for many years has been a focus of the concern of the Organization  remains unresolved and explosive. The postponement of its solution could lead to a renewal of hostilities on the Korean peninsula and threaten international peace and security. In accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the joint communique of 1972/9 issued by the two Korean parties  my Govern¬ment urges that they both demonstrate their willingness to settle the Korean question by peaceful means.347.	The successful conclusion of the negotiations and the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea' represent a major step forward in our attempts to establish order in the seas. The Convention is based on the concept that the resources of the sea-bed are the common heritage of mankind. One significant outcome of the negotiations is a set of treaty provisions for States to co-operate regionally and globally to protect and preserve the marine environment. This part of the Convention is consistent with the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.^"" We express our thanks to all of those who laboured tirelessly to bring these negotiations to fruition. My Government  therefore  urges all Member States to sign and ratify the Con¬vention  which will be opened for signature as of 6 December 1982  in Jamaica.348.	The post-war period has witnessed an unabated acceleration of the arms race. This race has consumed an increasing proportion of the world resources as well as a greater percentage of internationally traded goods and services. This situation has contributed to a significant diversion of globalresources from pro¬ductive to non-productive sectors. Statistics show that in a world where expenditures on armaments amount to about $700 billion annually there are 870 mil¬lion adults who cannot read and write; 500 million people who have no jobs or are less than fully employed; 130 million children who are unable to attend primary school; 450 million people who suffer from hunger or malnutrition; an annual infant mortality rate of 12 million babies who die before their first birthday; 2 billion people who do not have safe water to drink; and 250 million people who live in urban slums or shanty towns. Serious efforts and concrete actions towards disarmament could release vast resources for the constructive cause of human devel¬opment and the establishment of a more equitable international economic order.349.	It is against that background that my Govern¬ment expresses regret at the disappointing results of the second special session on disarmament. We call upon the world community not to relent in the pursuit of the objectives of general and complete disarmament  for on this hinges the survival of mankind.350.	On the subject of international economic co-operation  reports show that the fundamental prob¬lem facing the international community is to restore the growth momentum in the world economy and achieve the growth targets in the developing coun¬tries as set forth in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The realization of those objectives requires that urgent and prompt attention be given to the critical problems confronting the developing countries  such as unequal exchange on international commodity mar' ^s  finance  food and energy.351.	There is a need for greater South-South co-oper¬ation within the framework of the Caracas Programme of Action^' in order to break the cycle of dependence  poverty and underdevelopment. The developing coun¬tries must undertake concerted efforts within the context of collective self-reliance to halt the misery of their peoples  since experience has shown that the survival of a people must begin with their own efforts.352.	We are convinced that in a world of growing expectation and increasing communications between nations and social groups  a lack of response to the pressing demand for more understanding  tolerance and selflessness can become a real source of conflict at both the national and the international levels. We are in an interdependent world and must collec¬tively face the challenge to remove people from the edge of survival and ward off catastrophe.353.	The state of the world today calls for the utmost tolerance and understanding among men. We have the moral responsibility to save our world from the misery and destruction which twice in the past have brought human society to the brink of extinction. We therefore declare from this rostrum  before the entire world  that the children of tomorrow deserve a better world order  free from the suspicion  violence and hatred of today. They must be able to live in a world where men will be responsive to the needs of other men and where the enlightened consciousness of the people will usher in the brotherhood of mankind. This  and only this  can save humanity from the ravages of war."
"81",4049,"LBY",37,1982,"At the outset  Sir  I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the Genera] Assembly of the thirty-seventh session. My delegation is pleased to see you direct the proceedings of the General Assembly  because you represent a friendly country with which my country maintains very close relations  and also because of your wisdom  experience and ability  which qualify you to shoulder that responsibility and make it likely that you will achieve the best of results. I should like also to pay a tribute and to express my thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani  head of the fraternal delegation of Iraq  for the excellent manner in which he directed the proceedings of the General Assembly during the last session  and the great ability he displayed. It is also my pleasure to commend the efforts being made by the Secretary-General to strengthen the role of the Organization and to increase its efficiency.1.	Sir  you have assumed the presidency of the General Assembly at a most difficult time  a time of increasing dangers and proliferating hotbeds of tension  and of problems causing instability in international peace and security. It is a time when the world's peoples  especially the smaller ones  are concerned for their destiny and their freedom. We note that the clatter of weapons is louder than the voice of reason  that right has become has become the prerogative of the strong and that the capability of the United Nations has sunk to an unprecedented tow. Disappointment at that was ctearly expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  in which he said that  The United Nations itself has been unable to play as effective and decisive a role as the Charter certainty envisaged for it.  ... The Security Council  the primary organ of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts and its recommendations are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so2.	The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya shares the Secretary-General's views in this regard. I should like in this context to recall the letter sent by the Leader of the Revolution  brother Colonel Muammar Qaddafi  to the Secretary-General on 20 September 1982 in the wake of the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut at the hands of Israel and its agents:  I regret to have to express to you and to the world the bitter truth which I perceive in my country  namely  that the second historic attempt made by the peoples in 1943 (in San Francisco) to establish an international organization to prevent war and keep the peace has failed utterly  as did the first attempt (i.e.  the League of Nations).4. We have  however  the right to ask: where does the responsibility for the inability of the United Nations lie? Is it the responsibility of the States Members of the United Nations? Or is it the responsibility of the developing countries which are systematical subjected to military threat  economic blockade and political blackmail?3. The responsibility  as we see it  lies in the structure of the main organ of the Organization. It is the Security Council which has become an instrument to protect dictatorship for the benefit of the permanent members of the Security Council. Responsibility also lies in the abuse of the right of veto by States members of the Security Council in a manner that has made the Council a vehicle for their own security  encouraging the aggressive policies pursued by their agents. The unlimited number of times that the United States Administration has used the right of veto to prevent the Council from condemning the Zionist entity's aggressive acts in the Arab region is clear evidence of the policy of injustice being practiced under the umbrella of the United Nations and the Security Council. The reason for the inability of the Organization lies also in the fact that the right of veto that the members of the cub of victors in the Second World War granted to themselves was abused for the benefit of those victors to maintain their balance of interests. In their irresponsible exercise of the right of veto  they turn the standard of democracy upside down and subject the will of more than 130 States Members of the Organization to the mercy of the permanent members of the Security Council.6. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  after consulting a target number of Member States  put forward a number of proposals to abolish or amend the veto or to give greater power to the General Assembly and make binding its resolutions adopted by a two-thirds majority. These proposals  however  met with rejection by the great Powers which exercised pressure on other  smaller countries to prevent the abolition or amendment of the right of veto and to oppose the principles of democracy and collective responsibility for the maintenance of peace and against the principle of equal sovereignty among ail Member States  as provided for by the Charter.7.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya still holds that view and will continue to bring up the subject as long as the veto continues to exist and continues to be used against the struggles of peoples. It represents dictatorship and monopoly  and is contrary to the opinion of the majority in favor of collective responsibility and equality. We shall continue to hold these views  regardless of the stand taken by the great Powers  particularly the United States  which most abuses its use of the veto  and without regard to procedural manoeuvres to which they have recourse.8.	The time has come to look seriously into the role of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization  because the oppressed peoples of the world have almost lost faith in the United Nations. We in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya realize the dangers that would result from a loss of faith in our Organization. That is why the leader of the great September revolution made an appeal to enable the Organization to fulfill its role in maintaining peace and justice  because the dictatorial practices carried out under its umbrella may compel us to leave it and to urge other oppressed peoples to seek their own special platform from which to express their will and ambitions.9.	The abolition of the right of veto or its review  if viewed as a guarantee of democratic practices  could enable the developing peoples to regain their faith in the United Nations. My country believes that  in reviewing the veto  the following aspects should be taken into consideration: first  the abolition of the veto or its amendment which would allow its use by all members  because if political dictatorship is to be practiced  then it is only fair that it be practiced by all; secondly  the Security Council must be placed under the General Assembly  and not the other way round  because in the General Assembly resides the true will of the peoples and nations of the world; and thirdly  the maintenance of international peace and security is the collective responsibility of all.10.	The agenda of the current session of the General Assembly is full of political and economic issues  in addition to those of liberation and colonialism. 1 shall allude to those problems.11.	The recent massacres committed by the Zionist entity in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon is evidence of the tragedy that has befallen the cause of the just struggle of the Palestinian people  and demonstrates the aggressive  Fascist and racist nature of the so-called State of Israel. It confirms beyond doubt that the State of the Zionist entity is not peace-loving and is a source of threat to international peace and security.12.	The continued occupation of the Palestinian territories since 1948  the annexation of the Golan Heights and the massacres committed daily against the Palestinians and Lebanese  must induce the international community represented in the United Nations to take practical measures to eliminate aggression and occupation and to enable the Palestinian people to return to its homeland.13.	The practical measures envisaged by my country are as follows: first  the expulsion of the Zionist entity from the General Assembly  on the grounds that the Israelis and their State are not peace-loving  and in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its ninth emergency special session  at which it debated Israel's repeated aggression against the Arab territories; secondly  the halting of military  material and political support provided by the United States Administration  which exceeds $10 million daily  because we see that support as encouragement for Israel to continue its constant aggression against the Arabs and its challenge to the resolutions of the international community; thirdly  the economic boycott of the Zionist entity in implementation of the resolutions of the General Assembly  on the grounds that Israel is occupying Arab territories by force  and because of its disregard of the resolutions of the international community. If some were able to impose an economic boycott on Argentina for demanding territories that belong to it  one wonders how it is that an economic boycott is not imposed on a Member of the United Nations that all have admitted is not peace-loving and is a threat to international peace and securityóand by that I mean Israel; fourthly  the halt of immigration  particularly that coming to occupied Palestine from Eastern bloc countries  because the immigrants are primarily citizens of those countries  and because their continued influx into occupied Palestine represents an increase in Israel's human and military capacity to continue to exercise a policy of aggression and occupation.14.	The political solutions proposed for the Palestine question come at a time when the United Nations is apparently unable to check Israeli intransigence. That is in addition to the inability of the Organization to stand against support of the American Government for Israel's aggressive policies. We therefore not see in the initiatives undertaken by the United States Administration a valid basis for any just peace.13. The United States peace initiative ignores the resolutions of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity  and the group of non-aligned countries  which affirm the right of the Palestinian people to determine their own destiny and establish their own independent State under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  their legitimate and sole representative. Furthermore  the peace initiative put forward by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  is too optimistic; it has much good will but does not recognize the true nature of the Zionist entity. It runs counter to the following logical facts.16.	History has taught us that the occupier  the aggressor  is the one that puts forward political initiatives to those under its occupation. The only initiative that can be put forward by a colonized people is armed struggle. On what logic should the Arabs come up with peace initiatives when the American people  with French assistance  confronted British colonialism and Europe confronted Nazi occupation in defense of peace and freedom?17.	The Security Council must guarantee the security of all States in the region and that assumes two things  namely: that Israel is threatened by its Arab neighborsówhich is contrary to the truth  for Israel is the constant aggressor that threatens Arab security  and  furthermore  Israel's security and its policy of aggression are guaranteed by the United States militarily and financially; and that the Arab peace plan would have the Security Council guarantee the security of all States in the region. That represents recognition of Israel. We wonder how we can ask for protection and recognition of a State the established political schemes of which include the occupation of Arab territories and the policy of genocide and displacement pursued by it against the Arab peoples in Palestine and Lebanon.18. Any real peace initiative must come through the United Nations  in spite of its weakness. Peace initiatives now coming from the Arabs are taken under the pressure of an Israeli force supported by the United States and under the United States threat to and blackmail of the Arabs.19.	The present Government of the United States of America is increasing its acts of intervention and pressure for the purpose of achieving political  economic and military hegemony. It has gone back to the policy of installing military bases in many parts of the world. It has used its war fleets to practice terrorism along the shores of non-aligned countries  as it did in August 1981 to my country  thereby violating our sovereignty over our territorial waters. The last act of aggression was on 3 September 1982  when a United States aircraft violated our airspace at 7.59 p.m. It was an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. Our air defenses downed it in the Benghazi area  and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will submit the documents and facts on this aggression to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary- General.20.	Also  in August 1981 the American Government launched a propaganda campaign of falsehoods and imposed an economic embargo against Libya. It started to incite other countries to follow its example on false pretexts  such as the alleged sending of a death squad to assassinate President Reaganówhich proved to be only the product of the imagination of certain officials in the United States Administration in collaboration with the Zionist intelligence service.21.	The United States Administration's practice of threatening the Caribbean countries and its attempts to prevent them from exercising their free will prove the imperialist nature of the United States Administration. The aggressive policies pursued by that Administration against Cuba  Nicaragua  Grenada and the people of El Salvador are examples of the United States policy  the aim of which is to create hotbeds of tension and instability in the world  particularly in the Middle East and southern Africa.22.	The issues of disarmament and the strengthening of international security are among the most serious and complicated matters facing our world today. They have been at the centre of attention for the international community for many years. This attention has been reflected in the convening of numerous conferences since 1932  in particular the two special sessions of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the first in 1978 and the second this year  and also in the resolutions adopted in this regard. However  we see no signs on the horizon that progress in this respect is being achieved. On the contrary  the arms race has continued  especially between the superpowers in the nuclear field  with the development of new weapons systems  such as the neutron bomb  and the continued promotion of certain dangerous theories  such as those of nuclear deterrence  strategic balance and a limited nuclear war that can be won  as well as the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons  not to mention the reported and manifest acquisition of nuclear weapons by the racist regimes of the Zionist entity and Pretoria.23.	The issue of disarmament is not just a military one; it is also an economic  social and political issue. In the study carried out by the United Nations entitled the relationship between disarmament and development it is stated that 1 500 million people do not have access to effective medical services  nearly 570 million suffer from severe malnutrition  800 million are illiterate and 250 million children do not attend school. This was at a time  1981  when the world expenditure for military purposes exceeded $600 billion.24.	In addition to these negative developments in the field of disarmament  in recent years we have witnessed a deterioration in international relations as a result of the violation of the Charter and international principles  in particular those relating to the right to sovereignty  independence  non-intervention and the non-use of force in international relations and the continued spread of the areas of war and hotbeds of tension.25.	In the African continent the policy of apartheid pursued by the racist regime in South Africa continues unabated in spite of the frequent condemnation by the Organization  which considers it a crime against humanity. However  because of the assistance given to that regime by the colonialists  especially the United States  this abhorrent policy continues to be practiced against African nationalists.26.	In Namibia the Pretoria regime continues  through its illegal administration  to oppress the black citizens and plunder the resources of that Territory  in collaboration with multinational corporations of Western countries which have impeded the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which contains a plan for the independence of the Territory. In this connection  the role of the Europeans is complementary to that of the Americans in trying to achieve independence for Namibia in accordance with Western schemes which hav6 nothing to do with Security Council resolutions. One of the latest obstacles created by the United States Administration was the linking of the subject of Namibia's independence to the evacuation of Cuban forces from Angola  which amounts to interference in the affairs of an independent sovereign State  which has the right to protect itself and seek help from any State as it sees fit.27.	The aggressive and racist practices of the Pretoria regime are not directed against the black citizens of Namibia and South Africa only; they have been extended to include the neighbouring countries  namely  the front-line States. Attacks have been frequent  especially against the territory of Angola. In this respect  my country declares its support and backing for the struggle of the African citizens of Namibia and South Africa and for the steadfastness of the front-line States; we commend those States and are proud of their steadfastness.28.	Colonialism and its surrogates  as well as the exploitative companies  continue to pursue their ambitions with tenacity and are prepared to intervene in any country that is ruled by a progressive and non-aligned regime desiring to free itself politically and economically. This was clear in the aggression against the Jamahiriya and also in that against the Republic of Seychelles  which was subjected to subversive actions perpetrated by external elements that wanted to create a state of anarchy and instability in order to bring down its progressive regime and replace it by one subservient to colonialism and under its political and economic influence. However  the people of Seychelles were able to overcome and thwart those acts of aggression. We in the Jamahiriya  together with the forces of progress and freedom^ support the people and the Government of Seychelles against any foreign maneuvers.29.	One of the regions that experience tension as a result of intervention and the installation of foreign bases is Central America  where the people of Nicaragua are struggling against the intervention of the United States of America  which has been training hostile elements and sending them to Nicaragua to carry out acts of terrorism and subversion.30.	We are witnessing a liberation movement sweeping through Central America. We see the United States attempting to stifle that movement  as is happening now in El Salvador and Guatemala  in addition to its constant threats and aggression against Cuba and the usurpation of the Puerto Rican people's right to independence.31.	My country supports the struggle of the peoples of Latin America against United States imperialism and affirms its unlimited support for Cuba and Nicaragua in their confrontation with the American policy of aggression.32.	My country followed with increasing concern the war which was forced on Argentina to recover the Malvinas Islands from British control. Anyone reflecting on that war and the way it developed would be shocked by the following facts. First  the United States claim that it belongs to the group of American States is only a covey for the protection of American interests and the Fascist regimes which are satellites of the United States Administration. The United States has revealed its imperialist nature and supported the British aggression carried out against the Malvinas Islands. Secondly  the British presence in the Malvinas Islands is but a vestige of the old colonialism which divided the world into spheres of influence among the strong and used its control to implant communities that did not belong originally to the indigenous populations of the occupied territories. Thirdly  the Malvinas war emphasizes the inevitable confrontation between the imperialist Powers and the third world countries  which have to realize that all that the super-Powers aim at is to have greater domination and wider spheres of influence.33.	Therefore my country supports Argentina's right to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and calls upon the international community to use all possible peaceful means to ensure finally the ending of the British colonization of the Malvinas Islands.34.	The United States exploitation of internal strife in certain countries of Asia aggravates tension in the region. The Afghan war and the situation in Kampuchea represent areas of tension in South-East Asia aggravated by foreign interference in the affairs of those countries. Therefore my country affirms the right of those peoples to exercise their freedom of choice. My country supports the principle that Afghanistan should be an independent  non-aligned country following the path of progressive Islamic States.35.	The question of Western Sahara continues to be one of the primary issues facing the Organization and there is the threat of American imperialist interference. We therefore emphasize that the Organization should assume its responsibility by affirming the right of the Sahraoui people to free self-determination  alongside the African peoples which have exercised their right to freedom and sovereignty over their territories.36.	The question of Cyprus is one that has been before the United Nations for a long time without any comprehensive solution being found. My country supports direct negotiations between the Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus with a view to finding a just solution to this problem which would guarantee the independence and neutrality of Cyprus.37.	The situation in the Mediterranean has become dangerous as a result of the increasing pressures of foreign war fleets and military bases  especially American fleets and bases  which have become a source of concern and a subversive element  threatening the security of Mediterranean countries. Everybody has heard about the United States Sixth Fleet  which is deployed constantly off the Libyan shore and carries out provocative maneuvers  some of which were in Libyan territorial waters.38.	It is our desire that that sea become a lake of peace  free from foreign fleets and bases and hotbeds of tension. Believing in the necessity of realizing this objective  the Jamahiriya has moved to settle the dispute between itself and its neighbor  the sister State of Tunisia  over the continental shelf. The International Court of Justice delivered its judgment in the case on 24 February 1982. The dispute with Malta over the delimitation of the continental shelf has likewise been referred to the International Court of Justice.39.	The effects of the acts of confrontation and war have sometimes extended to societies which have not participated in such acts and are not parties to them. This is evidenced by the tragedies and consequences of the Second World War which continue to surface in my country  causing economic  social and environmental problems. The minefields planted by the warring forces over vast tracts of territory in my country have delayed the carrying out of development projects and raised the cost of such projects  in particular that of prospecting for minerals.40.	This problem has been discussed at meetings of the non-aligned movement and here in the Assembly  and several resolutions have been adopted in this regard  affirming the responsibility of the countries that planted those mines to compensate the affected countries for the material and moral losses caused by this problem and calling for co-operation in the provision of information about and maps of those minefields.41.	The relevant decisions of international and regional organizations  conventions and international laws require the States which participated in the Second World War and their allies who planted mines in Libyan territory to shoulder the responsibility  pay the required compensation and co-operate in the final solution of this problem. Accordingly  my country hopes that such States and the United Nations will take practical measures to place the responsibility where it belongs and guarantee the right of the affected States to compensation for the damage sustained by them as a result of the effects and vestiges of war."
"82",4084,"LCA",37,1982,"95.	 I should like to join those who have preceded me in placing one more flower in the bouquet of congratulations that the President has received and with justification. I do so with the confidence that the vast experience and skill that he possesses will be put to the service of this parliament of nations which he now heads. Upon his shoulders now lies the mantle worn by many distinguished statesmen  the latest being his worthy and immediate predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who led the Assembly safely through the turbulence of the thirty-sixth session.96.	The universal character of this body is no more exemplified than in the fact that a distinguished son of another region our region  the Latin American and Caribbean region has been honored and with him the entire region to hold the office of Secretary- General during this most crucial and exacting period in the history of the Organization. The delegation of Saint Lucia not only congratulates Mr. Perez de Cuellar upon his election to that high office  but notes with commendation the imprint of his dedicated personality  which is already in evidence on the Organization.97.	The Secretary-General has assumed office at a time when peace-makers the world over need the consolation that they are called blessed and we all hope that by his efforts and those of other peace-makers  man will continue to inherit the earth. The report on the work of the Organization produced by the Secretary-General in so short a time and in times punctuated with such anxiety for the process of peace amply justifies the confidence that was placed in him when he was chosen as Chief Executive of the Organization. It is the duty of all of us who are dedicated to the cause of peace to ensure that the guidelines laid down in the report are followed and that the conclusions of so excellent an analysis do not lose their fragrance in the desert air of barren rhetoric.98.	Throughout the world the war drums continue to throb. Throughout the world the production  stockpiling  sale and distribution of weapons of war and destruction continue at an ever-escalating pace. The hungry furnaces of armaments suck in and consume enormous and ever-increasing proportions of the world's treasures. While the specter of famine is a constant and ever-present companion of millions in the Sahel and in sub-Saharan Africa  the weapons of war pour into the Horn of Africa. The arms trade between the industrialized nations and the nations of the third world now reaches the obscene proportions of billions of dollars annually and much of that trade is with the poorest of the poor nations  to whose relief much of the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations is directed. The arms bazaar teems with merchants of death  eager to place sophisticated weapons in the hands of mere children. Generous credits are extended to the purchasers of weapons  while such agencies as UNDP are left short of funds to support programs designed to lift the poor out of the bondage of poverty. What a saH harvest we sow for our children.99.	But what are the immediate consequences of this widespread irrationality? The economies of the world are so burdened with the cost of arms  so starved of resources that are deflected to the purchase of weapons of destruction that we are now faced with the looming spectacle of a depression which shows signs of being wider and deeper than that of the 1930s  and for scores of nations and hundreds of millions of people nothing short of catastrophe looms. While nations continue upon this irrational course  while the treasures and the blood of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq are poured out upon the desert sands  while the refugee camps of Africa swell with the ever- increasing tide of human misery  the arms race continues and the merchants of death prosper.100.	As so much of the world's resources are sucked into this insatiable vortex  the economies of the world stagger drunkenly under the excessive burden of armaments. Countries are forced to borrow not for development  but to pay interest rates that have now risen to unprecedented heights; inflation rages through economies with the speed and destructiveness of forest fires; the debt burden of nations reaches staggering proportions; the lines of the unemployed cast an ever-lengthening shadow; and nations producers of primary products are pushed to their very knees as the value of their exports reaches its lowest levels since the 1930s.101.	With all these warning signs of economic collapse and with the instruments and devices for averting this catastrophe within our control  we nevertheless appear to stand transfixed and helpless waiting for the collapse  waiting for the new depression before we take action to avert it.102.	Saint Lucia is convinced that nothing short of a halt to this senseless expenditure on arms and armaments can avert the severe economic crisis which faces us  as we hold most steadfastly that therein lies the root cause of our current economic difficulties. The Government of Saint Lucia will therefore support with zeal any initiative to bring the World Disarmament Conference to a successful conclusion. And we note with joy that the crown of honor has been placed upon the work of one of the most persistent workers in the cause of peace  Mr. Garcia Robles  the Permanent Representative of Mexico  for his efforts in the Committee on Disarmament.103.	Within recent times  members of this body  in violation of their obligations under the Charter  have resorted to or threatened to resort to the use of force in the settlement of disputes; in some instances  as in the case of the Falkland Islands  while the dispute was under the mediation of the Security Council and within sight of a peaceful solution. Such action will find no support from the Government of Saint Lucia but on the contrary will be visited with swift condemnation. On the specific case of the Falkland Islands the position of the Government of Saint Lucia is that there must be the right of self-determination  as has been frequently restated in resolutions of this body  and further  that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means. From this position we shall not waver.104.	This means of mediation and restraint we commend to all Member States and in particular those within our hemisphere. Although the territorial dispute between Guyana and Venezuela has not yet been satisfactorily resolved  the Government of Saint Lucia notes with approbation that both countries have been most restrained in the pursuit of their competing claims and have expressed their willingness to seek resolution through mediation. We urge them to continue on this course of conciliation.105.	This restraint is not apparent  however  in the claim by Guatemala against the territorial integrity of Belize. The Government of Saint Lucia notes with regret the bellicose attitude which Guatemala continues to exhibit with reflect to the sovereign State of Belize and urges other States to give no aid  comfort or assistance concerning such intentions against a State Member of the United Nations.106.	In the very bosom of the Americas  a region for over a century protected by the ocean from great- Power conflict  there are now ominous rumblings and this must cause us some concern. The problem of unequal distribution of land and wealth  a legacy of the colonial past  cannot be solved by the introduction of armed conflict into the region. But the social order of ""the rich man in his castle  the poor man at his gate"" can no longer be tolerated in our hemisphere. It must be accepted  too  that social and economic problems are not amenable to military solutions. Nations in which such manifestations of social and economic injustice exist must seek through structural changes in the society to deal with this by conciliation and mediation within their own societies  and no nation should seek  by the introduction of arms and military advisers into the region  to extend its sphere of influence by taking advantage of this tragic situation. Any assistance to the region should be directed  rather  into avenues which assist in the removal of the root cause of the problem; instead of being channeled into arms  training camps and military advisers to fuel the conflict and exacerbate human suffering  it should be used to replenish the resources of the International Development Association and for financing land reform and other measures for the restructuring of the economy of the countries concerned.107.	But  while some countries hold the footlights of the world stage  the center stage and the spotlight are still occupied by the events in the Middle East. The tragic and savage events in Beirut and the continued hemorrhaging of Lebanon cannot but arouse the righteous indignation of the civilized world and the condemnation of the Organization. There can be absolutely no justification for this savagery. These events are the more lamentable in that involved in them  however indirectly  is a nation whose centuries of suffering have introduced into the languages of the world the words ""diaspora"" and ""holocaust"".108 The right of Israel to exist and to live within secure and defensible boundaries is a right which the Government of Saint Lucia has and will continue fervently to support. The bloodletting in the region we have always deplored  the indiscriminate killings of civilians we have always condemned  but these brutal acts against the conscience of humanity will always continue unless Israel whose people through centuries of tribulations and Diaspora  throughout the holocaust  kept their faith alive by the hopeful greeting  “Tomorrow  in Jerusalem"" understands another people's longing for a homeland; until the intense desire of the Palestinian people for a homeland is satisfied  there will be no peace in this troubled land because there will have been no justice. The Government of Israel should realize that the iron bars of a prison cannot confine an ideal  nor the mass burial grounds of Beirut inter a dream. The dream of the Palestinians will continue to haunt the corridors of this Organization until their search for justice is successful. The Government of Saint Lucia hails the valiant effort of Mr. Philip Habib to end the conflict in Lebanon and looks forward to the day when that troubled land will be free of foreign troops and its people permitted to live in peace under their own vines and fig trees.109.	The racist regime in South Africa cannot  however  be permitted to live in peace by segregating itself from the rest of the civilized world. How long can this racist and oppressive regime continue to thumb its nose at the Organization? How long will it be permitted to occupy the United Nations Trust Territory of Namibia and impose upon its people the abhorrent doctrine of apartheid? These are questions which cry out for answers^ answers that the contact group of Western States is slow to provide. South Africa not only has subjugated its people by oppression  legislative acts and naked police terror but  like any outlaw  has sought to extend its reign of terror beyond its boundaries  threatening the stability of States in the region. Until the activities of South Africa can be brought within the pale of civilized conduct neighboring States will harbor uneasiness regarding their own security and seek appropriate measures in this regard. South Africa cannot be permitted to impose conditions for Namibian independence  and the Government of Saint Lucia awaits with eagerness the long-delayed admission of this country to the community of independent nations.110.	I believe that I voice the sentiment of all third world and developing countries when I say that we are tired of conflict  tired of wars and rumors of wars  and we look forward to the time when nations will beat their swords into ploughshares  and when the rich products of man's mind  the products of science and technology  will be put to man's service in the fight against his ancient enemies  poverty  hunger and disease. We look forward to the time when such technology  now so triumphant in the exploration of space  will be extended to the exploration of the riches of the sea-bed. It is a tribute to the statesmanship of Members of the Organization that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  after years of patient negotiations  is now within our grasp. This act of statesmanship is intended to prevent the kind of rapacious colonialization and exploration of thesea-bed and exploitation of the resources of the sea which  when applied to other spheres  brought to the African continent a legacy of suffering suffering which has yet to be helled. As island States  we in Saint Lucia and in the Caribbean have an intense and abiding interest in this Convention  and although some points of detail remain to be resolved  the Government of Saint Lucia looks forward to the signing and ratification of the final act  in another Caribbean island State  Jamaica  in December of this year. In the encircling gloom of the world economy  this is a tiny ray of hope that shines like a beacon.111.	But no such light can be seen on the horizon of the global economic negotiations. The so-called North-South dialog on the new international economic order is now stalled. What we have instead is a rising tide of protectionism that threatens to stifle world trade and economic co-operation. As the economic storms lash our shores  nations now tend to seek refuge within their fortress of economic isolation  erect strong tariff walls against each other and pull up their drawbridge behind them. Such devices  simple and politically attractive though they may appear  cannot work in a world where economies are so intricately intertwined and interdependent. Such action is but an admission of powerlessness  of an erosion of confidence in the conventional wisdom and of orthodoxy recently so fashionable  of a sense of being overwhelmed by forces beyond national influence or international control. That there can be so abject a surrender to economic forces renders all our statements here but empty rhetoric.112.	But not only is our economic well-being threatened; our political structures may well be convulsed  if the international community does not face up to the need to provide mechanisms for global management of the world economy and assist in its recovery. The mechanism for recovery was adequately analyzed and documented in the Brandt Report  and it should form the basis for urgent negotiations. The procedural objections being used as delaying devices should be beneath the contemplation of some of the major countries of the North  but unfortunately this is not the case. In the three or so years since the Brandt Report was published  and in the many months since the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held in 1981 at Cancun  there has been no discernible progress or meaningful discussion on this initiative.113.	Here again we stand transfixed without will  huddled in our own igloos  hoping that the more rabid manifestations of world economic disorder will pass us by. But we live in one world. The vast majority of the consumers of manufactured goods live in the South  and unless this vast potential is mobilized all our efforts at economic readjustment  all the aid to keep the teeming multitudes from starvation  will be no more effective than putting a band-aid on a cancer. What is necessary  and what the Brandt Report urges  is to restructure a system created many years ago to satisfy the needs of a few industrialized countries so as to meet the present-day realities of the emergence on the international scene of a hundred or so new nations  which are now the majority in this world Organization. 114.	No country  no nation  wants to suffer the indignity of being for ever on the bread line of the world. But countries* emergence from this condition is not helped by the attitude of some Member States which seek to avoid their humanitarian obligations to provide multilateral assistance through United Nations specialized agencies by advancing the specious argument that all the ills of the third world countries are but the legacy of colonialism  and that therefore the obligations for relief and assistance must be borne only by the former colonial Powers. This argument the Government of Saint Lucia unequivocally rejects as spurious and untenable  since no such argument is used when bilateral aid is offered as an extension of foreign policy and in the extension of spheres of influence. These multilateral agencies have been specifically designed to assist poorer nations to extricate themselves from the bonds of poverty  and it is by the support of these programs that the righteousness of one's utterances can be judged.115.	We live in one world  the frontiers of which are being shrunk daily by the advance of science  a world which now demands an answer to the question “Am I my brother's keeper?"""" It is because it sees it as being in keeping with that question and as a tentative attempt at an answer that the Government of Saint Lucia welcomes the Caribbean Basin Initiative outlined by President Reagan. Some aspects of this initiative still require refinement and qualification  but in principle it affords the countries of the Caribbean covered by the proposal a unique opportunity to help themselves. It is by giving people an opportunity to develop themselves and contribute to the world's stock of resources  by initiating and supporting programs that give people that sense of participating  that sense of ownership  that sense of belonging  that an era of peace can be ushered in an era when the war drums will throb no longer and the battle flags are furled.116.	We in our part of the world  in the blue and placid Caribbean Sea  wish to be no one's satellite or ideological appendage. Left out of the ideological struggles  we wish to devise an economic system uniquely our own  and to live in peace under the protective mantle of this unique organization  of which we are a proud member and a staunch supporter."
"83",4154,"LKA",37,1982,"3.	 On behalf of my Minister for Foreign Affairs and on my own behalf I should like to extend to you  Sir  my warm congratulations on your unanimous election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly. Your election is a recognition of your talent and experience in the conduct of international affairs and a tribute to Hungary a country with which Sri Lanka has warm and cordial relations. I should also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani  who presided so well over the last session of the General Assembly. Similarly  I wish to convey to the Secretary-General our warm appreciation for his unrelenting labors in the cause of the United Nations.4.	We are about to end this year's general debate  during which we have been privileged to hear distinguished leaders from several Member States. I make this statement on behalf of my delegation today only because Sri Lanka is on the eve of an election  when its people will  under their Constitution  exercising their freedom and the universal franchise which they have enjoyed for 51 years  elect a President. That freedom  that democratic right to elect their leader and their Government at prescribed intervals  is a quality which we cherish and proclaim with some justifiable pride.5.	The leaders who have addressed the Assembly on the international situation  while not agreed on the causes  have been unanimous concerning the gravity of the situation that now prevails. They have spoken of the continuing armed conflicts in some regions  the heightened confrontation in others and the cease-fires and the fragility of the peace obtaining elsewhere. They have also spoken of the dire poverty and hunger of many millions of the world's people  the plight of millions of refugees  the millions of unemployed and the world's economy in recession. And they have spoken of the patent incongruity of the continuing expenditure of billions on the arms race ostensibly to provide security but in truth leading us inexorably to a nuclear holocaust.6.	We Member States bring these issues before the Organization  having established it to resolve these very problems. But  as to the present state of the Organization and its capacity to fulfill that task  the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization [A/37II] could not have been more forthright. He tells us of the disarray in the United Nations system of collective security and describes the present situation as ""perilously near to a new international anarchy"". He could not have spoken otherwise  having seen the blatant disregard of principles of the Charter and the defiance of resolutions  not just of the General Assembly but also of the Security Council  and witnessed a Security Council incapable of enforcing its own fiat.7.	We have come to this sorry pass because Member States pursue their exclusive national interests with scant regard for the obligations they have assumed under the Charter. And when this malaise overcomes the permanent members of the Security Council  as the Secretary-General says in his report  ""we bring upon ourselves a global catastrophe and find ourselves without institutions effective enough to prevent it"".8.	In his report the Secretary.-General asks Member States and the Security Council tr take cognizance of situations and act before they reach the point of crisis. He seeks the support of its more influential members to ensure respect for the Organization's decisions. Several leaders have commended the Secretary-General for his appraisal. We can only hope that Member States will be no less fervent in their support for him when he acts in accordance with the responsibilities vested in him by the Charter.9.	In June this year we assembled for the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second special session on disarmament. It is not speaking with hindsight to say that the circumstances under which that session met were most propitious. We were meeting to talk about disarmament while three separate wars were being fought  the human and material costs and consequences of which are yet to be assessed. For months before and during the special session popular sentiment  wherever that could be openly expressed  was persistent and vocal in reminding us of how much was expected of us. After five weeks of protracted exchanges we could only conclude with a feeble document recalling our renewed commitment to the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly. It has been left to the General Assembly to determine the date of the next special session on the subject. As we said at the concluding meeting of the second special session on disarmament [28th meetingJ  we were even more dismayed by the attitude of some who believed that they had in 1978 conceded too much and who sought to retract the commitments they had undertaken.10.	Though nuclear disarmament has been acknowledged as the first priority  according to the rationale it is the deterrent effect of the nuclear weapon that has ensured the security of many and the fragile peace. Our response remains that peace through the nuclear deterrent has been sustained  not at the progressively reduced level envisaged but at an accelerated and competitive level of nuclear destructiveness. We can therefore only reiterate that security through the nuclear deterrent and the reversal of the nuclear arms race are quite incompatible. In June we suggested that if the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons was not acceptable we should at least demand a joint or individual declaration by nuclear-weapon States that they would not be the first to use nuclear weapons. Such an undertaking had long been given by one nuclear-weapon State  namely  China  and at the second special session on disarmament we welcomed a similar declaration by the Soviet Union. Similar or reciprocal declarations from the other nuclear-weapon States would have their own consequences as regards our goal of nuclear disarmament.11.	Again at the special session we recalled the somewhat tedious history of the tripartite negotiations on a nuclear test-ban treaty and concluded by reiterating the appeal made in 1978 that  pending the conclusion of a test-ban treaty  there should at least be a moratorium on nuclear tests. The renewed efforts of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva have been slow  and it is in this context that we welcome the initiative of the Soviet delegation at this session of the General Assembly calling for the immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear weapon tests  including a moratorium on peaceful nuclear explosions [see AI37/243]. This proposal will receive our most careful consideration.12.	Sri Lanka was privileged to be the Asian country that transmitted a message by satellite to the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration andPeaceful Uses of Outer Space  held in August this year in Vienna. The President of Sri Lanka  Mr. J.R. Jayawardene  addressing that gathering via satellite from Colombo  stated:""The potential of satellite technology for destructive uses is the greatest challenge which humanity faces today. We have the word of every astronaut and cosmonaut who looked at planet earth from space that their first response to this view of our planet was a profound realization not only of its smallness in the vastness of the universe but also of the oneness of the human condition. The greatest irony of our time is that  even with that perception of our human bond  nations could think in terms of using that very same space to deny that bond. It would be man's greatest injustice to man  man's greatest insult to science to view outer space as another arena of conflict  another medium of mutual destruction. On behalf of all the peoples of our world and in the name of all humanity  I voice our profound hope that this Conference will succeed in averting that folly.13.	We believe that those sentiments will find a universal echo; and during this session Sri Lanka will join with other delegations and will give of its best to help preserve peace in outer space.14.	During the last 30 years  no General Assembly session has concluded its business without adopting more than one resolution on the Middle East and Palestine. For over two years now  we have been suspending without closure an emergency special session on Palestine; the foresight of having resorted to that procedure has become increasingly evident. This year we meet in somewhat different circumstances. Having invaded and occupied more territory in Lebanon  including part of its capital  Israel advanced into west Beirut  ostensibly to enforce order there after the assassination of the President-elect of Lebanon. Having demanded and obtained the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  Israel was in effective control of west Beirut. The world was aghast when an internal faction in Lebanon carried out the massacre of defenseless Palestinians herded into refugee camps. The estimates of the numbers killed have been given in the hundreds  but they are believed to be too low and the truth about the scope of the violence may never be known.15.	The parallels and the ironies the diaspora  the ghettos  the branding as ""terrorists""  the annexations and now a holocaust are too obvious to avoid mentioning. The death-camps in Europe hastened the acceptance of a State for the Jewish people  and we had to have the genocide and massacres of Shatila and Sabra to convince the unbelieving that the Palestinians also have a right to a homeland  to peace and security. Their heroism and sacrifices have also become a legend in our time. I might conclude my remarks on this subject with an expression of hope that the adoption of the proposals by Arab leaders at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez and the initiative shown by the leadership of other crucial countries may serve as a new beginning to a solution of this problem.16.	For over a decade  Sii Lanka  together with the other littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean region  has sought to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We had hoped that  with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and other maritime users  the Conference on the Indian Ocean scheduled to be held at Colombo in 1981 would mark a significant beginning for the implementation of the Declaration. That conference was postponed to the first half of 1983. At no time have we taken the position that a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean will materialize overnight from one conference. Rather  we regard the conference in Colombo as the commencement of a process to include the consideration of such remaining issues as could not be completed during the preparatory meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean.17.	The view that the political and security climate must reach some hypothetical degree of improvement  and the recurring tendency to link every initiative with global strategies  should not be applied selectively. No international conference or negotiation has been deferred until circumstances were ideal  or nearly ideal. It seems appropriate to ask whether the Treaty of Tlatelolco would have come about if its pioneer  Mr. Garcia Robles  had deferred that project until today. On the contrary: conferences and negotiations have been held in the midst of hostilities. None among us would claim the ability to forecast that the future holds the promise of better times. If anything  what we have heard during this session is that the international situation has worsened yet negotiations in other areas are taking place. As I speak here today  my delegation believes that it is still possible for the Ad Hoc Committee to place before the General Assembly a draft resolution that will enable the conference to be held in accordance with General Assembly resolution 36/90 of December 1981.18.	We have waited four years for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was to have made Namibia free. The five Western States whose initiative made that resolution possible have been conducting negotiations with the Government of South Africa. The United Nations has been in readiness to play its own part with the administrative and operational arrangements. However  at the pre-implementation meeting at Geneva in January 1981 the Government of South Africa showed that it had undergone a significant change of attitude  a change which even some of the Western contact group found it difficult to entertain. The cease-fire and the free elections  which were to bring about the independence of Namibia  were delayed by new conditions which had little relation to the mandate given under resolution 435 (1978). While it is sought to accommodate these new conditions  the work entrusted to the United Nations is held in abeyance. There have been reports that even the Tumhalle group which was installed in Windhoek has been found by the powers in Pretoria to be less than equal to its task. Once again the authenticity of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] as the sole representative of the Namibian people has been demonstrated. What does provide a reason for concern is the continuing sensitivity being shown towards a Government whose apartheid policies have received universal opprobrium. Four years of prevarication is more than the international community can countenance. We would ask only that the United Nations resume the role conferred on it by Security Council resolution 435 (1978).19.	There are three other issues on which my delegation considers it necessary to comment. Two of them concern the geographic area from which we come  Afghanistan and Kampuchea while the third concerns Cyprus. The non-aligned movement  of which Sri Lanka is a member  regards non-interference in internal affairs as a cardinal principle. When interference takes the form of entry by foreign troops into another's territory  the threshold has  literally and metaphorically  been crossed. That has been the situation in those three countries. While those foreign troops remain  we can take no position other than that which we take year after year in the draft resolutions that come before the General Assembly. In doing so we are not only upholding a principle  but also resorting to what is perhaps the only safeguard available to smaller States. We wish for the success of the efforts now being made by the Secretary-General to bring about a political settlement in Afghanistan  and we trust that they will proceed with greater momentum. We hope that the new coalition Government for Kampuchea will offer a new approach. In Cyprus  which has had to endure the longest occupation  we would ask that the inter-communal talks prove to be more productive than they have been hitherto and that the Members of the Organization will remain committed to their own resolutions calling for the restoration to Cyprus of all its territory  free from external interference.20.	The time has now come to state clearly that no matter how one describes or determines the mighty on this planet  their might is of little consequence if it is exercised to the neglect and the detriment of the small and the weak. It is our view that following the near total failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris in 1975 we have today perhaps one last opportunity to sort out our international economic relations in a global process and thus prevent anarchy. Self-reliance is but one aspect of the attempt to bring some order and reason to international economic relations. The case for reasonable conduct through international agreements and regulations cannot be dismissed as dangerous thinking promoted by third world countries in an attempt but a vain attempt to claim their share of the pie. A joint effort at achieving an equitable new order is an imperative if we are to continue together. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  has cautioned against those short-term advantages which sometimes dictate political solutions to problems. That same caution needs to be applied in the field of economic relations. The short-term advantage has too often proved to lead to long-term disaster.21.	Sri Lanka has without doubt reaped many benefits from its membership of the United Nations system as a whole. It is a matter for regret  however  that those aspects of the Charter devoted to the economic and social well-being of the peoples that areto be saved from the scourge of war have been increasingly neglected through failure on the part of the international community to use the United Nations system as a positive instrument for economic and social development.22.	We have identified the need for a North-South dialog  a South-South dialog  an East-West dialog and so on. This identification is perhaps a useful method for setting about to solve problems of international economic relations. We do not  however  have an identity of views on the ingredients for the solution of those problems. In his report the Secretary-General has proposed a high-level meeting of members of the Security Council in order to solve certain problems. We see in this a vital link with the need for a global round of negotiations on economic affairs. If we fail to see that link  the vitality of the multilateral process will become eroded and it will be open to grave danger.23.	Considerable efforts have been made by the developing countries to use existing institutions in order to achieve the kind of harmonization which is a cherished goal of the Charter. We have endeavored to bring the kind of new thinking to the World Bank system that will help it keep pace with the constantly changing perceptions of economic development. At the joint annual meetings of the Board of Governors of the World Bank  held in Ontario in September  the Minister of Finance of Sri Lanka made the following observation:“These institutions are not independent entities living and moving in a world apart. They are creatures of the international economic environment. And it is policy-makers and politicians who shape and reshape that environment.""24.	Since 1963 UNCTAD has been a central forum for the determination of development priorities. In retrospect  considerable value should be attached to UNCTAD as a forum for negotiations and as one which has lived up to expectations  rather more than did the first session of UNCTAD  which resulted in the creation of an international trade organization. Similarly  GATT continues to be a focal point for some of the distressing features of disharmony in international trade. It is ironic that laissez-faire thinking  which was mooted as a framework for improvement in trade and in trade-related matters for the world as a whole  has today resulted in modifications to the detriment of third world countries at a time when barriers to trade constitute one of the biggest impediments to advancement in this field. The social factors that prompt protectionism and what are termed unfair trade practices are understandable. It is this very fact that should prompt the international leadership to undertake a searching examination of the issue  with a view to changing attitudes on a global scale in order  to prevent a breakdown in relations.25.	We have not despaired at the immensity of the problems that face us. We believe that despite the causes for gloom we have the capacity to pursue action in limited areas and that this will enable us to maintain our faith in the United Nations system. At the 14th meeting of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka proposed an international year of shelter for thehomeless. If food  clothing and shelter still remain the basic priorities for the creation of a better quality of life for people  then it is undeniable that the focusing of attention on housing will result in some good action by the United Nations. The proposal for an international year  which has been set for 1987 [resolution 36171]  now needs the active support of all Member States to make a success.26.	We are not bereft of evidence of the success of determined international effort to bring about greater order in the world community  enhancing the role of and respect for the United Nations. We arc about to conclude the marathon talks undertaken by the nations of this world in concluding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.3 This was an outstanding exercise in the use of this forum for the harmonization of views. Through the Convention the international community has also recognized that there are areas of this planet that are beyond national jurisdiction and that they constitute the common heritage of mankind. We have no doubt that in years to come these positive achievements will help guide our thinking in other areas of endeavor.27.	We shall conclude this session of the General Assembly with the customary package of wide- ranging resolutions. That reminds us of yet another observation in the Secretary-General's report: the tendency for Governments to act as though the adoption of a resolution absolved them from further responsibility. We also know of the tasks imposed on the Secretary-General  who is obliged to follow up the implementation of those resolutions  and the self- imposed burdens on national Governments that are called upon to respond to the queries  information  action and so on that are the sequel to those resolutions. Implementing decisions and policies of the Organization and motivating action by national Governments are admittedly no easy tasks considering the variety of conditions obtaining at national levels. There have been extensive studies and remedies and much research prescribed which have yet to influence our work here. We are not lacking in awareness of the problem  but perhaps a beginning could be made through a more understanding and responsible approach to our work in the Assembly.28.	I shall conclude by assuring the Assembly of my delegation's co-operation in this endeavor."
"84",4197,"LSO",37,1982,"The multiplicity of the problems with which the United Nations has to contend is clearly reflective of its universality. Yet in the 37 years of its existence the Organization has shed light unto many. Within this forum  great hopes have been realized  misery and despair have been averted and a new generation of man has been moulded a generation that recognizes the value of diplomatic intercourse over the perils and degradation of warfare. It would not be wrong  therefore  to suggest that the current worsening international climate  characterized by grave economic imbalances and world wide political turmoil  presents but simple trials which this world body can readily contain. I trust that our unity of purpose  bold determination and serene statesmanship will help us through the heavy agenda ahead of us. In congratulating the President on his election to preside at this session  I should like also to assure him and the other officers of the Assembly of my delegation's firm support and co operation. We are convinced that  as a distinguished statesman of the Hungarian People's Republic  he will be able to steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. Permit me to congratulate the President of the thirty sixth session  Mr. Kittani  who discharged his obligations honourably. Since this is the first regular session of the General Assembly at which we have the benefit of the services of the new Secretary General  I should like to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his elevation to the high office of guardian of international law and order and mentor to the world's leaders. To him we have entrusted for the next five years the future of the United stations. We are convinced that  as the son of a third world country  he is better able than anybody else to articulate the concerns and aspirations of the developing world. It is also fitting at this stage warmly to thank his predecessor  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who steered the Organization through many a difficult time over the past 10 years. The success of the United Nations during those 10 years is clearly demonstrated in the; increase in the membership of the Organization  the marked decline in the suffering of the South East Asian refugees and the high priority accorded by the United Nations to various international problems. Regrettably  there have been setbacks in the operation of the Organization  as evidenced in the case of Namibia. One of the primary goals of the founding fathers of the Organization is nearing achievement. I refer to the decolonization agenda. While many countries have gained independence in the years since the founding of the United Nations  we are still waiting for Namibia to accede to independence. Namibia is a test case which should give the United Nations the image of an international arbiter. If it does not  the United Nations continues to be characterized by cynics everywhere as a connotation of uselessness and inaction. When the glorious day of independence finally arrived in Namibia  a sad chapter in the struggle of a people to rid itself of foreign domination will be closed. TM world has witnessed the worst defiance of international opinion as South Africa has employed one subterfuge after another to delay the attainment of independence by the people of Namibia. We are heartened by the fact that progress has been made on this issue in recent months  but we find it highly disturbing that the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia is being linked with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from the People's Republic of Angola. No one can question the right of any sovereign State to determine its internal affairs  including its sovereign right to seek technical and military assistance from any friendly country. The presence of Cuban personnel in Angola is an extraneous issue which should not delay Namibia's independence. In any case  it has always been our stand that South Africa will delay the independence of Namibia until such time as it may get a Government amenable to dictates. One of the ploys it is using to delay Namibia's independence is setting conditions such as the present one. That condition is unnecessary and uncalled for  and it negates the sovereignty of Angola.The numerous obstacles which have been placed in the way of a peaceful settlement of the Namibian issue have delayed the solution of this problem. I have to express in the Assembly the genuine fear of my Government that if this issue is made so drag on indefinitely  it may bring about the very thing that everybody has been trying to avoid for the last five years turning southern Africa into a constant hotbed of tension and a new arena of East West conflict. The President of the thirty sixth session of the Assembly  Mr. Kittani  presided over the second special session devoted to disarmament  in June July this year. That second global attempt to give disarmament a special place in this grim catalogue of the ills that afflict mankind clearly reflects the threat of universal annihilation that is posed by the unprecedented arms build up. That is why we have to express openly our disappointment that the session failed to produce any results. The world political situation remains tense; old rivalries have reemerged; the prospects of peace and tranquility have been diminished and the probability of war has been enhanced. In this decade of the 1980s we are facing a critical nation in which man's lust for peace is being replaced by a lust fbr war. The world order  on both the political and the economic front  continues to manifest signs of decline and impending collapse. This point is all the more poignant at this time when we are witnessing a resurgence of big Power rivalry and a dangerous tendency to assume that superior force is the final arbiter in international relations. This dangerous trend in the conduct of foreign policy must be arrested before it is too late. Lesotho will continue to participate in all efforts aimed at bringing about a global consensus on the vital issues of international peace and security  disarmament and the new international economic order  on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Lesotho  as a member of the non aligned movement  places a high premium on international respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. We are therefore alarmed at the increasing readiness of States to use force to safeguard their proclaimed interests or to assert territorial claims  without any regard for the interests of other States  especially the weak and defenseless ones. I cannot comment on the current international political situation without touching on recent events in Lebanon  especially the human tragedies that have unfolded in that war torn land. We witnessed earlier the brutal siege of west Beirut by Israeli forces. No sooner had the siege been lifted than a succession of tragedies began to befall the people of Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees. The world learned with shock and dismay of the dastardly assassination of President elect Jashir Gemayel  only to witness a few days later an even greater human tragedy and spectacle the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila. Those unfortunate events have irrevocably placed the Palestinian issue at the centre of Middle East politics and have once and fbr all crystallized its central position in all peace efforts. The question of Palestinian rights and Palestinian self determination cannot be treated merely as a political issue  the solution of which is subject to Israel's security requirements. It is an issue which has brought untold suffering upon the Palestinian people. They have suffered the degradation of displacement and the squalor of refugee camps in foreign countries. Today they have suffered a tragedy which invokes the deepest human emotions and disturbs the conscience and moral values of mankind. The Palestinian issue has come to symbolize  in our time  the ills and deficiencies which plague international diplomacy. We have maintained all along that the Palestinian issue is the crux of the Middle East problem. We do not need further massacres of Palestinian refugees to be reminded that the issue of Palestinian self  determination is the crucial item on the agenda of peace in the Middle East. It is about time Israel learned that its security lies not in the dispersal of the Palestinian people and in war but in peace. Lesotho does not condone the breach of peace in the Middle East and southern Africa  nor does it countenance with complicity the presence of foreign troops in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. We are fully aware of the complex political and military relationships in South East Asia and South West Asia  and particularly the strategic interests of foreign Powers in those vital areas. In our humble view  the issue of peace in those areas does not depend solely on Viet Nam's willingness to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea and on Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan; it depends also on an overall recognition of the security requirements of each and every State in those regions. Another focal point of tension is the Korean peninsula. We renew our call for resumption of dialogue  without pre conditions or external interference  between the two parts of Korea so as to bring about a peaceful reunification of that artificially divided land. I also wish to repeat the well known position of Lesotho on the question of the Falkland Islands. The Falk larders should be allowed to determine their own future in accordance with their inalienable right to self determination as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). The history of the human race is replete with international efforts to accord man his rightful place within the community of free nations. Over the past three decades in particular  the international community has witnessed a succession of attempts to codify legal instruments aimed at the promotion and protection of the basic rights of man. Ironically  world wide reports of flagrant and persistent violations of the sanctity of the human person continue to filter into the already heavy agenda of the United Nations. This is clearly reflective of man's reluctance to conform deeds to words. In this respect  we applaud once more the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU. Significantly  the Charter draws attention to the distinctive nature of African values and morals  and also provides fbr the respective duties and responsibilities of individuals and groups to their communities. Lesotho is at present engaged in moves to incorporate the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights into our municipal law. History will be made in Kingston  Jamaica  when the United Nations Convention on the Law of the. Sea is opened for signature in December. This will be the culmination of nine years of patient negotiations and a firm determination to accord land locked States access to the sear whose resources are the common heritage of all. It is to be hoped that once it comes into force good will will prevail upon the international community to make the Convention a success. My Government is satisfied that UNDP has played a very important role in the transfer of assistance from the developed to the developing countries  and its importance in this role has all the more increased  as revealed by its latest reports. We also take cognizance of the interest UNDP shows in the least developed countries. We  therefore  wish to pledge our confidence in the manner in which the Administrator is handling the affairs of UNDP  and we give him the assurance of our co operation. We are aware that his task during the current cycle will be made more difficult by the fact that resource prospects for the period are gloomy and far from promising. However  we have reason to believe that the newly created Inter sessional Committee of the Whole will soon come up with specific proposals for recovery in the short term and for the longer term to secure predictability  continuity and assurance in the funding of the Programme. The developing countries recognize that they are  in the first instance  responsible for their own economic and social development and that external aid should only be supplementary. They accept that the economic challenges of the future demand a complete elimination of unhealthy competition among them. At the same time  they are aware of their individual limitations. It is for these reasons that the idea of economic co operation among developing countries is increasingly gaining ground. We  therefore  entirely support the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  whose future projections are geared towards economic integration of Africa by the year 2000. We recognize that ECA is engaged in consolidating sub regional plans and strategies towards the noble goal of economic integration. We support the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit on the reorganization of ECA recognizing the role of multinational programming and operational centres. We applaud the signature last year of the Preferential Trade Area Agreement for east and southern Africa in Lusaka  Zambia. The significance of the PTA is seen in particular in its scope  spanning as it does some 7.2 million square kilometres with a population of about 140 million people. For our part  having overcome domestic limitations imposed on us by our geography y Lesotho ratified the PTA Agreement in March 1982. We view the PTA as a right step towards the basic restructuring of the economic base of our continent. As the Executive Secretary of ECA  Mr. Adebayo Adedeji  said at the December meeting to launch the PTA  we see our continent as a boat in which there is less to eat  where poverty and degradation is the plight of the average person  a boat which may sink before long unless all hands are on deck and a will to survive and eventually thrive manifests itself. This will to survive has been adequately articulated within the PTA and the Southern African Development Co ordination Conference. This will to survive is further lucidly elaborated in the Lagos Plan of Action  which maps out Africa's economic strategy to the year 2000. We are  however  far from realizing the fact that the search for a universally acceptable formula of self reliance through the process of global negotiations has not yet been achieved. We are concerned about the continuing hesitation by some developed countries and we urge that an agreement be reached to launch global negotiations not later than January 1983. With respect to the special economic assistance programme for Lesotho  I am proud to announce that the generous response of the international community to the request for special economic assistance for Lesotho has been most encouraging and has permitted the implementation of a substantial portion of the programme. Some of the projects have been fully funded and others have been financed in part as revealed in the report of the Secretary General. On behalf of the Basotho nation  the Lesotho Government and myself  I wish sincerely to thank all donor countries and regional and intergovernmental organizations  as well as United Nations bodies and agencies for the assistance rendered under the special economic assistance programme for Lesotho. They can all be assured that good use has been made and will continue to be made of their contributions. We urge to be donor countries to continue to respond to the appeal made in the report just mentioned. The complexity of the geo political situation  of which we are an integral part  hardly permits us the equanimity to consider Lesotho's political and socio economic problems without reference to the conditions which prevail in South Africa. The Assembly will have noticed that stability in South Africa is becoming more illusory and that the prospects of eventual racial accommodation are dimmer. At no time since the doctrine of apartheid became a way of life in South Africa has the Government of that country faced as great an assault on their racial policies as it does now. Within South Africa itself signs of confrontation manifest themselves from all sectors of social life. Pretoria faces opposition from students  church leaders and sections of the white population  and the Nationalist laager itself is in terrible disarray. In our strong and vociferous opposition to as repeatedly stated in the past  we proceed from the moral position that apartheid is dangerous  not only for South Africa itself but also for its immediate neighbours and civilized humanity as a whole. We seek not to preach to South Africa regarding the objectionable tenets of its domestic policies  but we respond to a moral demand which we can only ignore at our own peril. We have to call continuously on South Africa to abandon the disastrous path of apartheid  which leads to the dead end of racial confrontation  a prospect too ghastly to contemplate. Lesotho will not watch silently while the stage is being set for a confrontation which would reduce southern Africa to ashes. For us the impending disaster with which apartheid threatens southern Africa is as real and as terrifying as the grim prospect of a nuclear holocaust hovering over mankind today. Because of our geographical location within the borders of South Africa  we cannot contemplate the prospect of violence and destruction in that country with composure. Our primary responsibility is to ensure the survival of our nation in peace and tranquility. Even when the writing is on the wall and clear fbr South Africa to read  the authorities in Pretoria continue to tinker with the problem. The recently proposed constitutional dispensation for Colourgds and Indians is a political force. It is meant to appease public opinion while it shows the seeds of conflict and tribal polarization. It is intended to put up a façade of political change  to hoodwink world public opinion and to lessen pressure from abroad  thus creating a breathing space for the Apartheid policies  which have apparently run their course and outlived their usefulness to the South African regime. This constitutional arrangement completely ignores and circumvents the rights and legitimate aspirations of the black South Africans that constitute the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa. It seeks to isolate the Coloureds and the Indians from the mainstream of the political struggle inside South Africa by turning them into allies of apartheid without giving them any tangible benefits from such an unwholesome association. Finally I should like to thank all those Member States that have stood by us during our moments of great difficulty and all those that have hastened to assure us of their solidarity in times of great trial. The OAU  in particular  through the Secretary  General  Mr. Kodjo  has been a true custodian of the principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the OAU. He has tirelessly kept the situation in Lesotho under constant surveillance  an act which has assured us that our plight in southern Africa is a matter of grave concern to the community of free nations. This awareness has given us courage to look forward with determination to a future in which southern Africa will be rid of all racial discrimination and segregation. Lesotho offers its firm pledge to contribute towards the evolution of a southern Africa of peace  prosperity  tranquility and respect fbr the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region. We call upon South Africa sincerely to offer a similar undertaking."
"85",4266,"LUX",37,1982,"Before discussing the international situation  which this year again can only be described as critical dangerous and explosive  I must associate myself with my colleagues in expressing our sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session. Your reputation as a seasoned diplomat  your long experience acquired in the course of a brilliant career and your deep knowledge of the workings of the Organization will enable you  I am certain  to conduct the proceedings of the General Assembly with all the skill required in these difficult times.2.	I should like to take this opportunity also to express very sincere thanks to some other outstanding persons  and first to Mr. Kittani  President of the thirty-sixth session  for the masterful and tenacious manner in which he assumed his heavy responsibilities.3.	Our thanks go also to Mr. Waldheim  who for 10 years as Secretary-General saw to the proper functioning of the Organization. His tireless dedication and the matchless skill with which he carried out his duties deserve our appreciation.4.	Finally  let me turn to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who since he assumed his functions has brilliantly succeeded in convincing us all of his exceptional qualities and his tireless dedication to the service of the Organization. I wish to reiterate to him our assurance of full and constructive cooperation on the part of the Government and people of Luxembourg.5.	The sessions of the General Assembly offer us an opportunity each year to take stock of the world situation. The Danish representative  speaking yesterday at the 8th meeting on behalf of the 10 member States of the European Community  presented the views of the Community on the world situation. It goes without saying that we fully subscribe to his statements  so that I may confine myself to emphasizing certain problems which are of particular concern to us.6.	In our view  the world situation has steadily worsened since last year. The fundamental equilibriums which have dominated our globe since the Second World War are breaking down; the worst economic crisis since the war continues to beset us without respite; there are more and more centres of conflict. Thus East-West relations  which are essential in determining the political situation of the moment  continue to deteriorate. Events in Poland  especially since last December  have added dangerously to this tension  so that the process of detente between East and West  which was so promising  not so long ago  has suffered serious setbacks.7. In our view  detente can only be one and indivisible. Our position in this regard is clear and in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Final Act of Helsinki. These two documents guarantee inter alia the right of each people to choose and freely develop its own political  social  economic and cultural system  as well as to determine its own laws and regulations. Logically the Helsinki document refers to the necessity for each State to abstain from any intervention  direct or indirect  in the internal or external affairs falling within the national competence of another State  whatever their mutual relations may be.I need not stress here that all the countries of Eastern Europe have solemnly subscribed to the 10 principles of the Final Act. The events in Poland are in flagrant contradiction of those principles. The same is true of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Such flagrant violations have in no way served the process of strengthening mutual confidence. Thus it is not surprising that East-West relations have been seriously affected.9.	A return to dialogue among all the component parts of Polish society and respect for the rights of self- determination of the peoples concerned are essential for the restoration of a climate of true and lasting detente.10.	For our part  we remain firmly attached to the concept of such a true detente and an improving climate of confidence between East and West. We hope that  in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe  it will prove possible to achieve an agreement on a balanced text guaranteeing real progress in all spheres  when the Madrid review session resumes its work in November.11.	In view of the slowness of the process of disarmament  the convening of a conference on disarmament in Europe  in conditions enabling tangible results to be achieved  seems to us to be more indispensable than ever. The concentration of weapon systems on the old continent  which is by far the highest in the world  has reached unacceptable proportions.12 In view of the disappointing results of the second special session devoted to disarmament  we think that a regional approach  with a smaller number of participants  to the problems of the reduction of armaments might be more realistic  and offer better chances of achieving tangible results. This does not mean that we oppose the carrying out of the world-wide efforts. On the contrary  the United Nations ought indeed to be able to play a more important role in this process than it has been able to do so far. Unfortunately  the second special session devoted to disarmament  in which so much hope had been placed by millions of citizens of good faith throughout the world  did not give any grounds for justified optimism in this regard.12.	That special session of the Assembly  however  did have the merit of producing a considerable impact on public opinion and beginning a process of creating awareness  the effects of which may be felt only in the medium or long term. We hope that the new phenomenon of the pacifist movement—which should be allowed to express itself freely  even though efforts are made to prevent it—will succeed in bringing moral pressure to bear throughout the world to advance the cause of disarmament  so vital for the future of humanity.13.	The nuclear nations have a special role in the disarmament process. I take this opportunity to say how much importance we attach to ensuring that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons of medium range lead rapidly to tangible results. We Europeans are indeed the first to be concerned about this type of weaponry and for us the success of those negotiations is of primordial importance.14.	We hope also that the negotiations begun this year between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic arms reduction lead to results within a reasonable length of time and we are confident that the proposals of the West submitted within the framework of the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe will make it possible to bring about a progressive reduction of military forces.15.	If disarmament is a key problem in East-West relations  it is equally true of North-South relations. In this context the problem is mainly one of conventional armaments and the disproportionate financial burden of armaments on the heavily burdened budgets of most developing countries.16.	However  the predominant issue in North-South relations is clearly the economic problem. The longest and most severe economic crisis since the last war has had a particularly damaging effect on the developing countries  primarily the least advanced. That crisis  in my view  is the main reason why it has not been possible so far  despite long and laborious negotiations  to start global negotiations aimed at establishing a new international economic order.17.	Luxembourg has always been  and remains  favourable to the launching of global negotiations. Considering the time spent on negotiating merely the procedure and the agenda  without its leading to an acceptable result for all  this session may well be our last chance. If we do not succeed in getting the process under way now  this ambitious and grand undertaking may remain a dead letter. Have we been too ambitious in our objectives in wishing to attack all the problems at a stroke? Is an undertaking of such dimensions viable in these times of crisis? Are there other alternatives which are less ambitious but morerealistic and have better chances of success? These are questions that must be answered at this session.18.	In this regard I should like to observe that if our hopes should be dashed and if global negotiations do not get under way—which we hope will not be the case—we ought not be too rigidly wedded to primarily theoretical concept but try to attack the problems from a less ambitious but more concrete point of view.19.	What is important is that we should succeed in continuing the dialogue and that we persist in seeking a solution  whether it be global or consists of several partial phases. We should not lose sight of the fact that it is the principle of interdependence that is the governing factor  interdependence in an increasingly complex world.20.	Unfortunately  the economic difficulties of today lead to nationalistic reactions and self-protection. The spectre of protectionism is once again looming on the horizon. Have we so soon forgotten that the principal cause of the unparalleled economic boom following the Second World War was the determined support of the principles of free trade of goods and services?21.	Experience has taught us that protectionism inevitably leads to a limitation of growth  indeed a reduction in the volume of world trade  and to particularly damaging repercussions on the small and weak. That does not exclude the fact that countries whose economies are close to autarchy  which of course are less seriously affected  do not escape the consequences of a world economy in recession.22.	My country  which in view of its size is particularly aware of its dependence and of interdependence in general  has always been especially attached to the concept of free trade in goods and services. I therefore take this opportunity to emphasize that one must not give in to protectionist temptations which may in the short run be alluring but lead  through an escalation of counter-productive results  inescapably to a negative balance-sheet for all trading partners.23.	I wish also to say a word on hunger in the world. This question  which is the most urgent of all  should have absolute priority. It is indeed absolutely unacceptable that in certain parts of the world malnutrition should be the rule when food surpluses are being improperly used elsewhere and indeed destroyed in order to maintain a level of prices acceptable to the producers. The right to decent nutrition is one of the most fundamental human rights  if not the most fundamental  and should be guaranteed for all.24.	The United Nations and its specialized services have rendered particularly precious assistance in all areas where hunger threatens  but we must observe that the problem is far from being resolved. Perhaps we are over emphasizing food aid per se   that is  the mere supply of food products  whereas it would certainly be better to enable the populations concerned themselves to meet their own needs.25.	After these considerations of East-West and North-South problems  I should like to turn to the principal areas of tension in the world today. We must unfortunately observe that since last year there has been a tendency for conflicts to increase. The unfortunately ""traditional"" areas of conflict have been compounded by a new one  that of the South Atlantic.On that occasion  one of the members of the European Community was the victim of grave violations of the principles of the Charter  namely those of non-resort to the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.26.	My country  itself a repeated victim of annexation and occupation by foreign Powers  can never condone resort to force or violation of the right of peoples to self-determination.27.	As for the Middle East  the situation has deteriorated continually since the last session of the General Assembly. The gravity and the inherent dangers of that crisis  which has continued to shake that part of the world since the end of the Second World War  have been emphasized at countless meetings of the Security Council and at the seventh emergency special session  when the Assembly met to consider the problem on three separate occasions.28.	The tragic events which have continued at an infernal pace in Lebanon since the invasion in June by Israel led about 10 days ago to the horrible massacre of some 1 000 Palestinian civilians in two refugee camps in Beirut. That criminal and irresponsible act  just like the act committed against President-elect Bashir Gemayel  can only be condemned. Like its partners in the European Community  Luxembourg is convinced that the future of the Lebanese State can be assured only if all troops at present occupying the country—those of Israel or the Syrian Arab Republic—withdraw as soon as possible.29.	As for the negotiation of a comprehensive peace for the region  events in Lebanon have shown the need for all parties to be involved  which means the Palestine Liberation Organization as well. The principles that should guide those negotiations are  more than ever  the security of all States in the region  including the right of Israel to exist; justice for all peoples  including the right of Palestinians to self- determination with everything that that implies; and  finally  mutual recognition of all parties concerned.30.	I would not wish to fail to welcome the new American proposals announced by President Reagan on 1 September  as well as the resolution which the heads of State and Government of Arab countries adopted unanimously on 9 September at Fez at the end of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference [ 4/37/696]. These different ideas  American and Arab  could encourage concrete progress in the quest for a just and lasting peace  to which the people of the Middle East have aspired for so long. A necessary precondition  however  is the establishment of a climate of confidence which is still lacking.31.	Another dangerous and explosive conflict  of which there is too little discussion in the Assembly  is also present in the Middle East. I am referring to the particularly bloody war between Iran and Iraq which has led to a huge number of victims and great material damage. This is another dangerous destabilizing factor in the region of the Middle East  which has been so sorely tried. It is important that reason overcome fanaticism and that a negotiated solution put an end to that blood-bath.32.	In Asia  two serious drawn out conflicts continue to be of concern. The main responsibility for thesetwo conflicts tails to a super-Power  whether it is guilty of direct intervention  as in Afghanistan  or indirect intervention  as in Kampuchea.33.	The occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter is now in its third year  despite the vigorous objections of all justice-loving peoples and the courageous resistance of the Afghan people. We reiterate our deep devotion to the right of the Afghan people to self-determination and its right to return to its previous status of neutrality and non-alignment under international guarantees.34.	In Kampuchea  on the pretext of eliminating an inhuman genocide regime  Viet Nam has imposed a puppet Government upon which it seeks to confer legality. Without wishing in any way to acquiesce in the barbarous policies of the Pol Pot Government  we remain convinced that the invasion by Viet Nam is contrary to the principles of international law. We shall never subscribe to the idea that it is incumbent upon a more powerful neighbour to decide on the well-being of another nation. We believe that it is high time for the people of Kampuchea  after such trials and suffering  at last to have the opportunity itself to decide on its own future  and we welcome the formation of a coalition Government as an important step in that direction.35.	In Central America  there is no end to dangerous tension. Although there has been some progress in certain countries  the situation remains unstable and the peoples of the region are far from having achieved the kind of coexistence enabling them to live in peace and security. Interesting proposals have been put forward by certain countries  and we would hope that they will contribute to diminishing tension in the near future.36.	In Africa  there are still numerous conflicts—in Somalia  Chad or the southern part of the continent. Let us say at the outset that the painful problem of apartheid in South Africa is not near to an acceptable solution. We condemn this ignoble attack on the dignity of the human person and we remain convinced of the imperative need to abandon this policy of racial discrimination if a dangerous escalation of violence in southern Africa is to be avoided.37.	Nevertheless  I should like to end on a somewhat more optimistic note with regard to this part of the world: indeed  the Namibian conflict seems close to a solution. We hope that it will soon be possible to eliminate the last remaining obstacles in order to enable the Namibian people to determine its own future.38.	In this respect I wish to emphasize how deserving are all those who played a constructive role in the solution of this problem  whether from the group of five Western States or the front-line States  and I should like to see others take inspiration from this model  which proves once again that when people come to the negotiating table with the firm intention of succeeding  even the most thorny problems can be resolved in a manner acceptable to all.The picture of the international situation I have just drawn is especially bleak. Rather than allowing ourselves to be discouraged and falling prey to pessimism  we should consider this bitter reality as a new challenge and redouble our efforts to reverse this trend.39.	The Organization—at least if we persist in upholding the Charter—is a precious instrument in this regard. However  we must make use of this instrument with deftness and dexterity if it is to function according to the intentions of its founders. Hence  we must guard against abusing it or making inadequate use of it  be it for propaganda purposes or for short-term political gain. In particular  we must ensure that every organ functions in keeping with its mandate and the principles enshrined in the Charter.40.	Let us guard against bringing before the organs of the Organization problems they are not competent to deal with. Otherwise  the only result would be a profusion of texts whose impact would be inversely proportional to their number. That would only lead to false hopes followed by political discontent from a public which is already weary of the few successes of the United Nations in certain specific tragic and easily identifiable problems.41.	Those few thoughts concur with the substance of the Secretary-General's analysis of the situation in his report on the work of the Organization. That report  made without complacency  speaks to certain weaknesses of the Organization but  above all  addresses itself to Governments—that is to say  to us—inviting us to go beyond short-term political expediency and rediscover the true objectives of the United Nations.42.	The fact remains that the Organization offers a unique advantage  allowing constant dialogue amongst all of us. It is up to us to preserve this advantage and develop it to its full potential  so that the Organization  in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 1 of the Charter  can be ""a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends"" and remain so for future generations."
"86",4339,"MAR",37,1982,"It gives me great pleasure  Mr. President  to extend to you  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco and in my own capacity  our congratulations on your election as President of this session of the Assembly. There is no doubt that your diplomatic career and your knowledge of both inter-national and United Nations affairs will assist you in bearing the considerable responsibility that is now yours. The delegation of Morocco assures you of its full co-operation in making your presidency a success  particularly because of the relations of friend-ship and co-operation our two countries enjoy. It also gives me pleasure to commend your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for his untiring efforts during an eventful year in which he evinced admirable foresight and patience  which was very much appreciated.111. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my cordial congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as Secretary-General. I am sure that his considerable experience in international affairs and the respect and confidence he enjoys among the world community qualify him to work creatively and positively in the defence of international peace and ensure the triumph of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I wish also to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Waldheim  on his action and efforts at a time characterized by tension and danger.112. It is traditional in this Hall at the beginning of each session of the General Assembly for our common hopes and aspirations for the strengthening of peace and understanding  the triumph of justice and right and the emergence of an era of prosperity and well-being for mankind to be expressed. It is regrettable to note at the beginning of this debate that hotbeds of tension are still giving rise to serious threats to international peace and security and that the international situation is deteriorating because of the new obstacles which have recently almost shattered our hope of establishing genuine and comprehensive detente.113. This state of affairs will persist as long as there are those who wilfully violate the principles of the Charter and flout international law  infringing the dignity of man and his b8sic rights; as long as colonialism  racial discrimination and the deterioration of the international economic situation  which results in increasing impoverishment of the world population  continue. In addition to this  the arms race and its attendant dangers threaten the achievements of mankind.114.	Because it is a member of the Arab world  the Islamic group and the African continent  and because of its geographical situation at the crossroads of three civilizations  Morocco attributes great importance to what happens in all these areas.115.	The question of the Middle East  and especially the Palestinian question  occupies a place of the highest priority among the concerns of my country. For more than 30 years the Palestinian people have suffered exile and deprivation and have been the victim of war and destruction. In spite of the voices raised every year from this rostrum condemning I3raeli practices and demanding that the Palestinian people regain their inalienable rights  despite the resolutions adopted by the Assembly and the Security Council in support of the rights of that militant people  Israel is persisting in its expansionist and repressive acts with all the means at its disposal  including the use of internationally banned weapons  in order to continue to occupy the Arab territories and annihilate the Palestinian people  in an attempt to eliminate them  suppress them and liquidate their leaders in the form of the PLO.116. Although the United Nations archives are filed with reports on massacres and assassinations carried out by Israel against the Palestinian people for more than 30 years  the tragedy and suffering resulting from the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and t:-'e massacres of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples are beyond all bounds and beyond imagination.117. The abominable massacre planned by the Israeli army of occupation in the camps of Sabra and Shatila claimed more than 4 000 victims among innocent Palestinians  including women  children and old people. It reminds us of a similar massacre carried out by Meacham Begin in the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin in 1947  and it transcends in atrocity and the manner in which it was committed the deeds of the Nazis during the Second World War.113. This butchery shows beyond doubt that the real aim of Israel is not security  as it claims  but the total physical elimination of the militant Palestinian people and expansion at the expense of the Arab nation. Morocco pays its tribute to the memory of the martyred victims of Israeli terrorism and expresses its gratitude and appreciation to those that have condemned and denounced this atrocious massacre and taken the side of right and justice. All the States of the world have expressed their individual condemnation of that massacre and the international community has denounced it collectively. The General Assembly  at its seventh emergency special session  adopted resolution ES-7/9 on 24 September 1982 condemning the criminal massacre and reaffirming Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) demanding that Israel with-draw all its military forces to the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon.119. In the face of this human tragedy it is more necessary than ever for the General Assembly to take all the measures called for  including the imposition of sanctions  to compel Israel to put an end to its aggression against the Palestinian people  to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally from the territory of Lebanon and to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council.120. Morocco  a sister State of Lebanon  takes this opportunity to reaffirm its full solidarity with Lebanon in its time of trial and to assure the Lebanese Government of its support for the measures necessary to guarantee the unity  independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.121. The two parts of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference were held in Fez  Morocco  under the leadership of His Majesty King Hassan 11. My country thus had the honour of acting as host to this historic conference which restored unity to the Arab ranks and placed Arab solidarity on firm foundations.122. The Arab Summit Conference was convened in extremely delicate circumstances for the causes of Palestine and the Middle East  and the Arab heads of State shouldered their historic responsibility and agreed to the plan designed to enable the Arabs to regain their rights. They did so because of their conviction that the Arab nation can achieve its aims and overcome the consequences of the Israeli aggression.123. The Arab nations  out of their concern to use all ways and means at their disposal to re-establish in the Middle East peace based on justice and to contribute to the efforts exerted by all the .peace:. loving forces in the world  in the vanguard of which is the United Nations  and on the basis of international law  the Arab peace plan  with the following elements: first  Israel's withdrawal from all the territories it has occupied since 1%7  including Jerusalem; secondly  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  to the exercise of its inalienable rights under the leadership of the PLO  its sole legitimate representative  and to the establishment of an independent State on its land; thirdly  the establishment by the Security Council of guarantees for peace among the States of the region.124. A study of those principles should convince the Assembly and the world public that the Arab nation desires peace based on justice and a solution to the Middle East problem that guarantees to the Palestinian people its right to self-determination and to establish its own independent State and that makes it possible for all the States of the region to live in peace  with Security Council guarantees.125. Morocco  whoís Sovereign. His Majesty King Hassan 11  presided over the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  calls upon all peace-loving States  andespecially the great Powers  permanent members of the Security Council  to support right and justice  to study the Arab peace plan carefully and to adopt the principles contained in that plan as the basis for the solution of the Middle East and Palestine problems. We hope that there will be a favourable reaction t9 this Arab initiative and that it will usher in a new era .that will restore peace and stability to the Middle East region and bring to an end the state of war which has afflicted the people of the region for so long.126. The favourable reaction and the broad support with which the Arab peace plan has met on the inter-national scene is encouraging. We hope that all States especially the great Powers permanent members of the Security Council  will support the plan and that the high-level committee set up by the summit conference will be able to establish contacts with the permanent members of the Security Council and to achieve positive results.127.	We should like to note also that Mr. Reaganís plan for peace in the Middle East gives cause for optimism. Morocco regards this plan as a measure that opens new prospects for a solution to the Middle East problem  and that places on record the commitment of the President of the United States of America to the principle of the restoration to Arab sovereignty of the Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1%7. At the same time  we note that this plan omits basic points essential to the process for the establishment of peace in the Middle East. We hope that during the forthcoming contacts between the Arab countries and the United States of America these gaps will be filled so that a just and lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East and that region may once again be the cradle of constructive coexistence and a centre for the dissemination of creative thought.128.	In north-west Africa there is still artificial tension resulting from a policy which runs counter to the noble principles established by the international community  which is based on desperate attempts to undermine international law and which resorts to hegemony as a means of achieving selfish interests. The so-called problem of Western Sahara serves as a pretext and an instrument to that end. Morocco has always made it clear that its desire to regain its Saharan territory is based on solid historical rights and legal ties  as well as international law. After the Moroccan liberation army had engaged in a heroic struggle against the colonizers in Saharan territory  Morocco called for the restoration of the land usurped at the beginning of the colonial era of this century. Because of the colonial authorities' procrastination in returning this land to the mother country  Morocco had recourse to juridical bodies. It submitted the question to the United Nations and to the International Court of Justice. That resulted finally in the conclusion of the Madrid Agreement  confirmed by the General Assembly in 1975.129.	Morocco has clearly set forth here on several occasions the political and historical circumstances in which Moroccan territory had been divided into various regions and subjected to various colonial systems. It has also clearly indicated that the restoration of the amputated parts of its country was also -by the very nature of things-carried out in various stages.130.	Because of Morocco's faithfulness to inter-national legality  and because of its desire to give that legality a new form that would bode well for the future  His Majesty King Hassan n  at the eighteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which was held at Nairobi in June 1981  stated that Morocco was prepared 10 hold a referendum in the region of Western Sahara  thereby opening the door to a final  peaceful solution to this conflict. Morocco put forward that initiative because it was convinced of its inalienable right to the Territory and of the fact that its children in the region of the Sahara had chosen to remain forever an integral part of the mother country.131. His Majesty King Hassan's initiative was in part. in response to the wishes of Morocco's friends and also was intended clearly to show the world public and to assure jt that the inhabitants of the Sahara region wished to belong to the mother country and  through a referendum  to confirm what they had expressed on many occasions and in many different ways: their Moroccan identity  to which they are very attached.132. The whole world welcomed this initiative  finding in it the ideal means for ending the long-standing tension in that part of north-west Africa. Morocco made every effort to give this initiative the chance to bring about peace  and to have it acted upon. Morocco  represented by its sovereign  thus made an important contribution to a settlement of the problem of Western Sahara at Nairobi  in August 1981. The African leaders laid the foundations for such a settlement by establishing the OAU's Implementation Committee 9 which was to concern itself with the cease-fire and the referendum. Morocco-thus made an effective contribution to the success of that African meeting  whose goal was to move the peace process forward to its desired end. The Implementation Committee continued working effectively to bring about the implementation of the resolutions of the OAU Assembly. especially since the adoption by the General Assembly of its decision 36/406  the text of which had been sponsored by Kenya  then Chairman of the OAU Assembly  calling on the United Nations to extend technical and financial assistance in this field to the OAU.133. The Implementation Committee met again on 8 and 9 February 1982  to decide on a time-frame for the cease-fire and referendum. In co-operation with African leaders  Morocco worked with sincerity to put the final touches on this African effort  which would have ended one of the disputes which have been the concern of the OAU over the past years. Good will dictated that all efforts made by the African leaders should be given a chance to bear fruit  but there are those who do not wish to find a solution to this problem  and that fact led to the cancellation of the initiative. When it became dear that there was a serious turn of events which would lead to the derailment of failure of hegemonies expansion plans and confirm the inalienable rights of Morocco through free consultation under United Nations and OAU auspices  attempts were made to abort that process and to undermine the resolutions adopted at the OAU Assembly at Nairobi. The well known plot thus took place at Addis Ababa which immobilized the work of the OAU and its activities halted when certain countries. in secret collaboration with the OAU administrative Secretary-General  tried to impose a group of mercenaries as participants in the thirty-eighth 'ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of .the OAU. That wanton act was in flagrant violation of the QAD Charter  which stipulates in more than one place that membership is confined to independent sovereign States. That act was furthermore  a conspiracy to undermine all the practical measures adopted by Africa to solve the Saharan problem in a peaceful manner.134. The leaders of the African nations represented by the ""wise men"" the founders of the OAU  opposed that conspiracy against legality  and 19  delegations withdrew from the session of the OAU Council of Ministers held at Addis Ababa in February 1982  which is where the conspiracy was acted out. That session was therefore illegal because there was no quorum as required in the OAU Charter.135.	To overcome this crisis  the African continent was the scene of intense political activity aimed at saving the OAU from collapse. Some African leaders called for a special session of the OAU Assembly to solve the problem; Morocco was among the first to take such an initiative. His Majesty King Hassan  11 sent a letter to the President of Kenya  Mr. Daniel Arap Moi  in February this year  requesting that  ~ special session be held to consider the existing' crisis before it worsened. But the forces fighting against legitimacy worked to preventthat meeting.136.	Once more  we see that enlightened Africa  which has opted for legitimacy  has shown itself to be above submitting to the policy of fait accompli. It refused to attend the OAU Assembly scheduled to be held at Tripoli unless African legitimacy  in accordance with the OAU charter  was restored to the OAU. The frustration and failure of the session of the OAU Assembly at Tripoli is a testimony to legitimacy and justice and the failure of attempts to violate the African Charter.137.	That failure caused the immobilization of the work of the OAU at all levels-political  economic  social  as well as in the field of information; but we are convinced t.hat the OAU-which is backed and supported by every sincere African-will once. more play its constructive role:  thanks to the efforts made by the sincere sons of Africa  who value legitimacy and higher African interests above all other considerations and narrow selfish interests.138. Morocco-which has played a pioneering role in crystallizing the idea of African unity through the African Charter  adopted in Casablanca in '1961  and which is one of the founders of the OAU-would very much like that organization to continue. Morocco will thus do its utmost to maintain and support the CAU so that it may continue to play its vital and effective role as an instrument of common African action. Morocco is extremely concerned that legitimacy be restored to the OAU and that the organization's administrative bodies should concern themselves with the implementation of African resolution with integrity and neutrality  free of any bias and without 'be'-coming involved in current disputes among ""certain member countries.139. The United Nations followed closely the African meetings held last year to discuss the question of Sahara. Its representatives gave to the African leaders  useful help by describing the experience of the United Nations in the holding of referendums. They know the 'stages that must be gone through In arriving at a cease-fire and holding a referendum.140. Morocco which has always proclaimed its adherence to international legitimacy reaffirms its commitment to the resolutions of the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly concerning Sahara which were supported last year by the General Assembly. It sees the way chosen by Africa as the best means of ending the artificial tensions in north-west Africa. Proceeding from that .premise  Morocco appeals to all States to work for the success of that African solution and to frustrate an attempts to block and obstruct it  so that the conflict can be ended and peace and stability can be restored to this area.141. Morocco  as a part of the African continent  attaches special importance to the events that take place there. It works in co-operation with its African brothers to support the independence of the countries of the continent and ensure the progress and development of their peoples  so that the whole continent may enjoy well-being and prosperity and play its role in building a world society founded upon justice and peace.142.	In the southern part of this continent  the brother people of Namibia is still suffering under the yoke of an unjust racist regime and waging a valiant war of liberation to restore its usurped liberty  independence and territorial integrity. Morocco  which has always supported the just struggle of the Namibian people  hopes that the day when independence is restored to that people will soon be here. On this occasion  we appeal to the contact group to redouble its efforts and negotiations so that a final settlement of the Namibian problem may be reached in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).143.	The people of southern Africa are still suffering from the tragedy of the regime of racial discrimination imposed by the Government of Pretoria  despite the many resolutions 1:ondemning that regime and denouncing apartheid as a ""crime against humanity"" .144~ Morocco reaffirms its support for the people of South Africa  which must regain its dignity and free-dom. It calls on those countries which have relations with Pretoria to break off their economic and military collaboration with it in order to induce it to end that regime  which is a challenge to the most basic legal and ethical principles.145. Morocco  which is pledged to defend all struggles for liberation  reaffirms its determination to defend all struggles for liberation in Africa  in the south  the Horn of Africa  Eritrea or elsewhere in the continent.146. For more than two years a destructive war has been raging between two neighbouring Islamic countries  Iraq and the Islamic Republic .of Iran. Those two countries were the cradles of ancient civilizations that helped to develop the thinking  science and progress of humanity. If is regrettable that the war between those two countries should still be going on despite all the untiring efforts to bring it to an end. We hope that it will soon be possible to reach a settlement that win effect a cease-fire  safe-guard the inalienable rights of the two States  and restore stability and security to the area  within the framework of Security Council resolutions 514 (1982) of 12 July 1982 and 522 (1982) of 4 October 1982.147. The initiative taken by our sister nation of Iraq recently  which took the form of withdrawing its army to the borders it had held before the hostilities  is  we believe  a positive step towards the restoration of peace and the consolidation of relations of good-neighbourliness. Iraq's response to all mediation efforts to end this conflict deserves our encouragement and praise. We also pin great hopes to the efforts of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  presided over by Mr. Ahmed SekouToure  President of Guinea  efforts directed to restoring peace and security to that important part of the world.148. In Afghanistan the people is still suffering from the injustices of the invasion of that land three years ago. It is still fighting to preserve its Islamic faith and its identity as a Moslem and non-aligned nation. Morocco  which is linked with the Moslem people of Afghanistan by ties of religion  culture and civilization  calls for the withdrawal of an foreign forces from Afghan territory  enabling the people to choose the political system it desires in full freedom.149. In Democratic Kampuchea  we note that the Vietnamese army has not responded to the call of the international community to withdraw from that country so that its people can freely choose its own political system. We still believe that the Declaration and resolution adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea6 constitute the basis for the best solution of this problem.150. As for relations between the two parts of Korea  we hope that (ne Governments of the North and the South will resume a positive and constructive dialogue with a view to bringing about gradually the peaceful reunification of Korea.151. Morocco has always maintained good relations with the States of the Mediterranean Basin  and is striving to create favourable conditions for that region to be transformed into a zone of peace and co-operation  in accordance with General Assembly resolution.36/l02. On that basis  and within the frame-work of the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Morocco has supported and still supports the efforts made to strengthen peace and security and ensure co-operation in the region.152.	It is a recognized fact that international detente is linked to disarmament and that the arms race is a serious threat to the existence and the survival of man. It is the two blocs that motivate the arms race  but it is the developing countries that are the principal victims  because it prejudices their economic and social progress  increases their debt burden and lessens their security.153.	It is regrettable that the international efforts to change the situation have so far produced no positive results. This is especially true of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which failed to achieve any concrete progress in this respect.154.	Morocco  associating itself with those who work for disarmament at the regional or the international level  appeals to the super-Powers  which bear aspecial responsibility for the maintenance of peace  to redouble their efforts to reach agreement on a comprehensive programme of disarmament  with a carefully prepared timetable  so that disarmament does not become a mere theory which cannot be put into practice.155. The utmost attention must be paid to tackling the chronic injustice of the world economic system particularly since the developing countries are the most affected by this. International economic institutions in all fields and areas of competence recognize the urgent need for a radical change in the world economic system  especially following the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  which stressed the inevitability of such change. Certain achievements benefiting the third world such as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the generalized system of preferences and the Integrated Commodities Programme and certain such concepts as the common economic self-sufficiency of the developing countries and the new international economic order  must have positive effects on North-South relations. In -order to make the establishment of the new economic order possible  the third world States have called for the beginning of a series of negotiations on all aspects of international co-operation for development  in accordance with the programmes of action approved by the General Assembly or recommended by various international bodies  in particular UNCTAD  with a view to the attainment of the objectives of the Third United Nations Development Decade.156.	Experience has shown that partial economic solutions in the narrow national context and negotia-tions limited to specified sectors are only palliatives. The real solution is to be found in global negotiations leading to collective solutions to world economic problems.157.	It is regrettable that the developed countries remain deaf to the appeals of the countries of the third world and that they have strengthened their protectionist tariff and non-tariff measures and reduced the level of their external aid  which half had a serious effect on the terms of trade  the balance of payments and the employment situation. The deterioration in the terms of trade and the increase in indebtedness have shattered any hope of achieving economic and social development in the developing countries  in particular the least developed countries.158. The latest annual report of the World Bank showed the weakness of the third world economies and drew attention to the dangers facing the poor countries  particularly as regards agricultural production and food deficits. The rich countries must therefore abandon their selfishness and their narrow national interests and recognize the interdependence of the economic progress of the North and the need to speed up the economic  social and technical development of the South  because their common interests impose on all the parties the joint responsibility for establishing a new international economic order and building a better world for all mankind.159. The entire international community should rejoice at the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea by the majority of States Members. That Convention  which will be signed officially in Jamaica in the first two weeks of December  is the culmination df tremendous efforts. We hope that certain Member States will prove to be more flexible regarding their objections so that ""his Convention may come into force after its signature and ratification. This would make possible the establishment of a new era of fruitful co-operation.160.	The Organization is a haven of peace and security in a world swept by fierce winds of conflict  war and violence  and in which there is much under-development  poverty and injustice. It is a source' of hope for the alleviation and elimination of the evils of fear and underdevelopment. Since its inception in 1945 the Organization has made possible profound changes in the political map of the world. It has supported weak  conquered nations and helped them to achieve independence; it has devoted its efforts to conciliation and the settlement of conflicts. It has also opened up new perspectives in the field of international economic  scientific and cultural co-operation.161.	Despite all this  an enormous task lies ahead and demands our full support so that the noble mission assigned to the United Nations under the Charter may be fulfilled-that of contributing to the prosperity and the well-being of mankind as a whole and of spreading peace and security throughout the world."
"87",4434,"MDG",37,1982,"The unanimous election of Mr. Hollai to the presidency of the Assembly is a tribute to the People's Republic of Hungary  a country with which Madagascar is glad to have very cordial relations based on our common aspiration to social progress  and if I can speak as a former colleague I must say that we also see in this election recognition of his personal qualities and his unceasing contributions to the deliberations and work of the United Nations. To his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  we would address fraternal thanks for the exemplary and responsible way in which he carried out his mandate. It is also fitting for us again to express the confidence of the Malagasy Government in the Secretary General and to assure him of the full cooperation of our delegation.At the last session  when analyzing the international situation  the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar highlighted three points: the failure of the system of collective security drawn up in the Charter in rather special circumstances; the widespread insecurity in international relations; and the need for a multilateral approach to both the assessment and the solution of world problems.That analysis is still valid today  particularly now that we are so bitter and disconcerted to see that despite the numerous meetings  the succession of conferences and the numerous consultations we still cannot manage to emerge from the world political and economic crisis. How could it be otherwise  when real or potential conflicts are constantly on the increase  and when  through neglect or of necessity or inadvertently  the determination of priorities is governed by one law only  the law of confusion  and when we are virtually helpless in the face of the return of the primacy of national interests?The most pessimistic among us are quite willing to say that we have tried all remedies  that nothing can be done about this problem  that all we can do is remain content with a short lived respite from time to time. We are tempted to agree with them  because the notions on which the hopes of a just and equitable redefinition of international relations were based have been discarded. What happened to detente? What about peaceful coexistence? Is it now obsolete? And what happened to the right of peoples and nations to independent development? Are we still bound by international solidarity? The generous enthusiasm of the 1970s is no longer with us  and we are witnessing the erosion of the collective responsibility necessary for vision and the management of a world that obviously can no longer be what it was 37 years ago.The vast majority of the countries of the third world were not present at the time of the drafting of the Charter  the limits and even the imperfections of which we recognize. But in joining the Organization we were determined to remain as faithful as possible to the precepts of the Charter. In that respect we were idealists  because  for example  we thought that by brandishing the Charter we would be able to rid the world of. But at the end of the twentieth century Apartheid remains at the center of our concerns. It is an inhuman and retrograde policy if ever there was one. The racial segregation practiced in South Africa is detrimental not only to the dignity and well being of the non white population of that country; it poisons the political life of the continent as a whole  and its persistence makes it impossible for us to talk about true stability or peace in either the short term or the long term.The	regime presupposes the use of force  because no ethnic group can willingly submit to domination and exploitation by another group. To stay in power this regime has to ensure that its victims will stop being inspired by the example of the independent African countries. It has to undermine and destroy the network of solidarity which the South African liberation movement  essentially the African National Congress  enjoys or may enjoy beyond the frontiers of South Africa. That is why the Pretoria authorities do not hesitate to show their anti  African nature by increasing their acts of aggression  interference and destabilization against their immediate or more distant neighbors  in particular those of southern and eastern Africa.The sister Republic of Seychelles will take a long time to recover economically from the mercenary aggression of 25 November 1981 and to regain the security it needs to press ahead with its policies and the development that should be promoted by enabling the Special Fund set up under resolution 3202 to become operational.The racist regime sends into action mercenaries and bandits  which it trains  finances  leads and commands  in order to challenge the socialist course followed by Mozambique.Angola  which has suffered several acts of aggression since independence in 1975  has had part of its territory occupied for more than a year by South African troops; its airspace is constantly violated  and its civilian population and installations are constantly at the mercy of bombardments and airborne troops.Was that provided for in the Charter? Is it tolerable? The only answer can be no  but when we Africans who are in our flesh and in our dignity victims of the system of Apartheid and the extortion that accompanies it ask for sanctions against Pretoria or compliance with and the strengthening of the arms embargo decreed by the Security Council  all we get is unwillingness to act and vetoes.In Namibia  which South Africa still considers to be one of its provinces  Pretoria has done nothing to break the infernal cycle of injustice  turmoil and repression through voluntary renunciation of a policy that is constantly challenged. Instead  the racist regime continues to rely on force to suppress or at least to thwart the desire for emancipation of those who disagree with it and continues to maintain the illegal occupation of the Territory.It is regrettable that certain circles  disregarding this aspect  refuse to recognize SWAPO as the authentic and sole representative of the Namibian people and continue to treat it as a terrorist organization  showing a lack of sensitivity towards the large  scale physical liquidation of SWAPO militants. Those same circles have been the most zealous advocates of the need to shore up confidence in the racist regime and to keep it secure  as if injustice and illegal occupation needed comfort or consolidation.Recently those same circles have not hesitated to go beyond South African requests by reimposing a conditional link between the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist troops that are in Angola at the request of the Angolan Government. Leaving aside the fact that this would constitute a flagrant intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign independent State  this proposed link is truly surprising. It seems to be forgotten that it was South Africa that committed aggression against Angola and not the other way round. Now it is South Africa that needs to be protected against the combined forces of Angola and Cuba. Instead of internationalist or why not multinational troops being brought in to provide protection for that country  those that are there are being asked to leave.For this reason we support the terms of the communique of the summit meeting of the front line States held in Lusaka on 4 September 1982. Reaffirming that Security Council resolutions 386 (1976) and 435 (1978) are the sole valid basis for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question  we subscribe to the position of the non aligned countries that the United Nations has the prime responsibility for the solution of this question  with a view to the rapid transition of the Territory to independence. If that independence is further delayed  the Organization should shoulder its responsibility and proclaim Namibia independent  with all the consequences which that might have  particularly for South Africa  whose rights in the matter we challenge  for the Member States  which cannot with impunity abandon the Namibians to their fate and  lastly  for the Organization itself  one of whose primary objectives is after all the liberation of peoples.The unanimity of the African States on the political liberation of Africa  particularly of its southern part  we should have liked to see manifested in a positive manner in respect of Western Sahara. For us  the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic as the fifty first member of the Organization of African Unity is irreversible because it represents an important stage in the struggle of the Sahraoui people to put an end to the Moroccan occupation  which we continue to denounce  and to enjoy fully independence  sovereignty and their inalienable national rights. Last year  in Nairobi  at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  a consensus emerged ' in respect of the framework in which the exercise of those rights could take place and no divergence of views manifested itself as to the need for a ceasefire and negotiations between the parties to the conflict  which in our opinion can only be Morocco and POLISARIO The crisis experienced by the OAU does not date from the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to that organization but it is evident thatits solution depends to a great extent on the commencement and successful outcome of negotiations on Western Sahara. The error in this matter  if there has been an error  does not lie in the existence of divergent views  but may derive from the belief that unity can be achieved at any price and on any conditions. The African determination to overcome this crisis is still as firm as ever and we shall achieve our aims and be even more strengthened in our principles and convictions  if only to confound those who have counted on a temporarily disunited Africa in order to promote certain interests which will never be ours.On the Middle East  there are those who would like to calm our apprehensions by suggesting that the recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the Palestinian people ended in political defeat. In Israel itself something seems to have changed  something resembling the qualms of a conscience which had long been accustomed to accept the double talk of the Government; while among the most fervent defenders of the Zionist regime there are those who complain they have been led astray by Begin and Sharon and now seem to recognize the dangers of unconditional support for Israel and the virtues of a more critical and objective attitude to its crimes.Although salutary those reactions have come rather late and we cannot forget what a great price has been paid by the Palestinian people in order to bring about these modest movements in public opinion. Israel is now its own rejection front. It is the only country which has rejected in tum the United Nations plan  the Fahd plan  the Reagan plan  the Brezhnev plan and the Fez plan. In its isolation  and even though it is in the wrong  none the less Israel in fact  however wrongly  holds positions of strength which enable it to veto any proposed solution. Its supplies of weapons  munitions and military hardware continue to be assured. It occupies Jerusalem  Lebanon and the Golan Heights. The West Bank and the Gaza Strip are under relentless control. The settlements are solidly established and do not seem to be threatened. The liquidation of the Palestinian resistance continues  with the use of methods the horror of which transcends imagination  including as they do genocide.In this connection the President of my country wrote as follows in a message to the Secretary General dated 19 September: from now on  the word genocide will bring to mind not Oradour  but Beirut... the holocaust  the concentration camps and systematic massacres at Dachau and Buchenwald are eclipsed  as we near the end of the twentieth century  by the final solution perpetrated by Beginís and Sharon's executioners. Now  after the genocide in west Beirut  we feel bound to declare to the world that verbal condemnations and United Nations resolutions are no longer enough but that it is time for action. I therefore have the honor to request you: To call upon all the great Powers to impose an economic  commercial  diplomatic and military embargo on Begin's Fascist and extremist Israel; in particular  that the great Powers which boycotted Argentina at the time of the Malvinas affair should desist immediately from supplying Israel with arms  munitions and petroleum. To consider the possibility of organizing an international tribunal along the lines of the Nuremberg Tribunal against the Israeli Fascist war criminals and their Lebanese accomplices. To demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. It is high time for a review of history  geography and frontiers in this explosive region of the world and to give the martyred Palestinian people a State  a homeland  a nation of their own. In the absence of urgent  concrete and decisive action  we greatly fear that the peace of the whole world will be very seriously threatened. In another part of the world a deplorable conflict has been taking place for more than two years between two countries which  like my country  belong to the non aligned movement. We have no more ardent desire than to see the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq resolve their conflict in a peaceful manner  bringing the hostilities to an end as soon as possible  because their own interests and the interests of the rest of the world are at stake. En this respect we are encouraged to see that  within the framework of the current meeting of Foreign Ministers of non aligned countries  the two parties have agreed to accept a consensus text reaffirming the principles of the movement and those of the Charter  principles which can and must serve to bring about a just and lasting settlement of this dispute. The armed conflict which broke out this spring in respect of the Malvinas was a source of great consternation to the world because of its intensity and its ramifications  involving regional alliances. Was this confrontation inevitable  once the negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom had remained too long in a state of uncertainty? As the General Assembly now intends to invite the parties to resume their talks  it is important in our opinion to learn from the past  and in particular from the recent past. We may wonder  among other things  whether the idea of self determination should constitute a relevant factor in these negotiations. Just as the Jewish settlers living in the settlements set up by Israel do not acquire the right to take part in a referendum on self determination concerning the future of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  so in the same way the personnel transferred by the Falkland Islands Company for the purposes of the colonial exploitation of the islands cannot determine by their vote the question of sovereignty over those islands.Although it is not on the agenda  the question of Korea is none the less of concern to Member States. We do not believe that the solution lies in the endorsement of the division of the country and the admission of two Korean entities into the Organization. How will that resolve the problems posed by the abuse of the United Nations flag and the introduction of atomic weapons into the peninsula? Direct negotiations between the two parties is inevitable if there is a real desire to make progress  towards the settlement of this crisis and they are all the more called for since the joint communique of 4 July 1972 has defined the basis for negotiations. We would add only that the principles of that communique are in no way incompatible with the establishment of the great Koryo confederation which we very much look forward to.Other hotbeds of tension exist in Asia  Central America and the Caribbean and we are concerned by them because they do violence to the principles which we cherish  particularly the right to self determination  respect for sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States  the right of peoples to choose freely without interference of any kind their political  social and economic regime  and the right of nations to preserve by all possible means the gains of their revolution. We will not repeat our position  which is constant and well known. We wish to assure our friends and comrades from those regions that our solidarity is with them  as it is with all the victims of destabilization  injustice and imperia list domination.Before proceeding to consider the world economic situation  I should like fairly briefly to touch upon disarmament. At the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  we tried to maintain the impetus of the first special session and despite some rather unfavorable factors we felt that the time had come to promote further a multilateral approach to disarmament  particularly in view of the risks attendant upon the bilateral negotiations. We did not succeed in our aims  but this is no reason for us to abandon the comprehensive programme for disarmament  the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons tests  the control of strategic nuclear weapons  or the strengthening of the nuclear non proliferation regime  particularly as regards negative security guarantees.We still believe that the two approaches  bilateral and multilateral  strengthen and complement each other  particularly in the case of nuclear  weapon free zones  zones where the limitation of conventional weapons is envisaged  and zones of peace such as the Indian Ocean  which  for our own security and for the sake world peace  should become a demilitarized  denuclearized zone. On this matter the proposals of the non aligned countries are blocked  but an Indian Ocean treaty remains our final objective and we once again urge the great Powers to reduce their military presence in the Indian Ocean area as a first step towards the eventual elimination of the great Power presence and the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Such was the unanimous position of the non aligned countries at the ministerial meeting of their Coordinating Bureau at Havana last June. I should now like to refer to the economic situation and first to point out that the deterioration of the situation  which is a manifestation of a structural crisis  has become one of the most serious political problems of our age  since it is a potential source of instability and insecurity for all countries  both the developing countries  which already have negative growth rates  and the developed countries  where the recession is continually getting worse and unemployment rates have become uncontrollable The crisis is widespread: it is global and it will remain with us for a long time because of the deterioration of the international economic climate and the emergence of trends which are not favorable to integrated development based on solidarity.Although the consequences of the crisis have been felt grievously by the international community as a whole  its bad effects have hit much harder at the developing countries. The repercussions of this are manifold  but some of them need to be emphasized. The developing countries have a large trade deficit  mainly due to unequal terms of trade and stagnant production. Despite their producers' associations  they have no control over commodity prices on international markets  or over the rising prices of capital goods; they are therefore subjected to inflated import prices and reductions in the prices of their exports  which lead in turn to a net reduction in investment  forcing them to sacrifice part of their development programme.The deficit in their balance of payments  resulting from the increase in their financial obligations in the private capital markets and the high level of interest rates have led to an unprecedented increase in the external debt of those countries  to about $540 billion at the end of 1981. The servicing of that debt alone absorbs an average of 25 per cent in some cases over 40 per cent of their export earnings.Moreover  in the field of multilateral cooperation  despite the encouraging indications  official assistance for development is slowing down. The financing of the programmes and funds of the UnitedNations system is becoming more and more uncertain  while support for multilateral financial institutions is crumbling and the massive transfer of resources remains illusory.In the quest for solutions to these problems  we should like simply to take up again the following points which have already been discussed many times by the States members of the Group of 77.First  interdependent economic relations as they are in the present day world are still unbalanced and reflect inequalities of development. The aim can no longer be the recovery of the world economy on the basis of an undifferentiated process of growth; there must be development of the countries of the third world fully in keeping with their options.Secondly  the problems posed by world trade  the financing of development and the international monetary system require concerted action and cannot be dealt with without a recognition of the harmful effects of certain national policies on the world economy  and particularly the economy of the developing countries. We have not adequately grasped these effects because of the distance between the decision making centers; that is why we consider it essential that the sixth session of UNCTAD should provide Member States with an opportunity to deal in an integrated manner with development issues.Finally  the third aspect of joint endeavor is required to restore an economic environment favorable to development and the recovery of the world economy  with due regard for the objectives of the new international economic order. These few considerations confirm the value of global negotiations and we look forward to seeing these negotiations open as soon as possible. Desirous of being considered as equal partners in the reform of international economic relations  the third world countries have proposed an agenda and a procedure for these negotiations which reflect their belief that equity and justice alone can assure a reorganization of relations governing countries which have long been categorized on the basis of an incorrect understanding of the international division of labor. At the beginning of my statement  I referred to the erosion of collective responsibility which is not only due to the fact that each one of us wishes to propose or  in the worst of situations  to impose its own solution. In this respect we must first of all revitalize and strengthen what should properly be called the pillars of the Organization  that is to say  all the organs or machinery for consultation and decision making at the regional and intergovernmental levels  taking care  however  to avoid further polarizing positions  and adopting convergent approaches in the interest of security for all in all spheres. The solution of conflicts will thus be made easier and one can even hope that conflicts will even be avoided. This requires  however  that we examine our priorities in the light of the permanent interdependence of problems which will continue to confront a world of increasing solidarity. In our view  it is not too late to check confrontation hither between East and West  North and South or even between countries of the South in order to make mutual recognition of interests the comer stone of cooperation and coexistence. In short  as Members of the Organization we must  in facing the crises before us  be open  minded and positive  resist temptations towards fragmentation and maintain the common principles to which we have freely consented  without allowing ourselves to have recourse to expedients in the name of pragmatism and acceptance of reality. It is in this context that we have studied the Secretary General's report on the work of the Organization with the greatest interest. Our concerns are very much his own  and  since the Organization is not just the symbol of collective responsibility but also the most appropriate framework for its implementation and further development  we can but rejoice if the indications given by the Secretary General in his report are followed up by deeds  particularly by the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. This would put to an end the continual challenge to the authority and functioning of the Organization. To take up this challenge is also one of the reasons and not the least for our participating in this general debate. For our part  we renew our whole hearted commitment to do our utmost in this respect and in the cause of peace."
"88",4472,"MDV",37,1982,"Mr. President  I should like to begin my speech by congratulating you on behalf of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your vast experience  knowledge and personal wisdom will guide our deliberations to a constructive conclusion. May I also express our deep appreciation and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for his excellent performance in discharging the duties of his office. I should also like to extend my delegation's sincere greetings to the Secretary General  with the renewed assurances of my Government's support for his dedicated efforts in upholding the objectives of the Organization. We are meeting at a time of increasing tension and anxiety. We are in a situation which demands that serious and urgent steps be taken to prevent any further deterioration in the international climate and to align the norms of international behavior with the proper human values prescribed in the Charter. The need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining world peace and security is felt at the present stage more strongly than ever before. We should not allow the opportunity of this meeting to pass without effectively renewing our commitments to the objectives of the Organization  and fulfilling the aspirations of our peoples. In his remarkable report to the Assembly  the Secretary General has very ably diagnosed the world situation  and my delegation fully agrees with him that our prime objective at this crucial moment should be to renew the concept of collective action for peace and security  and to render the United Nations more capable of carrying out its primary function. The United Nations was created for the purpose of harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends and it should effectively remain so with the maximum capacity to safeguard peace and to be a forum for responsible discussions and negotiations between nations. We feel also that the responsibility as well as the authority of the Security Council in its function as the primary instrument for maintaining international peace and security should be reconfirmed and further strengthened by all possible means. In this context  my delegation wishes to stress the important commitment of the permanent members of the Council and their responsibilities to world peace. It is frightening to imagine a world with no power at all to deal with situations that endanger international peace. The recent military adventures in Lebanon and the earlier foreign interventions in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and some other countries in Africa and Latin America have indeed alarmed the world community regarding the dangers of a new international anarchy. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that we seriously and sincerely embark on a process that will free mankind of these fears and anxieties. My delegation feels that we should accelerate our efforts to achieve world disarmament. While we concentrate on removing the danger of a nuclear war  we should continue with renewed determination our efforts to limit the arms race and the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons as well as of other destructive conventional weapons. My delegation will continue to support the efforts of the world community in the direction of total disarmament  including the safeguarding of outer space  prohibition of nuclear weapon tests and establishment of nuclear weapon free zones. The situation in the Middle East remains the most pressing issue on the international scene. The tragic events in Lebanon have added new dimensions to the gravity of the problem to which the Organization has to address itself. And yet the question of Palestine the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self determination and freedom remains at the heart of the issue. The key to any lasting solution and to peace in that crucial area is  as is evident from the sequence of recent events  the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to have their own independent homeland. The world has witnessed with anger and dismay the Israeli invasion of Lebanon while it continued its illegal occupation of other territories  perpetuating its policy of expansion through the establishment of illegal settlements  ignoring and rejecting United Nations resolutions and violating all norms of international behavior. My Government has joined the world community in its repeated condemnation of the Israeli aggression against Arab territories and atrocities in the occupied territories. The invasion of Lebanon under the cruel pretext of liquidating the PLO  which symbolizes the legitimate will of the Palestinian people  has clearly revealed the nature of Israeli policies in the area. Israel is not only a radical entity that aims to expand at the expense of other peoples and of their rights  but is also a force that will not hesitate to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States through occupation  terrorism and even assassination in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives. The world community  including States which continue to sympathize with Israel  should now  in particular after seeing the horrible consequences of its invasion of Lebanon  act firmly to stop the arrogance and expansionism of Israel. Among the central issues of international concern remain the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  two small countries which were subjected to foreign invasion. My delegation reiterates its policy of endorsing the United Nations resolutions which condemn foreign intervention and call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from those two countries  allowing the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea the opportunity to exercise their own rights without outside influence or pressure  including the right of refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary General in initiating talks with the parties concerned aimed at finding a political solution to the problems involved. In the same context and within the framework of the same principles involved  we look at the events in Africa and Latin America in which intervention in the internal affairs of countries took place under different pretexts in the past few years. My country is deeply concerned over this trend of military intervention  which undermines the orderly and peaceful existence of nations. Among issues of grave concern to the Organization and to the world as a whole is the question of South West Africa. The continuation by South Africa of its occupation of Namibia  despite the vigorous efforts of the United Nations to grant independence to that deprived nation  constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and endangers world peace and the stability of the African region. It is our duty to continue political and economic pressure on South Africa in our efforts to force it to concede to the logic of human realities and to continue our support to the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO. While condemning the occupation of Namibia by South Africa  my Government reiterates its support to the oppressed people in South Africa itself under its inhuman policy in their struggle for equality  justice and dignity. Another question of concern to us is the situation in Cyprus. We are disappointed by the slow progress in negotiations between the parties concerned with the aim of reaching an honorable solution to the prolonged internal dispute that will at the same time ensure the rights of the communities and preserve the national and territorial integrity of the country. My country is concerned also about the stalemate in the dialogue between the peoples of North and South Korea for the purpose of their peaceful reunification. We believe that the international community should continue its support to the Korean people and encourage them to continue that process within the framework of their own aspirations  free from outside influence and pressure. In this respect we should welcome all initiatives calling for the resumption of talks between the two sides. We are deeply concerned that thewar between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to rage despite the repeated appeals by the world community for a cease fire and for the solution of the dispute between those two neighboring countries by peaceful means. Maldives continues to be guided by a policy of non alignment and has always endeavored humbly to contribute its modest share in order to strengthen the unity and the charter of the nonaligned movement  in sincerity for peace  friendship and international cooperation. Turning to our region and to a question of immediate concern to my country  I wish to confirm our full endorsement of and support for the proposal to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  not only because of our strong opposition to the presence of foreign military bases and facilities in the Indian Ocean but also because of the awareness of increasing tension in the region and of the strong possibility of their involvement in provoking and escalating conflicts in the area. The rivalry among the big Powers and their military presence in our own neighborhood divert our attention to potential dangers and compel us to exhaust our resources on otherwise unnecessary security measures  while our limited resources are most vitally needed for the promotion of the welfare of our peoples and the development of our economies. The efforts to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace must therefore be renewed and continued within the framework of the fundamental elements of the Declaration. We feel that the Colombo Conference should be held on as early a date as possible. It may be true that the convening of the Conference will not be enough to resolve all the problems pertaining to the security of our region. However  we are convinced that the meeting will contribute to the favorable development of the concept and improve the climate in the region. My country is indeed glad to note the successful conclusion of the negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with the adoption of a comprehensive Convention on the Law of the Sea which reflects the expectations of the world community. It is our hope that the acceptance of the Convention by all the States Members of the United Nations will become a reality as soon as possible. My delegation believes that the Convention will be an extremely important instrument far the promotion of a peaceful and orderly discipline in ocean affairs as well as for the exploitation of the immense resources of the sea and the sea bed in a better and more dignified manner  which would be beneficial for mankind as a whole. While we focus our attention on the critical developments on the international political scene  we find that further deterioration and serious erosion is taking place in multilateral economic relations mainly due to the failure of some of the developed countries to understand the inevitability of interdependence. My delegation feels that the concept of global negotiation should be further pursued and that new initiatives should be undertaken to accelerate our effort to establish a new international economic order. Meanwhile we should continue our multilateral negotiations at the sectorial levels within and outside the specialized world bodies. The process should not be allowed to slow down under the pressure of the still existing obsessions of protectionism and adverse national policies. We should sincerely and collectively address ourselves to all the stresses and strains of the entire economic system of the world  which extend beyond the relationship between North and South. Meanwhile we are convinced that the promotion of measures for collective self reliance among the developing countries is now more indispensable than ever. In this regard we endorse the outcome of the meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow Up and Coordination Committee on economic cooperation among developing countries held in August in Manila. As one of the least developed countries of the third world  Maldives was happy to note the positive responses from many ofthe developing countries to the recommendations of last year's Paris Conference. For our part  we shall try to demonstrate to the donor countries and to our friends all over the world that we are sincere and serious in our efforts to develop our country and to emerge from the bracket of underdevelopment to an appropriate stage of steady national growth. We sincerely hope that the recommendations of the Paris Conference will be followed up effectively  and we look forward to the round table meetings scheduled to take place in the near future in the earnest hope that they will produce positive results. In conclusion I should like to reaffirm my country's faith and trust in the Organization as the instrument with the most potential for maintaining peace and security in the world and fulfilling the aspirations of mankind to justice and prosperity. We are bound by serious constraints and difficulties. We are more often faced with frustrating situations such as that through which we are passing today. However  our faith and trust in the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations demand of us that we renew our commitments and continue our efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization in fulfilling the lofty objectives of the Charter."
"89",4518,"MEX",37,1982,"Mr. President  it gives us great satisfaction that the President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a representative of Hungary  a nation which has succeeded in preserving its identity in all circumstances.Mr. Secretary-General  the international community has conferred upon you the highest and most sensitive of its responsibilities in these perilous days. We must therefore all share with you the commitment of our time: peaceful  just and productive coexistence. In facing the challenge of today's unsettled world  I offer you the solidarity of my country.Mexico sees in the United Nations the best and highest international forum  where it is possible to hope for rationality in the overwhelming presence of the absurd. Since the unparalleled ignominy of the Second World War this has been the only setting in which arguments can be adduced in the light of reason and law to prevent a new conflict that very probably would be our last. It represents the only way to give new impetus to the endeavours of civilization.If these words seem exaggerated to us today  if the dramatic tone strikes us as anachronistic  let us ponder the fact that less than 40 years have passed since the end of that war. Let us recall that it was preceded  and in fact brought on by  an economic depression and that the despair caused by that serious setback proved to be an evil counsellor of peoples and Governments. Let us remember that before absurdity and death took over there was a slow and gradual debasement of reason and of life itself.The symptoms are ominous. In recent years we have drifted far from the principles that gave birth to this Organization  in large measure because of the attitude of those who think they can achieve their objectives through the use of force and disregard of the law. They fail to realize that in abandoning the processes of the rational solution of controversies or disputes they bring us all closer to the abyss of violence and anarchy.Today there is no region that can regard itself as immune from crisis. The tragic conflicts of the South Atlantic and the Middle East bear witness to this. Some areas of the world are in great turmoil. I refer to those where the arrogance of their leaders is imposed on the historical demands of their peoples. We share the indignation and shame of those who  in the face of genocide practised by former victims of genocide  are now protesting against a vile crime that is an affront to mankind. Repetition of the worst excesses of the war has also revived the atmosphere of ignominy and the heavy burden of fatal foreboding.We note with concern that pressure is being brought to bear on the Members of the United Nations in order to sway their votes. The results that are sometimes achieved indicate the vulnerability of many countries. The negotiating mechanisms prevailing in some agencies of the system raise doubts as to whether they are at the service of those who created them or whether they are inspired by true respect for the sovereignty of States.Mexico has always been active in and committed to the United Nations  not with the idea that it may be the last resort for the prevention of total destruction but because it is the best means available to us to halt the process that could lead to such an outcome.This makes it essential to bring together the two fundamental areas of negotiation for which the world is waiting: that which will lead to detente between the two super-Powers and that  which will reorganize relationships among countries with different levels of development. The two conflicts  between East and West and North and South  have  we would repeat  crucified all mankind. Only through a convergence of both areas of negotiations can there be established a new international order  one that includes the process of political decolonization and the fundamental challenge facing international society - economic decolonization. Both types of decolonization are changes attesting to the most profound potential of a human being the attainment of his own dignity.Mexico's traditional adherence to and promotion of the principles of the United Nations and its contribution to those two major areas of negotiation are well known; evidence of this is the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States  the world energy plan  the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  which was held at Cancun in October 1981 and the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. We have been unflagging in our efforts to give impetus to the development of international instruments to promote disarmament worldwide  particularly in Latin America.We believe that the arms race and development are in competition with each other  not only as regards the utilization of available resources but also because they represent incompatible approaches: arrogance and inequality  which will lead to annihilation; or tolerance and co-operation  which would make progress possible for all. We know that the funds allocated for technical assistance to developing countries for the next five years amounts to less than will be spent on weapons in the next five days.Everything would indicate that the world economy is being sacrificed to the arms race. The great Powers are arming themselves even at the expense of their own standards of living  while their adversaries are doing the same. And they are dragging all mankind  which wants not weapons but progress  into this vortex.Thus is created a Dantesque vicious circle. The greater the tension  the greater the concern for security; the greater the insecurity  the greater the arms expenditure; the greater the concentration of resources in armaments  the greater the impoverishment and social inequality and the greater the political radicalization and tension until the wheel of destruction starts its atavistic cycle all over again.The strongest Powers may insist on imposing their will upon others and on taking advantage of the power imbalance  which favours them  to strengthen their aspirations to hegemony. But they will not thus subdue moral sensibility; nor will they quell revolution. They will succeed only in fanning the flames of the conflagration that uncontrolled can set fire to everything.The practical ineffectiveness of the means of collective security is at the very core of armed conflict. Thus  for example  when a weak country is openly threatened by political pressure that is superior to its own strength and it realizes that it cannot rely on the United Nations for protection  it is reduced to the fateful choice between arming itself or being annihilated.At the same time  when the international community is incapable of generating the minimum conditions needed for general progress  peoples have to choose between the wretchedness of abject subsistence and the harsh road of revolution. Such is the tragedy of Latin America today. Such are the prospects of most of the nations here represented.At the present moment  rather than an appeal what is needed is a warning: the world is absolutely interdependent  and not one of its parts can be saved if the others are doomed.Mexico has tirelessly collaborated in the other major area of negotiation  which is aimed at the establishment of a new international economic order. It proposed to the community of nations that it draft a document having legal status that would encompass the doctrine and basic rules of a new model of international relations  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which was adopted by the General Assembly almost 10 years ago.Mexico has recently demonstrated its willingness to commit itself to the struggle for justice and rational coexistence as regards not only global problems or remote conflicts but also issues that affect it very closely and for which it has taken risks and made sacrifices. This is evidenced by the proposal for a world energy plan made by an oil-exporting country during the oil boom and above all by effective co-operation in good times and bad with those countries neighbouring ours that lack such resources.I consider that the ideas and proposals we put forward in the energy plan are still valid and that it is possible to foster an orderly  progressive  comprehensive and just transition between two epochs of mankind the present one  in which the consumption of hydrocarbons predominates  and the future one  in which the development of new energy resources will have priority. The world energy plan is still a good method for the achievement of the new international economic order.Even during the present crisis Venezuela and Mexico have moved forward and set an example by reaffirming and renewing the San Jose Agreement to help the countries of Central America and the Caribbean by guaranteeing their supplies of oil and by creating soft loan funds for their development. The $700 million that Mexico alone has earmarked to date for that purpose is granted unconditionally and without distinction and equals the amount that the United States plans to allocate for the same region.Our willingness to commit ourselves is shown also in our efforts to enhance the possibilities for a negotiated settlement of the social and political conflicts of that same region  notwithstanding the many who would like us to feel threatened and thus be driven by fear to support repression. They forget that Mexico has already had its revolution  which it is continually consolidating  and so has no reason to be afraid of its people's desire for justice. We support and will continue to support detente and negotiated political settlements  with due respect for the parties concerned.But Mexico's most constant concern and task in the international sphere is the transition to a new economic order.We have stressed that the entire gamut of economic relations between the developing countries and the industrialized world must be transformed. Those relations have figured on the agendas of many international conferences  but the progress made has not been particularly encouraging. It was therefore our thought to convene a summit meeting of the main industrialized countries and a representative number of developing nations: The idea was for heads of State and Government  rather than negotiating topic by topic  to show their firm political will to take a qualitatively significant step in the stalled negotiations by acknowledging the need to seek this essential new order.Mexico and Austria worked for more than a year and a half to make possible the Cancun summit meeting. As the process which was to lead to the global round of negotiations became increasingly bogged down  the meeting of the heads of State took on greater importance. We noted alarming indications of a world economic slowdown. Many .countries placed their hopes in Cancun  not because it might result in solutions  but because it was the only forum that could provide the political impetus necessary to revive a suspended process.The meeting took place almost a year ago and was attended by 22 heads of State and Government  or their representatives.In an attempt to replace prejudice with sound judgement  and to transform monologue into dialogue and subordination into solidarity  differing points of view regarding our present-day situation were expressed openly and with tolerance for the ideas of others.At that meeting many of us stated that the lack of harmonious relations was making the world in which we live increasingly perilous for rich countries and implacable and cruel for poor countries. We maintained that progress for all should be a condition for the progress of each individually.The tragedy of hunger was stressed  and strategies to increase food production and improve food distribution were discussed. The possibility of organizing a fair and balanced trade in raw materials and industrialized goods was set forth. It was not only petroleum markets and prices that were dealt with  but also ways of organizing the exploitation and use of energy sources and of alleviating the financial burden that oil purchases represent for developing countries.Tragic paradoxes that we have been unable to resolve; were examined in Cancun: recession in the countries of the North  due to  among other things  the lack of a market for goods which are needed by the South but which it cannot purchase because of inadequate financing; liquid funds from the countries of the South that are placed in the North and then loaned to other countries of the South; and the persistence  and even the worsening  of monetary and financial practices which have proven time and again to be inadequate and ineffective  both in the South and in the North.Faced with such paradoxes  we maintained that financing the joint development of rich and poor countries was not only rational  but the only possible way to achieve a healthy world economy.We acknowledged  and we say again today  that many of the problems of the South are of the South's own making; but there are other serious constraints that stem from its relations with the North. We see today that the likelihood of such constraints becoming fatal to the world economy has been rapidly increasing since we met at Cancun.Many things have changed since then. In recent years we have witnessed unprecedented hostility  rhetorical belligerence and lack of understanding between the super-Powers. In 1982 the world saw the outbreak and escalation of actual armed conflict in many areas. Such conflicts are irrational in every case and should be of serious concern to us  both because of their very existence and because of the relative ease with which they are coming about.What most concerns and affects the majority of countries  however  is the extremely serious deterioration of the international economy  particularly in the poor countries  where three quarters of the world's population lives and where the consequences of the crisis are felt in tragic measure.Steadily decreasing income due to the plunge in the prices of raw materials on the one hand  and higher interest rates and shorter terms of repayment on the other  are the two blades of the shears that threaten to slash the momentum achieved in some countries and to cut off the chances for progress in the others.In fact it is generally recognized that the world is now in the throes of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Growth rates  both in industrialized countries and in the developing world are at the lowest levels recorded in recent decades. Rampant unemployment  endemic in poor countries  has now become widespread in the most powerful nations as well. All over the world  men and women who had jobs are losing them. The reduction of inflation achieved in certain countries through huge sacrifices in employment does not mean that the problem has been overcome. The brutal rise in interest rates over the last three years has not only created an intolerable burden for debtor nations  but has also given rise to speculation and a flight of capital which are uncontrollable and of unforeseen magnitude.The events of the past few years have more than confirmed the need to tackle energy problems in a comprehensive manner and in close co-ordination with the other areas of the world economy. Petroleum sales abruptly shifted from a seller's to a buyer's market  which resulted in surpluses that have again caused prices to fall and have discouraged efforts to bring about a transition in the field of energy.The disarray has been detrimental to the oil- producing countries and has been a victory for no one  since it is but another factor in the crisis. The decline in available financial resources caused by lower petroleum prices has led us from an unresolved energy crisis to a financial crisis that is deepening the recession and threatening the stability of the international monetary system.Spectres arise in this panorama  spectres which could seriously threaten the world if the present trend continues. The most dangerous of these threats is that the social pressures created by economic dislocations could reach the point of exploding. We should recall that developing countries have no so-called social- security and crisis-control systems such as those which exist in the developed world. We cannot afford  and therefore do not have  unemployment insurance or extensive public welfare programmes.A second spectre that appears to be dangerously near at hand is a North-South and North-North crisis in trade in both basic and industrial commodities. We all want to export more in order to solve our problems  and we all want to import less to avoid a drain on our foreign exchange reserves and our domestic markets. When the entire world is in the midst of a severe recession  the only exportable item is the crisis itself. If recession in industrialized countries continues to push down the prices of raw materials and to restrict the entry of manufactured goods from the South  both our problems and theirs will become more critical.The favourable trade balance of the industrialized countries as a whole has become the major feature of the international economic order  with the exception of a period of less than 10 years of positive balances for some oil-exporting countries. It is therefore inevitable that the vast majority of developing countries have a negative trade balance.To maintain the flow of trade in these circumstances necessarily implies the establishment of credit flows that would make it possible to pay the industrialized countries for goods and services. To sustain growth in the countries of the South and maintain employment in the countries of the North  the amount of such credit must continually increase; this is even more the case if the cost of the accumulated debt increases as a result of higher interest rates.Reduced availability of credit for the developing countries has serious implications not only for those countries but also for production and employment in the industrial countries. Let us not continue in this vicious circle  since it could well be the start of a new Dark Ages  with no possibility of a Renaissance.Here we have a third threat. I refer to the serious problem of the lack of co-ordination in the international financial system. As everyone knows  several heavily indebted countries  among them Mexico  have recently been obliged to begin renegotiating their foreign debt.This is a paradox that makes us reflect on the fact that the growth of many of the countries of the South is now being criticized by the very countries that made loans to them for that purpose and that are now haggling over extending the credit needed for continued growth  although only such growth will make it possible for the former countries to repay the latter and to buy from them.Today  Mexico and many other third world countries will be unable to comply with the payment schedule agreed upon in conditions quite different from those that now prevail.Suspension of payments is to nobody's advantage and nobody wants it. But whether or not this will happen is beyond the will and  thus  the responsibility of the debtors. Everyone must negotiate seriously  carefully and realistically. The international financial system consists of several parts: lenders  borrowers and guarantors; it is tied to those that produce and those that consume  those that buy and those that sell. It is everybody's responsibility and it must be shouldered by everybody. Common situations produce similar positions  with no need for conspiracies or intrigues. We developing countries do not wish to become vassals. We cannot paralyse our economies or plunge our peoples into greater misery in order to pay debt  the servicing of which has tripled without our participation or responsibility and the conditions of which were imposed upon us. We countries of the South are about to run out of chips; if we cannot stay in the game  it will end in defeat for everyone.I wish to be emphatic: we countries of the South have not sinned against the world economy. Our efforts to grow in order to conquer hunger  disease  ignorance and dependency have not caused the international crisis. A more immediate cause is the decision to arm  to fight force with force  dragging all the economies  directly or indirectly  towards this senseless objective.But we can overcome the crisis.It will be done more quickly if we can count on the rational support of the international financial community rather than reluctance or punishment for sins we have not committed.Such support will be of benefit to both creditors and debtors  for we all belong to one world  in which  if we are all part of the problem  we are also part of the solution. We need foreign exchange to make payments and' purchases. Our opposite numbers also need to buy in order to make collections and sales. This is a healthy relationship which is to everyone's advantage. It is that simple.Mexico is a good illustration of various North- South problems because of its dual situation as a country on the threshold of development and in its geographical location and because of the domestic and international prospects as regards its petroleum resources.In recent years we have made every effort to meet the needs of our population by developing its great productive potential  in conjunction with the needs of the world economy and supported by substantial external financing. For four years we grew at a rate of over 8 per cent annually  we doubled our installed industrial capacity  we rose from eighteenth to fourth place among oil-producing countries  we tripled hydrocarbon production during that period and we undertook the urgent task of intensive social development  thereby generating more than 4 million jobs not only to absorb the existing unemployed but to provide work for new generations.The greatest growth in our history was dramatically interrupted in 1981. Our plans  which had been programmed and budgeted for on the basis of four successive fiscal years  suddenly could no longer be financed because of a drop in the price of raw materials  including petroleum  and because of higher interest rates on the already contracted external debt  the cost of servicing which tripled. A pernicious sequence of inflation  devaluations and mounting prices and wages put a brake on our prosperity. In just three years the flight of capital became double the total of foreign investment in our country. Thus  because of the financial system and free exchange  facilitated by our proximity to the wealthiest country in the world  our reserves were exhausted. It is easy to say that  but for 70 million Mexicans who had begun to look forward to better times it is a brutal reality. Our way of being  of acting and managing our affairs  has been distorted in the news media  which have made us appear to the eyes of the world a country incapable of shaping its destiny and incompetent in administering its resources  so that the alternative would have to be our subordination to the ruthless ambition of outside Powers. Developing countries like Mexico have suffered countless such experiences. Many of our problems are made worse by tendentious reports which bring on the results they announce.After major attempts to correct this economic situation  my Government decided to attack the root of the evil and extirpate it once and for all. There was obviously an inconsistency between internal development policies and an erratic and restrictive international financial structure. A reasonable growth policy could not be reconciled with freedom to speculate in foreign exchange. We therefore established exchange control. Given our 3 000-kilometre border with the United States  exchange control can only function through a banking system that operates on the basis of the policies of its country and Government and not its own speculative interests and the fluctuations of international financial chaos. For that reason we have nationalized the banks. We have been a living example of what happens when that enormous  volatile and speculative mass of capital ranges over the world in search of high interest rates  tax havens and supposed political and exchange stability. It decapitalizes entire countries and leaves destruction in its wake. The world should be able to control this; it is inconceivable that we cannot find a formula that  without limiting necessary movements and flows  would permit regulation of a phenomenon that damages everyone. It is imperative that the new international economic order establish a link between refinancing the development of countries that suffer from the flight of capital and the capital that has left those countries. At least they should have the crumbs from their own loaves.In the face of these dramatic realities  we are lectured about economic liberalism at all costs  which is not applied even in the countries that most passionately defend it. On the contrary  the danger of losing their national integrity has led many Governments among them  our own to intensify their economic reforms and to strengthen the role of the State in directing their national economies; these are cases of legitimate self-defence.Mexico is open to negotiation in every sphere and every forum. We have the resources  tradition and historical background to reinforce the principles laid down by our social and popular revolution. We are sure that  as a country bordering both the North and the South  our fate is of concern not only to Mexicans but to all developing countries. To all of them I say that we must hold our heads high and stand together  today and always  in dignity and with our shared endeavours and our shared hopes.Never has the principle of sovereignty over natural resources and economic processes been more valid than now. The terms of the debased relations that we suffer could lead to the dissolution of sovereignty itself. The interference of transnational corporations  the growing concentration of financial facilities  the subordination of the banking systems to the great metropolitan cities  the massive outflow of capital and the imitation of models alien to our development endanger the very existence of States.Although its formal links have been broken  dependency persists  and the pattern of domination on which the colonial regime was founded has even been reinforced. The concentration of wealth and power increases  while vast regions of the world become ever more impoverished. In the present situation the machinery of international co-operation that we have devised has been useful in soothing some troubled consciences  but it has proved altogether incapable of solving the serious everyday structural problems.The charges levelled by the countries of the South in this respect were accurate and far-sighted. In proposing a new order  we sought a profound institutional reform capable of rechanneling international economic relations. We should have liked to avoid the tremendous deterioration of recent years and to have eased the crisis. But it is never too late.Throughout history  major transformations usually occurred when there was no other course to take  which accounts for the distance that separates prophets from revolutionaries. Major ills call for major remedies.International economic relations should be reviewed judiciously and with a sense of commitment. Let us not look for culprits but  rather  find people who will take responsibility for the future. The tracing of the ultimate cause of our ills is a task for historians and research workers  not for political leaders.The assumption of that immense task of political and economic integration requires a change in attitude. Until now ideological Manichaeism  which nurtures the hegemony of the great Powers  has prevailed.There has been a tendency to impose the same system of the past  and in a tense dialectical relationship as yet unresolved  the doctrines and strategies of change have been in confrontation with vested interests  love of compromise for its own sake  and the conservative instincts of empires that never end. Therefore  the global economic negotiations must provide the opportunity to reconcile these opposing views in approaches compatible with the needs of the present. The necessity to convene these negotiations is urgent; they cannot be postponed.Nor can the alleged dispute between the specialized agencies of the system and the sovereignty of the Assembly be put forward as an excuse for delaying the dialogue. All the United Nations bodies have been created by our sovereign decision; all of them function within a given legal framework  and are to be respected.The justification for these international bodies is not to be found in the perpetuation of undesirable inequalities  but in the search for rational solutions to the crucial issues of our time  disarmament  collective security and development.The United Nations was created in a different era and the Organization and its Members now find themselves at the crossroads. We have the forum we deserve and there is no other. If we do not know how to use it to overcome the crisis and establish a more equitable order  and above all one compatible with our times  there will be no further opportunity. Global negotiations should begin immediately  and they should be conducted thoroughly  with a serious intention of reaching agreement. World peace and security are threatened to an even greater extent today. We must safeguard them at all costs. Any solution or concession is preferable to the alternative. We cannot afford to fail. Something tremendous is at stake here  not only the heritage of civilization  but the very survival of our children  of future generations  of mankind itself.Let us make what is reasonable possible. Let us recall the tragic conditions in which the Organization was created and the hopes that we placed in it. The place is here and the time is now.Let us hope that the logical confrontations of pluralism  the understandable outbursts of dissidence  compounded by the frustration of impotence  and the unavoidable delays in negotiations do not nullify the highest good represented by the United Nations.Let us not resign ourselves to the United Nations becoming bogged down in formal procedures  while outside pressures are brought to bear to satisfy selfish interests unable to withstand the test of inclusion in an international legal order.We are all part of this union. It is as strong as we wish to make it  particularly those who have the real power and therefore the ultimate responsibility. We have never created anything better or more efficient. Again and again I shall repeat what I have said here. This is the time to decide whether mankind belongs to the powerful or the powerful to mankind. That has never been truer than now. We shall know the answer here  and in the centuries to come people will bear witness to it."
"90",4613,"MLI",37,1982,"A year ago  during the thirty-sixth session  President Moussa Traore  head of State of Mali  affirmed from this rostrum that ""The aspiration of our peoples to live in dignity and in spiritual  moral and material tranquility is thus being increasingly jeopardized"".Alas  the past year confirms that statement which should be a source of fruitful meditation and deep reflection for us. In fact  1982 will above all confirm the prevalence of relationships of force in international relations. The international community has been shaken by political  economic and military crises which treaten the very foundations of human civilization.The past year  more than any other  seems to have been a year of disillusion. Solutions to fundamental questions basic to the balance of the world which were at one time within our reach crumbled because of the resurgence of warlike activism and last- minute intransigence.That is why the eyes of the world  a world which legitimately expects from us just and lasting solutions for its stability  its security  its economic  social and cultural progress  are fixed particularly upon the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.Because we know that Mr. Hollai is an experienced diplomat with a long and full career; because he has dedicated part of that career to defending  in this very Organization  the fundamental objectives of the Charter  the Republic of Mali  a friend of his country  the People's Republic of Hungary  places great hopes in his well-deserved election which will  we are convinced  contribute to enriching our common action in maintaining peace  respect for the sovereign equality of States and the peaceful coexistence of all nations.Of course  I cannot conceal the legitimate pride that my delegation takes in the wide-ranging and positive action accomplished so skilfully by Mr. Hollai's outstanding predecessor  Mr. Kittani  that worthy son of the third world  of Iraq  a country which is a friend of my own  who acquitted himself so ably in they should like also to reiterate to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  the best wishes of the Government of the Republic of Mali  which reaffirms its full readiness to co-operate most sincerely with him. One of the long line of individuals who devote their talents and their political courage to the cause of peace  he bears with him the faith and hopes of the third-world countries which are resolutely committed to preventing the bipolarization of the world. He has already reflected in stirring terms in his report on the work of the Organization and in his speeches the meaning of his fight for justice and equity and also for the strengthening of the system of collective security of the United Nations  an irreplaceable instrument for world peace.The United Nations is neither called upon nor able to provide magical solutions to international problems. But we had become accustomed year after year  in spite of certain negative factors  to winning victories over ourselves which reflected our deep dedication to the ideals  goals and principles of the Charter and to have our awareness of our international responsibilities heightened day by day.In the course of the past decades  the United Nations has given particular meaning to its ascent towards universality. New forces have strengthened its action and given new dynamism to its structures. The virtues of wisdom and realism have often dispersed the clouds which  streaked with lighting heralding lethal thunderbolts  darkened the international horizon. Where agreement was sometimes lacking  hope at least was allowed. That is why the United Nations can quite rightly be pleased at having made its appreciable contribution to the national liberation struggles. It can take pride in having prepared international development strategy decades tor low-income countries. It can also be proud at having created hopes for the establishment of a new international economic order. Well may it be proud also at having contributed to a sharper perception of the danger represented by the arms race  especially the danger of atomic weapons  and at having placed the individual at the center of its concerns by stressing the magnificence and protection of his basic rights.Thus  in spite of pitfalls  in spite of certain sharp setbacks  in spite of uncertainties that have often characterized the international situation  at each of the previous sessions the Assembly has attempted to pay its share for the safeguard and maintenance of peace. The feeling has prevailed that where we lacked immediate solutions to international problems  dialogue did enable us to discharge our international responsibilities with respect for our fundamental interests.But this is where our hopes stop short. Indeed  as the Secretary-General himself recalls in his brilliant report ""The past year has seen an alarming succession of international crises as well as stalemates on a number of... international issues"". Hence the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly has opened in the atmosphere of a terrible  distressing vacuum.It is therefore easy to understand why the recent twelfth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  in which many distinguished personalities participated  concluded without even reflecting the hopes that had been placed in it. And  worse still  while it was meeting Beirut was crumbling under Israeli bombs and new so-called conventional weapons were appearing on the battlefield  which thus served as a testing ground.The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been adopted  but with its chances of implementation blocked. The North-South dialogue on the coming into being of the new international economic order has foundered on national egoism.The racist  illegal Pretoria regime has strengthened its alliances  heightened its repression against South African patriots and violated  with increasing brutality and even more bloodshed  the sovereignty and integrity of neighboring States. Some Member States persist  in their delirium of power  in their attempts to break the will of peoples for independence. The United Nations will not at this session be enriched by the admission of one of the nations still under domination-although we had every reason to hope that that would be so.Thus the challenges that we have committed ourselves to meeting are in fact taking on frightful dimensions.The thirty-seventh session of the Assembly is being held at a time when Palestinian people is experiencing the most tragic situation in its existence. The Zionist war machine has been unleashed against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples with unequalled furor. The siege of Beirut  the invasion of that city  the systematic destruction of Palestinian refugee camps  hospitals and schools and  lastly and above all  the Sabra and Shatila massacres lend the war in Lebanon the character of genocide  a crime against mankind. That outright aggression against Lebanon is a premeditated act of war against the sovereignty and integrity of a State Member of the Organization. The horrors that have been perpetrated bring back terrible memories. But the peoples that do not have short memories have spoken up everywhere in the world  including in Israel itself  against this repetition of the massacre of an entire people.What took place in Lebanon disturbs and frightens us  because there is no greater incitement to crime than the apathy of those who  under the dangerous illusion that only the neighbor's house is burning  accept the inadmissible role of hearing and seeing no evil. In international relations  indifference is the most serious complicity  because it makes it possible for evil to progress and worsen.The Zionist aggression in Lebanon is the consequence of the unpunished acts of Israel which therefore continues to defy the international community every day-as though the odious aggression of June 1981 against the Iraqi people were not enough and as though the arrogant annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights were a minor event. Today it is the Lebanese and Palestinian civilians who are the innocent victims of the blind violence characteristic of the policy of the Zionist State.The Security Council should have  for the cause of peace  drawn from Chapter VII of the Charter its inspiration and justification for action to induce the Government of Israel to respect the elementary rules of international law. It is high time to come to our senses  because Zionism just like apartheid and both are by their very essence generators of tension-will expose mankind to a new conflagration. Let us therefore act together to guarantee the collective security of all the nations of the world.There is no other solution for the Middle East crisis  and especially the Palestinian question  than that set forth at this very rostrum a year ago  at the 23rd meeting of the thirty-sixth session  by the head of State of Mali  who  even at that time  welcomed what was still called the Fahd plan and advocated  first  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and  secondly  recognition and guarantee of the exercise of the national rights of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the PLO  its sole authentic representative.Those proposals were reaffirmed once again by the non-aligned movement during its recent Extraordinary Ministerial Meetings. They are being increasingly accepted  even by Israel's friends  including the most fervent ones. They are the backbone of the recent plan  of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  which the Government of Mali supports.Israel's brutal rejection of those proposals is not at all surprising. This systematically rigid attitude is part of the Zionist logic based on defiance and arrogance. The leaders of the PLO  with their usual grandeur  have solemnly declared that they adhere to those realistic proposals. Israel  on the other hand  rejects any solution which might stop the massacre in the Middle East and enable all the peoples of that region to live in peace  honor and dignity. However  we must remember this: the Palestinian fighters have left Beirut but their destiny is not buried there. They left Beirut with the strong determination to impose their national identity.The repercussions of the situation in Palestine have on four occasions almost led mankind to perdition. In the face of the persistence of that danger and the imminent outbreak of even more serious conflicts  the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the convening in 1983 of an international conference on Palestine demand attention as very valuable proposals in the accomplishment of our compelling duty to restore peace to the Middle East and finally enable the Palestinian people to enjoy its inalienable right to freedom.That right to freedom is part of the whole series of rights that the Charter acknowledges for all peoples and that have been codified  particularly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But  like Israel  South Africa does not understand these principles  which have international scope  for the system which it has made into a system of administration  denies man his very existence. This unacceptable system is disturbing the harmony of international relations.In its resolution 36/172 B the General Assembly proclaimed the year 1982 the International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa. Since then  the recommendations made to that end by many political  economic and social governmental and nongovernmental organizations have taken on new meaning  on this twentieth anniversary of the arbitrary imprisonment of Nelson Mandela  whose vision of freedom is the same as that of those great men who by their courage and actions gave meaning to life.The banning of the apartheid regime from United Nations activities is only poor consolation for those who are truly committed to defending the basic rights of man and peace. Chapter VII of the Charter has a wealth of resources for isolating and destroying that hateful system of	It is that system which is preventing a just and peaceful solution to the problem of Namibia.The United Nations by legitimately assuming trusteeship over that Territory committed itself to helping the Namibian people to complete the re- conquest of its homeland. The steps taken in accordance with that commitment have been essentially of two types: the first was the recognition of SWAPO as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people  because it is the only organization which has palm in blood the price of the dignity of its homeland; the second led to the adoption by the United Nations of recommendations and decisions pertaining to the Namibian issue  including Security Council resolutions 385 and 435  adopted unanimously  which contain a plan to settle the crisis. The methods for implementing that plan were the subject of long and patient negotiations between Pretoria and  respectively  the United Nations and five Western Powers. An exceptional opportunity was thus presented to us to abide by our commitments in regard to the maintenance of international peace and security.But Pretoria remained frozen in its total lack of understanding for the requirements of peace. Each time that a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon for Namibia's accession to independence  the racist regime of South Africa snuffed it out through successive recantations-some involving fantastic allegations in regard to the partiality of the Organization  others putting the emphasis on the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. The duty incumbent upon us is to commit ourselves resolutely to correct implementation of the relevant resolutions on Namibia. The implementation of those resolutions which pertain solely to the independence of that Territory cannot have any impact on or link with commitments entered into by States bordering on South Africa  in the exercise of their sovereignty  to ensure the security of their peoples in the face of precisely the warlike incursions of South Africa.Mali's people and leaders vigorously oppose that grotesque machination  which is only a fallacious amalgam aimed at delaying the process of independence for Namibia. For Mali  the presence of Cuban forces comes within the exclusive sovereignty of Angola and cannot be an element for negotiation between South Africa and those who are fighting-that is  the heroic SWAPO combatants.The position adopted by the United Nations  to lead Namibia to independence  is based on the purposes and principles of the Charter. If it has provoked the wrath of South Africa  as was to be expected  it is even more valid.It is up to the Namibian people and to them alone to seek and apply the appropriate political formulas to guide them in carrying out their national duty. Any attempt to subject its independence to other purposes will only lead to the preservation of foreign interests.The Government of the Republic of Mali hopes that between now and the end of the current session of the General Assembly  an independent Namibia  with its territorial integrity intact  will take its rightful place in the United Nations. That independence will only be deserved  in view of the great sacrifices made by the courageous Namibian people in the defense of the ideals of the United Nations.It is on behalf of those ideals of justice  equity and peace that the Government of the Republic of Mali has committed itself to the quest for a peaceful solution to the problem of the future of the Sahraoui people. We have on several occasions set forth and analyzed here the various steps taken by Africa and the many initiatives taken by the head of State of Mali to bring about a satisfactory solution to this painful-because it is fratricidal-conflict. The question of Western Sahara  which bears the imprint of incomplete decolonization  cannot be solved without free expression by the Sahraoui people-that is to say  the exercise of true and inevitable self-determination. Africa  in its traditional wisdom  had already at the fifteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at Khartoum  recognized that to be the only solution. But it was only at the eighteenth session  at Nairobi  that unanimous agreement was reached by the parties to the conflict to the organization of a general and free referendum on self-determination.One could have thought  therefore  that the real dangers inherent in that conflict had been eliminated because the path of wisdom and realism had finally been taken by the protagonists  thanks to the vigilance and firmness of Africa. But to think that was not to understand sufficiently the demons of history. If the latest African meeting  the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly  held at Tripoli  bore the stamp of the Sahraoui equation  it is comforting to note that once again Africa showed proof there of its traditional wisdom.My country  Mali  which is honored to have constantly benefited from the confidence of Africa in all its attempts patiently to search for a solution to that delicate problem  will continue its efforts to ensure that our continent  as in the heroic epochs of resistance and struggles for independence  will in unity complete the elimination of the after-effects and last vestiges of the colonial system. That noble mission must be the concern of all African States  forced us not to forget that the OAU remains above all the symbol of anti-colonial resistance. The current crisis in our continental organization will be mastered. Eternal Africa will be able to draw from its age-old values the resources necessary to allow our unified organization to pursue its constant march towards happiness  progress and solidarity among African peoples.To live in peace means to establish and strengthen links of co-operation and tolerance of political and economic choices. That means non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the strengthening of relations of good-neighborliness. The policy of good-neighborliness recognized by the United Nations is indubitably one of the most dynamic factors for the exploitation of the enormous potential which continued progress in science and technology makes available to nations.The crossroad for several civilizations which enriched each other  the cradle of a people which linked its destiny to that of others  Mali has made good-neighborliness one of the pillars of its foreign policy  The language that it desires to speak to its neighbors is that of sincerity  tolerance and respect for the basic principles which govern the existence of States. Mali is always open to dialogue  to constructive discussions which unite people around common basic interests.That policy of positive good-neighborliness also implies active solidarity among fraternal peoples faced with temporary difficulties. That is why our country constantly pursues its efforts within the African family to safeguard the national unity and territorial integrity of Chad. Those objectives can only be achieved without any outside interference in the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign State  whose current crisis is no reason for placing it under any trusteeship.It is also on the strength of the principles I have just mentioned that we appeal to our brothers on the Horn of Africa and in Kampuchea  the Islamic Republic of Iran  Iraq  Afghanistan and Cyprus honorably to end conflicts which can only expose them further to the appetites of the forces of domination and make the fruits of the struggle for emancipation increasingly bitter as well as dangerously weaken the front that the third world has decided to form for the restoration of its human and natural resources. From Korea there does not come any glimmer of hope that would permit us to believe in the just redress of one of the errors of the last world war  which established arbitrary borders-an artificial line within a single country  all of whose people aspires profoundly to the unification of their common homeland. We hope that fraternal dialogue and fruitful co-operation will triumph so that the great Korean family will come together on the basis of the 10-point reunification plan  which is an infinite source of inspiration.As can be seen  an analysis of the international situation reminds one of the situation during the great fear of the year 1000. Today conflicts born of liberation struggles are taking on formidable dimensions. Brothers are tearing each other apart. The policy of diktat is resurfacing. The desire to impose solutions to international disputes through threats and the use of force is again common currency.Conceived and drawn up on the ruins of a monstrous war  the Charter of the United Nations was designed to open the world onto an era of reconciliation of hearts and minds. But  unfortunately  the spirit of competition continues. Nuclear experiments continue although  according to all estimates  the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons is more than capable of destroying our planet several times over.There is no agreement on the spiraling arms race  because the arguments advanced in the negotiations to restrain it are attached to concepts which tend to transform effect into cause. The initial concept can be reduced to the old adage  ""If you want peace  prepare for war"". However  people have never stopped preparing for war and have never stopped being in a state of war. Armament is seen to be a stabilizing element in international relations  whereas  on the contrary  the maintenance of such stability is conceivable only without the threat of the use of armed force. The second concept is that no disarmament is possible without the prior establishment of a climate of international confidence. Here again  the terms of the discussions on disarmament are inverted. Confidence is dissipated; it emerges through a prism whose pieces must be put together on the basis of a common agreement. Here the stumbling-block which has impeded negotiations on disarmament is again the balance of forces. Once again rhetoric has prevailed over the real will to negotiate. In an atmosphere of negotiation in which confidence does not reign or in which the stockpiling and improvement of weapons appear to be the only guarantees against widespread conflict  the basis on which the balance of strength rests is only a figment of the imagination.The arms race leads inevitably to war. Only the kind of political will that has made possible the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the International Development Strategy for the First and the Second United Nations Development Decade can lead to results in the negotiations on disarmament.The manifestation of this political will was  unfortunately  lacking during the launching of the global negotiations at the thirty-sixth session. Nevertheless  here again  the goal pursued was very close. The need for the establishment of a new international economic order was seen by all to be a demand of our times. A number of obstacles along the way were eliminated after long and patient negotiations. The consensus which enabled progress to be achieved was not maintained into the final phase of the negotiations  although these pertained only to questions of procedure.Here again  in the final phase of the negotiations  the North-South dialogue lost its raison d'etre. A group of States  thinking only of the status of their national economies  blocked the dialogue that had been begun with a view to finding concerted solutions to common problems. These problems may be rerouted  they may be subordinated to temporary concerns  but their scope and their universality can only become more compelling. They are common problems because they pertain to the interdependence of States  and they require common solutions  without which the world economic situation will only deteriorate further.An analysis of the world economic situation shows on the one hand a more marked deterioration of trade relations and on the other hand a trend towards absorbing the crisis through selfish and isolated national policies. That is the way in which I have summarized the bitter observations in the World Economic Survey  1981-1982: ""Economic expansion decelerated markedly throughout the world... The deceleration was particularly intense in the developing countries  most of which experienced a significant fall in per capita incomes"".The growth rates of the developing countries have been falling dangerously since 1978. The terms of trade have deteriorated further; export earnings have not been sufficient to ensure debt servicing  while at the same time official development assistance has become more scarce and been tied to more and more conditions. For the first time since the welcome establishment of UNDP-and we wish to praise its efforts and its merits-UNDP has had its resources reduced. The Ottawa  Cancun and Versailles economic summit meetings  as well as the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  gave rise to many hopes  which were very quickly dashed. Global negotiations  the immediate launching of which is seen every day to be an undeniable necessity  although promised  do not seem to be on the horizon.However  the industrialized countries are beginning in their turn to be affected to their very foundations by something from which they thought they were shielded  that is  an upheaval in the anachronistic world economic system. In fact we are on the eve of an implosion of the international monetary system. An increasingly large number of developing countries can no longer pay the North the interest on their numerous debts  which have reached the outrageous sum of $500 billion. Even though they transfer every year to the North the tidy sum of $50 billion to service the debts and even though the South receives annually from the North only $25 billion in the form of official development assistance  the banks of the North are still threatened with collapse. This is in no way surprising. This disturbing observation only underscores once again the degree to which the world economy is interdependent.We must above all be convinced that it is upon an improvement of the living conditions of the three quarters of the population of our world which continues to live in extreme distress that the world balance and the maintenance of international security depend. For millions of people whose average income is less than $1 a day  it takes little thought to comprehend and realize the fact that every day about 4 million times that income goes into the production of devices that could deprive them of the meagre benefits they hope to derive for their subsistence. How can we explain to them  when every day they wonder what their chances are of obtaining a small crust of bread  that the cost of a jet fighter is equivalent to that of 15 000 tons of wheat and that the cost of a bomber is equivalent to that of 30 schools or 15 hospitals? How is it possible for them to understand-and here we are referring to the statistics of the World Bank-that 800 million of them are condemned to illiteracy while sums that defy the imagination are swallowed up in the unbridled arms race?For us  the peoples of the Sahelian region  where a relentless drought prevails  where millions of people see their very survival endangered  this dangerous evolution of the world's civilization is stupefying. The international community has  of course  decided to mobilize to restore life to the Sahel. We are therefore pleased once again to thank the many States and groups of States and governmental and non-governmental international organizations that have helped us to carry out some of our projects. However  it remains true that the desert continues to advance. The drought that prevails in the Sahelian regions can no longer be attributed to temporary meteorological phenomena. It prevails as a profound and more and more widespread evil  for the combating of which  however  technical and human resources exist.A careful look at the phenomenon of drought  because of its persistence and its magnitude  shows a disturbing evolution in the ecology of our world. Yet the time is past when lightning caused man to dash for cover. The struggle to keep our environment healthy and sound so that man can flourish by applying all his creative skills  has never been closer to being won. Unfortunately  thousands of experts  and even the most competent among them  devote their intelligence to improving the war machine that is destined to destroy mankind.The rehabilitation of the world economy so as to give it new life and vigor is thus among the primary challenges we shall have to meet in the course of this decade if we are to preserve peace.The Republic of Mali  because it is determined to participate actively in the collective effort to rehabilitate the world economy  has chosen a course of development that is in keeping with the ethic of its people and with the demands of the modem international community. The building of an independent and planned national economy  in our view  is the appropriate response to the concerns of our people. Having made this choice  we are endeavoring to adapt our economic policies to meet the deepest aspirations of our population.Like our neighbors  we believe that the patient construction of regional groups and subgroups such as the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River  the West African Economic Community  the Conference of Saharan States and the Economic Community of the States of Western Africa is the only way significantly and decisively to contribute to the realization of the Lagos Plan which resulted from the important second special session of the OAU Assembly in April 19S0 devoted to a thorough consideration of economic questions of concern to the African continent. The guidelines contained in that plan  which is now an historic one  arc for Africans the only way to survive in the face of the serious economic crisis. At the thirty-sixth session  in this very Hall  President Moussa Traore spoke these words: ""Together with you  we wish to restore the confidence of our people in their creative abilities. Together with you  we wish to preserve international peace and security."" We have come here once again to reaffirm our readiness to build  together with all the States of the international community  another world  a new world commensurate with our creative genius so that universal civilization can flourish.This readiness on the part of the Republic of Mali to work for peace  justice and equity is constant. That is so because our aspirations and hopes are shared by the rest of the international community. Those hopes will exist as long as peoples are compelled to resort to weapons to defend their raison d'etre and their dignity. They will exist as long as racism and its most odious manifestation  apartheid  continue as a system of government.A world that trembles in fear of nuclear peril is not a free world  and it is even less a world of peace. People who are ill for lack of care  who are sick of being hungry will  without warning  upset the present precarious order  precarious because it is obsolete.The past year has been fraught with threats. That is why we are here in this Hall with the other members of the Assembly to clear the ground for the establishment of a more stable system of collective security.We should not be shouldering our responsibilities and we should betray the confidence of our peoples if in our actions we failed to provide concrete  pragmatic  realistic and lasting solutions for the sole raison d'etre of man: that of living in peace with himself and with his fellow man  free of fear of future misery and conflicts  in ever larger freedom."
"91",4654,"MLT",37,1982,"The recent visit of the Prime Minister of Malta to Hungary is sufficient indication of the close relations existing between our two countries  therefore it gives me all the more pleasure to compliment Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to preside over this important session. We also compliment Mr. Kittani of Iraq on his record-breaking performance last year.Our presence in the Assembly is a token of our collective commitment to the processes of peace in inter-State relations which the United Nations offers in opposition to the processes of violence and aggression which have marred human history for unsold ages. Yet  in spite of this commitment  we are all aware of the reality that once again the methods of violence and conflict are on the increase in intercourse among nations. In Asia we are disturbed by the events in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  in Africa by the continuing aggression and inhumanity of South Africa  in Latin America by the recently concluded conflict in the Falklands. In the Middle East we have still not recovered from the shock of the appalling events in Lebanon  which form a tragic climax to the escalating policy of illegality and outrage perpetrated by Israel in its relentless aggression against the Palestinian people  its annexation of occupied territories  its attack on Iraqi nuclear installations and its persistent flouting of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.The post-war world order based on the Yalta repartition of spheres of influence  with its ensuing system of armed alliances  is no longer able to maintain even its initial precarious stability. The erosion of the nuclear superiority by one super-Power  leading to nuclear parity  ushered in a state of strategic uncertainty. Together with the challenges by the emergent nations to rigid polarization around super-Power spheres of influence  this led to an increasing resort to the use of force by dominant Powers. Therefore we cannot but agree with the frank analysis of the Secretary-General  in which he points out the reforms which are still required to transform the United Nations into a world body which effectively unites nations in the pursuit of their security on the basis of peace  co-operation and mutual respect.In the absence of all-encompassing co-operation on security at the global level  nations have increasingly resorted to concrete initiatives at the regional level.In the Mediterranean  regional States have traditionally approached their security concerns in different ways. However  while most of the States of the North appear to have chosen the road of complete integration in the armed alliances and all the States of the South are active members of the non- aligned movement  the apparent division is not so rigid. There are evidently different levels of integration in the alliances by the members in the North  while States of the South have established their own links with members of the alliances-links which are based on economic  technological  cultural and historical realities.What constitutes the most pervasive destabilizing element in the Mediterranean at the present time is in fact the massive and increasing super-Power presence in the region. Detente  far from being a global phenomenon  was restricted to central Europe. In Helsinki  at the start of the process begun with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Malta had striven for the acceptance of the need to extend detente to the Mediterranean  on the basis of the principle that security in the Mediterranean is an integral element in European security. The super-Power  however  paid only lip-service to the Mediterranean document of the Helsinki Final Act. Eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation is the reality in the Mediterranean today  a reality which is even more threatening to regional and European peace and security because it creates a confrontation more direct than it has ever been in central Europe  where the military forces of the super-Power are buffered from each other by the presence of their allies.Because of the vacuum which exists at the global level through the absence of an elective role by the United Nations  super-Power influence in matters relating directly to security and co-operation in the Mediterranean has today assumed excessive proportions. All States in the region must be concerned by the extent of this influence. Many have already come to the conclusion that the only feasible alternative is for Mediterranean countries to forge together their own arrangements for regional security  which would then enable them to work out with the super-Power an agreed programme of progressive armaments reductions  phased in such way as to ensure that at no stage would either super-Power consider that its legitimate strategic interests were being put in jeopardy.Such an approach entails two fundamental objectives: first  that the Mediterranean should not be used as a major arena of global confrontation; secondly  that regional States should be more directly in control of security and co-operation questions in their own region. Although we cannot have any illusion as to the continuing impact of bloc politics on our region  we also sense an underlying appreciation of the potential validity of an indigenous regional security system  leading to the ultimate withdrawal of super-Power forces from the region.Malta's experience in its own struggle for freedom  a struggle which is rooted in a strategy for regional co-operation  corroborates this assessment. The Socialist Government which came to power in 1971 after 13 years in opposition was firmly committed to a policy aimed at the elimination of all foreign military bases on the island. The phased and bloodless withdrawal of the forces of Britain and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from the island commenced in 1972 and was completed by March 1979. My party was returned to power in 1976 it was pledged to entrench the process of the elimination of all foreign military presence in Malta by the assumption for the island of a status of neutrality  based strictly on the principles of non-alignment. We started discussions with our Mediterranean neighbours on the status we were to adopt after 1979. By 1979 those discussions were already bearing fruit. We found early encouragement and support both from our southern neighbours  in particular the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Algeria  and from our northern neighbours  including Italy and France. In the unfolding of events  our choice of a neutral status received broad recognition from Mediterranean and non- Mediterranean States alike. In different forms and under different circumstances  such broad recognition came from Qatar  Yugoslavia  Italy  Bulgaria and the European Economic Community in 1980; from Saudi Arabia  Morocco  the United States of America  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  France  Senegal  Iraq  the non-aligned movement and the Commonwealth in 1981; and from Algeria  Tunisia  Greece  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  China and the Islamic Republic of Iran so far this year.In May 1980 the Maltese Parliament formally enshrined our neutral status in a proclamation. By virtue of that proclamation  Malta undertakes not to allow any foreign military bases on its territory  not to allow any military facilities to foreign forces  not to allow any facilities to be used in Malta in such a manner or to such an extent as will constitute a virtual presence of foreign forces  nor that any foreign military personnel be allowed in Malta  and that the shipyards of Malta will be used for civil commercial purposes and will be denied to the military vessels of the super-Power. Soon after the formal adoption of our status  in September 1980 Italy entered into a bilateral agreement with us in which it welcomed  recognized and supported our neutrality and engaged itself both to avoid any action that would jeopardize that status and to come to our assistance in case of any attack on Malta. That formal commitment by a country belonging to NATO to commit itself actively in safeguarding Malta's neutrality was paralleled a few months later by an analogous undertaking by the Soviet Union in which recognition and support of our status was also accompanied by an undertaking not to do anything that would put it in jeopardy. Both agreements have been duly registered with the United Nations under Article 102 of the Charter.Following its third consecutive return to power in 1981  the socialist Government pledged to utilize Malta's new-found freedom and neutral status to promote a genuine process for peace in the Mediterranean. Several countries have not only formally recognized our neutral status  but have also explicitly acknowledged its significance for the process of peace in the Mediterranean-these include France and Greece from within the NATO alliance and the non-aligned Mediterranean States of Yugoslavia and Tunisia.In addition to its choice of neutrality  Malta had already taken other important initiatives for peace in the Mediterranean. The most comprehensive of those initiatives has been our endeavours in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to obtain recognition of the linkage between security in the Mediterranean and security in Europe  and participation by Mediterranean States in all matters relating to Mediterranean security and co-operation.By 1975 all European States  and the two super-Powers  had accepted non-participating Mediterranean States in the process of that Conference. By 1979 the Conference had launched a concrete initiative for functional co-operation in the Mediterranean. Meeting in Malta in February of that year  participants in the Conference and non-participating Mediterranean States drew up recommendations concerning the exchange of statistical data  environmental co-operation  tourism  energy resources  transport networks  telecommunications research  migrant labour  scientific and technical problems  eradication of Mediterranean diseases  gerontology  seismology  preservation of cultural heritage and a number of other subjects. In the ongoing review Session of the Conference  taking place in Madrid  our objective is now to bring about a thorough consideration of the security aspects of the Helsinki Mediterranean chapter  in particular the recommendations regarding the reduction of armed forces in the region.We have also taken initiatives outside the established bodies. As early as 1972  on the initiative of Malta's Prime Minister  Dom Mintoff  who has identified himself most intimately with the objective of enhancing Mediterranean co-operation  a process of quadripartite collaboration at the ministerial and technical levels was initiated between Italy  Libya  Malta and Tunisia. That initiative has led to the recognition of a common interest in communications  tourism  fisheries  agriculture and the preservation and protection of the environment.A more recent initiative has been the setting up of Radio Mediterranean  which Malta pioneered in 1978 under the auspices of UNESCO and which is now starting to assume its intended role as the collective and authentic voice of Mediterranean peoples. The keen interest which that initiative is awakening has recently been demonstrated by Algeria's participation and by the various approaches made by other Mediterranean States.At the multilateral level in 1975 UNEP launched a Mediterranean Action Plan  which  under the objective of environmental protection  has given scope to the emergence of a number of concrete projects of a technical and practical nature. Malta is participating in various aspects of that Action Plan  in particular through the setting up of a Regional Oil-Combating Centre on the island which is intended to coordinate regional action against hazards of oil pollution.Here at the United Nations since 1976 the resolutions on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security have included a call  sponsored by Malta and other Mediterranean States  for the transformation of the Mediterranean into a zone of peace. The growing support for that call  which now also includes members of the NATO alliance  is also manifested in the encouraging number  and substantive content  of the various replies sent to the questionnaire on the strengthening of security in the Mediterranean called for under resolution 36/102. It is clear from some of those replies  in particular the one from Yugoslavia  that Mediterranean countries are giving very serious consideration to the question of how they can themselves best take charge of security matters in their own region. We also find great significance in the fact that in its reply France has indicated that it considers its formal recognition and support of Malta's status of neutrality as a direct contribution to the process of strengthening security and co-operation in the Mediterranean. Similar interest has emerged in the various statements made during the current general debate  in particular by Italy and Algeria. It is our intention this year  in collaboration with our partners  to seek to add to the growing consensus on the question and to identify pragmatic ways of developing the initiative further. One important consideration concerns the need to keep all Member States  and especially those in the Security Council  fully informed of relevant developments in our region.Various initiatives are converging to lend further strength and credibility to the formation of a Mediterranean built upon the awareness of a commonality of interests which bind the regional States together in a process of peace and co-operation. Malta's uphill task in the mid-1970s to form a consensus for bringing together northern and southern Mediterranean States in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has in turn opened up prospects for other initiatives. Thus  Malta and other Mediterranean States  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Havana in 1979  engaged the explicit support of the non-aligned movement for the proposal that non-aligned Mediterranean States meet in Malta in 1980 with aligned Mediterranean States  participants in the European Conference  to discuss specific projects of co-operation and to co-ordinate positions for further action even in the European Conference itself.That convergence is most evident in the case of Malta's neutrality. The widespread recognition and support for Malta's status of neutrality is proving of seminal value for initiatives aimed at installing a system of regional security in the Mediterranean in which the concerns of super-Power confrontation are neither exclusive nor dominant.Through their unilateral rejection of foreign military bases on their territories  a number of Mediterranean States have set in motion a process of disarmament in the region. With the closing of foreign military bases  Malta  too  has contributed to that formation of embryo zones of peace. But this unilateral approach is not enough. In seeking support for its status of neutrality  Malta has introduced a reciprocity of commitments. At the regional level it has undertaken the commitment that its territory would never be used for armed offensives against neighbouring States  and in return obtained assurances from them that they would not threaten or violate its neutrality; at the broader level  the super-Power have accepted Malta's assurances that its territory would not be available to either of them for military purposes and in return they have assured Malta of their undertaking to respect its neutrality. If the Mediterranean is to enjoy the benefits of a system of regional security  an extension of this type of reciprocal commitment is indispensable. Only in this way would there start a process of easing of tension  reduction of polarization and limitation of armaments deployment.We are  of course  very much aware that military deployment by the super-Power in the Mediterranean is not simply a function of regional concerns  but is integrated in global strategic planning. We are equally aware that the options being taken today by some of the States in our region are supportive of the global dimension of the super-Power military presence in the Mediterranean. The current deteriorating situation is not especially propitious. Yet  we have sensed in the developments which took place in the 1970s that the potential exists for an affirmation of the collective role of Mediterranean States in the security of their own region. Our persistence at the present time arises both from the concern that any relaxation would jeopardize the progress which has already been made; as well as from the conviction that in pursuing our objectives for peace we are directly contributing to the overcoming of the current negative trend.Although conditions in the Mediterranean are ripe for progress in the pursuit of regional security and co-operation  current negative trends elsewhere are adversely affecting this region too. The Mediterranean thus challenges the super-Power with a crucial test of their willingness and capacity to respond by favouring the processes of peace as opposed to the processes of confrontation. In the light of the remarkable achievements for the Mediterranean over the past decade  a reversal here would have ominous consequences for other quarters of the globe  where stability  peace and security are precarious and threatened. Progress here  on the other hand  would give the cue for analogous initiatives to be undertaken in other regions so that peace becomes indivisible and stable. In other words  the crucial test for peace is whether Mediterranean countries and the super-Power agree on reciprocal assurances as have already been implemented in respect of a neutral Malta. The Mediterranean is ready.For Malta  the struggle against such high odds to bring about a halt to the process of confrontation in our region is in line with the historic linkage which has existed between events in our country and in the region at large. Poised in the heart of the Mediterranean  less than 200 miles from the mainlands of Europe and of Africa  Malta has for centuries been right on the dividing line between opposing and contending forces.Starting with the Roman-Carthaginian confrontation of the pre-Christian era  and running through to the regional super-Power confrontation of our day  Malta's position has always imposed critical choices of alignment and commitment. In the past  these choices were always made by the dominant Power in possession of the island. They were inevitably choices for aggression and military domination of Malta's neighbours. During this century alone  Malta has served as a forward base for major military offensives in Italy  Greece and North Africa; it served as a strategically vital position in the two world conflicts and as an important focal point of operations in the Suez crisis in the late 1950s.Without any choice of its own  Malta has therefore consistently been committed on one or another of the sides in the many conflicts and confrontations taking place in the Mediterranean region. Whenever armed aggression took place  Maltese territory fell directly under attack. The nature and extent of our defences were as much at the discretion of the foreigner as were the strategic decisions leading to the opening of hostilities and the actions and considerations leading to their resolution. The experience of the last World War  when the Maltese people in their overwhelming majority joined enthusiastically in the struggle against fascism and nazism and rejoiced in their eventual overthrow  brought with it the dear realization that in always fighting other people's wars  Malta had never yet had the opportunity to struggle for its own freedom and for peace.In the 1950s and 1960s  the time came for Malta  in common with other oppressed nations of the world  to achieve its independence. The opportunity thereby created for the island to define its role for peace in the region was  however  obstructed by British and NATO collusion that Malta should and  indeed  would continue to pursue economic  strategic  political and cultural choices strictly integrated into the Western alliance  even if that involved actions and policies divergent from the national or regional interests of a small independent island State in the heart of a troubled region.For a few years the local interests which had thrived on the colonial structures and mentality managed to retain sufficient control over the island to ensure the pursuit of a policy in strict conformity with NATO strategies. The inappropriate economic infrastructure closely supportive of a NATO role  which had been inherited from colonial times  was cosmetically restructured only to the extent that it would not interfere with that role. Control of key factors-ports  airports  telecommunications  media  banking and currency  for example-was retained  sometimes through indirect means  by the British.This continuing control served British interests in two ways. On the one hand  by reinforcing the dominance of an elite which had a weak base of local support  it ensured the continuing loyalty of that elite to the British and NATO objectives. This in turn permitted Britain to convince its NATO allies that in order to ensure that Malta remained firmly entrenched in the Western bloc  it was in their interests not to take any action to improve  at least to Western European standards  the social and economic plight of the Maltese. The Maltese people soon realized that the policies under which they were being led constituted a negation of their freedom  were inimical to their national interests and thwarted their natural vocation to serve as a focal point of peace and co-operation in the Mediterranean. Those who were claiming to maintain the island as a bulwark of democracy by aligning it irrevocably with one bloc were at the same time led into taking measures which  in their disrespect for the basic rights of the individual  constituted a serious denial of democracy.The process of Malta's struggle for freedom came to a critical point in the early 1970s when the people of the island  in anger and frustration  took a dramatic decision to halt the centuries-old military role of their own homeland. Over the last 12 years  Malta has pursued a policy in which the struggle for personal liberty  national freedom and regional peace and co-operation are intimately intertwined. We have  restructured our economic infrastructure to make it serve simultaneously the purposes of national development and regional co-operation. We have opened our economic  cultural  technological and political relations to all countries  rejecting any ideological bias in our contacts.This policy both defines and lends credibility to the status of neutrality we have assumed  not out of any escapist desire to steer an uncommitted course between the contending antagonisms in our region and beyond  but out of the fundamental awareness that the future of our nation is intimately linked with developments in our region.This policy has enabled us to demonstrate a forceful integrity in the pursuit and defence of peace. Last week's endorsement of Malta's candidacy for the Security Council in the ministerial declaration of the non-aligned movement encourages us to persevere in our policy. Whenever the occasion has required it  we have not shirked from taking the necessary frank and forthright action. It was the forceful integrity of our policies which enabled us to persevere when alone in the European forums  in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  and in the European capitals we put forward such views as the call for a Mediterranean involvement in questions of European security and the equally pressing call for a Middle East solution based on recognition of the Palestinians' right to an independent State of their own. Today  when these views are finding increased support  we can look back on our earlier efforts with a dense of pride  satisfaction and encouragement for the future.This same spirit motivated us in the early 1970s to be equally firm in our negotiations with Britain over the arrangements to phase out their military presence on our territory. We then faced a massed opposition based on prejudice  misconception and vested interests both from within and beyond our shores. Gradually  however  we persuaded our opponents of the integrity and peaceful nature of our objectives.Yet following the final departure of British troops from the island  we again had to face the arrogant attitudes of our erstwhile colonial ruler in connection with the question of the clearing from areas around Malta of war remnants left over from the colonial period which are seriously obstructing some of our major development projects.One particular case  concerning the removal of war remnants  is causing serious problems to our development programme. My Government's development plan calls for the setting up in Malta of a major coal and grain trans-shipment centre in the Mediterranean. A prerequisite for the success of this project is a sufficient draught to enable ships requiring an under-keel clearance of over 14 metres to enter and navigate in the Grand Harbour of Valletta without any problem. Nature has blessed Valletta Harbour with a sufficiently large draught to handle such ships  but the presence of war wrecks in various parts of the harbour and  in particular  at its entrance  has reduced the clearance to 12.6 metres  so that the trans-shipment project cannot materialize unless those wrecks are removed.For the past several years my Government has been trying to reach an amicable solution with Britain on this subject but  in spite of the universally accepted principle that the removal of remnants of war is the responsibility of the country that implanted them  Britain has consistently refused to accept any legal or moral responsibility. Indeed  Britain is making its repeated disclaimer of any legal or moral responsibility whatsoever a pre-condition of any talks with my Government. From this rostrum I repeat the offer which my Government has already made to the British Government of talks without pre-conditions. A satisfactory solution would also obviate the need for us to raise this issue in all appropriate international forums-something which we are otherwise determined to persist in.Our experience teaches that the struggle by a people to achieve dignity and freedom is itself part of the process in the endeavor for regional and global peace and security. For the Palestinian people the road to dignity and freedom is proving particularly tragic  as the recent events in Lebanon have shown. These events have not broken the spirit of the Palestinian people in continuing their struggle but the opportunities for a peaceful solution  which under the leadership of the PLO were genuinely being sought  have been dealt a severe blow. The Israeli actions have deliberately placed a policy of aggression right in the path of the road to peace; in the process they have inflicted unbelievable suffering  and they have torn a country apart.The threat to the peace and stability of the Middle East and the Mediterranean which arises out of the Palestinian and. Lebanese tragedies constitutes a direct threat to peace and stability even outside the region. European nations should play a major role to help bring about a solution which both respects the inalienable rights of the Palestinians and at the same time safeguards other legitimate interests in the region. Malta is proud of the role it has played in supporting the Palestinian cause and pledges to continue steadfastly in this course.The actions of South Africa  its internal policies of racism and oppression and its external policies of aggression and domination constitute yet another threat to international peace and stability. The cry of anger  frustration and suffering emerging from southern Africa is urgent and persuasive. It calls for urgent and effective remedies.The aspiration of the people of Korea to the peaceful unification of their country continues to be frustrated. The presence of foreign troops in South Korea and the size and strategic objectives of this presence run directly counter to the already expressed desire of all Korean people to seek a peaceful road to the reunification of their country.Similarly  in Cyprus the illegal presence of foreign troops stands in the way of an already defined basis for a peaceful solution which would ensure the sovereignty  unity  territorial integrity and independence of that island.The people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea also find the internal evolution of their societies interfered with and distorted by the interplay of outside interests. The departure of foreign troops from these countries remains a necessary pre-condition of the recovery by their peoples of their sovereignty and independence.For over two years now the imperatives of peace have not prevailed between the Iranian and Iraqi peoples. We continue to believe that the possibilities exist for a peaceful solution to their problems and that no means whatsoever should be spared to achieve this end.In the Falkland Islands the resort to force was a tragic outcome of the failure to use the processes of consultation and negotiation recommended by the United Nations. We hope to see wiser counsels prevail in the future.In these and other instances  policies of aggression and force clearly continue to play their dominant role in the relations among nations. The yearning for peace  so urgent and pervasive in the hearts and minds of peoples throughout the world  has not yet been translated into the actions and policies of nations. And yet the mechanisms for peace exist  here at the United Nations  through regional concertation and through national initiatives. We need to muster the courage and tenacity to make a thrust for peace before the increasing resort to force overwhelms us completely and leads us to an irreversible catastrophe. Malta remains deeply committed to this endeavour."
"92",4700,"MMR",37,1982,"It is my privilege to extend to Mr. Hollai the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on his unanimous election to his high office and to assure him of our support and co-operation in the discharge of his responsibilities. We are most fortunate in having the advantage of his wisdom and expended  and we are confident that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly with the tenacity and resourcefulness which the numerous tasks before us require. Next we wish to express our deep appreciation to the former President  Mr.  Kittani  for the distinguished manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session of the Assembly and his vigorous efforts to bring it to a successful conclusion.165.	The international climate in which the Assembly is meeting is rife with tensions and acute world problems. From whatever angle the present world situation is viewed  there is no denying that we are facing a time of serious upheavals in almost all spheres of international relations. The disconcerting features are evident in the political overtones of the declining trend and the rising tensions in great-Power relations; in the economic overtones of a deepening world recession  with conflicting interests ensuing among nations in racial cleavage and the revival of old historical quarrels in regional relationships; and the increasing acts of terrorism afflicting human life and international order. Taken together  these adverse manifestations potentially endanger international peace  stability and security.166.	The bewildering complexity of issues burdening the world of today are mirrored in the variety of agenda items to which the Assembly will direct itself. Some of the most important issues have been with us for many years and have become aggravated with the passage of time. The United Nations today faces far more intractable challenges than could ever have been foreseen at the time of its founding. The concomitant increase in the number of conferences•  bodies and institutions is also straining the human and financial capacity of the Organization. The dilemma besetting the Assembly is how to reconcile the ever widening scope of activities and responses demanded of the Organization with an annual budget that must be kept within the financial limits of what the membership as a whole can reasonably be expected to accept and to bear.167. The delegation of Burma does not propose to dwell at length on the host of issues before the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session. We shall focus our attention on the principal political and economic questions which we consider to be the current realities of the highly difficult and dangerous world situation in which we live.168. The international quest for disarmament is still an unfulfilled aspiration of the world community. Paradoxically  while there is now a swelling international drive for disarmament  the arms race has surged ahead on a scale unknown before  increasing the already enormous outlays for destructive purposes. Whatever the circumstances  the crucial problem of how to bring about disarmament remains. To our understanding  there are only two ways of achieving disarmament-by mutual agreement or by unilateral action. But the present policy of positions of strength and its reliance on superior destructive power as the ultimate deciding factor constitutes a psychological road-block to both processes. We say this because if one adversary decides to arm heavily the other will invariably do likewise. Thus weapons themselves add to fear and mistrust and become the greatest obstacle to any headway on disarmament and arms control.169.	All  this leads one  to conclude  that there  are dim prospects of success for agreement unless a suit-able atmosphere of confidence and trust can be nurtured to bring about enough mutual understanding to enable both sides to make the requisite concessions and compromises.170. The central arms-control doctrine being exercised today is that of stabilized nuclear deterrence  where each side refrains from attack for fear of mutual annihilation. Deterrence has its use thus far prevented the outbreak of another world war. However  stabilized deterrence will not stop the arms race. Mutual effort to maintain deterrence leads to a steady spread of nuclear weapons. International tension and fear remain high without the prospect of disarmament.171. Clearly  this is not compatible with the universal view that there is an urgent need to find a solution to the dilemma of nuclear weapons. Unless things take a more sensible turn  it seems that man is doomed to live in harrowing uncertainty as to what the future will bring. Thus  the status quo is not only not good enough. it cannot in fact endure  for the human system cannot for long put up with the persistent  constant pressure which the status quo imposes upon it.172. It is self-evident to all that no one can expect to win the arms race. As we see it  the only sensible recourse for those engaged in that perilous venture is to call for a halt and decide to agree on a sequence of processes leading to reduction of their nuclear arsenals. In order to mitigate the danger of a nuclear war erupting  either by miscalculation or by accident. we hope that the two leading nuclear Powers will sustain the recent resumption of their bilateral con(acts on strategic nuclear arms and assert sufficient political wi1l to ensure the success of their discussions. Divergences may be very sharp at present  but there can be no progress anywhere on the arms control front until the two leading nuclear Powers agree on what to do about their strategic arms.173. As rapidly as the situation permits  those bearing the main responsibility for the arms race must begin the critical transition from deterrence to disarmament  for it soon may be beyond the reach of efforts to initiate the process. The main ground for advocating this is that  ultimately  it offers the only hope of the continuance of human survival.174.	Developments in the Middle East this year took a dramatic turn for the worse. Tension sharpened and escalated fighting led to direct military intervention in Lebanon. The policy and practice of sending a punitive expedition of such formidable strength can only be deplored. The action constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and is yet another example of the use and abuse of force. It is abundantly clear that such actions are completely at variance with the norms of conduct in international relations and cannot augur well for the future. The position of the delegation of Burma remains one of serious concern.175.	Nobody who has followed the situation in Lebanon could fail to be shaken by the remorseless violence  the heavy toll in human lives and the suffering that resulted from the recent conflict in that country. The general contours of the Middle East situation may have changed somewhat  but that does not alter the fact that there is an urgent need for an overall settlement in the region. It is equally clear that the prospects for peace in the Middle East are not likely to become brighter until the Palestinian question is resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned. It accounts for virtually all the problems of the Middle East and will remain a weight on the world's con-science.176.	At this point  I should like to reiterate the support of the delegation of Burma for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries and for the full implementation of all Security Council resolutions in that regard.177.	As we see it  the two problems-that of the Middle East and that of Palestine-are inextricably intertwined. Consequently  any search for a political settlement must necessarily encompass both questions  rather than dealing with one to the neglect of the other. This means that only the method of seeking a comprehensive solution with the full association of all interested parties can lead to the possibility of achieving a durable peace in the Middle East.178.	The Assembly has been struggling with the Middle East and Palestinian questions for many  many years. The main obstacle to the resolution of the many issues involved is the extreme antagonism of the parties concerned and the refusal of either party-Israel or the Palestinians-to recognize each other's existence and to acknowledge the mutual right to statehood. This is making very difficult any constructive and fruitful negotiations towards a solution that would be in the interest of all parties concerned  for lasting peace in the Middle East. The positions of the parties to the conflict being what they are at present-implacable hostility on the one side and impetuous belligerence on the other there are few signs of any willingness by either side to be the first to break the impasse. We take the view that there is no option but for the parties to coexist. That cannot happen without a change of heart on the part of all those at present involved.179.	The delegation of Burma does not under-estimate the highly emotional and complex political questions of the Middle East. None the less  we are of the view that this long-standing conflict cannot be settled by force  but only by negotiations. Realism demands that the parties to the conflict learn to put up with each other  for there is no other way to make relations more humane  more peaceful and more secure. The road of negotiations may be a long and tedious one. Given the will  however  there is no problem in the world  no matter how intractable  which cannot be solved by negotiations and without loss of honour by either side.180.	The world community became seized of the issues of Kampuchea and Afghanistan at the beginning of the 1980s. The unresolved situations in both countries continue to undermine the development of good-neighbourly and co-operative relations in their respective re2ions.181.	The delegation of Burma has had occasion at previous sessions of the General Assembly to voice its regret and deep concern over the occurrence of armed intervention  which obviously cannot be justified or condoned  in both situations. Our approach to both situations and to their solution is based on our firm and consistent support for the principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations  which upholds in unequivocal terms respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of States as cardinal principles to be scrupulously observed in international relations among States. The Charter outlaws the threat or use of force in inter-national relations in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. It strictly enjoins all States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from intervening in any manner whatsoever in matters within the juris-diction of any State.182.	Burma believes that only scrupulous respect for those principles by all States  both in word and deed  would make it possible to promote the progressive establishment of and universal respect for the rule of law.183.	Any violation of those principles  directly or indirectly  in whatever guise or under whatever pretext  deals a grievous blow to mankind's hope for a peaceful and just world order. By the same token  whenever and wherever a Power-big or small-resorts to armed force in contravention of those principles  the inevitable result is their serious weakening and erosion  creating conditions with far-reaching implications which are of concern to all countries everywhere.184. It was in this spirit that the delegation of Burma gave its support to the resolutions of the General Assembly which called for the withdrawal 'or' 'all foreign troops from Kampuchea and Afghanistan and for"" strict observance by outside Powers of the principles of non-interference and non-intervention. All those conditions are necessary to enable the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan freely to exercise their will and determine their own destiny.185.	As the internal and external circumstances in Kampuchea and Afghanistan develop  we hope that the leaders of those countries will be able to master their conflicts and to find a peaceful way to a political solution and national reconciliation.186.	The  independence  of  Namibia  envisaged  in Security Council resolution .435 .(1978)  is long over-due. Since the United Nations plan embodied in the resolution had the acceptance  in principle  of all parties to the dispute  we believed that Namibia's struggle for freedom had entered its final stage. But over the following years the pathway to Namibia's independence meandered between hope and frustration  the principal obstacle being South Africa's attitude of intransigence. Meanwhile  South Africa's escalation of military activities against the front-line States has only added to the political impasse and the worsening situation in southern Africa. The latest reports on continuing efforts at negotiations indicate that there are somewhat improved prospects for a Namibian settlement. We hope that that improvement will continue and not break down as in the past. Until a definite date is fixed for the implementationof resolution 435 (1978) the outlook for Namibia's independence will continue to remain highly uncertain.181. The delegation of Burma reaffirms its support for the Namibian people's inalienable right to freedom  independence and territorial integrity  including Walvls Bay  under the leadership of SWAPO. We look for-ward to the implementation at the earliest opportunity of the United Nations plan granting Namibian independence.188. We welcome the adoption by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law• of the Sea of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea6 which establishes an international regime on an aspects of the uses of the sea. The major portion of the rules have long been applied in practice as norms of customary law and have acquired full validity with the new Convention. It is a package arrived at by carefully balanced and painful compromises  over nine years of hard work and highly complex negotiations  in order to achieve wide acceptance. To allow it to go overboard would mean that no order would prevail on the seas and that a universally acceptable modification would never again be attainable.189. International relations as a whole are exacerbated as a result of the prolonged crisis in the world economy. The forecasts made by the primary financial and trade organizations of the world are not at all encouraging. They foretell an ever widening gap between rich and poor nations resulting from the slackening of economic growth  lessening cash aid flows for development  declining world trade resulting from protectionism  and prolonged monetary instability. Both inflation and unemployment have become priority issues to be grappled with before the world can be pulled out of the present crisis. In facing up the situation the best intentions and the most dedicated efforts of us can be frustrated if we do not succeed in overcoming these economic setbacks afflicting the world economy.190. The consequences of the disarray"" in the World economy are being felt in all sectors of international economic life. No country is immune from their disruptive effects. The impact upon the developed countries has taken the form of slower growth  widening payments deficits and rising inflation and unemployment rates. These countries are tending increasingly to solve their problems by way of protectionism  reducing their payments deficits and tightening money policies to arrest inflation. We would hope that  in putting their economies in order  the developed countries would d\l so with as little harm to the developing countries as possible. .191.	Apart from encountering the same problems  the developing countries are  faced with worsening terms of trade  declining demand for primary commodities and mounting debt burdens caused by rising interest rates.192.	All of this indicates that there is a complex interplay of economic forces influencing both developed and developing countries. The conclusion would be that the problems of the world economy and of the international economic relations are common problems which require joint action by developed and developing countries. Clearly  the situation calls for an untiring effort to work out a basis of co-operation. Reconciling the conflicting needs and desires of the minority  developed countries  and the majority  developing countries  will also call for much tolerance and good will. As we see it  there is no other way. In the con-temporary world economic development has become a matter for international co-operation and this requires a meeting of minds between countries in all stages of development.193. Another requirement is that of solvil1g certain structural discrepancies in the world economy. so that it can result in a more rational and equitable economic system than the present one. It is a path we had hoped could be begun with the launching of global negotiations  to put relations between developed and developing countries on anew  constructive foundation that would be realistic  equitable and lasting. That this has not yet taken place is a matter of consider-able disappointment for the developing world. Such a process could only begin if all sides could be influenced to adopt a less rigid attitude and to come together in a spirit of mutual need and mutual responsibility.194. The delegation of Burma believes that the path of confrontation) or negotiations rooted in any adversary psychosis  cannot lead us out of the present uncertainty and impasse. Statesmanship of the highest order  good will  reasonableness;"" and  above •an.  realism on all sides are required for the building of bridges towards global negotiations. The world's economic problems are of a structural nature and can  therefore  only be resolved within the entirety of international economic relations.195. We make these comments simply by way of emphasizing what seem to us to be the salient features of the current world situation and its problems. There is no doubt that international relations in their-entirety are in deep crisis."" We express the hope that this session will prove fruitful and will signify an important step towards forward movement on many of the issues which have been at a standstill. The bounden duty of us all is to meet this challenge."
"93",4757,"MNG",37,1982,"Mr. President  I take special pleasure in congratulating you  the representative of fraternal Hungary  on your election to the presidency at this thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to this high post is an expression of the general recognition of the international authority and prestige of socialist Hungary and its peace loving foreign policy. At the same time it is a tribute to your outstanding personal qualities. On behalf of the Mongolian delegation  I wish you every success in the discharge of your responsible mission. Your great experience in international affairs  and especially in United Nations circles  will no doubt serve as a valuable factor in the successful completion of this session. At this thirty seventh session the Assembly faces the urgent tasks of lessening international tension and reducing the threat of nuclear war. The world situation has acutely deteriorated as a result of adventurist actions of the most aggressive circles of imperialism  which have set their narrow selfish aims against the onward march of history. In particular  the military industrial complex of the United States of America is seeking to impose the domination of American imperialism over the whole world and to establish everywhere an order solely to its liking. The arms race is being intensified on an unprecedented scale with a view to upsetting the existing military and strategic balance to the detriment of the interests of universal peace and security. Designs are being nurtured for waging limited or protracted nuclear wars. Detente and the principles of peaceful coexistence are being renounced outright. Force and sanctions have become the principal instruments of foreign policy. Attempts are being made to undermine the very fabric of international relations. Resort to blackmail  deceit and hypocrisy have become all too common. Rhetorical statements about peace and stability camouflage the actions taken to destabilize the situation in various regions  to sow distrust and enmity among peoples and States. Under the pretext of safeguarding vital interests and national security  blatant interference in the internal affairs of States  as well as acts of aggression and even genocide by proxies  are being perpetrated. I should like to note here that such tricks are also practised by certain circles on our Asian continent. In order to conceal their expansionist ambitions  some offer assurances that their country would never become a super Power. In order to divert the attention of the public from their own country’s increasing military potential and from its reviving militarism  others assert that their country would never become a military Power. The rewriting of textbooks and historical documents in order to whitewash the past criminal acts of the militarists is another case in point. But the main thing is that the militaristic circles of imperialism are covering up their attempts to strike at the socialist community by coarse slander directed against the peaceful nature of the socialist system. The clamour about the nonexistent Soviet military threat is designed to justify the organization of a crusade against the real socialism. History knows such tactics. Immediately after the victory of the October Revolution  an armed intervention of 14 capitalist States under the slogan of fight against the communist threat was launched against the young Soviet Republic. And nowadays attempts to undermine the very foundations of the socialist system in the countries of socialism are not abandoned  which is evidenced by the aggressive intrigues against the Polish People’s Republic and the Republic of Cuba. But socialism has withstood imperialist assaults and invasions and has now become so strong as to exert a decisive influence on world events and to serve as a stronghold of peace  national independence and the social progress of nations. This is an historic gain of lasting importance for the future of mankind. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  which celebrates its sixtieth anniversary this year  is thebulwark of all the peace loving  democratic and revolutionary forces. The peace loving policy and constructive initiative of the socialist community have a favourable and stabilizing impact on the world situation and actively promote United Nations activities for the maintenance of peace and international cooperation. Here I should like to note also the influential role played by the nonaligned movement in consolidating peace and security and in restructuring international relations on an anti imperialist and anti colonialist basis. We give due credit also to the realistic approach of sober minded statesmen in Western countries who stand for the maintenance and development of mutually beneficial relations between East and West and for the preservation and strengthening of detente. The intensified mass antiwar movement in the world is an important factor that promotes the objectives of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. Meanwhile the following striking example reveals the attitude of major imperialist Powers these objectives of the United Nations. At the very moment that the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament was under way in 1978 here in New York  a long term programme of an arms buildup by NATO was adopted nearby in Washington. And this year that programme was again reaffirmed in Bonn  at the highest level of the NATO alliance  during the second special session devoted to disarmament. The peace programme for the 1980s put forward by the Soviet Union and the constructive initiatives of socialist countries envisage practical measures to curb the arms race and to remove the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Under the present circumstances  the extremely far reaching and bold step of the Soviet Union is the obligation  unilaterally assumed by the Soviet Union at the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. We believe that at the present session the Assembly should call upon other nuclear Powers to do likewise. We consider that the new proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation at this session rightly supplements the aforementioned initiative of historic significance. The proposal and the relevant document on the immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear weapon tests seeks to speed up the stagnant negotiations in this field. The new draft of basic provisions of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests constructively reflects the views and observations of other States on this matter  in the verification issues  and thus undoubtedly improves the chances for a positive outcome of negotiations. The proposal to set a moratorium on any nuclear explosions  starting from an agreed date until the treaty is concluded  can create favourable conditions for achieving this vital goal. The same goal is then pursued by the Soviet Union  which clearly expressed its readiness to ratify at any time  on a reciprocal basis  the Soviet United States treaties on the limitation of underground nuclear weapon tests and on nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes  as well as to resume tripartite negotiations. This position of the Soviet Union is in glaring contrast to the recent decision of the United States Administration not to resume tripartite negotiations  which has given rise to concern in the world community. The carrying out of a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests is of special significance in putting an end to the technological arms race  preventing the production of new types of nuclear weapons  including neutron weapons. The Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic regards as timely and important the new initiative of the Soviet Union on intensification of efforts to remove the threat of nuclear war and ensure the safe development of nuclear energy. It is essential to block firmly a new channel which could result in incidents of nuclear catastrophe. The General Assembly  in the spirit of its Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe  should  as proposed by theSoviet Union  declare the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities  even by means of conventional weapons  to be equivalent to an attack carried out with the use of nuclear weapons. Such an action  as we know  would be termed a crime against humanity. The talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms  as well as medium range nuclear missiles in Europe  are of decisive significance as regards a wide range of disarmament problems. Those talks  which concern the very core of the global strategic situation  will be successful provided that the two parties strictly observe the principle of equality and equal security. Attempts to evade that principle in particular  manoeuvres such as the zero option are the main obstacle to reaching mutually acceptable agreements. The problem of the elimination of chemical weapons has of late become especially acute. It stems from the decision adopted by Washington to accelerate the development and manufacture of new types of this barbaric weapon including binary weapons. The Mongolian People’s Republic is in favour of intensifying the efforts of the Committee on Disarmament so as to complete the elaboration of an international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Actions aimed at spreading the arms race to outer space are becoming more and more ominous. The Mongolian People’s Republic is endeavouring in every way possible to bring about an early start of the work of the Committee on Disarmament on the elaboration of the text of an international treaty on the prohibition of the deployment of weapons of any kind in outer space. Among the measures for strengthening universal peace and security  the Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic attaches great significance to the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces; Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The achievement of positive results in those talks would have a favourable effect on the improvement of relations between East and West and on the international situation as a whole. A realistic approach is required of the Western partners to the constructive proposals of the socialist countries so as to pave the way for achieving progress in this field. The same stand is taken by the Mongolian People’s Republic in its approach to the Madrid meeting of the participants in the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe which was held at Helsinki in 1975. My Government commends the efforts by the neutral and nonaligned States taking part in the meeting that are aimed at working out a generally acceptable final document. It hopes that the meeting will succeed in adopting a decision to convene a conference on confidence building measures and disarmament in Europe and taking other towards consolidating the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act. My delegation believes that a settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the relevant United Nations decisions and the principles of respect for the national independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus is of great importance for the cause of peace and stability in Europe. In Asia the largest number of hotbeds of tension and armed conflicts continue to exist. Developments: the Middle East during the past several months prove that a delay in the settlement of so called local conflicts is fraught with dangerous consequences for the cause of universal peace. The armed aggression against Lebanon and the massacre in west Beirut are the direct aftermath of the Camp David deal and of the so called United States Israeli strategic cooperation. The Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic in its statement of 22 September this year resolutely condemned Israel’s acts of aggression and genocide in Lebanon and stated anew that the responsibility for the atrocities must be borne by Tel Aviv and its United States patrons. The Mongolian People’s Republic demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and from all occupied Arab territories. The Mongolian Copies Republic  like the overwhelming majority of States  advocates a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the PLO the legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine on the basis of ensuring its right to create a national State of its own. Therefore my Government supports the proposal made by the Soviet Union on 15 September this year  which takes into account the latest developments in the Middle East. The Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic regards as positive the declaration of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  and regards it as a basis which would contribute to uniting the Arab world in the interest of settling the Middle East problem. For many years the situation in South East Asia has remained highly tense. The reason for that  we strongly believe  lies in the policy and practices of the imperialisms and their accomplices  who  in pursuance of their so called parallel strategic interests  seek to alter which emerged in Indo China as a result of the triumphant struggle of the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea against imperialist aggression. At the same time attempts are being made to incite the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations to engage in confrontation against the three countries of Indo China and to have ASEAN transformed into a military political bloc. Quite recently a new manoeuvre concerning Kampuchea was undertaken. A so calted coalition Government of nonexistent Democratic Kampuchea was knocked together and serves as a camouflage for attempts to revive the Pol Pot regime  on whose conscience lies bloody genocide against its own people. This is a new machination not only against the peoples of Indo China but also against peace and security in South East Asia as a whole. The Mongolian People’s Republic firmly believes that all the problems of South East Asia should be resolved by the States of that region themselves  through constructive dialogue and without any outside interference. The initiatives taken by Viet Nam  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea in July of this year at the conference held in Ho Chi Minh City are constructive and directed to that end. Those proposals and steps demonstrating good will are conducive to the creation of a spirit of mutual trust and of favourable conditions for strengthening peace and security in the region and for developing good neighborly relations and peaceful cooperation between the countries of Indo China and those of ASEAN. The Mongolian People’s Republic has consistently supported the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of its country  and for the withdrawal of United States troops and nuclear facilities from South Korea. At present the situation in Asia is being aggravated still further by the fact that the expansionist and militarist circles of certain major Powers of that continent are being drawn more and more into the orbit of United States military and political strategy. That calls for the active involvement of Asian States in the struggle for strengthening peace and security on that continent. My delegation notes with satisfaction that a number of Asian countries are advancing constructive ideas and proposals. The proposal made on 24 August 1981 by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan points the way to the solution of the situation which has arisen around Afghanistan on the basis of respect for the sovereignty  independence and democratic achievements of the Afghan people. In that context the Mongolian People’s Republic welcomed the meetings between the representatives of Afghanistan and Pakistan  held through the good offices of the Secretary General. Against the background of the present situation in the Far East  the proposal made by the Soviet Union concerning the drafting and implementation of confidence building measures in that region is of great importance. The proposal made by the Govern ment of the Mongolian People’s Republic on the conclusion of a convention on mutual nonaggression and nonuse of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific is in keeping with this and other initiatives. The very purpose of our initiative is to proscribe the use of force in interState relations  which would strengthen mutual understanding and trust in order that all disputes can be settled by peaceful means alone. We consider that dialogue and negotiations constitute the only reasonable way to solve problems of peace and the security of States. I should like to stress here that the Mongolian proposal is not a mere repetition of the obligation not to use force undertaken by States in accordance with the Charter. It has as its aim the realistic implementation of that principle  with due regard for the multifaceted practices and the specific features of interState relations in Asia. In spite of some assertions  the existence of many unresolved problems in Asia proves that our proposal is timely. It is clear that efforts for the peaceful resolution of conflict situations between individual States or in different regions specifically require the adoption of measures to exclude the use of force. We in the Mongolian; People’s Republic hope that the efforts of the representatives of nonaligned States  which deserve encouragement and support will bring about a peaceful securement of the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran and create conditions for the establishment of peaceful relations in that important part of western Asia. Naturally  we realize that the implementation of cur initiative will require time and painstaking efforts. My delegation  on behalf of the Mongolian Government  wishes to express its gratitude to all Governments which support our initiative. The Mongolian People’s Republic has consistently supported the efforts of nonaligned countries to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  and we favour the convening of an international conference on this issue in 1983. We consider as timely the appeal to refrain from any steps likely to complicate the situation in that region. A danger to international peace is posed by remnants of colonialism and by the neocolonialist intrigues of imperialist forces. The racist Pretoria regime  relying on the support of imperialist circles  is seeking to perpetuate in one way or another its domination in Namibia  and it systematically commits acts of aggression against neighboring countries. In our view  the Assembly at this session should once again speak out in favour of the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. Like other countries  the Mongolian People’s Republic is in favour of the immediate granting of independence to the people of Namibia through its legitimate representative  SWAPO  on the basis of United Nations resolutions. There should be no artificial conditions or linkages. In that connection  the Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic most emphatically condemns Pretoria’s aggressive intrigues against the People’s Republic of Angola  Mozambique and other frontline States. The events in the South Atlantic have vividly demonstrated the danger posed to peace by the continued existence of any colonial possessions  even the smallest and remotest. At the same time  those events emphasized the urgent need to complete the process of decolonization. My delegation considers that the problem of the Malvinas Islands should be solved only through negotiations and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions on the decolonization of that Territory. The Mongolian People’s Republic supports the granting of independence to Puerto Rico. Moreover  it is opposed to making Micronesia a colonial possession. The Mongolian people condemns the growing intrigues against revolutionary Nicaragua and the patriotic forces of El Salvador. Imperialism’s neocolonialist strategy assigns an important place to attempts at splitting the OAU  which plays an important role in the struggle for peace  freedom and independence on the African continent. The Mongolian delegation expresses the hope that the Tripoli declaration of 8 August 1982 will promote the cause of consolidating the ranks of the OAU. The pernicious effects of neo colonialism are clearly shown in the economic policies of imperialist Powers towards developing countries. Economic relations between imperialist Powers on the one hand and developing countries on the other are characterized by exploitation and plundering of the latter. That is the main reason for the constant deterioration of the social and economic situation in newly liberated States. The leading Western Powers disregard the just demands of developing countries for a restructuring of international economic relations  and they are preventing the implementation of progressive provisions of such important United Nations documents as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order	The Mongolian People’s Republic is in favour of the democratic reshaping of international economic relations and of economic decolonization. The Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic condemns the attempts of imperialist Powers to use trade and other forms of economic ties as instruments of their aggressive policy. Such a course undermines the very foundation of international economic cooperation and results in increasing tension in the world. My delegation believes that the comprehensive United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea meets the interests of all countries and can contribute significantly to the cause of strengthening peaceful cooperation among States in the vast space of the world’s oceans. The Mongolian People’s Republic advocates the signing of the Convention by all States and its speedy entry into force. We resolutely reject any actions and deals directed towards arbitrary utilization of the world’s oceans and their resources in evasion or in violation of the provisions of that Convention. In conclusion  the Mongolian delegation wishes to emphasize once again the urgent need to adopt measures on the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security enhancing the effectiveness of the principle of renunciation of the use of force or the threat of its use in international relations. In the same spirit the Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic reiterates its stand in favour of stimulating the activities of the United Nations and its principal organ the Security Council  which bears the main responsibility for the maintenance of collective security on the basis of strict observance of the provisions of the Charter. My delegation will be guided by this policy in its participation in the work of the present session."
"94",4799,"MOZ",37,1982,"Sir  it is with great satisfaction that we see the post of President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly occupied by the representative of a friendly people with great historical traditions of struggle for freedom  peace and progress. The Hungarian people succeeded in preserving their dignity and personality for all time by heroically resisting Hitler's fascism and building a socialist fatherland free from foreign domination. Strong ties of friendship and solidarity forged during our armed struggle for national liberation from colonialism bind our two countries. After the proclamation of our independence  these ties took on a new dimension and scope  extending to multidisciplinary cooperation  the basis of which is the defense and pursuit of the fundamental interests of our peoples and Governments and building and defending socialism. In expressing our firm guarantee of close cooperation in the fulfilment of the weighty responsibilities that have been entrusted to you  my delegation joins previous speakers in warmly welcoming you and congratulating you on your unanimous election. We wish also to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the skilful and intelligent manner in which he conducted the work of the last regular session of the General Assembly. This was no easy task considering the grave crisis existing at the time in international relations  in which dialogue and mutual trust among nations gave way to cold war language  threats  aggression and intimidation. We extend our greetings to the Secretary General  whose action in defense of the Charter of the United Nations and in the endeavor to find peaceful solutions to world problems at the most critical times is deserving of the respect and confidence that the international community extended to him when it elected him one year ago. The disdain in which the United Nations is held as a privileged forum for discussion and for the search for peaceful solutions to international conflicts is expressed in the constant violation of the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter. The overwhelming majority of the speakers at this session have denounced the aggravation of the already critical situation prevailing in all parts of the world. There is an atmosphere of insecurity and latent warfare  which seems likely to lead to a holocaust. As if the already existing hotbeds of tension were not enough  we are witnessing the outbreak of new hotbeds and the emboldening of localized conflicts. This situation forces peoples to divert their human and material resources from the solution of problems inherent in underdevelopment  such as hunger  homelessness  illiteracy and disease  in order to concentrate on the defense of their sovereignty and on the fight to achieve and preserve their freedom. To the obstinate refusal to acknowledge the right of peoples to self determination  the peoples respond with the resolution to die rather than live in slavery. Harmonious relations and cooperation among nations require the creation of a climate of peace and security in the world and absolute respect for the fundamental right of peoples to self determination and independence. It was the ideals of peace  justice and liberty that inspired the people of Mozambique. When we took up arms against colonialism in Mozambique we fought to eliminate the causes of war in our county; we were moved by the noble aspiration to establish  with all the peoples of the world good and just relations founded on sovereign equality and mutual respect. This is a just aspiration for which all the peoples of the world  in which inequities and imbalances are increasingly felt  are prepared to fight. With the achievement of our national independence we established the conditions for the expression and development of our culture and our personality  which had been trampled upon and inhibited during the centuries of exploitation and domination. But the scope of our ideals was not circumscribed by the liberation of our territory alone. We were forced  shortly after independence  to wage another war  imposed upon us by Smith's racist regime.A/37/PV.26In expressing solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe in their just struggle  Mozambique was contributing to the elimination of one of the causes of war and instability in our area. The independence of Zimbabwe made it possible for a climate of relative peace to be restored  which enabled broad perspectives to be opened up for our economic development and stimulated cooperation among the countries of southern Africa. Since then it has become possible for us to concentrate our attention on the search for solutions to the numerous problems facing our people. Our objective is to promote the material and social wellbeing of all the people in Mozambique  who were denied this throughout the entire period of the domination of their country. The relative peace that we achieved was of short duration. In defining and using an illegal minority racist  regime as their principal ally in the area  the imperialist forces consciously  wilfully and impudently gave Pretoria the moral strength which  more than any technical or technological means  allows it to provoke war and occupy parts of the territory of Angola  a sovereign State  spreading death and destruction to all the front line States. This is a deliberate action which is typical of heir redoubled aggressiveness  the basis of which is the refusal of the imperialists to recognize the right of peoples to independence  freedom and peaceful and harmonious development: the face of the qualitative advances achieved by our people in the reconstruction of our country the imperialist forces have intensified their activities against the People's Republic of Mozambique. They are trying by all possible means to prevent the establishment of a civilization without discrimination  which the building in Mozambique of a socialist society  free from man's exploitation by man  represents in our part of the world. No longer able to rely on a political and administrative structure in Mozambique  something they were able to do until recently  imperialist forces are today resorting to other more insidious and brutal means of attacking us. Using as a spearhead the racist minority regime in South Africa  imperialism is waging a true undeclared war against us  committing direct armed acts of aggression against our country through the use of regular South African troops and special detachments of armed bandits. The Pretoria regime recruits and trains  finances and equips  arms and outfits  transports and supplies  evacuates and commands armed bands in Mozambique in order to commit crimes against our people  spread unrest and terror and destabilize our country. The target of these bandits is the helpless civilian population  intimidating them and committing all kinds of atrocities. They savagely torture  mutilate and assassinate children  women and the elderly. They rob peasants and loot their property. These armed bandits also perpetrate kidnappings and assassinations against foreign nationals who contribute with their labor to the progress of the People's Republic of Mozambique. These armed bandits are recruited by South Africa from among those former members of the political police force of the colonial regime who did not have the courage to join in the process of national reconstruction and thus to wipe from their hands the blood resulting from  their crimes. They are recruited from among those elements of the colonial army such as commandos and special units which  like the former  rushed cheaply to themselves to new bosses instead of waiting for the clemency of the people. They are recruited from among traitors to the fatherland  marginal elements and foreign mercenaries. The common denominator of these bandits is their anti social character  parasitism. Characteristics of the decadence of the so called free world. They do not pursue any political objectives. Their motivation is crime for its own sake  and drug the nature of their acts and their criminal motivation characterize them as bandits. The armed banditry taking place in our region today is a new phenomenon  a new form of mercenarism. In organizing and utilizing armed bandits  imperialism and the apartheid regime a aiming at implanting among the world public the false idea that opposition and a climate of insecurity exist in Mozambique. Concurrently with the acts of armed aggression  the enemy is infiltrating spies into our country and promoting economic sabotage. In promoting a vigorous campaign of slander and misinformation on the international scene  the enemy endeavors to project to the world the impression that there exists in Mozambique a permanent state of terror and panic. It promotes an economic blockade  thus hampering sound and fruitful cooperation with other peoples of the world. It endeavors to hamper the consolidation of our independence enforcement during this phase of our development process and tries to discredit socialism  a system freely elected by the people of Mozambique. In this struggle  in which the enemy is using the most subtle methods of aggression  our people has demonstrated the highest degree of critical consciousness and has become that cannot be penetrated by the designs of imperialist agents. We wish to express our gratitude in all those members of the international community that have in various ways extended support to us and that contributed progress of our country and the strengthening of fair and equitable cooperative relations. We reiterate our appeal to the international community to maximize its assistance to the People's Republic of Mozambique so as to enable us to reinforce our defensive capability and successfully to carry out the struggle gains underdevelopment. The existence of colonialism  racism and apartheid is the fundamental cause of the tension through which we are living in southern Africa and our permanent confrontation with the South African regime  which obstinately refuses to accept the course of history. South Africa continues to intensify its criminal actions against the South African people  whose struggle for national liberation is growing in scope and depth and spreading to practically all sectors of the economic and social life of the Pretoria regime. To the wave of assassinations  detentions  the torture of those who oppose and the repression of trade unions  in which many whites are now also militantly involved  the people of South Africa respond with positive actions of resistance  causing the erosion of the very establishment of the Pretoria regime. The people is fighting heroically against oppression  discrimination  repression and humiliation. Large sections of the white population are rising against the restriction of liberty  repulsed by the brutal nature of apartheid  whose criminal action is beginning to be felt in their own homes. Thus contradictions deepen in the very heart of Botha's racist minority regime in the face of its manifest inability to contain by force the liberation. struggle of the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress. Confronted by a wave of popular uprisings  and unable to fi: 3 a solution to its internal strife  Pretoria chooses to generalize the conflict in the area. South Africa attacks and occupies part of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola  at the same time supporting and promoting puppet groups such as the Union Nacional para la Independence Total de Angola. It continuously and systematically commits acts of armed aggression against Lesotho  Botswana  Zambia and Zimbabwe  violating the territorial integrity of those sovereign countries and showing no respect whatever for the ethical conduct governing relations among States signatories of the Charter of the United Nations. The objectives pursued to bring about permanent destabilization are in the last analysis intended to divert ns from the struggle for economic independence under the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference. That Conference is the weapon of the nine countries of the region for independent development and the gradual elimination of dependence on South Africa and imperialism in general. South Africa is taking action again.  It aimed at its disintegration in the face of the progress achieved in the various sectors of cooperation  particularly in the area of transportation and communication. We continue to be preoccupied with the question of Namibia. Arrogant and irresponsible  South Africa continues to use dilatory maneuvers to delay the self determination and independence of the people of Namibia  which  like every other people  has the right to freedom and independence. In Namibia  it is the people that is fighting for independence. That is the reality which is being obliterated. That is the reality which is being conjured away. That is why any attempt at connecting the independence of Namibia  either directly or indirectly  with the withdrawal of internationalist Cuban forces from Angola is not only intolerable interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola but also a crime against the people of Namibia  because by this subterfuge an effort is being made to prolong war and massacres. The internationalist Cuban forces are in Angola because the racist regime in South Africa violated the sovereignty of that territory. Therefore we must demand  in the first place  the unconditional withdrawal of the invading South African troops from Angolan territory and an absolute guarantee that such aggression will not be repeated. In fact  all the independent countries of the area which are being threatened and invaded by the forces of the apartheid regime are demanding guarantees of security. The foreign forces which are attacking  assaulting and occupying independent States in southern Africa in violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those States are not Cuban. The only invading forces which  as the entire world knows  attack and occupy the territories of the independent States of southern Africa are the forces of South Africa. It is absurd to set the security of South Africa as a pre condition for the independence of Namibia. Namibia is not the first country bordering on South Africa to fight to achieve its independence will not come from outside South Africa. It is the children of the people of South Africa who will overthrow that hideous regime from within. If it were a matter of involving foreign forces in the struggle for the liberation of South Africa  they could have used the territory of Zimbabwe for more than two years now and the territory of Mozambique for more than seven years; and the territory of other independent countries bordering on South Africa could have been used even earlier. The sovereignty of the people of Angola cannot be used as currency in exchange for the liberation of Namibia. The liberation of Namibia is an integral part of the universal emancipation movement of peoples. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms once again its unconditional support for the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leader ship of the South West Africa People's Organization its only legitimate representative. As far as we are concerned  Security Council resolution 435 remains the political and juridical framework for the fair solution of this problem. No pretext designed to impede the implementation of that resolution can stand up to a correct analysis of the reality. The remaining problems could easily be solved if there were the essential political will on the part of South Africa and its allies. We are of the opinion that even during this session of the General Assembly it should be possible to define an electoral system for the election of a constituent assembly. It should be possible during the current session to establish the forces of UNTAG and a date and the conditions for a cease fire in Namibia. This is the International Year for the Mobilization of Sanctions against South Africa; nevertheless  the indices of economic growth of the	regime show an ever increasing connivance by Western countries in maintaining and reinforcing that abominable and hideous regime. While it is said that to apply sanctions against South Africa is a useless exercise  sanctions are being applied against other countries. Where  then  is equity  justice and integrity? Today we are observing the international Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners. On this day  dedicated to the struggle  we salute the determination and the courage of the peoples of South Africa. We demand that the freedom fighters be released from South African prisons. The action of imperialist forces is not confined to southern Africa: its scope spreads throughout the African continent. At the present time those forces are endeavoring to implement their strategy aimed at the manipulation  paralysis or even disintegration of the Organization of African Unity  an important anti colonialist and anti imperialist instrument. We are certain that the African countries will know enough to turn down the blackmail  intimidation and bribery and reject the divisive tactics  and to work towards the consolidation of the OAU. We repeat our support for the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the OAU and reject the idea that that may be a cause for division within our continental organization  since it is based. The forces that will overthrow the apartheid regime on the principles embodied in the OAU charter and in the Charter of the United Nations. We reaffirm our active solidarity with the just struggle of the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. It is a struggle that could find its resolution through negotiation  which unfortunately is hampered by the intransigence of the Morocco regime. This intransigence is the reason for the protracted state of war  which threatens to spread and even involve other countries  because of the involvement of alien forces on the Moroccan side. That danger must be averted by countries which cherish freedom and the independence of peoples. The image of the massacres in Beirut is a blown  up picture of a Dantesque world transferred to the latter part of the twentieth century. Beirut invaded  Beirut bombed  Beirut besieged  deprived of water  food and medicines  will remain forever engraved in the history of the resistance struggle of peoples. It was a gratuitous demonstration of Zionist murderous fury  the purpose of which was the total elimination of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Despite the powerful weaponry unleashed by the Zionist regime  the PLO and the progressive Lebanese forces resisted the slaughter and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. We hail their heroism. The People's Republic of Mozambique supports the struggle of the Palestinian people  with the certainty that it will end with the creation of a Palestinian State  autonomous and sovereign  and the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories  which is the only acceptable solution to the conflict in the Middle East. The illegal occupation of East Timor continues. The expansionist Indonesian regime insists on the criminal occupation of that Territory  denying the Maubere people its inalienable right to self determination and independence. How many times must the events in Beirut be repeated in Dili before we can say enough and finally acknowledge the right of the Maubere people to exist and build its independent and sovereign State? Independence is not a privilege of those who are richer or more powerful. It is not an attribute of Moslems or Catholics. Independence is an inherent right of all peoples  regardless of geo strategic  religious or other considerations. Every people has its history  its culture  its personality. By preserving them  the people can face any obstacle and accept any sacrifice from the best of its children. It is because they are making such sacrifices and because their struggle is a just one that the Maubere people deserve our support. The curtain of silence drawn around the massacres and the famine to which the Maubere people are being subjected can no longer muffle the cries of the hundreds of thousands of people of Timor who are resisting the brutal Indonesian occupation. Both Republican and Democratic United States  Senators have recently called attention to the gravity of the situation. The situation in East Timor was compared by them to that of Biafra at the time of the secessionist war and that of Kampuchea during the Pol Pot era. They clearly admitted that the Maubere people had not exercised their right to self determination. We cannot watch these atrocities in silence. In East Timor there are people who  under the leadership of Frente Revclucionaria de Timor Leste Independents their legitimate representative  reject the annexation  resist Indonesian occupation and fight for the affirmation of their national rights. They have our admiration and our solidarity. We are certain that in Dili the banner of liberty of the Maubere people will be raised. In Korea  the presence of United States troops in the southern part of the territory contributes to the creation of tension  hampering the reunification process of the Korean nation a dismembered country  split in two by an imaginary line drawn in conformity with geo political concepts  to the detriment of national reality. We support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts to ensure the peaceful reunification of its nation. Its proposals for direct negotiations between North and South Korea with a view to the creation of a confederated republic constitute a positive contribution to the unification process. In Latin America  Cuba  Nicaragua and Grenada are the targets of constant threats of aggression. The imperialist aggressiveness ranges from economic blockade to imminent invasion and occupation. The peace and stability of the area must necessarily be contingent on the cessation of the use or threat of force or of any type of coercion against Cuba  Nicaragua and Grenada  free countries which have the right to choose in full sovereignty their own way of achieving socio economic development. In Chile  El Salvador and Guatemala popular uprisings are developing and apologists of Western civilization are endeavoring to intensify their military and financial support of the dictatorships in the area. No bayonets can silence the people's cries for freedom. Fairness and moral considerations dictate that we support the peoples of those countries in their struggle to gain their freedom and tum their countries into lands free from terror and repression  where no one need any longer live with the fear of never again being reunited with his loved ones. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms the principles of solidarity with all peoples who fight for their political and economic emancipation and for peace. We meet again in an international debate in an atmosphere tense and heavy with threats. The crisis expands and worsens and is being felt most acutely in developing countries. The dramatic effects of this crisis on our countries are well known: the imported inflation  the growing deficit in the balance of payments  the deterioration in the terms of trade  the food shortages  and so on. Developing countries are faced with all the symptoms of underdevelopment  where hunger is the overpowering scourge of the people. Specific short term and long term measures must be taken with a view to the eradication of the hunger and malnutrition that ravage Africa. Our continent is becoming ever more dependent on imports of food because of the lowered production and the natural catastrophes that have periodically devastated our region. The adoption of coercive economic measures aimed at the attainment of specific political objectives is so common today that it is as though an attempt were being made to replace the norms in the juridical instruments governing the Organization by that practice. It is thus that the countries that freely chose paths to development which led them to real independence have fallen victim to blackmail and pressures. Taking into account the present international economic situation  we are concerned by the insistence of some developed market economy countries on taking unilateral and arbitrary decisions and refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations. The initiation of global negotiations on international cooperation for development is of primary importance. The People's Republic of Mozambique calls for the exertion of all possible efforts during the current session of the General Assembly to ensure the initiation of global negotiations. We wish to assure the Assembly that our country will sign the recently adopted United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ' which establishes a new juridical order for the utilization of the ocean space as an instrument of justice  peace  development and international cooperation among States. true cooperation among States based on a common examination of international economic problems and on common action is absolutely necessary. Only then will it be possible for us to respond to the yearnings of all peoples for equitable and rational development in all parts of the world. It is important to ensure the appropriate conditions without delay  establish normal economic relations among all States  regardless of their socio economic systems and to reinforce international cooperation as a means of stabilizing peace. The exploitation of the weak can no longer be regarded as the right of the rich  nor can poverty  hunger  ignorance and disease continue to be the lot of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America. The struggle for peace is the greatest preoccupation of our time and most of mankind is involved in it. The struggle for peace means the reduction  destruction and Final elimination of the causes of the conflicts that rage around the world: imperialism  colonialism  neo colonialism  racism  apartheid Zionism. It means  in addition  that we must apply all our efforts to achieving general and complete disarmament. That is why the failure of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  is of great concern to the People's Republic of Mozambique. The wanton armaments race and the use of the ocean space and the stratosphere for purposes of warfare are serious obstacles to development and to cooperation among States. Development for the peoples and the promotion of worthwhile social and material wellbeing cannot be achieved unless all available human and material resources are used for peaceful purposes. In the realm of the struggle for peace  the People's Republic of Mozambique considers that nuclear disarmament has the highest possible priority  since the devastating effects of this type of weapon represent a serious threat to our very survival. It is essential for the sake of all mankind to prevent a nuclear conflict  and this must be a matter of fundamental concern in the policy of every Government. A threat to peace continues in the Indian Ocean region  where we see the consolidation  expansion and nuclearization of imperialist naval and military bases. Some Western countries persist in their firm opposition to the convening of the world Conference to adopt measures to give effect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace free from nuclear weapons. We hope that those countries will change their position in order to make possible the implementation of General Assembly resolution 36/90  which provides for the Conference to be held during the first half of 1983. The struggle for the implementation of peace and cooperation is one of our greatest priorities. Peace is necessary in the struggle against underdevelopment. Cooperation among the people of the world emerges as a necessity in the history of humanity and as an instrument in the struggle against underdevelopment  in particular through the creation of a just international order. The People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its commitment to contribute  together with the other members of the international community  to the search for a just and equitable solution to the problems that beset all of humanity. Despite the systematic and deliberate violation of international legal instruments by certain Member States  we reaffirm our adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter. The People's Republic of Mozambique expresses its full confidence in the Organization and in its everlasting dedication to the struggle for the achievement and preservation of international peace and security. The struggle continues."
"95",4844,"MRT",37,1982,"It is a great pleasure to extend congratulations  on behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  to the President on his unanimous election to guide this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This honour is undoubtedly due to his personal qualities as a statesman and diplomat  and is also a tribute to his country  Hungary. In discharging these high functions he may be assured of the availability of our delegation and its constant desire to co-operate with him. I should also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the exemplary way  displaying constant tact and objectivity  in which he conducted the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly and the subsequent special sessions.To the Secretary-General the Mauritanian delegation and I personally would like to extend the sincere expression of our esteem. The report on the work of the Organization which he has submitted bears witness to his great qualities of courage  frankness and far-sightedness.The picture of our universe today is a terrifying one. It is not worthy of mankind which has come of age and should therefore be united and be responsible. What is our verdict? Admittedly  there has been agreement on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  but with the abstention of the majority of the developed countries  in defiance of our ideology; it has proved impossible to make even a timid first step towards the global negotiations; there has been a general reduction in aid and development; the special session on disarmament ended in a notable failure which may have sinister consequences; the conflicts in Palestine and the Middle East  in southern Africa and Western Sahara; have developed in a most dangerous way; localized conflicts have continued in the Gulf  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea  and other centres of tension have emerged.In several respects the international situation before us is even more gloomy and alarming than what we faced just a year ago. We are all too familiar with the disastrous effects of the crisis which for some years has been characteristic of international economic relations for the developing countries. They include imported inflation  a sharp rise in interest rates  with a disastrous effect on the debt burden  an unprecedented fall in commodity prices  and increasingly restricted access to capital markets.The conclusions in the World Economy clearly show that the recession in the industrialized countries  far from receding has broadened and extended to all groups of countries. That study also concluded that the decline in general economic growth was more widespread in 1981 than at any other time since the Second World War. Thus world trade has remained in a state of stagnation for the second consecutive year. In the field of aid for development we have seen a considerable decrease in the share of this aid allocated through multilateral channels.The practical measures which were drawn up at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna in 1979  and the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  held at Nairobi in 1981  have remained a dead letter through the lack of funds. In a word  the development process in the world has come to a halt  as the Committee for Development. Planning pointed out in its most recent report.Everything indicates that the implementation of the aims of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade it is in a state of disarray. Such a finding makes even clearer the urgent need to seek just and equitable global solutions for the serious problems which threaten all parts of the international community.The proposal by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries for the launching of global negotiations on co-operation and development  which has been before us Car three years now  is  in our opinion  both methodologically speaking  and because of its context  the only effective way to bring about such solutions. While welcoming the positive attitude of most of the developed countries towards the most recent proposals made by the Group of 77  we cannot disguise our disappointment at seeing that these proposals have encountered stubborn resistance from those who  for good or bad reasons  still refuse to recognize the wisdom  the moderation  the practical and pragmatic nature of the formula proposed.The interdependence of national economies  and the repercussions of policies of a particular country or region on the world economy  no longer need to be demonstrated. Fully aware of this reality  and in view of the fact that the North-South dialogue seems to be more and more bogged down in the meanderings of procedure  the developing countries have conceived and implemented an outline for multifarious cooperation among themselves. In this connection  we are very pleased that the application of the great Caracas Plan of Action seems to be along the right lines. Economic co-operation among the developing countries  however  should in no case be regarded as an alternative to North-South co-operation. Nor should it serve as a pretext for the developed countries to shirk their responsibilities.10.	After a decade of hard work  negotiations on the law of the sea have finally been completed and have resulted in the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ' which was adopted here this year. Major hopes are now placed in this Convention which  because of the patience which has been shown and the mutual concessions which have been made during its drafting  is an encouraging example of what global negotiations can be  if the self-same determination to succeed and the necessary political will were to motivate the great Powers concerned.11.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania attaches particular interest to the action of the United Nations and the specialized agencies in the fields of food and agriculture. This interest arises from the predominance in our economy of activities linked with the rural sector  which employs approximately 80 per cent of our population  and which therefore is given absolute priority  and is absorbing an ever-growing share of the financial resources of the country. Faithful to the spirit of the Lagos Plan which made food self-sufficiency for any viable development  my country has drawn up  and is trying to implement  with the help of friendly countries and international institutions  a national policy based essentially on an increase in production.The relative improvement which has been observed this year in the world food situation  because of the abundant harvests in certain developed countries  should not blind us to another reality which is even more grievous  and that is that in a number of developing countries food production has increased much more slowly than the demand for these products. Similarly  we favour the proposal which was put forward at the last session of the World Food Council that a food reserve stock should be set up belonging to the developing countries  with the aim of stabilizing the grain market. Finally  in this connection I should like to recall that the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  of which my country is a member  has just drawn up a programme  in co-operation with FAO  designed to set up a cereal reserve for the Sahelian region.In my diagnosis I have referred to the causes of the deterioration in the international economic situation and the considerable decline in aid for development which is chanelled through multilateral institutions. No institution has suffered more from the general lack of support for the multilateral system of financing than the International Development Association and UNDP. The attitude of the donor countries is particularly regrettable  since it is precisely the action of these two bodies which is most in harmony with and best adapted to the development efforts of the third world.The reconstitution of the International Development Association resources at previously agreed levels is therefore an immediate and imperativeneed. The financial situation of UNDP is all the more disquieting  since this is the most important multilateral programme of the United Nations system. The stagnation of UNDP resources in 1980 and their decline in 1981 will  according to all projections  have a disastrous impact on the economies of developing countries  where the programme plays a vital financing and technical assistance role. However  we have no doubt that  aware of the extreme seriousness of the consequences of such a situation not only for the developing countries but also for the international community as a whole  those who are financially able to do so will spare no effort or measure to bring UNDP out of this crisis. In this connection the forthcoming pledging conference for operational activities will undoubtedly provide a test of political will.15.	I do not wish to conclude my country's statement on economic problems without referring briefly to the disturbing aspect of the phenomenon of desertification in our national territory and our efforts to try to limit its catastrophic effects. In my country  after many years of drought  encroachment of the desert is taking on increasingly alarming proportions. Thus  the fertile areas of our national territory have been reduced considerably because of the disastrous results of a persisting drought. Consequently  grain production has decreased from 100 000 to 26 000 tons. Of the 108 million hectares which comprise our territory 15 million had been classified as non-desert territory  of which 93 per cent have now been desertification in the course of the last 20 years. In order to face up to such a situation  the Mauritanian authorities have adopted severe regulations for protecting the fauna and flora and  in 1981 set up a National Committee to combat desertification and declared a National Arbor Day.16.	Of course  in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  we are relying first and foremost on the sense of sacrifice of our people and its willingness to pursue faithfully the goals we have set for ourselves. Nevertheless  the financial and technical means required for achieving this national programme satisfactorily are well beyond our own possibilities.17.	In this connection we have benefited from the valued assistance of friendly countries and certain international organizations. I avail myself of this opportunity to express our gratitude to these friends —too numerous to be mentioned by name here—who have demonstrated to us their constant readiness to provide valuable assistance. Our appreciation also goes to the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office  which has in our country played a primary role in our national mobilization for the struggle against the phenomenon of desertification and other natural disasters.18.	At a time when all hopes for optimism have been dashed by international economic relations that are characterized by the growing gap between the rich and poor countries and by the obvious lack of political will to establish the new international economic order in the near future  the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held from 7 June to 9 July this year  further heightened our disappointment and frustration in this field which is so vital for the security  if not the survival  of our species. The fact that the session proved unsuccessful should not  however  deflect us from the objectives pursued by our peoples for genuine and progressive disarmament both in the nuclear field and in conventional weapons. This vital objective would not only ensure preservation of mankind's many gains but also make available for the economic and social progress of all peoples the enormous financial resources at present devoted to the machinery of death and destruction which is linked to the industrial infrastructure and the environment.19.	Still in this area  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania would like to see the creation of denuclearized zones in Africa and the Middle East. We should particularly like to draw attention to the policies of nuclear armament of Israel and South Africa and the growing co-operation between these two racist entities.20.	Our country supports the demands of the coastal countries of the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean for these two regions to be transformed into zones of peace.21.	In 1981 we stated in this Hall that as far as the Zionist entity was concerned the whole world was wrong and Israel alone was right. Despite our long experience of the practices  falsifications and bad faith of the Zionist usurper  we did not think that we would be so accurate. Israel's suicidal folly  its arrogance  its contempt for international legality and the impunity it continues to enjoy have strengthened its regime in the little heed it pays to international public opinion  particularly the United Nations  which is the conscience and repository of the values of mankind and its aspirations for peace and justice.22.	We shall not review the tragic events which were visited upon our Lebanese and Palestinian brothers in Lebanon. Nor shall we go into the details of the long suffering of innocent populations  witnessed by all mankind that remained powerless but whose indignation was aroused  and which ended with the indescribable massacres of our brothers in Shatila and Sabra.23.	We should simply like to recall the facts which confirm the striking resemblance between the methods of the Nazi murderers and those of an entity which claims to be the successor of the victims of the holocausts and pogroms. Indeed  in the Middle East  the Zionist entity is emulating the Fascist regimes of days gone by and applying  in all their horror  the universally condemned practices of nazism in the form of so-called preventive wars of aggression; the crossing of international boundaries under the pretext of defence; the methodical destruction and the siege of the capital of a sovereign country and the indiscriminate blockade imposed on civilian populations through collective punishment; the blind massacre of civilian populations by the thousands and the bringing about of general insecurity in the name of security for its own citizens; and the genocide of an entire people both on its usurped land in all its havens of refuge.24.	This is an occasion to pay a tribute to the courage of the fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to bow our heads in memory of all the martyrs of the Palestinian resistance.25.	Israel's disproportionate deployment of brute force  its rejection of all moral codes and its arrogant display of racial contempt and religious fanaticism have demonstrated to the entire membership of the Organization the real purposes of the entity whose ideology can easily be mistaken for exacerbated chauvinism  the oppression of others and the denial of their rights. Israel's stubborn refusal to bring about peace in the Middle East unless it be on its own conditions by legalizing its hegemony in the region  which is the consistent policy of Zionism  is today the subject of universal condemnation. The pursuit of the plan undertaken half a century ago for the physical elimination of the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its land shows that the goal of Zionist implantation is to blot out all traces of its crime by a ""final solution"" of sorry memory.26.	It goes without saying that neither the Arab nation  the victim of this ongoing aggression  nor the international community as a whole can accept this diktat on the part of the Zionist entity and the repeated challenges to any global consensus and the relevant resolutions that have time and again been adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly.27.	As has always been the case  genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East and real security for all must necessarily be based upon the unconditional and complete withdrawal of Israeli occupying forces from all occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Al Quds and the recovery by the Palestinian people  under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  of its inalienable rights  particularly its sacred right to set up its own sovereign State on the land of its ancestors.28.	Any other approach would be to reward arrogance  aggression and blackmail in that region and would engender a new cycle of violence that would endanger the stability of the entire Middle East and peace throughout the world. Despite the desire for peace which has undeniably been shown on a number of occasions by the Arab nation  the Zionist enemy persists in its constant refusal to envisage any policies which do not endorse its own tremendous territorial appetite and its determination to annex permanently the Syrian Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories  as well as its senseless dream of exercising tutelage over the destinies of the peoples of the Arab east.29.	As we said last year  the Organization must take the enforcement measures contained in the Charter and make Israel abide by the rules of international law and our repeated decisions. It is for the United States of America  which gives Israel massive military and financial aid and sustained political assistance  to assume the very special responsibilities conferred upon it as a permanent member of the Security Council  and fulfil as soon as possible the weighty duty which derives from its dual role as a friend and ally of the Zionist entity  by exerting the necessary pressure on Israel to ensure that it abides by the rules of ethics and international legality.30.	We should like to reiterate to our brother people of Lebanon the expression of our solidarity with it in achieving its objectives—to liberate its homeland  preserve its territorial integrity and bring about the unity of its people in the context of the global strategy of the whole Arab nation. We appeal to friendly and fraternal States and to the international community as a whole to redouble their efforts to ensure that Lebanon receives all necessary support in reconstructing its country and ensuring the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from its soil.31.	In southern Africa  another area of major concern for our country  we deplore the delay in Namibia's liberation and the increased aggressiveness of the South African regime  both inside the country  and also outside where it is directed against the front-line States. The Namibian problem remains unchanged. In the opinion of our delegation  the only realistic basis for re-establishing international legality and ending the usurpation of  at Territory is Security Council resolution 435 (1978).32.	We take note of the fact that the contact group of Western States has reaffirmed its commitment concerning the expeditious implementation of that resolution so that the Namibian people can exercise its right to self-determination. While welcoming the praiseworthy efforts made by the five Western countries in order to bring about a friendly settlement of the Namibian crisis  we cannot share either their optimism or all their concerns. Indeed  it is not at all obvious to the free peoples of Africa that there is any real desire in Pretoria to resolve the existing conflict peacefully  legally and democratically. Furthermore  while we respect the rights of all the ethnic communities in Namibia  we refuse to recognize that the minority which is of European origin has special exclusive rights  and  in particular  an exaggerated right of veto.33.	So far as the principle of security is concerned  we are amazed that the only concerns which seem to prevail in certain Western circles relate to South Africa's security  like the security of Israel. In our opinion  this is putting the cart before the horse. In the eyes of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania the security that is being denied and violated is that of the African people. Our country would like once again to reaffirm that the only conceivable security for all is in the speedy establishment of the State of Namibia by the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in full association with the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the people of the Territory. Within the frontiers of South Africa  and despite the so-called improvement in racial segregation—as if there could be such a thing—the apartheid regime remains fundamentally as it always has been—contemptuous  inhumane  exploitative and repulsive.34.	This is  an occasion to pay a well-deserved tribute to our brothers in the African National Congress who  by their passive and active opposition to this barbaric regime  have reinforced the faith of the oppressed millions in the possibility of a multiracial and egalitarian South African society.35.	following the same path as Zionism  applies its criminal laws against African patriots and outside the country acts as the policeman by its almost permanent occupation of a part of the sister Republic of Angola and its periodic incursions against Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe  Zambia and the other countries in southern Africa. This is an opportunity to express our solidarity with those brother countries  victims of the indescribable acts of aggression perpetrated by the racist regime of South Africa. We also reaffirm our total commitment to stand side by side with these front-line countries.36.	Quite apart from these anachronistic attempts at colonization  in the Arab east and in southern Africa in the twilight of classical colonialism  new embers of tension have begun to smoulder in recent years in various parts of the world. Of all those armed conflicts  which for the people and Government of Mauritania are subjects of deep concern  that in Western Sahara is the one which most closely affects my country. Indeed  for practically seven years now Western Sahara has been fighting a difficult war to ensure national survival and to be able to give expression to its inalienable right to self-determination and independence.37.	We make an urgent appeal that this ruinous and useless war should be brought to an end  a war which has pitted against each other two fraternal peoples  which is taking place very close to our frontiers  and which entails the certain danger of engulfing the whole region and leading to an international conflict. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  which sees the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the Organization of African Unity as a positive factor  will give its sincere support to any practical solutions accepted by the two parties concerned  the Moroccans and the Sahraouis  which could put an end to their fratricidal confrontation.38.	Nevertheless  as we have repeatedly stated  our country remains convinced that the only possible means of achieving genuine peace  then the necessary reconciliation  and finally a natural co-operation  requires the opening of a constructive dialogue directed to beginning the direct negotiations which are an indispensable prerequisite to the conclusion of a peace agreement. As we see it  that agreement should lead eventually to the self-determination and complete independence of the Sahraoui people  thus removing any obstacles and constraints of an administrative or military nature. That would remove the final obstacle to the building of a fraternal  egalitarian and closely united Arab Maghreb.39.	This cursory survey of the burning problems in our continent reminds us that Africa  which in the past suffered the terrible exploitation of its human and material resources  and which is now the target of imperialist appetites and intervention  needs  more than ever before  the cohesion of all the countries which make it up.40.	The OAU  which was created in 1963 and is based on the common aspiration of our peoples to achieve fully political and economic liberation of all its members and of all colonial territories  will  in spite of everything  be able to preserve its essential unity and its firm faith in its charter and its fundamental principles.41.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  a country ideally suited to meetings and exchanges among all the members of the African family  is firmly convinced that our continental organization will once again surmount its temporary difficulties by closing ranks  while at the same time avoiding the sacrifice of thesacred principles of pan-Africanism  namely  the equal right that all enjoy to self-determination and their inalienable right to national independence.42.	In the Gulf area  two countries that are both members  as are we of the Islamic Ummah and the non-aligned movement  have been confronting each other for more than two years in a devastating war  at enormous cost both in human lives and in the destruction of a valuable economic infrastructure. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania would like to reiterate its heartfelt appeal for the cessation of hostilities between our brothers in Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran and for negotiations to be opened between them to reach a permanent solution to their differences.43.	Another equally unfortunate conflict is continuing in Afghanistan as a result of the invasion of that country in violation of its sovereignty. Once again  we appeal for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the national territory of Afghanistan and for respect for the sovereignty of that country  for the integrity of its national territory and for the sovereign right of its people to seek their own progress in accordance with their historic heritage and their socio-cultural values.44.	The same is true with regard to the Member nation  which has also been the victim of fashion and prolonged military occupation. In this connection  we would like to welcome the constitution of a national front under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  and we appeal for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the national territory of Democratic Kampuchea.45.	We reaffirm our adherence to the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea of July 19816 and to all the resolutions of the Organization calling for respect for the sovereignty of Kampuchea and for an end to foreign interference in its internal affairs and respect for its people's sovereign right to organize their own national life in a democratic manner without any outside interference.46.	In general terms  we condemn the claims of Powers  whether large  medium-sized or small  to arrogate to themselves the right to modify by force the regime of a neighbouring country if they judge it to be hostile.47.	A secure world of nations joined together in independence and solidarity and determined to shoulder the noble responsibility incumbent on mankind cannot  obviously  live by the anachronisms of the past and by social and political injustice. There can be no other way to satisfy the rights of peoples to national differentiation and the realization of their aspirations to freedom and progress  than by banishing all hegemonistic trends. There can be no other way to achieve the rights of every man to a life in dignity than through the triumph of fundamental freedoms. There can be no other way to redress on a global scale of all the damaging economic relations that result from subjection or from structural imbalances than by setting up an equitable world economy.48.	A world for tomorrow  one that man can live in—all men  equally—must be built on justice and equality or it cannot be built at all. Let us liberate those peoples still under domination  the victims of those who would deny them their identity and their right to a homeland and a name. Let us destroy the barriers that prevent men from achieving their dream of a life worthy of being lived in freedom and from satisfying their basic social and cultural needs. Let us put an end to the unjust heritage of an outrageous colonialism and to the further deprivations caused by an ill-adapted world economy suitable neither to equity nor to the aspirations and interests of all men  in North and South alike.49.	Let us  in other words  work devotedly to ensure the emergence of a new international order worthy of this end of the twentieth century that should witness the triumph of a united civilization brought together not around the values of a single continent or spiritual family  but imbued with a common heritage rich in its very diversity 50.	We will thereby have undoubtedly laid the groundwork for a new equilibrium that will be more realistic  more peaceful  more stable and more human. Indeed  we will have opened the way towards the realization of one of the noblest wishes of the drafters of the Charter of the United Nations  who stages three years after one of the most fearsome catastrophes of our time  their determination ""to saw succeeding generations from the scourge of war""."
"96",4890,"MUS",37,1982,"I bring to the General Assembly and to the United Nations the greetings of the people of Mauritius and of their newly elected Government. I wish to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to preside over our deliberations. I am confident that under his wise and able leadership the Assembly will  in the superior interests of mankind  give concrete shape to the aspirations of the peoples of the world. I seize this opportunity to express to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our warmest appreciation for the highly impressive manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the previous session of the Assembly.53.	It is indeed a moment of intense emotion for me to address the Assembly for the first time in my capacity as the head of a new Government overwhelmingly mandated by the people of Mauritius to take the destiny of the country firmly in hand  to make it play the role it should play in mankind's search for enduring peace in the world and to make it contribute its share  however modest  to the eradication of all forms of injustice at home and abroad.54.	I wish here to record our appreciation of the work done by the Secretary-General. It takes great courage  Mr. Secretary-General  to undertake on behalf of humanity the difficult tasks that your office carries with it. The international community has seen you at work in the past year in some of the most trying situations  where your tact  your moderation and your perseverance have inspired universal admiration. The year ahead  unfortunately  does not promise to be any easier for you than the year that has elapsed. In your first report on the work of the Organization you have focused on the need for an urgent review of the United Nations and  in particular  of mechanisms set up for collective action for international peace and security. You have argued for a more forthright role for your office of Secretary-General and you envisage for the Security Council a kind of diplomatic system. Finally  you say you would like to see more concrete follow-up action to debate in the Assembly. Many of the proposals you have made could be put into effect immediately if the political will of Member States was galvanized for the purpose. You can therefore rest assured that my delegation will co-operate fully with your office and with the other Member States for an early implementation of any resolution arrived at in respect of the reorganization envisaged.55.	It is a matter of deep regret that the principle of the universality of United Nations membership does not yet actually prevail. Unilateral action and exclusive alliances have in fact not been disowned. Spheres of influence and considerations of balance of power  regrettably  continue to actuate the policies of many nations  despite the fact that they fail to produce the desired results. Added to this is a considerable and formidable interference in the internal affairs of many countries  the powerful making their presence felt in many ways  relentless in their endeavour to enlarge their spheres of influence. Countries like Mauritius  which have only recently acquired freedom  have a strong attachment to the United Nations and inevitably a special stake in its functioning. I have come here to reiterate my country's deep commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter.56.	I believe that we come here not to save face but to save and protect life. We come here not to deliver speeches only and then make our exit but to make action follow our words. We come here not as a matter of mere formality and to pay lip service to the ideals of peace and justice but  to show how serious we are in our intentions to work for the superior interests of the whole of mankind. We come here not out of selfish motives but to show how willing and prepared we are to forgo a little bit of our own ego for international good in a spirit of compromise  so that the world may live and the human race survive. We come here not to add to problems but to find solutions satisfactory to all parties. We come here because we believe in man and in all the inherent good there is in him which  if it prevails  will be the safety valve of the human race.57.	What is urgently needed is a unified view of the world's resources and the world's experience and of man's power of invention. The change we desire  the change which must come  is one not of pace  quantity or manner but of the basic quality of what man is and can be. We all need to make earnest and well-considered efforts to subdue and check national ambitions and rivalries in the superior and wider interest of the preservation of civilization and the survival of humanity.58.	It is in the context of what I have just said that I invite representatives present here to bear in mind the human dimensions of the issues we shall be deliberating upon. The average man does not ask for much; he is not interested in leading a life of frivolous affluence and frenetic consumption. We are gathered here to give substance to the yearnings of the average man  to give voice to the wishes of the voiceless  for that is the primary responsibility of those who govern. The great tragedy of the present situation is that the world order as it now exists has been unable to satisfy the basic universal aspirations of man —dignity  peace and security.59.	In June the people of Mauritius gave an overwhelming mandate to those whom they perceived to be the champions of the dignity of man. We have given a solemn undertaking to our people to defend the oppressed and the weak and we will be true to that undertaking. It is equally in this spirit that we want to add our voice to that of this concert of nations in our denunciation of all forms of injustice and to work to better the lot of suffering mankind.60.	The major and continuing threat to the dignity of man comes from the prevailing economic order  characterized by built-in self-perpetuating inequality which results in an unjust distribution of the world's limited resources. Year by year the inequality grows  the injustice of the system becomes ethically more revolting and at the receiving end deprivation and misery become more unbearable. It is patent that this system cannot be allowed to continue. Change may be too gradual in the developing countries for our liking but we realize that it can come only out of patient dialogue. We are today faced with the Herculean task of restructuring an economic order which has been shaped by four centuries of colonialism. This cannot be done quickly  it cannot be done painlessly  but it has to be done and it will be done. The real question before us is whether we want to continue frittering away our energies in useless disagreements and quarrels or whether we want to look seriously into the future of mankind and act to make people really prosperous.61.	Both the rich and the poor nations have pressing  and paralleled problems which cannot be solved independently. The present crisis is a crisis of international structures. The present system needs fundamental institutional reforms  based upon the recognition of a common interest and upon mutual concern in an increasingly interdependent world. New vitality and urgency have to be imparted to the North-South dialogue. The very survival of both developing and developed countries depends on the success of this dialogue. We have to moderate the shrillness of the demands made  as well as the obdurate arrogance with which those demands have so far been rejected. I believe that we have in the Lome Convention given the world a small but significant example of what cooperative North-South could be like.62.	My Government also calls upon the members of the international community to direct its efforts to the equally important transformation of the international order relating to the oceans. The traditional legal order in that Held has been eroded by technological and political developments and must be replaced by a new legal order which would permit the exploitation of the ocean space—the largest and most valuable region of our planet—in the interests of all mankind. After many years of intense and very complex negotiations  in which over 150 States have regularly participated  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has produced a Convention which ought to be hailed as a triumph for mankind in laying the foundation for international co-operation in the use of the oceans.63.	All the major industrialized Powers played a very active role in the shaping of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which largely reflects their interests  concerns and preoccupations. It is on account of this that we fail to appreciate the attempt being made by certain major Powers to scuttle the Convention by their decision to opt for a mini-treaty among like-minded States  a mini-treaty which inevitably will create new areas of tension in international relations likely to lead to a situation which endangers international peace and security.64.	We call upon all States to sign the Convention in order to make the concept of the common heritage of mankind a reality. The Convention on the Law of the Sea should be treated as a special convention and we urge the major industrialized States to forgo their fears about the precedent setting nature of this Convention. All States should embark on this enterprise in a spirit of trust and good will.65.	Quite apart from its determination to work with other countries of the third world for the elimination of the poverty curtain that divides our planet into a world of the affluent and a world of the poor  Mauritius militates against the equally pernicious division of the world into two hostile camps dominated by the so-called super-Powers  which  in their pursuit of world domination  threaten the security of States the only concern of which is the social and economic development of their people  free from external interference. Mauritius is committed to a policy of active and determined non-alignment. We intend jealously to protect and guard our hard-won independence; we intend to condemn unequivocally all aggression  all forms of imperialism and all hegemonistic ambitions. We aspire to a world of true interdependence of genuinely free and equal States  whose relations are based on co-operation rather than on confrontation.66.	The Government of Mauritius  in pursuit of its policy of strict non-alignment and in conformity with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  will work with other peace-loving members of the international community for the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. During the years which have elapsed since the adoption of the resolution  we have witnessed the expansion of the Ocean's geopolitical dimensions and the conversion of this intended zone of peace into a zone of war and mobilization for war  with all the attendant dangers for the countries of the regime. The Ocean has gradually expanded beyond its own waters; it is now linked to the States of South-East Asia and to developments in West Asia and the Middle East. The so-called modest communications facility in Diego Garcia has been converted into the formidable and horrendous nuclear base which threatens the security of all Indian Ocean States  and there has been a scramble to secure port facilities along the so-called arc of crisis  that is  the Horn of Africa  the Arabian peninsula and the vital Persian Gulf area.67.	With the alarming increase in a foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean  the fervent hope of the States of the region for the holding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean has receded. Mauritius and the other States of the region are not hoodwinked by the tactics and ploys adopted by some States  which are designed primarily to cause confusion  postpone indefinitely the holding of that Conference and create a smoke-screen to hide their warlike designs. We solemnly appeal to all the members of the international community to give their full support to the United Nations so that the Conference on the Indian Ocean can take place in the very near future. We also call upon the foreign military Powers present in the Indian Ocean to exercise mutual restraint and to initiate a gradual and balanced withdrawal of their forces from the region  which would then be open exclusively to commercial navigation. It is our conviction that the security of the sea lanes in the Ocean can best be protected by the States of the region.68.	At this juncture I should like to dwell on an issue which affects the vital interests of Mauritius; I mean the Mauritian claim of sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  which was excised by the then colonial Power from the territory of Mauritius in contravention of General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX). This dismemberment of Mauritian territory  the violation of our territorial integrity  has been made all the more unacceptable by the fact that one of the islands of that very Archipelago  Diego Garcia  is now a full-fledged nuclear base  which poses a constant threat to the security of Mauritius and to that of all the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  the very Ocean declared to be a zone of peace by this Assembly in 1971.69.	I solemnly appeal to the peace-loving Members of the Organization to extend all their support to the legitimate Mauritian claim of sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. In helping Mauritius to regain its national heritage  the United Nations will be living up to its own principles and proclaiming loud and clear that it expects its resolutions to be implemented by its Members. As the Diego Garcia issue involves two fundamental principles of the United Nations  namely respect by the administering Power for the territorial integrity of its colony  and the right of peoples to live in peace and security  I venture to say that the return of the archipelago to Mauritius will bring the Organization the respect that is so indispensable to its continued existence.70.	Times are bad  very bad. The world economy in fact teeters on the brink of a depression that could be wider and deeper than that of the 1930s. For the weakest national economies  and therefore for hundreds of millions of people  little short of catastrophe looms. Such a situation  wherein the world is perilously poised on the brink of an economic precipice  is not conducive to peace. An extended recession  excessive interest rates  highly unstable exchange rates  widespread protectionism—all these constitute threats to peace in a world of inescapable interdependence. Our political and economic systems should provide conceptual space for the reality of an interdependent world economy. Regrettably  the search for the world economy recovery that is so desperately needed remains derailed and we drill towards the abyss of economic disaster.71.	As far as Mauritius if concerned  we shall participate fully in the North-South dialogue and  indeed  have great expectations of progress resulting from that dialogue  but we believe that much can be achieved through South-South co-operation. The Island States of the south-west Indian Ocean are actively engaged in promoting co-operation at the regional level. We hope in the near future to set up an Indian Ocean commission which will provide the institutional framework for co-operation among the States of the region. It Is no mean measure of our firm belief in the concept of an interdependent world economy that we are already looking beyond the immediate present to the day when the grouping of the south-west Indian Ocean States can be associated with other regional groupings.72.	Violations of human rights constitute another serious threat to the dignity of man. In too many countries do people live under constant threat of arbitrary arrest  torture  appearance and execution after trials that are away from civilized norms of justice. We unequivocally condemn all violations of human rights wherever they occur  under whatever social or political system that occur.73.	We have a special abhorrence for a system so inhuman  so immoral  would be unimaginable but for the shameful fact that it exists. This odious system of institutionalized racism will eternally tarnish the claim of our epoch to a place of honour in the history of civilization. We have a duty to our brothers in South Africa. We also owe it to ourselves to eliminate all vestiges of this iniquitous system; otherwise the judgement which posterity will pass on our times will be indeed very harsh  and deservedly so.74.	We believe that freedom is indivisible  that peace is indivisible. One of the first foreign policy decisions of my Government was formally to recognize ANC. Mauritius will stand by ANC in its hard struggle to secure the emancipation of the people of South Africa; ANC can depend on the unflinching support of the people and Government of Mauritius.75.	We shall give the same unconditional support to SWAPO in its struggle for the decolonization of Namibia. It is unacceptable that the Republic of South Africa should continue in its illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of the basic tenets of international law and of international opinion. This defiance has to be opposed by united and determined action. We should not permit economic considerations to hinder our action when the basic norms of universal morality are being trampled upon  and we should vigorously condemn the tactics adopted by the South African regime  tactics designed to modify the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Mauritius  moreover  sees no linkage between the presence of Cuban troops in Angola and the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia and demands that the South African regime should no longer be allowed to invoke such a linkage to delay the accession of the Namibian people to independence.76.	We in Africa will  we hope  soon be rid of the last vestiges of colonialism  and the emancipation of the South African people will inevitably be accomplished in the near future. Racist domination in southern Africa is the major  immediate problem we face  but it is by no means our only problem.77.	I should like to impress upon the Assembly that the African peoples want to dispel the image that the African continent is only a rich source of raw materials and nothing more; nor is it fertile ground for the manoeuvres of outside Powers and it is now determined not to tolerate such manoeuvres. Africa calls open all outside Powers to keep out and to let Africans get on with solving their problems and be of help for countries in the solution of these problems is not to be ignored  provided there no sinister ulterior motives  We in Africa are in urgent need of technology  of capital  of know-how. Our problems  both economic and social  call for the joined  sustained effort of all of Africa. 0ur greatest challenge is the maintenance of African unity and the consolidation of our independence.78.	I come now to an area distant from Mauritius. The issue at stake  however  is close to the heart of every Mauritian. Tre PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people has our unreserved support; our identification with the Palestinian cause is total. We believe that the people of the Middle East will remain supportive towards Palestine until Palestinian aspirations are fulfilled. Mauritius has studied the various peace proposals with great attention and we are ready to give our backing to any peace plan put forward that is acceptable to the PLO.79.	We call upon all those who can do so to bring pressure to bear on Israel to stop forthwith its aggression against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples. Prospects of peace in the area suffered a severe setback with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the unspeakable  cold-blooded carnage of innocent civilians in Beirut.80.	The fratricidal war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran drags on  to the satisfaction of those who would wish to see the third world in a perpetual state of turmoil and underdevelopment. We call upon both parties to the conflict to cease hostilities and to stop the death and destruction this war is inflicting on the peoples of Iran and Iraq.81.	This war has led to the postponement of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. This postponement comes at a time when our movement is faced with problems requiring immediate solutions. Afghanistan  a member of the movement finds itself under foreign occupation for the third year. It is imperative that foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan  that all foreign interference in its internal affairs cease and that its non-aligned status be restored.82.	The conflicts  the inequalities and the injustices of the world scene could easily lead us to be disheartened at the precarious state of the world. But we cannot allow ourselves to be disheartened  for that would be an abdication of our responsibilities towards our children and towards posterity. An important aspect of my Government's socialist creed is faith in the innate goodness of man. Man fights the forces of evil and darkness  conscious that  however long and arduous the way may be  the victory of good over evil is assured.83.	I believe that the Charter is the concrete embodiment of one of the instances where good has triumphed against tremendous divisive odds. The Charter is our yardstick by which are judged the acts of nations. I can assure the Assembly that my Government's actions find their inspiration in the Charter.84.	The world has always faced one crisis or another  but today's crisis is deeper and more far-reaching. No thinking  sensitive and right-minded nation can remain silent. But it is not enough merely to speak out: we should peak out when the occasion for action comes  but  above all  we should act  because the occasion for action is here and now.85.	On behalf of the people of Mauritius and on behalf of their newly elected Government  I pledge our continuing and unflinching support for the United Nations and our respect for its Charter."
"97",4973,"MYS",37,1982,"Sir  at the outset I wish to extend to you my sincere felicitations on your unanimous ejection as President of the General Assembly. Your ejection bears testimony to the recog¬nition and respect that you enjoy as a diplomat of outstanding ability. Under your presidency  I am con¬fident that the Assembly will be able to complete its work successfully and with distinction. Your election is also an added honor to your country  with which Malaysia enjoys friendly relations. In welcoming your election  I wish also to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Kittani  the outgoing President  on the outstanding manner in which he conducted the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.3.	Since the General Assembly last met  the interna¬tional situation has not improved. On the contrary  it has deteriorated even further. The world continues to remain in the grip of crises of various kinds stemming from unresolved political and military con¬flicts  economic stagnation and recession  widespread poverty and privation  and various inequities  all of which seem to defy solution. Through all this there is continued escalation of armaments  consuming enormous funds and resources and threatening mankind with destruction and possibly extinction. The General Assembly  meeting against this backdrop  must get the full backing of the Members so as to reassert the authority of the United Nations and play a truly effective role.4.	As we look around us  we have to admit that this time international law and order has truly broken down. Might is now the only thing that is right. Weak coun¬tries like Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Lebanon are trodden upon by this boots of invading armies as the rest of the world stands by. The economies of the poor nations are wrecked by recession resulting from man-made policies in the powerful commercial and financial centers of the world. The pleas of the poor are but secondary subjects for discussion by the rich as they meet to plan their own world in places like Cancun and Versailles. And in Lebanon  thousands of Palestinians are murdered in the name of security for the Israelis and their cohorts.5.	There was a time when the United Nations sent a multinational force to stop an invasion and it did in fact succeed. But now it is helpless. Resolution after resolution is adopted by the various United Nations committees  but the invasions  the atrocities and the economic bullying go on. The credibility of the United Nations is indeed at its lowest ebb  and we who are weak and small live in real fear—fear for our independence  our well-being and even our lives.6.	The need to restore faith in the United Nations is very pressing. The United Nations must regain its credibility. I should like to say that countries like Malaysia must help to restore the trust and confidence of the international community in the Organization's ability to play a constructive role in resolving problems and crises and in maintaining world peace and stability  but that would be pure rhetoric. What is needed is the full backing of the powerful nations. They must revitalize the Organization which they created. They must breathe life into it by abiding by its decisions and lending it their weight.7.	In South-East Asia  the Kampuchean problem continues to pose a threat to peace and security. Three times the General Assembly has called for the total withdrawal of foreign forces and the exercise of self- determination by the Kampuchean people. The International Conference on Kampuchea laid down the principles for a political settlement of the problem. But again those who are in a position to help achieve this political settlement have shown little concern for the accepted norms of international practice.8.	The foreign military invasion and continued occupation of Kampuchea is a crime against the Kampuchean people and a threat to regional peace and security. It has brought in its wake big-Power rivalry into a region where five peace-loving nations have agreed to a concept of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality. Members of the Association of South East Asian Nations find in the Kampuchean problem an insurmountable obstacle to their cherished dream of a conflict-free neutral area.9.	The world must give serious attention to the situa¬tion in Kampuchea before big-Power rivalry escalates into open confrontation  for when this happens  the United Nations will once again be powerless to do anything. The Members of the United Nations must act while there is still time for them to do so. They must give their stamp of approval to the valiant coalition that has been formed.10.	In consonance with the efforts for a peaceful settlement  Malaysia and ASEAN are extremely gratified with the agreement reached among the three resistance groups of Kampuchea to join hands in the coalition in which His Highness Prince Sihanouk has assumed the presidency of the Government of Demo¬cratic Kampuchea. The determination  wisdom and  above all abiding sense of patriotism of the three leaders  in standing together to restore freedom and honor to their country  deserve our profound admiration. Malaysia welcomes this development  as it is a positive and important step towards the attain¬ment of a political solution. Malaysia feels honored for having been able on 22 June 1982 to act as host during the historic signing of the declaration estab-lishing the coalition by His Highness Prince Sihanouk  Mr. Son Sann and Mr. Khieu Samphan. I am indeed happy about the presence and participation at this session of His High¬ness Prince Norodom Sihanouk  President of Demo¬cratic Kampuchea and the beloved leader of the Kampuchean people. I hope that the Assembly will respond appropriately and positively to his noble cause. We await with keen anticipation his triumphant return to Kampuchea to restore the freedom and inde¬pendence of that country and the honor and dignity of the Kampuchean people.11. In West Asia  the situation has also taken a turn for the worse since the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Since the Palestinians were evicted from their homeland  they have been forced to move from one refuge to another countless times. Their rights us a people are still being denied. They are not even treated as humans  as the brutal massacres in Lebanon amply demonstrate.12. We remember vividly the horrors of Belsen  Dachau and other Nazi concentration camps of the Second World War. We know of the sufferings of the Jewish people then and the pogroms of centuries past. We were appalled at those atrocities. Nevertheless  nobody—not even a people that has suffered as much as the Jews have—has the right to inflict upon others the horrors of Sabra and Shatila. The Palestinians and the Lebanese were not responsible for Belsen or Dachau. Has the international community lost its conscience that it could stand aloof while such horrors were perpetrated against the helpless and the innocent? In order to assuage the conscience of the anti-Semites  the land of the Palestinians has already been taken away from them to create a Jewish home-land. Must the Palestinians now be butchered and driven from refuge to refuge? Must they also be exterminated? We understand the conscience which bothers the people that were once cruel to the Jews. We understand their need to make amends for their past misdeeds. But are we going to condone massacres because we or  rather  the powerful nations of the world are unwilling to hurt the feelings of the Jews? Some may think that the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila camps will satiate the Israelis and that they will go back to their Israel. This can only be a wrong assumption. Recent history has shown  and the Israeli Prime Minister has admitted  that Israel never really fought in self-defense. It attacks at the slightest provocation—even imagined provocation. The neighbors of Israel are going to be under constant threat and again and again they will be invaded  and atroc¬ities committed against them. In the interest of Israeli security  there will be no security for its neighbors. Can we accept that only the security of Israel is important and that its Arab neighbors have no right to security?13.	Israel is a bully. If it were any bigger or stronger  the world would not be safe. I should therefore like to call upon the United States  as the main supplier of weapons to Israel  to reconsider its position. Those weapons are for nothing less than murder. Apart from its systematic and premeditated use of lethal and sadistic weapons on occupied Palestine and Arab territories  Israel continues to propagate the myth of the non-existence of the Palestinian people  thereby frustrating all peaceful efforts to find adjust and enduring settlement of the West Asian conflict. Indeed  the lesson we have learned from the Israeli invasion of neighbouring Lebanon and the destruction of Beirut is that  if Israel is not stopped  the West Asia problem will not only continue but also escalate until we are all swallowed up in the conflagration. At this point  I wish to pay homage to the valiant Palestinian freedom fighters for their outstanding qualities of fortitude  patriotism and courage in the face of overwhelming odds in their just struggle for their inalienable rights. I also take this opportunity to salute Chairman Yasser Arafat for his statesmanship  foresight and courage in leaving Beirut in order to spare the civilian population of that city continued Israeli savagery. Unfortunately  the sacrifice made by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has been in vain.14.	Malaysia would also like to welcome the initiative taken recently at Fez by the Arab leaders at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  which reflects the reasonableness of their stand as much as their courage  statesmanship and  above all  their reaffirmation of their commitments to the Charter of the United Nations and to regional and international peace and security. This initiative presents to the interna¬tional community a formula which will enable the Palestinians to return to their homes and freely exercise their God-given inalienable rights in their own home¬land  Palestine. The Israelis have of course rejected the proposal outright. The world and the supporters of Israel must prevail upon that habitually intransigent country to return to sanity and the ways of civilization.15.	In Afghanistan  too  we continue to witness another example of the blatant use of force. There  too  we continue to find the misery and the travails of a people locked in an unequal struggle to preserve their faith  national identity and character  their sovereignty  dignity and freedom.16.	Indeed  the situation within Afghanistan  and that of the 3.5 million refugees forced into exile in neigh¬bouring countries have given cause for unprecedented anxiety  particularly for weak and small nations of the world. To these nations  the continuance of the Afghan nationalist struggle is crucial. It is incumbent on the international community to see that this struggle succeeds.17.	We in Malaysia are fully committed to the restora¬tion of the lawful rights of the Afghan people  including their right to determine for themselves their future  free from coercion  and to the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes in safety and with honor.18.	We support the efforts of the Secretary-General in initiating indirect talks with the parties concerned to find a political solution consistent with the United Nations and resolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on the Afghan problem.19.	It is disconcerting that the war between Iraq and Iran continues to rage. The conflict has gone on  far too long. It has taken a heavy toll in lives lost  in property destroyed  in wounds inflicted and in human misery. We must all therefore apply ourselves earnestly to the task of reconciling the two countries in the interests of the peoples of those countries themselves and those of the world at large. The fact is that there can be neither victor nor vanquished in this conflict.20.	Malaysia enjoys close and cordial relations with both Iran and Iraq and we therefore implore them to cease fighting and to accept mediation and reconcilia¬tion so that an honorable and enduring solution can be found.21.	My Government abhors South Africa's inhuman policy of apartheid. It is a travesty of justice and an affront to human dignity coupled with the Pretoria regime's deliberate and provocative armed incursions into neighbouring States  constitutes a major cause of tension and instability  not only in Africa  but throughout the world. Malaysia will con¬tinue fully to support the cause of the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle for equality  justice and dignity  and against those who champion human rights  or claim to do so  would do better to condemn the Pretoria regime  and treat it like the freak it is.22.	Another area of great concern to us is the problem of drug abuse. The world community has for a long time treated the drug problem as a social problem akin to poverty  slavery  child abuse and other social ills. In fact  drug addiction is all those social ills rolled into one. The youths afflicted with this problem are mental slaves with deviant tendencies who are per¬manently impoverished. The problem must be tackled at its source  and this can be done only if the United Nations acts positively. Failure to arrest this spreading scourge will destroy whole generations to come.23.	The age of empires and imperial Powers is practically over  but the world has not as yet become a better place for the previously colonized. There are many reasons for this  and among them is the banding together of the rich nations in order to maintain eco¬nomic dominance  which some say is actually a form of imperialism.24.	We in Malaysia are very much affected by this. As a nation  we have tried to live within the rules  formal and informal  which govern economic relations between nations. We have even refrained from nationalizing industries set up during colonial days  which were engaged in literally extracting wealth from our country for foreigners who frequently do not even know where Malaysia is  much less care for the well- being of its people. But our patience and sense of fair play are being taxed to the limit by the market manipulations abroad which  in effect  reduce our people to the status of underpaid laborers. As a producer of primary commodities like tin  rubber and palm oil  we are as much entitled to a fair return on our outlay as any producer of manufactured goods in the developed countries. Producing these primary products is no longer merely a question of having enough land or minerals and cheap labour. These days  expensive capital outlay is needed to explore  extract and develop them  and also to do the required research and development. The indications are that these costs and the technology required will increase steadily in the years to come. Thus  money is needed  not merely for profits  but for future development  for our own income and for the needs of the world.25.	While the manufactured goods that we buy are priced according to the costs of production and marketing—plus  of course  a hefty profit—the prices of primary products seem to bear no relation to any of those costs. They are priced according to the whims and fancies of a host of people who have nothing to do with their production. The various exchanges located in the developed countries literally manipulate prices in order to make a profit for the brokers  the dealers  the speculators and others. These people make money when the prices go up. They also make money when the prices come down. Therefore  it suits them to cause a ""yo-yo"" effect in commodity prices. In addition  these exchanges are exclusive clubs  where the producers are unable to secure membership. The brokers and others who trade on the exchanges are the same people who make the rules  apply the rules and arbitrate. Is it any wonder that whenever their profits are threatened they change the rules so as not only to save themselves  but to make a handsome profit as well?26.	That is the situation in the tin and rubber markets today. It has played havoc with my country's eco¬nomy. We have tried to reduce price fluctuations by having producer-consumer agreements  but this is an arrangement that taxes the producers when prices are down but which benefits the consumers when price trends are upwards. It is a case of ""heads I win  tails you lose"".27.	As if all that were not enough  the United States maintains a stockpile  ostensibly for strategic —meaning security—reasons. We fully support the needs of the United States for strategic reserves  but the administration of that reserve is clearly not influenced by problems of strategy. The stockpile is merely a rich nation's monopolistic weapon  used to depress prices of commodities for the benefit of the consumers.28.	Such is the fate of the producers of primary commodities that they now have to sell three to five times as much of their produce as they did 20 years ago in order to buy the same amount of manufactured goods from the developed countries. In other words  the gap between rich and poor has widened by 300 to 500 per cent in the last 20 years or so.29.	Malaysia is trying to break the vicious circle of the old commodity market system. We are trying to set up a more suitable system which will maintain reasonable prices while ensuring adequate supplies of tin and rubber to the world. To that end  we have tried to form a viable and effective producers' asso¬ciation. There is no intention to create a monopolistic situation. We know full well that unreasonableness on our part would result in reduced consumption and a switch to substitutes. We hope that producer countries everywhere will appreciate the need for this strategy and participate in it.30.	Commodity prices today arc at their lowest. We can blame the recession for that. But what we regret is that this recession is man-made. There is no shortage of supply  nor is there a shortage of demand. Energy is plentiful and the level of technology is unprece¬dented^ high. Yet suddenly  no one wants to buy what only yesterday he could not get enough of. And those who want to buy are without the necessary foreign exchange. Indeed  many poor countries have virtually to sell their souls in order merely to survive.31.	As I have said  this world-wide depression is man-made. It is made in the powerful countries by short-sighted people. Foremost among the decisions that led to the diminution of world trade is the increase in interest rates. The high cost of money has reduced investments  shrunk inventories and stifled new business initiatives. Thus a lot of commodities are floating around unsold and unsought  further depressing prices.32.	True  some people have waxed rich in this depression  but the price is high in terms of unem¬ployment  bankruptcies and misery for the poor. The world's economy cannot go on like this for long. There will be violence  riots and revolutions; Governments will fall  and anarchy will prevail. The longer the depression lasts  the longer it will take to recover.33.	As this depression is man-made  man must unmake it too. The first need is the lowering of interest rates  even if it causes slightly higher inflation. Secondly  the protectionism of the rich nations must be reduced if not done away with altogether. If this cannot be done  at least the protectionist policy should be made more discriminating. The developing nations should not be subjected to any protectionist measures. This should at least soften the impact of the recession on them. The rich countries  too  would benefit as the improved income of the poor would enable them to buy more manufactured goods. The world has suffered enough from this depression. We need action now. We need the reversal of policies that are so obviously wrong. We should like to appeal to those people who wield so much power to heed the needs of the world. Reverse the policies you have made  and the world will remember you as saviors.34.	The participating Members of the United Nations must congratulate themselves on the successful conclusion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The days when the rich nations of the world could take for themselves what¬ever territory and resources they had access to be over. Henceforth all the unclaimed wealth of this earth must be regarded as the common heritage of all the nations of this planet. The seas and the sea-bed are undoubtedly going to be the source of wealth for the future. There is no reason why the minerals and other resources now found on the exposed surfaces of the planet will not be found in the sea-bed! The problem is  of course  one of exploration and extrac¬tion. The high cost and the sophisticated technology required will be well beyond the capacity of the poor nations. Unless they can have a share as of right whenever this wealth is extracted ^ the gap between them and the rich nations going to widen even more. When finally they do have the capacity  much of the readily accessible wealth will have been exhausted. It is to be hoped that  given the agreement on the law of the sea  the poor nations will get their fair share.35.	But there remain certain areas in the world which are not covered by any international agreement. According to present norms  territories colonized by the old colonial Powers must be decolonized—that is  they must be returned to the natives or the original inhabitants. United Nations concern on this issue is reflected in the permanent Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. However  there are still land areas which have neither natives nor settlers. There is therefore no one to inherit the land and to set up viable governments should the claims of the metropolitan Powers be given up. Because of this  little attention has been paid to these areas.36.	It is now time that the United Nations focused its attention on these areas  the largest of which is the continent of Antarctica. A number of countries have in the past sent expeditions there which have not limited themselves to mere scientific exploration but have gone on to claim huge wedges of Antarctica for their countries. Those countries are not depriving any natives of their lands  and they are therefore not required to decolonize. But the fact remains that those uninhabited lands do not legally belong to the dis¬coverers  just as the colonial territories do not belong to the colonial Powers. Like the seas and the sea-bed  those uninhabited lands belong to the international community. The countries now claiming them must give them up so that either the United Nations can administer those lands or the present occupants can act as trustees for the nations of the world. At present the exploitation of the resources of Antarctica is too costly and the technology is not yet available  but no doubt the day will come when Antarctica can provide the world with food and other resources for its development. It is only right that such exploita¬tion should benefit the poor nations as much as the rich.37.	Now that we have reached agreement on the law of the sea the United Nations must convene a meeting in order to define the problem of uninhabited lands  whether claimed or unclaimed  and to determine the rights of all nations to those lands. We are aware of the Antarctic Treaty ' concluded by a few nations  which provides for their co-operation for scientific research and prohibits non-peaceful activities. While there is some merit in this Treaty  it is nevertheless an agreement between a select group of countries and does not reflect 6he true feelings of the Members of the United Nations or their just claims. A new international agreement is required so that historical episodes are not made into facts to substantiate claims.38.	As I said at the beginning  the world is today beset by crises of various kinds. To believe otherwise would be to ignore the realities before us. It is imper¬ative that we take cognizance of this fact and mobilize all our efforts to overcome these crises. We can do this if we choose to  or we can let the opportunity slip by. Never before has human ingenuity in science and technology reached such a level of development as it has today. But we must use it wisely not in pursuit of sophisticated weaponry for purposes of war; we must instead harness it for peaceful and beneficial uses for the common good.39.	It is an imperiled world in which we are living  and we must put it right at all costs. This could come about if nations were willing effectively to implement past and future resolutions of the United Nations and related agencies  for this would not only help to restore the international community's confidence in the United Nations but also contribute to the reso¬lution of the current conflicts and crises. I urge all Members of the Organization to give their fullest co¬operation and all support towards this end so that international peace  stability and security may be achieved."
"98",5046,"NER",37,1982,"The annual gathering of representatives of virtually all the sovereign nations of the globe  and of affiliated or interested international institutions within the framework of the regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is always a source of great satisfaction and moral comfort to us. We see therein the signs of that ideal of tolerance which is inscribed in the Charter and which inspires us all  despite the different views we may hold about the various events which are at present rending the world. We also see therein the demonstration of our willingness to discuss our differences  not to say our divergences of opinion  and to seek together ways and means to solve or eliminate them.That ideal of tolerance and dialogue could hardly be symbolized more fittingly than by the gesture of the unanimous election of Mr. Hollai as President of the Assembly. Crowning his long diplomatic career  that choice constitutes a well-deserved tribute to his country  Hungary  for its positive contribution to mutual understanding among peoples and the strengthening of co-operation among States. Certainly  the reins which our President has taken over from Mr. Kittani of Iraq are difficult to hold firm. But we are convinced that his long and rich experience of world affairs  particularly in the United Nations system  will allow him to undertake the difficult task with the same wisdom  determination and efficiency as his talented predecessor  to whom I should again like to express the appreciation of the delegation of the Niger.The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is opening in an international context which is heavy with threats for all mankind  so true is it that the course of affairs of our world and the spirit guiding it remain dreadfully marked by violence  injustice  egoism  and ignorance or disregard of the principles and noble ideals which the United Nations adopted in its Charter in order to establish a world of peace and progress for all. Such a situation is likely  if care is not taken  to do serious and lasting harm to the credibility of the Organization—a credibility which is  moreover  increasingly being challenged by international public opinion  which is disturbed and anguished because of the results achieved by United Nations action in areas as vital for mankind as those of disarmament  development and the maintenance of peace and security.Each of our peoples aspires to live in a world free of wars and conflict  where hunger  sickness and poverty are unknown. The events of today seem to indicate that this prospect is further away than ever  consequently revealing the inability of the Organization  and of the system of international relations as a whole  to respond effectively to the political and economic challenges which confront us.In the political arena  that failure is even more serious because it relates to problems which are at least as old as the United Nations itself and which the international community has assumed a direct moral and historical responsibility to resolve. I refer here to the problems of Palestine and the Middle East and the question of Namibia. To be sure  the United Nations has formally recognized the legitimacy of the struggle for self- determination of the peoples of those countries by granting observer status to their legitimate representatives  the PLO and the South West Africa People's Organization. But the fact remains that any mention of Palestine and Namibia results in flagrant and unpunished violations of international rules and customs  brutal oppression  the denial of the rights of peoples to self-determination and the invasion and occupation of neighbouring States.With regard to the question of Palestine  it should be noted that the international community as a whole has now finally accepted that the Palestinian problem is at the head of the drama which is tearing the Middle East apart  and that any solution to that conflict must necessarily involve the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.The great majority of the States of our community recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as well as recognizing the absolute right of those people to self- determination and to the creation of a sovereign State on their own territory.There is also reason to recall that at the seventh emergency special session the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority resolution ES-7/2  an important resolution reaffirming the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination without foreign interference  as well as to independence and sovereignty  and stressing their right to create a sovereign State on their own national territory.Similarly  the international community has on many occasions  within the United Nations as well as in other international forums  condemned the continued occupation of Arab territories by Israel and  on the basis of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force  has called for its total and unconditional withdrawal.But we must today note that the international community has not been able to take any specific action to ensure that the Palestinian people can exercise their inalienable legitimate rights  to restore to Arab sovereignty the territories illegally occupied by Israel  and to guarantee the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. Thus far no action has been possible to halt the policy practised by Israel of systematic negation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the rights of the Arab and Lebanese people to peace and calm within their borders.It is a fact that Israel remains deaf to the disapproval  the constant appeals to reason and the condemnations of the international community. On the contrary  guided by hatred  blinded by military power  day after day displaying its growing for the decisions of the United Nations  Israel has adopted and is carrying out in an outrageous manner an unbridled policy of Judaization of Palestinian Arab lands through the modification of their geographic  historical  sociological and religious characteristics.Pursuing its expansionist policy  Israel has successively annexed the holy city of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  before launching its army upon the conquest of Lebanon  a large portion of whose territory is today occupied. At the same time  populations living in the occupied Arab territories are pitilessly subjected to ferocious repression which nothing can justify.Recent events in Lebanon  which in fact represent only a single episode in the strategy of conquest pursued by the Israeli State  prove—if any proof were needed—that neither vehement protests nor energetic condemnations are enough to thwart a genocidal undertaking which discredits the action of the United Nations as much as it makes guilty by omission almost the entire international community.In the light of this holocaust of our time  faced with this great tragedy  it demeans the international community that its representatives continue to cling to their well-known positions and to conduct byzantine discussions on the texts of resolutions which  when adopted  remain dead letters. The memory of thousands of Palestinian martyrs and of the innocent victims of Sabra and Shatila cry cut to us  and call for decisive action from us to restore the usurped rights of the Palestinian people.Against that background  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  whose thirteenth session of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs the Niger was greatly honoured to host  urges all the States which love peace  liberty  justice and progress to work collectively within the United Nations for the adoption and implementation by the Security Council of a new resolution requiring in precise terms the Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  including the holy city of A! Quds  and the guaranteeing of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  namely  their right to return to their homeland  Palestine; their right to determine their own fate without foreign interference; and their right to establish an independent State on their national territory  under the leadership of the PLO.Furthermore  we believe that a sincere use of the way courageously opened by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez in September of this year  will allow the international community to restore its image in the eyes of the Palestinian people and of history. We say that in the hope that the constructive peace proposals unanimously adopted at Fez will be accepted by Israel and will not suffer the same fate which South Africa dealt to the United Nations plan for Namibia—another situation which persists and seriously concerns my Government owing to the threats it represents for the security of the African continent and for world peace.The situation prevailing in Namibia is known to everyone. It is a situation which is clearly illegal and exceptionally painful for the Namibian people which is enduring it and fighting for its freedom; it is painful for the front-line States which  because of their support for that liberation struggle  expose themselves to repeated acts of aggression by South Africa; and it is painful for the United Nations  which has an historic direct responsibility for Namibia. Inspired both by its own foreign policy and the principles of the Organization of African Unity of the Niger intends  just as all of independent Africa  to draw attention once again to that situation and to the proposal of a rapid solution for the Namibian problem. It does so in the name of law and legality  in the name of morality and justice  and for the benefit of peace and international security.The hope raised by the United Nations plan for Namibia has still not been realized. In spite of information showing notable progress in negotiations for the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  we note that five years after the adoption of that plan by the United Nations the electoral system has not yet been defined  the composition of the United Nations forces has not yet been agreed upon  and the cease-fire has not yet been decreed.During this time South Africa has  with impunity  continued its illegal occupation of Namibian territory  its pillage of its natural resources  and its outrageous acts of aggression against neighbouring countries. Through manoeuvres which now no longer deceive anyone it is attempting to promote the establishment of institutions and bodies which would alter the authenticity of Namibia's independence into something artificial.The racist minority regime of Pretoria  strengthened by solid complicity  continues to flout and defy the international community under fallacious pretexts and with unreasonable demands. Therefore the United Nations is confronted with a deadlock in Namibia  responsibility for which lies entirely with South Africa—and no consideration  in particular one related to Angola's sovereignty  can hide that fact which was emphasized on 4 September at Lusaka by the heads of State and Government of the front-line States.The Government of the Niger reiterates most energetically its condemnation of the illegal and continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa and its repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States. We hope that the international community will display the necessary upsurge of political will to lead Namibia to independence and thus allow the surrounding countries to work for their own economic and social development. In this context  it is important for the United Nations to think about establishing a massive aid programme for those countries which today are heroically bearing the burden of the unjust war imposed upon them by the racist regime in Pretoria.The African peoples also expect of the international community in general and from the United Nations in particular energetic action to eradicate the apartheid and racial discrimination that are rife in the southern part of the African continent. They fervently hope and wish for the establishment in South Africa of political conditions that would allow everyone  without any consideration as to race  sex  language or religion  to participate in the building of a multiracial community like the one which is today being built in Zimbabwe  a country which formerly suffered from the evils of racial discrimination. The achievement of such conditions will allow the African countries to devote their efforts to the improvement of the living conditions of their peoples at this particular juncture in the international economic situation when things are already particularly difficult and continue to worsen.The world economy is today in a critical state of disruption which many meetings held in various parts of the world on the question have not been able to prevent. Those stages—New York  Geneva  Vienna  Paris  Cancun  Versailles and many others—have been glimmers of Hope quickly dashed. The disintegration of the economy has reached such levels that any prognosis today would be daring or haphazard. No one is attempting to do that  neither Governments nor even international financial and economic institutions. Everywhere in the world one envisages the future with pessimism. In this climate of gloom  concern and almost panic  the fate of developing countries  and especially the poorest among them  is particularly alarming.As channels for a limited group of export commodities  developing countries today are facing a marked deterioration in their terms of trade—an evil which they have fought for many years now without success. They are therefore facing a catastrophic dwindling of their export revenues. At the same time  high interest rates on the main international financial markets and the rise in the value of the dollar have increased their loan and debt-servicing costs. They can only watch as the standard of living of their peoples drops sharply owing to galloping inflation.Their export revenues have plummeted  the cost of borrowing and servicing the debt has soared; they have been compelled to slow down the pace of implementation of their development programmes—or to make agonizing revisions. In some cases that has led to the cancellation of those programmes; in others  such as Chad  the effects of a long and disastrous war  added to those of the economic crisis  have created an even more tragic situation which only a vast international programme can remedy.That is the very similar picture which we find  with varying degrees of intensity  in the world economy today  from North to South  East to West  in the countries of the periphery as well as those at the centre. The destabilizing effects  internally and internationally  of such a situation can be easily foreseen. In this connection and stressing that this difficult situation largely stems from the fact that international financial and economic structures have not adapted to the demands of the present world  President Seyni Kountche said the following at the thirty- sixth session of the General Assembly:""We shall spare the world from a very damaging economic confrontation only if together we overhaul North-South relations and work together for a more unified approach to the development of the world and for the well-being of mankind.""The wealthy countries should become aware of that requirement and  although they  too  are affected by the crisis  they must understand that the recovery of their economy for which their citizens long require decisive action in favour of developing countries. The modalities of such action e been laid down by representatives in various international forums from Cancun to Toronto; but  for various reasons  the proposals that have been made have not been completely taken into account. People continue to maintain that a considerable increase in the capital of the two main international financial institutions is not needed. Some even continue to advocate limiting the relevant credit facilities for deprived peoples. There is certainly a basically negative and selfish attitude involved; it is embodied in the position of those who prevent ail progress towards the establishment of a more just and equitable new international economic order.The various economic conferences held in recent years  both within the framework of the United Nations and in other international bodies  have all shown the need for a reorganization of the present international economic and financial structures. In the light of the serious crisis which is shaking the world economy today  a restructuring of the present order has become a categorical imperative if we wish to spare mankind painful turmoil. We must accept the fact that no nation represented in this Hall  however powerful it may be  can reasonably think that it can do without the others. Attempts to seek isolated solutions to the serious economic problems of our world today are unquestionably doomed to failure. The concept of the interdependence of nations is today more than ever before of special significance.In this connection we find in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization relevant comments on the development of United Nations action along such lines  because no organ is better able than this one  despite its insufficiencies and limitations  to offer the possibility of fostering a spirit of harmony  interdependence  solidarity and co-operation among nations.I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for the clear and courageous manner in which he analysed the deep-rooted causes of the disorder in the present system of multilateral relations and set out certain guidelines which could be used as a basis for innovative action on the part of the Organization to establish a world order capable of meeting the aspirations of the peoples to peace  justice  freedom and economic and social progress.We are ready to play our part in this major battle  because we are aware that this is a question of saving the world from the cataclysm which lies in wait. As for the Niger  as has been stressed here by President Seyni Kountche ""we are ardent supporters of peace  tireless workers for good-neighbourliness and fervent apostles of dialogue and understanding among nations""."
"99",5091,"NGA",37,1982,"On behalf of the people and Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  I extend to Mr. Hollai our warmest congratulations on his election to and assumption of the office of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His election is eloquent testimony to his admirable personal qualities as well as an honour to the Hungarian People's Republic  with which  happily  my country  Nigeria  enjoys very cordial relations. I am quite confident that under his able and wise guidance  our deliberations at this session will be resoundingly successful. I assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation in the discharge of the heavy responsibilities of his office. May I also pay a tribute to his predecessor in office  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  who presided over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with great dedication and distinction. The able manner in which he guided the proceedings of the thirty-sixth session when grave issues of war and peace were at stake is a credit to him and to his country  Iraq. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his well-deserved election to the exalted post of Secretary-General. His election is thoroughly deserved. It is not only a personal achievement for him and for his country  but one in which we of the third world can collectively take justifiable pride. In the short time he has been in office  Mr. Perez de Cuellar has already shown great courage and a strong commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We are indeed fortunate to have the services of such a distinguished and accomplished international statesman. He has assumed office at a most difficult period in the life of the United Nations  when confrontation has replaced detente in relations between the super-Powers  when the world economy is sinking into depression and when naked aggression rather than peaceful coexistence and respect for sovereignty has become the order of the day in international relations. I pledge to him the full support of my delegation in the execution of the onerous task placed on his shoulders.The rapid and seemingly inexorable deterioration in international relations is of great concern to my delegation. Many of the global issues that have plagued the Organization for many years have persisted in the unwholesome atmosphere of confrontation and repeated aggression. There is no doubt that the great majority of nations are dedicated to peace. Nevertheless  one is left with the sad feeling that all our efforts are an exercise in futility since none of the major issues of our time appears to have been resolved. The litany of political and economic crises which now plague the world is formidable and spans every region of the world.Detente between the super-Powers has suffered a severe setback. There has been a resurgence of cold war attitudesóa situation which has been further aggravated by the virtual state of collapse of the international economic system. The spirit of internationalism and the interdependence of nations of the world have been gravely impaired. Nations  particularly the big Powers  are now resorting increasingly to the use or threat of use of force in defense of what they perceive to be their national interests. The provisions of the Charter on the settlement of international disputes and on the maintenance of international peace and security are being brushed aside and ignored by the big Powers in pursuit of their narrow interests.In this present climate of uncertainty  the Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  called Car measures to strengthen the peace-keeping machinery of the United Nations system and to develop the United Nations as a more effective and viable instrument for resolving disputes among States. He has called our attention to the propensity of the big Powers to bypass the United Nations whenever it suits them and to the necessity to return to the United Nations as the primary international negotiating forum. His warnings are timely and should be heeded by all Member States.We are gravely concerned in particular about the areas of tension which continue to exist in Africa. We attach the utmost importance to peace and stability in Africa  without which our efforts to develop our countries will continue to be frustrated. We are concerned about the continued intervention in African affairs of the big Powers and their attempt to turn Africa into a cold-war theatre. Africa's efforts to solve its problems in Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa continue to be undermined by the intervention of the big Powers. We deplore and view with resentment these unwarranted interventions in our internal affairs and the consequent intensification of intra-African disputes. Whenever it has seemed we are close to a peaceful settlement of disputes among African States  the process of peace has been gravely weakened and undermined by the intervention of extra-African Powers. Weapons of mass destruction continue to find their way into our continent in the guise of foreign military assistance. In order to maintain their hegemony in Africa  the big Powers have resorted to so- called military assistance  which has increased sharply over all other forms of aid in recent years. In addition  there has been an insidious attempt by external forces to weaken and destroy our continental organization  the OAU  which they regard as inimical to their dominant influence in our continent. The fact is the OAU  now facing a serious assault by our detractors  has contributed immensely to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region. By bringing Africa together and forging bonds of unity within the continent  the OAU has contributed to the fulfilment of provisions of the Charter of the United Nations on the role of regional organizations in resolving regional disputes.Let me assure our detractors now plotting daily the demise of our organization that we will emerge from our present crisis stronger than ever. In the past our continental organization has demonstrated its resilience and capacity by withstanding several serious internal crises. Africa remains committed to the maintenance and continued stability of its continental organization  and collectively we are determined to repair the damage and the setback which it has recently suffered.My delegation is extremely disturbed and distressed by the stalemate in the negotiations on the independence of Namibia. I believe that we have shown the utmost restraint and understanding in the negotiations with the contact group. It is not necessary to go over the ground covered in those negotiations. However  it is necessary to remind the Assembly that apartheid  South Africa's Mandate over Namibia  has been terminated by the United Nations and the international Court of Justice. South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia is illegal and in defiance of the unanimous decision of the Assembly  which gives protection to all nations.The greatest threat to the survival of the United Nations is the absolute disregard of its decisions by a few recalcitrant nations. The saddest aspect of the tragedy being played out in the southern African region is that the apartheid regime draws comfort  solace and support from the same countries as arrogate to themselves the role of defender of democratic freedoms. How can those Western countries explain to the world why  in spite of resolution 435 (1978)  sponsored by the contact group  adopted by the Security Council and unanimously endorsed by the General Assembly  effective pressure cannot be brought to bear on South Africa to withdraw from Namibia as a prelude to the implementation of the United Nations peace plan for Namibia?Last year the impression was created that the Namibia issue was very near solution. It is now crystal clear to all that a peaceful solution of the Namibian problem is as far away as ever. It is now obvious to us that the strategy is to wear us down to a point where we shall throw up our hands and say: ""We have tried. Let Namibia fend for itself."" This strategy fails to take account of the tide of history  of our resolve to rid our continent of the last lingering vestiges of colonialism and oppression  and of our rendezvous with destiny.A tenuous effort is being made to predicate the independence of Namibia on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. This is unfortunate  and we reject this unwarranted and arrogant demand; it has nothing to do with the legitimate right of Namibia to self-determination. Right now South Africa is occupying by force a portion of the territory of the independent State of Angola  which the foreign forces are there to protect. But for the decision which Angola took  in the exercise of its sovereignty  to invite the foreign forces 	South Africa would have recolonized it. We call upon the Western Powers to support the principle of self-determination for Namibia as a demonstration of their sincerity. We maintain that South Africa's occupation of Namibia is illegal  as well as contemptuous of the United Nations. We believe that the people of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  are entitled to their freedom and the pursuit of happiness. We shall persist in this belief and we shall continue to fight for this belief until our brothers in Namibia are free.Inside South Africa the racist regime has intensified its reign of terror against the blacks of that country  who are still being denied their basic freedoms. Repression and suppression of the blacks have continued with unabated rigour. We have warned often enough that the racist policies of the apartheid regime represent a grave danger to peace and stability  not only in Africa but throughout the world; for peace and freedom are indivisible. The world cannot be truly free and peaceful when parts of it remain in bondage. Africa is committed to the eradication of racism in South Africa. Nor will it be deterred by the attempts of the racist regime to destabilize and undermine the independence of its neighbours. We call on the Assembly to redouble its efforts and bring the necessary pressure to bear on the apartheid regime by imposing economic sanctions on it. Each time we call for economic sanctions against South Africa certain Western countries demur on the ground that sanctions do not work. When  however  the vital interests of the West are at stake sanctions are invoked  as they have been over Afghanistan  Poland and the Falkland Islands.The present parlous state of the world economy is a vindication of the warning that many developing countries have issued for many years from this rostrum. Today  in every country of the world  the term ""depression"" is very well understood. At this time last year we were describing the economic phenomenon that we were experiencing as recession. This year we call it depression. Very few countries have registered any appreciable growth in their economic activities during the past year; as a matter of fact  the economies of most countries have been badly ravaged. The consequences of this decline in economic activity are massive unemployment  incredibly high levels of global inflation  high debt-servicing ratio for many developing countries  sharp falls in commodity prices  unstable exchange rates and protectionism in international trade. The slow-down in economic activity is global. The present state of the world economy provides ample proof that our economies are interdependent.Agriculture has all but collapsed in many parts of Africa  due in part to drought and  of course  to the unreasonably low commodity prices  including the high cost of agricultural machinery. The fact is that many countries in Africa spend a significant portion of their meagre foreign exchange earnings on massive food importations to stave off hunger. Very few developing countries can afford  after paying for food imports  to buy capital goods for industries. The net result is that developed countries are able to market only a small proportion of their manufactured goods in these countries  and so the vicious economic circle persists.The reluctance of the developed countries to embrace the new international economic order so necessary for combatting the global economic crisis is deeply regrettable.We are convinced that the present negative trends in the world economy can be reversed. Since they affect all countries  action should be taken collectively to resolve them. It is therefore a matter of deep regret that the prevailing mood in the developed economies today is a negative one  as illustrated by declines in the flow of official development assistance  a clearly expressed preference for bilateralism over multilateralism which has seriously undermined the integrity of the multilateral institutions of the United Nations and  of course  the lack of encouraging progress in negotiations on various questions relating to international economic co-operation for development. These trends undermine the development process of developing countries  but events have also shown that the short-sighted and unilateral policies pursued by certain developed countries are self-defeating even for those countries.Without losing sight of the need for a fundamental restructuring of the world economy  my delegation would like to join in the call already made for reviving the waning spirit of international economic co-operation in the interest of steady global development and in particular the accelerated development of developing countries. My delegation is of the view that opportunities for further enhancing international economic relations still exist. It is auspicious that two international meetings on trade and development are scheduled to take place within the next few months  namely  the GATT Ministerial Meeting next November and the sixth session of UNCTAD in mid- 1983. My delegation believes that these meetings can contribute immensely to the reactivation of international trade and improved trading prospects for developing countries  if the countries of the North will show a more positive attitude regarding the evident need to make the necessary structural adjustments.Similarly  the present structure of international monetary and financial institutions leaves much to be desired and calls for urgent reforms. My delegation does not underestimate the contribution being  made by international financial institutions  such as the World Bank group  to the development of developing countries; but there are also many areas requiring a better response by these institutions to the special needs of developing countries. The very stiff conditionally of International Monetary Fund lending  for instance  is resented by developing countries. While we are not suggesting that the principles of sound financial management should be compromised  we can see no advantage in the application of medicine which leaves the patient either worse off than before or dead.With the present credit squeeze unlikely to ease immediately  the need for expanding the capital base of the World Bank has become more urgent. It is also timely to underline the inadequacy of present development aid  as the performance of donor countries has not gone beyond one half of the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product solemnly agreed to in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. We urge them  therefore  not only to step up official assistance to the poorer nations but also to ensure that an increasing proportion of that assistance flows through the development organizations of the United Nations system  which are currently experiencing critical resources problems.The development problems which confront the international community today call for prompt and equitable solutions. Important initiatives need to be taken with a view to alleviating the critical food shortages in several developing countries  the slow pace of their industrialization  and the low level of technological attainment  for which the speedy conclusion of negotiations for the international code of conduct on the transfer of technology and the establishment of long-term arrangements of the United Nations financing system for science and technology for development acquire special significance.A feeling of despair and despondency must be avoided  despite the present mood. We should not  in fact  overlook the bright spots in international cooperation which  happily  have resulted from certain efforts by the developing countries.Last year  much was said about the epoch- making event of establishing a systematic framework for the promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries  through the adoption of the Caracas Programme of Action. My delegation is gratified to note that that initiative has been further consolidated over the past few months  through concrete action aimed at the mutual economic advancement of States members of the Group of 77. We believe that this process will contribute to the strengthening of the individual and collective self-reliance of developing countries.All countries  developed and developing  must show a positive determination to grapple with the present economic problems in a global and concerted manner. In this connection my delegation recognizes the need for ongoing negotiations in various international forums to proceed unhindered and with the requisite good will and understanding  particularly by the industrialized countries. We hope it will be possible to launch global negotiations at this session of the General Assembly  especially as much precious time has been lost over peripheral issues  apparently to gain certain advantages  when what is needed is for every party to go to the negotiating table with an open mind. Now  my delegation hopes that with the flexibility and spirit of compromise shown by the Group of 77 through the proposal submitted last June  our partners will be more forthcoming on the question of launching the global negotiations without further delay. Three years after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 34/138  it is surely time the international community took that long-awaited step for laying the basis for a more just system of international economic relations  capable of supporting the steady growth of the world economy and particularly the accelerated and self-reliant development of developing countries.In June this year Nigeria participated in the deliberations of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  in the hope that ways and means could be found to halt and reverse the extremely costly and dangerous arms race. After five weeks of intensive negotiations we discovered to our utter disappointment that the nuclear-weapon States  in particular  were neither willing nor ready to listen to the voice of reason and sanity. We recall the massive demonstration last June in New York against the immense danger which nuclear weapons pose to human survival. We listened to representatives of innumerable non-governmental organizations voicing their fears that the current trend of the arms race might result in nuclear war by accident  miscalculation or even design. We should not be insensitive to those justified fears of humanity.Yet what did we achieve after five weeks of debate and negotiations? We have neither halted the arms race nor set in motion a single disarmament measure. It is true that at the second special session devoted to disarmament the General Assembly launched the World Disarmament Campaign and increased the United Nations Fellowship Programme on Disarmament from 20 annual awards to 25. Those modest achievements scarcely touched the heart of the matter. Year after year  we helplessly watch the world's military budget leap to higher and higher levels. It is now of the order of $US 650 billion annually. Not one nuclear Power believes that its nuclear and conventional stockpile of arms has attained the optimum level necessary to guarantee its security. It is obvious that the more sophisticated and enormous the quantum of armaments at the disposal of each State  the less secure the State possessing such arms feels. What purpose is there in pursuing at such colossal cost an unattainable mirage? The world feels more insecure today than at any other time in the past.The increasing reliance of nations on force rather than on negotiations and the good offices of the United Nations for the peaceful settlement of disputes is the root cause of our feelings of insecurity  coupled with the economic disaster  which has afflicted all nations. While the world spends more than $US 650 billion yearly on armaments  mass unemployment  hunger  disease and ignorance take a heavy toll on two thirds of the world's population. It is a great indictment of our sense of social justice that our fellow human beings in the third world should die of hunger and of disease that we could wipe out at minimal cost  just because our misplaced sense of security compels us to spend billions of dollars on armaments which breed more fear and insecurity.If those vast sums of money currently ploughed into the unproductive arms race were channelled into the economic and social sectors  their multiplier effect would result in vast social and economic activities that would provide millions of jobs  demolish protectionism in trade  expand demand and bring back prosperity to all parts of the world.Is it not grossly immoral for the nuclear Powers to destroy us in a war intended to expand their spheres of influence? Our greatest desire is for peace in the world  especially on the part of peace-loving peoples who have no expansionist ambitions or designs. As we are firmly convinced that it is impossible to limit a nuclear war or to win it  we affirm that the only realistic option is to prevent it. That is why we have repeatedly advocated a nuclear freeze as a first step towards significant nuclear disarmament. We are motivated by the desire to halt the dangerous arms race that is inexorably dragging the world towards self-extinction. We are inclined to believe that a measure of parity has been achieved in the destructive power of the two blocs and that neither side  fully aware of the fact that it cannot win a nuclear war  will be so propelled by a death-wish as to launch a nuclear attack. My delegation therefore calls upon the super-Powers to agree to a freeze  followed by a verifiable comprehensive test ban leading to talks on arms reduction. With good will and faith neither side will find this process detrimental to its national interests.While we were busy deliberating on the great threat to our survival posed by the rapid buildup of lethal weapons  the devastating war machine of Israel was reducing large areas of Lebanon to rubble with disastrous consequences for the lives of innocent human beings unfortunate enough to reside in that region of the Middle East. The Israelis  in an arrogant display of power  callously ignored the pleas of the Organization for a halt to that butchery. For four long months  the Israelis laid waste the sovereign State of Lebanon in utter contempt of the resolutions of the Security Council calling for a cease-fire. In historical perspective  that barbaric act of Israel's is reminiscent of the Nazi ""final solution of the Jewish question"". The expansionist propensity of Israel and its penchant for settling disputes by force are inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. The horror of the massacre at Sabra and Shatila sends chills down the spine. For a people that has gone through the horrible crucible of a genocide to be associated  even in a distant way  with the pogrom of Sabra and Shatila is a sad irony of history.We believe that the Israelis are entitled to secure borders within the State of Israel. However  Israel's persistent refusal to realize that it cannot continue to enjoy legitimacy and rights based on the Organization's Partition Plan for Palestine and  at the same time  deny corresponding legitimacy and rights of nationhood under the same plan to the Palestinians is the greatest obstacle to any lasting peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian Arabs must and should be enabled to have their own independent sovereign State. Nigeria firmly supports the legitimate right of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own.It is a matter tor regret that the fratricidal and unnecessary war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  two non-aligned States  still lingers on in spite of the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to put an end to it. We once again call upon our friends in Iran and Iraq to throw aside the weapons of war and strive to settle their differences by peaceful means. . We are also gravely concerned over the intensification of other local and regional conflicts in Latin America and Asia and the immense suffering imposed on the peoples of those regions by the conflicts. As a non-aligned country  Nigeria condemns all foreign intervention in the internal affairs of the States in those regions. We support fully the efforts of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to consolidate their national sovereignty and to develop their political and economic systems  without undue foreign intervention or pressure on them.In conclusion  let us resolve to adhere to the provisions of the Charter by faithfully abiding by the decisions of all organs of the United Nations. Let us resolve to eschew force in the settlement of our disputes. Let us strive to be open and candid in our bilateral and multilateral relations  so as to create an atmosphere of trust in which peace will reign supreme and the Organization will blossom."
"100",5137,"NIC",37,1982,"236 Sir  I should like first of all to congratulate you and the noble country you represent on the occasion of your well-deserved election as President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are certain that  given your diplomatic skill  wisdom and even-handedness  you will provide excellent leadership for the work before us. Also  we wish to congratulate Mr. Kittani for the skill and tact with which he presided over the tasks of the sessions of the General Assembly held throughout this particularly difficult year. We extend special recognition to the Secretary-General for his outstanding efforts in the short  yet troubled  period in which he has held his post.237.	In this general discussion  it is customary to review the most important developments on the international scene. Year after year  we deplore—almost ritualistically—new and old problems that threaten international peace and security. But this year  a new and exceedingly grave threat has aggravated the situation. I refer specifically to the threat to world peace and security represented by the fatalistic resignation by ever-growing numbers of people and  in particular  by Governments  in the face of genocide  hunger and misery  and even in the face of the possibility of a nuclear holocaust.238.	Confronted with the most tense and fragile international situation since 1945  at this session the General Assembly is called upon to reflect most profoundly. The persistence of old sources of tension and the emergence of new ones  in addition to symptoms that the current structures for maintaining stability are becoming worn out  lead us to the inescapable conclusion that the pre-conditions for peace do not exist. Indeed  there can be no peace if the vast majority of the inhabitants of this planet are without bread  education  decent housing  security and political rights. There can be no peace without justice. There can be no peace while certain countries cling to outmoded systems of domination and dependence and stubbornly endeavour to prevent third world countries at all costs from adopting measures they consider imperative and necessary to overcome underdevelopment and want in the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence. Peace is impossible  so long as the powerful maintain their arrogant stance of demanding that developing countries act in accordance with imperial interests and in detriment to the interests of their own peoples.239.	How can there be peace when 40 per cent of the third world population is denied the right to read and write? How can there be peace when the vast majority of mankind is struggling to overcome hunger and misery t while a tiny minority invests enormous resources in weapons to be used against those demanding justice?240.	How can we not acknowledge that we are facing the most serious economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s  with world per capita income not making the slightest advance since 1981 and with the prospect of a decline in 1982? How can there be peace while countries and entire continents are fighting not simply for economic growth but for mere survival? Our countries are calling for a new economic order wherein the developed countries do not correct their own problems of stagnation  inflation and unemployment at the expense of the developing world.241.	In this setting Latin America has felt the need to lay the groundwork for a strategy for independence and security. At the eighth regular meeting of the Council of the Latin American Economic System  held this past August in Caracas  our countries reasserted the sovereign right of all nations to adopt their own path in the economic  social and political fields in peace and free from pressure  aggression and external threats.242.	In Managua  the seventeenth Regional Conference for Latin America of FAO also urged the creation of security machinery in terms of foodstuffs in order to decrease the vulnerability of Latin American and Caribbean nations with regard to one or several industrialized countries. And  in Toronto  on the occasion of the Joint Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  our country  on behalf of Latin America  the Philippines and Spain  voiced its opposition to intervention by certain institutions in the system of economic organization of countries in need of assistance. Warning was given of the dangers involved in the setting of more and more conditions  in the rising cost of credit and in the threat contained in the questioning of the very importance of international co-operation.243.	With regard to international co-operation  we wish to go on record as voicing concern at the tendency of some developed countries not to abide by the commitments that they have undertaken vis-a-vis UNDP  thus making the progress of important projects already under way much more difficult.244.	Just as indicative of the current indifference to mankind's vital interests is the impudence of those that try to hide the consequences of nuclear conflict. Illogically  they try to make us believe that such a conflict could be confined to a given geographical area. It has reached the point where the world's most formidable military Power is proclaiming that there are issues more important than peace and that force is a legitimate instrument in attaining its objectives of domination and political hegemony.245.	This reckless policy of the current United States Administration has made its own citizens and the peoples of the world contemplate the danger of a nuclear confrontation. In this context  it should not surprise us that the anti-nuclear movement has attained such massive and broad dimensions—even in the United States itself—although this outcry  as has unfortunately become the rule  is not reflected in decisions of Governments  as evidenced by the paltry results of the recent second special session devoted to disarmament.246.	Just a few months ago Latin America suffered colonialist military aggression by an extra-continental Power  which threatens the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a sister nation. We refer  of course  to the British invasion of the Malvinas Islands  the true origin of which can be found in the United Kingdom's stubborn attempt to perpetuate an anachronistic colonial situation on our continent. The aggression against the Republic of Argentina was possible only thanks to the military  economic and political support that the United States supplied to the aggressor nation—support which astonished Latin Americans  support that unmasked the United States conception of the reciprocal defence treaties and the true motives that led the United States to sign them.247.	In numerous General Assembly resolutions and resolutions of other United Nations bodies it has been said in clear-cut terms that the Malvinas issue is a colonial one that must be resolved. Twenty Latin American foreign ministers requested that this situation be discussed at this session of the Assembly  because they wanted to make it absolutely clear that the cause of the Malvinas Islands is also the cause of Latin America  and that a resumption of negotiations leading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict on the basis of United Nations resolutions is imperative.248.	The principle of solidarity compels us to unite with our African brothers and sisters in the defence of Namibia's right to independence. We reject all the manoeuvres aimed at creating a puppet Government in Namibia. We demand full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the recognition of SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the heroic people of Namibia. We denounce the campaign launched by the Reagan Administration to deprive Angola of its inalienable right of self-defence and to the assistance it needs to repel South Africa's attacks. We are certain that neither this policy of Mack-mail nor the stationing of thousands of racist troops along Angola's frontier  nor the attempts to destabilize the front-line States  especially Mozambique  nor the use of mercenaries to overthrow Governments  as happened in Seychelles  can weaken the clear determination of those peoples to defend their sovereignty and to ensure sovereignty for Namibia.249.	We condemn the aggressive policy of the racist regime of South Africa against neighbouring States  a policy which is the logical outgrowth of its own criminal apartheid system. We reaffirm what our non-aligned movement has stated on numerous occasions  namely  that there can be no peace  stability and security in southern Africa until the oppressive and illegal apartheid regime is totally eradicated. We are as one in solidarity with the labour leaders imprisoned and condemned to death by the diabolical racist regime  in flagrant violation of the most elementary human rights. The United Nations must step up its campaign to prevent them from being executed and to win their release.250. The entire world has witnessed the brutal aggression of which the Republic of Lebanon has been the victim  and in which atrocities comparable only to the ""final solution"" policy pursued by the Nazi regime were committed. It is appropriate to recall  in such circumstances  that Hitler's Germany started that catastrophe with its policy of territorial expansionism  which was followed by the mass extermination of human beings  and that one of its principal victims was the Jewish people itself. Today  to the world's consternation  the leaders of those who survived genocide and the concentration camps are to be found promoting acts of genocide and building concentration camps with the objective of exterminating the heroic Palestinian people.25l. The horrors which have occurred in the Palestinian refugee camps  the indiscriminate massacring of the civilian population of Beirut and the denial of people's most elementary legal rights led the Government Junta of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua to break the only remaining link we still had with Israel  that is  the fiction of diplomatic relations  all genuine ties having been severed upon the triumph of our Revolution. It was the least Nicaragua could do to express its categorical repudiation and total non-recognition of the Zionist regime and at the same time its militant support for the Palestinian combatants and their sole legitimate representative  the PLO  and the long-suffering people of Lebanon.252.	We feel it necessary to denounce  moreover  the open complicity of a great Power in the barbarism unleashed by the Zionist forces in Lebanon. That Power gave the Zionist regime its full political  military and economic support  thus ensuring that the crimes committed would go unpunished and  which is even more shameful  systematically blocked the Security Council's efforts to restore peace  proclaiming that it alone was capable of controlling the monster which it had itself encouraged and which it had always defended.253.	Those events demonstrate clearly that the problem of the Middle East can be resolved only by recognizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to self-determination  to return to their homeland and to set up their own State. The international community must step up its efforts to prevent the policy of force and occupation practised by Israel from prevailing in that area of the world  a policy which could have the fatal corollary of the physical extermination of the Palestinian people. Equally evident is the fact that the Middle East crisis will be capable of solution only when the United States abandons its policy of protecting those guilty of crime  terrorism and genocide and stops thwarting United Nations efforts  in particular those of the Secretary-General and the Security Council  to carry out the mandate set forth in the Charter.254.	Speaking as a member of the non-aligned movement and as a revolutionary nation  we wish to voice our solidarity with all the countries and peoples fighting to win or to preserve their independence: with the people of Cyprus  seeking to exercise their right to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation; with Grenada and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  defending their sovereignty against imperialism; with the sister Republic of Cuba demanding the return of illegally occupied Guantanamo —and we condemn in the strongest possible terms the blockade and constant threats against that country. We join the brother people and Government of Panama in their just demand that the Torrijos-Carter treaties be implemented.255.	We rejoice with the people of Bolivia over their nation's return to legality and democracy. We extend our solidarity to the people of Puerto Rico and support their right to independence and self-determination in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  recalling the fact that the problem facing the Puerto Rican people but that it is  rather  a matter that concerns Latin America  to which Puerto Rico is an undeniable part. We support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their nation free from foreign intervention.256.	Nicaragua reaffirms its support of the appeal issued by the non-aligned movement with regard to Western Sahara for the parties concerned to enter into negotiations immediately in order to reach a just and lasting solution—that conflict in keeping with the provisions of resolution 1514 (XV) and the principles of our movement  with the decisions adopted by the OAU and with the principles of the Charter.257.	We welcome the efforts made by the States of South-East Asia to begin a dialogue leading to the re-establishment of peace and stability in that region. We welcome as well the positions and appeals with regard to South-West Asia adopted by the non-aligned movement at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at New Delhi.258.	The worsening of the international situation cannot be separated from the grave crisis affecting the Organization. That is why we welcome the frankness with which the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization acknowledges that the United Nations is being ignored by some countries  and we support the recommendations he makes aimed at strengthening the Organization and  in particular  at strengthening the authority of the Security Council to prevent conflicts and revitalize the system of international security. In this connection  it is worth stressing that the use of the veto to thwart the condemnation of terror  aggression and genocide must no longer be tolerated  so that being in Washington's good graces is not interpreted as a green light to violate the fundamental principles of the Charter and the most basic norms of law.259.	It should be a matter of profound concern to the international community that a permanent member of the Security Council tends to turn increasingly to the veto in detriment to the just proposals for peace advanced  with a lofty sense of responsibility  by Governments in the most troubled regions of the world. In specific terms  we wish to refer to the Reagan Administration's decision to veto the draft resolution regarding Central America submitted by Panama and Guyana on 2 April of this year  a draft resolution that confined itself simply to reaffirming the illegality of the use of force or the threat of force in relations between States and that called for dialogue between all parties concerned.260.	Nicaragua believes there is no justification whatsoever for the Reagan Administration's attitude towards our country and the Central American region. We deem it absurd to portray us as a threat to the United States for having chosen  in the exercise of our sovereign rights  an independent political path within the framework of the most scrupulous non-alignment. It is even more absurd to try to blame Nicaragua for all the problems Central American countries are enduring  problems whose origins and true causes can be found solely and exclusively in the constant postponement of appropriate solutions. This is a situation the peoples of Central America seem unwilling to go on tolerating indefinitely  despite the fact that the United States continues to oppose any changes that might result in greater independence for the States of Central America.261.	We have stressed—and we do so here once again—that the Nicaraguan Government genuinely desires an understanding with the United States that would make it possible substantially to improve the relations between our two States on the basis of mutual respect  non-intervention in internal affairs and  above all  on the basis of sovereign equality  independence and self-determination—principles that constitute the foundation of peace and stability in the world and that are found throughout the Charter.262.	Guided by our unshakeable devotion to peace  we have presented to the Reagan Administration a number of different approaches for initiating dialogue  reiterating time and again our invitation to hold high-level meetings between representatives of our States in the hope of avoiding the putting into effect of the threats of the use offence against Nicaragua.263.	Unfortunately  the response of the United States Government to date has been to attempt to impose upon us its rigid East-West outlook  a combination of economic pressures  accusations and threats culminating in the financing of covert destabilizing activities and the open use of its territory for the training of counter-revolutionary forces and for the preparation of actions of a criminal nature against Nicaragua. The financial and organizational assistance the Reagan Administration is lending the enemies of our people has led to an increase in terrorist acts and armed assaults on our national territory and to a substantial increase in the weaponry  personnel and organization provided to the counter-revolutionary forces. Those forces have been supplied with sophisticated means of warfare used solely by professional armies—such as those found in the wake of the evidenced blowing up and sabotaging of two strategic bridges near the border with Honduras and as evidenced by the use of armed aircraft in attempts to destroy our only oil refinery and the fuel stores located at the port of Corinto on the Pacific coast. To round out this distressing picture  we cannot avoid mentioning the presence of United States warships in our territorial waters  the overflights of spy planes and the holding of joint military manoeuvres with the Honduran army near our borders.264.	Guided by our firm determination to consolidate peace in our region  our Government has taken part in and promoted the search for solutions which would permit an understanding among the Central American countries  to which we are united by bonds so strong that no foreign Power  no matter how powerful it may be  could ever permanently impair them.265.	In this regard I should like to recall the far-reaching importance which the meeting of foreign ministers  held in San Jose  Costa Rica  on 14 and 15 March 1980  had for Central American unity. As the Declaration adopted at the meeting puts it  it was motivated by the conviction that direct and frank dialogue between the countries of the Central American isthmus was the best way to review the regional situation in the political  economic and social fields  as the most appropriate means of adopting positions to benefit the peoples of Central America. The first point in the 1980 San Jose Declaration affirms that the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of the States in the region requires respect for the different political systems  for the right to self-determination and the right to resolve internal affairs in accordance with each nation's historical development.266.	Another important agreement adopted at that meeting was the inclusion of the sister republic of Panama as an integral part of Central America  along with the institutionalization of the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the area  which are to be held regularly three times a year.267.	More recently  during my visit to Tegucigalpa in April of this year the Honduran Minister for External Relations  Edgardo Paz Barnica  informed me that he would immediately call a meeting of the foreign ministers of the region—an initiative which Nicaragua welcomed without delay or reservations. I committed myself to attending  and to supporting the inclusion in the agenda of that meeting of the six points contained in a peace proposal which the Foreign Minister of Honduras said he wanted to submit for consideration to the foreign ministers of Guatemala  El Salvador  Honduras  Nicaragua  Costa Rica and Panama.268.	Surprisingly  six months after our conversation —in other words  in this month of October—bypassing the still-valid agreements of the Declaration of Central American Foreign Ministers of 1980  another meeting of Foreign Ministers was called  also in Costa Rica  promoted by the United States  from which certain Central American States were excluded. This exclusion violated the agreements adopted previously by the region's Foreign Ministers  hence this meeting can be regarded only as an unimportant and marginal event in terms of its content  and as going against our peoples' genuine interests of peace  stability and development.269.	Central America  for the reasons we have already outlined  finds itself in the midst of great political upheavals  exacerbated by grave economic problems. Nevertheless  as pointed out in the joint letter sent by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela to the Co-ordinator of the Nicaraguan Government Junta of National Reconstruction  Daniel Ortega Saavedra  and to the President of Honduras  Roberto Suazo Cordoba  it is undeniable that the most critical situation facing the region the most serious problem  is the dangerous deterioration of relations between Honduras and Nicaragua  which could result in a conflict of unforeseeable proportions.270.	The attitude adopted by the United States Government  which must be denounced  has decisively influenced powerful sectors of the Honduran army  which are providing ample assistance to the counterrevolutionary forces  permitting the use of Honduran territory as a base for military operations to attack towns and posts along the Nicaraguan border  as well as the supply of weapons  infrastructure  and logistical support  tolerating the provocations and attacks by soldiers of that country's army  and are even going so far as to sign specific agreements with the United States on the basis of which the United States Government has increased its military aid to Honduras  financing the reconstruction of airports and military bases  multiplying the number of its advisers  and reserving the right to use these and other bases and military infrastructure in Honduras. It is obvious that this policy is giving rise to a dangerous spiral of war in Central America. It encourages the most aggressive sectors of Honduras and other countries of the region  who recklessly brag in public about their military ability to defeat Nicaragua and openly call for foreign intervention against our country 271.	These military preparations  which amount to a prelude to the much-advertised assault on Nicaragua  were recently denounced by the former Commander of the Honduran Public Security Force  Colonel Leonidas Torres Arias  and this week by the Mayor of Puerto Lempira  Marcial Colemann  who told news agencies that an unprecedented invasion of Nicaragua was approaching and that Puerto Lempira  his own city  would be the organizational centre for the invasion. He reported that the counter-revolutionaries there were being supplied by a Hercules aircraft of the United States Air Force. He also stated that there was a warehouse in Puerto Lempira which was full of weapons that local residents could see  and that there was evidence of counter-revolutionary camps from which a silent invasion of our country had already begun.272.	Notwithstanding these irrefutable facts  an elaborate diplomatic and propaganda campaign is under way to defame Nicaragua and portray us as a country opposed to all dialogue  when the truth is that it is the people of Nicaragua who are being attacked and it is Honduras that systematically refuses to take part in a dialogue at the highest level to find solutions to bilateral problems. It is possible that this reluctance stems from a recognition of the fact that our problems with Honduras—a brother nation with which we have close-knit ties—are really problems with the United States  since the Reagan Administration conscious of how absurd and counter-productive a direct confrontation with Nicaragua would be—the United States so big and we so small—has chosen Honduras as the ideal country from which to attack us with the foolish aim of destabilizing us and overthrowing our Government. It forgets that this objective is impossible to attain in the light of our people's monolithic unity and our determination to defend and consolidate the achievements we have gained at such a high cost.273.	From September of last year to September of this year our country has endured approximately 143 attacks from Honduras. We have detected some 23 infiltrations of counter-revolutionary military groups and units. There have been 10 violations of and incidents in our territorial waters. A11 of that has left a painful toll of more than 150 Nicaraguans killed  30 missing and incalculable material damage  which forced our Government at one point to evacuate the civilian population in the frontier region  which had become a veritable scorched-earth battlefield.274.	Within the framework of its many peace initiatives  Nicaragua promoted the meeting between the heads of State of Honduras and Nicaragua  at the El Guasaule border post on 13 May we have repeatedly requested a meeting between the army leaders of both States  something agreed Co at El Guasaule; this past April I travelled to Tegucigalpa to talk with the Foreign Minister  Mr. Paz Barnica and present him with a seven-point peace plan  later rejected by Honduras down to the last detail; we worked for the meeting between the chiefs of staff of the respective armed forces  held this past May at the La Fraternidad border post—as a result of the agreements obtained at the La Fraternidad meeting  the only meeting that has actually been held was between the heads of the naval forces of our countries in the port of Corinto.275.	The rapid deterioration of the situation along the border and the systematic refusal of Honduras to offer the viable solutions urgently needed in accordance with the existing situation led Nicaragua to make yet another effort and on 6 August we extended an invitation to the President of Honduras to meet in Managua with the Co-ordinator of the Government Junta of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua. It was made known unofficially that such a meeting would require a prior meeting of Foreign Ministers. On 24 August I sent an invitation to the Honduran Minister for External Relations for us to meet in Managua in early September  an invitation I renewed on 4 October  asking him to set the date. The Honduran response to both invitations was that an excessive work-load made any commitments impossible now. Under these circumstances  the Governments of Mexico and Venezuela launched their very worthwhile peace initiative  which Nicaragua immediately welcomed and which we were most pleased to accept  but which Honduras has  unfortunately  rejected on the grounds of having matters of a higher priority to deal with at present.276.	Fully aware of the delicate situation existing in Central America  Nicaragua has redoubled its efforts and will continue to do all that is humanly possible in order to obtain a peaceful settlement  through dialogue  of the matter of the critical relations with the United States and Honduras  as we have turned the struggle for peace into the guiding principle of all we do in the political realm. Nicaragua seeks only to live in peace  to move forward with the process of our material and spiritual reconstruction within the most absolute respect for the principles of the Charter and of non-alignment."
"101",5183,"NLD",37,1982,"Mr. President  I should like to convey to you  on behalf of the delegation of the Netherlands and on my own behalf  my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly. I am convinced that your long experience in United Nations affairs will enable you to shoulder the heavy responsi¬bilities of your high office and to guide us in our deliberations.42.	Much will depend upon your wisdom  for the Assembly convenes at a juncture marked by an atmosphere of crisis in international affairs  as well as a crisis in the multilateral approach to international affairs. Respect for and the use of multilateral forums both within and outside the United Nation seem to be on the decline  while a tendency towards bilateralism and a preoccupation with national prob¬lems are growing. We consider this to be a disquieting development. In times of crises such as those through which the world is now passing  we  the Govern-ments and the States Members of the United Nations  share a particular and common responsibility to see to it that this trend is reversed and that co-operation among States resumes its rightful place in international relations.43.	This session of the General Assembly owes much to the Secretary-General for the way in which he has put before us the central problem of the Organiza¬tion's capacity to keep the peace and to serve as a forum for negotiations. I fully share his anxiety and his disappointment about the inability of the United Nations to live up to the hopes the peoples of this world placed in it at its inception. I welcome his report on the work of the Organization as an important signal to the international community and as a challenge to us all. We  for our part  will do our utmost to help him in his efforts to improve the credibility and the effectiveness of the Organization.44.	Two objectives which are fundamental to our mutual relations would  if properly pursued  make the world a better place to live in for everyone. They are complementary and are intertwined in such a manner that the one cannot be neglected without harming the other. Those objectives are peace and security on the one hand and justice on the other.45.	It is sometimes argued that peace is the most important of all. Indeed  would a major war in our nuclear age not be synonymous with the annihilation of our civilization or even of mankind itself? Peace is certainly a prerequisite for the fulfillment of our aspirations  but we should not forget that security is essential to the process of peace. The principal organ of the United Nations concerned with peace is called the Security Council  not the Peace Council. Indeed  one of the major challenges before us is to make our system of collective security work.46.	Still  it is impossible to think of peace without at the same time thinking of justice  for there will be neither lasting peace nor genuine security without justice. Not only should relations between States  peoples and individuals be governed by it  but justice is also foremost in our minds when we come to think of such matters as the eradication of poverty and the promotion of human rights.47.	There are a number of areas in the world where peace is at best precarious or where a breach of the peace has already occurred. The most conspicuous of those areas is the Middle East  where—notwith¬standing the presence of a United Nations peace¬keeping force—a military invasion took place only three months ago. I shall not repeat here what Mr. Ellemann-Jensen  of Denmark  speaking on behalf of the members of the European Community  said so eloquently yesterday at the 8th meeting. Suffice it to say that the Netherlands fully associates itself with his condemnation of the invasion and with the indigna¬tion at the complete disregard for all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the sorrow for the suffering caused to the many—too many—victims.48.	In this connection I would pay a tribute to the memory of those who fell victim to the senseless murder in the refugee camps of Beirut. Atrocities of this magnitude call for an authoritative inquiry.49.	We cannot hope to find a durable solution to the problems of the Middle East unless such a solution is based upon security and justice. There is a clear need for all peoples in the region to live within secure borders. We shall have to keep in mind  however  that a line drawn on the map cannot provide genuine security. Borders can be secure only if they are recog¬nized by all concerned as part of a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement. There will have to be justice for all peoples: for those who lack a national home  for those whose territory is under foreign occupation and for those whose State has yet to receive full recognition.50.	The countries of the European Community have repeatedly stressed the need to ensure both security and justice for all peoples in the Middle East. We therefore welcome President Reagan's recent initiative as an important opportunity for peaceful progress to this end. I am equally happy to note that at Fez the Arab leaders expressed their readiness to work for the achievement of peace for all States in the region. I sincerely hope that these statements will pave the way for the negotiated settlement which has eluded us so far and for which there is no alternative but endless war.51.	Let me turn for a moment to another area where peace has been regrettably absent for many years now: Afghanistan. As a direct result of the Soviet invasion 3 [pillion people have left their country. We cannot but voice our indignation at the repression which followed the occupation of that unhappy  once non-aligned country. In order to control a population heroically fighting for its independence  100 000 foreign troops are now stationed in Afghanistan. The intervention  which has caused the Soviet Union serious loss of prestige  has had a profound impact on international relations. I note in this respect  for instance  its very negative effect on efforts to convene a conference on the Indian Ocean.52.	We sincerely hope that it will be possible to arrive at a political solution to this question  and we therefore fully support the efforts undertaken to that effect by the Secretary-General.53.	Another victim of aggression  Kampuchea  seems to be in a slightly better position than it was in last year. Here various factions have been able to form a coalition under the chairmanship of His Royal High¬ness Prince Sihanouk. It is our sincere hope that this development will make it possible for the resolutions of the General Assembly on Kampuchea to be carried out and that there may be a better future around the comer for that country  which has suffered so much during the last five years. In this connection I should like to express my country's appreciation for the efforts of a number of States in the region  in par¬ticular the members of ASEAN which are playing such a positive and effective role in furthering the cause of peace.54.	Unfortunately there are many other areas in the world where peace is precarious or where efforts to reach a permanent settlement have failed so far. One such area is Korea  where  to my mind  better use could be made of the possibilities for dialogue and negotiation.55.	There is another area  however  where peace has been in danger for quite some time now but where there is hope for a settlement in the not too distant future. I am thinking of Namibia. If it were indeed possible to remove the remaining obstacles on the way to a just and lasting solution—and  need¬less to say  that is what we are all looking forward to—then the world will have witnessed an encouraging example of what can be achieved by patient and careful mediation. In that case the United Nations and the group of five Western States can be proud of having contributed to the accomplishment of independence for the people of Namibia and for having brought peace and  one hopes  lasting stability to a region which has gone through such a trying period. Let me only add at this stage  while negotiations are still continuing that the Netherlands will gladly be of assistance during the transition.56.	Finally  whilst I am on the subject of peace  I should like to say a few words about the South Atlantic. I do not intend to go deeply into the matter for I can associate myself with what was said yesterday on behalf of the European Community by my colleague from Denmark. Let me only add that we are happy to note that the recent grave events  in which force was used  contrary to the principles of the Charter  especially the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  are now a thing of the past. The Netherlands continues to attach the greatest importance to its rela¬tions with the countries of South America with which it has many ties. Needless to say  we are looking forward to a further strengthening of our relations with those countries.57.	There will be no peace without security and there will be no security if the various arms races taking place in the world are allowed to continue. It is sad to note  therefore  in particular at a time when the need for concrete progress is so great  that the results of the Assembly's second special session on disarmament were so meager. We shall have to redouble our efforts in Geneva  so as to make up for lost time. One way of doing this is to devise ways and means which would enable the Committee on Disarma¬ment to carry out its mandate more effectively.58.	Only a few blocks away from the United Nations Office at Geneva other negotiations are taking place which are of crucial importance to us all. A success¬ful outcome of the talks on the reduction of strategic arms  and  one hopes  the scrapping of an entire category of semi-strategic weapons  could have a decisive effect on arms control at large  and on the security of a great number of nations present here in New York.59.	While addressing the subject of security  I should like to make a few remarks on United Nations peace-keeping operations. As members know  the Nether¬lands has been  and still is  engaged in one of the major activities taking place in this Held. UNIFIL  which includes a Dutch battalion  fulfilled an important task in keeping the peace in southern Lebanon—for a number of years anyway. Also  some progress was made toward the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government in that part of the country. Apart from the humanitarian assistance given to the numerous refugees in recent months  that has remained UNIFIL's main objective.60.	However  the difference between peace-keeping and peace-enforcing and the limitations under which peace-keeping forces operate and can be expected to operate have become painfully clear. Whenever one of the parties to a conflict shows a total disregard for a force of this nature and applies massive military pressure the United Nations presence is bound to lose much of its meaning.61.	It is impossible to speak of security without touching upon the Security Council. It is the nucleus of the system of collective security which is at the very heart of this great Organization of ours. A number of its resolutions have acquired the status of generally recognized international instruments. I very much agree with the Secretary-General that it is our common task to protect and enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council. I assure him that he may count on our full support when he takes it upon himself to bring potentially dangerous situations to the attention of the Council  as indeed Article 99 of the Charter invites him to do. Furthermore  the .Netherlands welcomes his intention to develop a wider and more systematic capacity for fact-finding in areas of potential conflict. The strengthening of the fact-finding capa¬bility of the Organization could be an important element in our efforts to maintain peace and security.62.	Occasionally special circumstances have led nations to resort to peace-keeping operations outside the United Nations framework. This may give cause for some concern. However  the maintenance of peace and stability must sometimes take precedence over considerations of an institutional nature. My country  for its part has a strong preference for participation in peace-keeping activities decided upon by the Security Council. The Netherlands will shortly provide the Secretary-General with an updated offer for units to be made available for United Nations service.63.	Peace and security are not complete without justice. Therefore it is to justice that I shall devote the latter part of my speech. Justice has to do with the notion of the fair and equitable distribution of wealth and decision-making power. It implies that relations between nations are based on respect for the principle of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples  and that citizens are treated in accordance with the dignity inherent in the human person. These basic rights lie at the root of the international community's commitment to support processes aimed at self- reliance and to overcome poverty  in particular in the third world. Conceived in this way  justice assures the consent of individuals to the way in which they are governed and the consent of nations to the interna¬tional order. Where justice is deficient that consent can at best be partial and there will be a constant danger to peace and security.64.	Let me give an example  that of Poland  a country that was also referred to by Mr. Elleman-Jensen when he spoke on behalf of the European Community. Nine months ago the Polish authorities  yielding to pressure from a powerful neighbor  decided to impose martial law  with ensuing large-scale viola¬tions of human rights. We all know the result: con¬tinuing turmoil  followed by increasing repression.65.	An important element in the search for justice is the promotion and protection of human rights  civil and political as well as economic  social and cultural. The fact that human rights have become a generally recognized subject of international concern is one of the major achievements of the United Nations. My coun¬try's approach to human rights and to violation of those rights  wherever and whenever they occur  is im¬partial. We feel strongly that we should fight any abuse of those rights regardless of ideological context or geographical area. In this connection  let me just mention our anxiety about developments in Iran and Viet Nam. In some Central American countries  more¬over  we see a vicious circle of repression and rebellion  resulting in massive human suffering and a rapidly growing number of refugees.66.	In South Africa the constitutional and political system continues to be based on the hideous policy of The Netherlands remains committed  as it has always been  to doing everything in its power to help put an end to that system  which is intolerable to the majority of the population and has been rejected by the entire international community.67.	More often than not when we discuss human rights we do soon a country-by-country basis. How¬ever  it is also possible to look at these issues in a thematic way. This method has proved to be of some value in the Commission on Human Rights. One of its principal advantages is that it allows for a sys¬tematic  world-wide approach to such disturbing phenomena as enforced disappearances  mass exoduses  summary executions  torture  and the fate of people advocating the implementation of interna¬tionally agreed human rights instruments in their own countries. This approach  which is certainly not designed to enable individual Governments to evade their responsibilities  has proved to be a workable method in a number of cases  and one which could be further developed in the future. In this connection  I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the practice of extra-legal executions as a means of political persecution. Some months ago Amnesty International organized in my country an interna¬tional conference on this intolerable practice  which seems to be on the increase.68.	I think it cannot be denied that; on the whole  the principles in the field of human rights are clear and that what is needed  first and foremost  %s implementa¬tion. Yet there remains a need for further refinement  if only to define the responsibilities of those who contravene human rights and to assure for all others  whether directly affected or not  the right to speak up and to act whenever such contraventions take place. States and individuals have both the right and the duty to play an active role in furthering the cause of justice. This explains our satisfaction at the adop¬tion of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance #id of Discrimination Based on Religion or belief by the Assembly last year after 20 years of drafting. It also explains why we look forward to the adoption of similar docu¬ments on medical ethics and on the protection of all persons under any form of detention or imprisonment  both of which are on the agenda of this current session.69.	The Organisation has taken a variety of initiatives directed towards the improvement of the position of women and young people. As the end of the United Nations Decade for Women draws nearer  we should make even greater efforts to ensure the realization of its principles and objectives  namely  full and equal participation of women in development  in political life and in all social activities. We shall be successful only to the extent that we can bring about a funda¬mental change in prevailing attitudes and mentalities  which too often lead to discrimination against and  thus  to the subordination of women in our societies. The Netherlands will participate fully in the imple-mentation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.70.	The year in which the Decade for Women will end  1985  will be International Youth Year. We attach great importance to the creation of effective channels of communication to involve the youth of our countries in various United Nations activities  such as those concerned with disarmament  arms control  develop¬ment co-operation and human rights.71.	I need not stress the importance we attach to United Nations activities for refugees. During the past few years  the refugee problem has reached staggering dimensions  particularly in the third world. Assiduous efforts are required to cope with this problem  and I can only express the hope that Member States will provide the United Nations High Com¬missioner for Refugees with the assistance he so badly needs.72.	Finally  there are people whose situation in some respects resembles that of refugees. They are the migrant workers  who are dependent upon the state of the economy in their host countries. As a result of the current stagnation  many of them will end up as victims of double unemployment  both in the host country and at home. This problem may well require our special attention in the years to come.73.	Today  hunger is still a very real problem for all too many people in a great number of countries. These people do not get a fair opportunity to earn their own living and to provide themselves with the necessary food. Millions cannot fulfill their basic needs. There remains an intolerable discrepancy in living standards  and in the opportunities to improve them  between the industrialized and the developing coun¬tries. Underdevelopment and poverty are an integral part of the North-South problem.74.	Justice requires that a wide spectrum of measures be taken to promote the development of the coun¬tries of the South. I am thinking of measures in the field of sizeable and well-defined development assis¬tance programmes  measures of a structural nature to eliminate bottlenecks in the areas cf trade and invest¬ment and in the financial and monetary sphere  and also measures to promote the exploration  exploitation and 3ocal processing of commodities and the search for sources of energy.75.	All these activities are destined to contribute to the growth of the developing countries and to a better world- vide distribution of income and resources. We believe that we should make a common effort to explore ways and means to improve the international economic order.76.	There have been numerous efforts  in particular within the United Nations  to bring this about. Instru¬ments for North-South co-operation  such as the strategies for the United Nations Development Decades  have been devised. The implementation of such measures as the 0.7 per cent aid target and the fight against protectionism in trade are matters that must be taken very seriously if justice is not to become a hollow word. Non-implementation could  in its effects  be almost as bad as disregard for Security Council decisions. It is jeopardizing co-operation between North and South  and threatening the United Nations as an organization whose decisions are to be taken seriously.77.	Those considerations have always guided 'my country's approach to these questions. I am happy to add that the Netherlands' development assistance has surpassed the 1 per cent mark.78.	The Netherlands had hoped that overall economic co-operation based on interdependence and solidarity between North and South could by now have been discussed at a new round of global negotiations. Unfortunately  we have been too optimistic. We therefore urge all concerned to make a serious effort to find an early solution to the few difficulties that are still outstanding. The world community is in urgent need of a framework for dealing  in an inter-related way and at a high political level  with the key issues that bedevil international economic relations and hamper development in the third world.79.	In the meantime  it is important that other nego¬tiations dealing with specific problem areas be con¬ducted in a constructive spirit. Solutions agreed in such negotiations should also benefit those whose needs are greatest but who are not in a position to offer concessions. The notion of the survival of the fittest is not applicable to relations between human beings or States.80.	In a stormy and uncertain world  the United Nations is an essential institution for the pursuit of the two overriding and closely interconnected objectives for international co-operation: peace and justice. As the Secretary-General so rightly observed  it is all too easy to indulge in extreme and inflexible positions. But what can one hope to accomplish by generating rhetoric and intolerance? Instead let us try to respect each other's views and positions  thus paving the way for a more meaningful dialogue.81.	With that in mind  I wish you  Mr. President  and all those assembled here today wisdom and good luck in the coming months. We shall need a lot of both if we are to make progress towards the realization of the principles and purposes to which we are committed as Members of the United Nations."
"102",5228,"NOR",37,1982,"At the outset  Sir  I wish to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly.21.	During the last few years we have witnessed a serious deterioration in the international political climate. The tensions between East and West are particularly serious since the East-West relationship still plays the dominant role in shaping international relations. But crises have emerged also in other regions and with grave consequences.3l. However promising the possibilities may be for modem man to create positive conditions of life  we must nevertheless acknowledge that we have still failed to deal with many of the world's major challenges of today in the political  economic and military fields. The most disturbing development is the increasing tendency to resort to the use of force in international relations. Events in Lebanon  in Afghanistan and in the Falkland Islands are clear examples of this.52.	When conflicts between nations create threats to international peace and security we need international mechanisms which can intervene to stop the escalation of such conflicts into open war. We need organs which can promote peaceful political settlements of disputes. The United Nations was established to serve these purposes. However  the United Nations is not always used in the way intended under the Charter; and when it is used; we have seen that its demands  calls  recommendations and resolutions are not heeded.53.	This development harms both the United Nations and its Member States. Norway has always regarded the United Nations as the cornerstone of its foreign policy and we therefore regret this development. In his annual report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General highlights just this situation. We greatly appreciate his open  frank and constructive presentation of the problems.54.	The Charter has invested the bodies of the United Nations with clearly defined and well- balanced responsibilities for independent action. It is up to us  the States Members of the United Nations  to make constructive use of the mechanisms provided for in the Charter in order to further the common causes of the world community.55.	Over the years we have witnessed a disturbing tendency to use the Organization for political prop¬aganda and condemnations rather than for seeking realistic and constructive solutions to the problems before us. Member States ought to consider whether this is compatible with our desire to develop the United Nations into an instrument for the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of international peace and security.56.	In his report the Secretary-General draws our attention to the same problem by stating that public debate  which often can become rhetorical and con¬frontational  is in itself not enough and cannot be a substitute for serious negotiations. He has also put forward a number of proposals on how we should tackle the problems now facing the Organization. I would in particular mention the following proposals.57.	The Secretary-General proposes  as an important first step  a conscious recommitment by Governments to the Charter. In response to this I hereby reaffirm Norway's commitment.58.	The Secretary-General asks us to reconstruct the concept of collective action for peace and security within the framework of the Charter. The Norwegian Government agrees with him and we are prepared to co-operate with him in investigating ways and means of achieving this urgent goal.59.	The Secretary-General comments on the Security Council and suggests that the Council should keep an active watch on dangerous situations and if necessary initiate discussions with the parties involved before they reach the point of crisis. We support a more forthright role for the Secretary-General within the framework of Article 99 of the Charter in bringing potentially dangerous situations to the attention of the Council. We find his suggestion for developing a wider and more systematic capacity for fact-finding in potential conflict areas very useful and we look forward to a discussion on how this capacity could be strengthened.60.	The Secretary-General also comments on peace¬keeping operations. As a country that has con¬tributed troops to several United Nations forces since 1956  and is contributing to UNIFIL  we have a direct interest in this vital aspect of the activities of the United Nations. We therefore strongly support the Secretary-General's recommendation that Member States  especially the members of the Security Council  should now urgently study the means by which our peace-keeping operations could be strengthened. We are not convinced that an increase in their military capacity or authority is a viable option  but we find very interesting the suggestion of underpinning the authority of peace-keeping operations by some kind of guarantees.61.	I should like to mention one last aspect con¬cerning the role of the United Nations. Perhaps the greatest strength of the United Nations is embodied in its universality. Norway has always considered the principle of universality to be of cardinal importance for the authority of the United Nations. We shall con¬tinue to do so  and in this connection I should like to stress the strong concern and protest of my Govern¬ment concerning the vote in the General Conference of IAEA on 24 September^ not to accept the credentials of the Israeli delegation. Such moves will inevitably have negative repercussions for the whole climate within the United Nations system.62.	The reaction in Norway to the recent reports of the massacre of Palestinian refugees—children  women and men—in Beirut has been one of shock and revul¬sion. My Government fully associates itself with the international condemnation of this massacre. Such a cruel act is a clear demonstration of how far the antagonisms and hatred have developed between the different groups in the area. This act shows us more clearly than ever the urgent need for national recon-ciliation in Lebanon and a comprehensive and Listing solution to the Middle East conflict in general. In the present circumstances we know this is extremely difficult. It can be possible only if all parties con¬cerned are willing to show moderation and act in a spirit of compromise.63.	Norway fully supports all the Security Council resolutions adopted on the crisis in Lebanon during recent months. We urge all parties to respect the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.64.	We also recognize the legitimate concern for the security of the State of Israel. The events that took place prior to 6 June this year did not  however  justify the massive Israeli invasion that followed. All States in the area  Israel as well as its neighbours must have the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. There can be no just and durable solution to the Middle East conflict unless this principle is fully respected.65.	The implementation of the national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self- determination  is of equal importance. This implies Israel's withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967. It also implies that representatives of the Palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the solu¬tion of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. The procedure for the realization of Palestinian self- determination should be established through such negotiations.66.	In spite of the tragic events of the last few weeks we have noted some encouraging signs of a positive development towards a peaceful and com¬prehensive solution to the conflict. The plan outlined by the President of the United States on I September for a more general settlement of the Middle East problem  and in particular the Palestinian question  has been welcomed by Norway as a significant and important contribution to the peace process. The agreement at the resumed Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez earlier this month on a number of principles for the solution of the crisis strengthens our conviction that serious efforts are being undertaken to try to solve the conflict in the Middle East.67.	There are several other pressing international problems on our agenda.68.	In Namibia  the ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated political settlement are entering a crucial stage. Norway strongly supports these efforts and we sincerely hope they will succeed so that Namibia can obtain its independence in 1933.69.	In South Africa  the inhuman system of apartheid persists. Together with the other Nordic countries  Norway will continue to examine ways and means of exerting pressure on the South African Govern¬ment so that the necessary and inevitable changes will come about by peaceful means.70.	In Afghanistan  the tragic war is continuing. The Soviet Union assumes a heavy responsibility by ignoring the clear decisions by a vast majority in the Assembly that it should withdraw its military forces. The Afghan people must be granted the right to determine the future of its country without external interference. Norway supports the efforts by the Secretary-General to solve this conflict.71.	In Kampuchea  the impressive humanitarian effort of the international aid agencies  led by UNICEF  has helped to save the Kampuchean people from famine and starvation. The illegal Vietnamese occupation of the country continues  however. Norway will support resolutions and efforts to achieve a political solution so that the long-suffering Kampu¬chean people can finally obtain true independence and self-determination.72.	The Norwegian delegation will express the position of my Government on these and other im¬portant questions on our agenda in more detail at a later stage. I feel it necessary  however  to make some remarks on the position of my Government on three of the most vital questions facing the United Nations and the international community  namely  the problems of disarmament  the question of human rights and the North-South dialogue.73.	Arms control and disarmament were dealt with extensively in the United Nations during this year's special session. In spite of positive results on some important issues  the second special session on disarmament this summer did not succeed in devel¬oping further the important Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  the first special session on disarmament  in 1978. However  this must not be allowed to undermine our resolve to continue to work for arms control and disarmament within the global framework which the United Nations represents.74.	Our deliberative process in the United Nations must be realistic. We cannot force agreement in the absence of consensus  nor must divergent views deter us from seeking agreement. Unless we succeed in our consensus-building here  our ability to influence negotiations outside this Hall will be minimal.75.	Norway attaches great importance to the follow- up to the second special session on disarmament. We intend to submit proposals for the strengthening of the machinery in the multilateral field of negotiations and research  including a limited expansion of the Committee on Disarmament.76.	Furthermore  Norway  together with the other Nordic countries  would like to see concrete action taken by the Assembly with regard to the United Nations study on disarmament and development.77.	Our follow-up discussions during this session of the General Assembly must necessarily be addressed to a broad range of issues. At this time  however  I should like to make a few observations regarding nuclear and conventional weapons. Priority must be assigned to questions related to nuclear disarmament. The prevention of both a further vertical nuclear arms build-up and a horizontal proliferation of such weapons is one of the greatest challenges facing the community of nations today  and there is a clear link between these two tasks.78.	In this connection  the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union at Geneva on strategic nuclear weapons—the strategic arms reduc¬tion talks—and intermediate-range nuclear forces are of particular significance. It is our hope and goal that the talks will lead to substantial reductions in strategic nuclear weapons on both sides. With regard to the intermediate-range nuclear force negotiations  Norway supports  as a first step  the total elimination of American and Soviet land-based intermediate- range missiles.79.	Progress in those talks would in our view also provide a further incentive to our efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries. Nuclear disarmament is also closely linked to ongoing talks regarding a future comprehensive test-ban treaty. Norway attaches great importance to the activities of the Committee on Disarmament in this regard; and we shall continue our involvement in these matters.80.	Our preoccupation with the need to hate and reverse the nuclear arms build-up must not make us forget developments in the conventional field—and the increasing destructiveness of conventional weapons. Therefore  the security problems involve not only nuclear weapons  but also conventional arms.81.	Real progress towards disarmament can be achieved only through negotiations resulting in binding and verifiable agreements. Declarations of intent alone concerning those questions can never be sufficient.82.	To conclude my remarks on disarmament  I would like to point out that positive results from these nego¬tiations could lead to a lessening of tension in the East- West relationship in general.83.	Since the creation of the United Nations sub¬stantial efforts have been undertaken to establish international instruments and norms for the protection of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights  one on civil and political rights and the other on economic  social and cultural rights  have become our basic instruments. In spite of those and other declarations  we are nevertheless confronted almost daily with reports of gross and systematic violations of fundamental human rights. Such reports show that a number of Governments do not live up to the commit¬ments and principles embodied in those covenants and declarations. We must also  regrettably  conclude that the mechanisms established for the protection and promotion of human rights are inadequate.84.	With that situation as the background  it must be an overriding concern to ensure more effectively each individual's enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This issue has been discussed for a number of years within the United Nations. Concrete proposals have been submitted; the establish¬ment of a post of United Nations high commissioner for human rights is only one among several examples. Thus  it is not a lack of ideas that hampers the pro¬motion of respect for human rights  but a lack of political will.85.	Recognizing that violations of human rights must be regarded as an international concern  it must also be the duty of the international community to react to such violations whenever they occur  regardless of the political colour of the regime in question. The invocation of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs cannot be accepted as a justification for the international community not to act. If we do not respond similarly to comparable violations  our credibility will be at stake. My delegation will address itself to those issues later in this session  in particular with regard to the situation in Iran  where the viola¬tions of human rights are becoming increasingly severe through religious persecution  torture and arbitrary executions.86.	Before concluding  I would like to comment briefly upon the importance of the international economic situation  in particular the North-South dialogue.87.	One conclusion from the September meeting of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and the World Bank in Toronto was that the world economic situation has worsened and that the short-term prospects for improvement are still bleak. The low-income devel-oping countries have been particularly hard hit by the recession in the industrialized world. Many of the developing countries are faced with crushing debt problems  the ramifications of which may threaten the stability of the international financial system. We see increasing protectionist tendencies and a risk of an erosion of the open international trading system. The spectre of mass unemployment threatens the stability and cohesion of the international com¬munity  in particular because of its effect on our youth.88.	At the same time  the economic and development organizations within the United Nations system are faced with a crisis of their own. In a joint Nordic statement to the IMF/World Bank meeting the crucial importance of multilateral assistance was underlined  as well as the necessity for donor countries at least to keep their contributions to the present level. It* this forum  I would in particular point to the very difficult situation now facing UNDP. If we do not find a rapid solution to the present financial problems of UNDP the resulting cutbacks in projects and assistance will have serious repercussions on the entire United Nations development system.89.	My Government intends to maintain an active role in the work for a new international economic order. We regard the concept of a new international economic order as an effort  through international negotiations  to achieve a combined strategy to foster just and equitable economic relations between rich and poor countries. We see this as a matter of developing mechanisms for co-operation which will enable the international economic system to function in the best possible way to the mutual advantage of all parties  and in particular to the benefit of developing countries.90.	If the present situation regarding the North- South dialogue is allowed to persist  it may not only have a negative impact on the relations between the developed and developing countries  but also further aggravate the stress on the international economy. The Norwegian Government still thinks that the planned round of global negotiations represents a comprehensive and integrated approach to the North- South problems  and it still hopes that agreement can be reached so that this round can be launched during this session of the Assembly. We also intend to take a very active part in the preparations for the ministerial meeting of GATT in November and for the sixth session of UNCTAD to be held next year at Belgrade. The commitment of Norway to the goals of international development co-operation will also 6e evident from the decision of my Government to main¬tain its official development assistance at the level of 1 per cent of its gross national product in the years to come in spite of the economic problems which are facing my country also."
"103",5274,"NPL",37,1982,"64.	 Mr. President  I have the honor to convey to you and  through you  to the representatives greetings from my August Sovereign His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bucram Shah Dev and his best wishes for the success of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.65.	I have the great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on your election as President Ot this session of the General Assembly. You represent a country with which Nepal has friendly relations. We are confident that  with your experience  skill and wisdom  you will guide the work of this session to a successful conclusion. I also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Kittani of Iraq  who guided the business of the last session of the General Assembly with impartiality and efficiency. I avail myself of this opportunity to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General for his exemplary devotion to the ideals of the United Nations and for the admirable manner in which he has been carrying out the heavy responsibilities of his high office.Mr. Lusaka (Zambia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.66.	The past year has been less than reassuring in many respects. Hie world political situation has not shown any sign of improvement. East-West relations and  in particular  relations between the two superpowers have further deteriorated  affecting a whole range of relationships in the international arena. Foreign military interventions in some parts of the world have not ended. Regional conflicts containing potential threats to international peace and security have assumed more dangerous proportions. The arms race  especially the competition in nuclear weapons  continues uncontrolled. Negotiations on vital economic issues remain deadlocked. These are ominous developments which cause us concern.67.	The world economic situation continues to be grim. International economic co-operation and the system of multilateral co-operation continue to erode at an alarming rate. Although there has been a greater awareness of the need for development  continuing world economic stagnation has actually resulted in a decline in the per capita incomes of a large number of developing countries. As a result  there has been a sharp increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty. This situation of continuing and increasing poverty constitutes a grave threat to international stability and peace.68.	The plight of the least developed countries remains particularly acute. This group of countries has been suffering serious setbacks in the form of slower growth and widening payment deficits as a result of the world economic crisis. The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held last year  agreed on the need for special measures  including concessional assistance for such countries. The Substantial New program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  adopted by that Conference  is an important link in the vitally needed interaction between the developed and the developing countries. We appeal for the urgent implementation of that program. 69.	The serious erosion in the effectiveness of multilateral economic co-operation has been a matter of deep concern to my delegation. Serious resource constraints are hampering the operation of the International Development Association  which provides critically needed resources to the low-income developing countries. The efforts of the developing countries to make policy adjustments to meet the desperate situation have to be supplemented by some form of long-term assistance to avoid the need for the poorer countries to slow down growth as the only way of balancing their international accounts.70.	UNDP has been rendering invaluable assistance to the developing countries in their efforts to create the necessary infrastructure for development. In this effort it has been trying to take into particular account the needs of the poorest countries. Other bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations are also engaged most constructively in the socioeconomic development of the developing countries. The shortfall in voluntary allocations of resources has seriously affected the programs of these bodies. Only firm and predictable support from the Member States  the developed countries in particular  can ensure their continuous and effective functioning. My delegation fears that if these bodies are forced to cut back on their programs  it will have serious consequences for the implementation of the Substantial New program of Action  to which the international community has committed itself.71.	The problem of energy is a priority item within the overall structural readjustment that the United Nations is seeking to achieve. The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  which was held at Nairobi in 1981  underlined that the interest of all countries would be served by an orderly transition to new and alternative sources of energy  in view of the finiteness of the traditional Source of energy. We 'tote with regret that no serious action has been taken to implement the Nairobi program of Action  especially in its institutional and financial aspects.72.	The difficulties facing the United Nations Financing System for Science and Technology for Development are still far from overcome. My delegation regrets the negative attitude adopted by some developed countries towards contributing to the resources of the system  in spite of the great flexibility shown by the Group of 77.73.	The growing trend towards protectionism and unilateral trade practices has aggravated the already difficult economic situation of the developing countries. My delegation hopes that the forthcoming meeting at the ministerial level of GATT will succeed in establishing a fair international trading practice responsive to the particular needs of the developing countries.74.	Economic co-operation among developing countries has assumed even greater significance in the present context. The 1981 Caracas program of Action has charted the course for collective self-reliance to break the cycle of dependence  poverty and underdevelopment. In this context the meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee on economic co-operation among developing countries  held in Manila in August  is of particular significance.75.	In the light of these pressing economic and development issues  the sixth session of UNCTAD  scheduled to be held in June next year in Belgrade  assumes crucial importance. At that session UNCTAD will have to break new ground to redress the central problems and disruptions in world trade and development. Only a new beginning can ensure the revival of the world economy.76.	Efforts in the past year have proved that it is becoming increasingly difficult to take timely decisions and necessary action to correct the international economic situation. There has been some progress in the drafting of a compromise which would permit the adoption of a resolution on the launching of the global negotiations. In the negotiations the Group of 77 has displayed great flexibility and accommodation in trying to meet the concerns of the developed countries. Regrettably  these serious efforts have not so far succeeded in breaking the deadlock over the substantive issues. Nepal fully supports the notion that the United Nations has to play a central role in any realistic program for global economic recovery. We call once again for the early launching of the global negotiations to face the challenges of the international economic difficulties. The stalling of the negotiations has withheld the impetus necessary for the effective implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade [resolution 35/56  annex].77.	There can be no enduring security in the world so long as widespread poverty and economic injustice prevail. It is on the basis of these two aspects of security and development that my Government watches with increasing concern the continuing rise in military expenditures. World military spending in 1981 is estimated to have reached a staggering $600 billion to $650 billion. Thus  the resources desperately needed for development are being rapidly drained away.78.	The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was the focus of great public attention and interest. Despite this popular concern and all the intensive work  the Assembly failed to reach any agreement on substantive items at that session. This failure is all the more regrettable because the great Powers went back on their solemn commitment to use the United Nations as a forum for disarmament negotiations. The failure of the special session was thus another example of the crisis of confidence in the United Nations system.79.	The building of trust between the East and the West is a difficult task  but Nepal believes that continuing dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union is necessary to open the way to the reduction and eventual elimination of the nuclear arms race. We welcome the resumption of negotiations between these Powers on strategic arms and on medium-range nuclear weapons  and we hope that they will speedily agree on balanced and verifiable reductions of these weapons.80.	The adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been a major achievement of the United Nations. After years of intensenegotiations  the international community has adopted a legal instrument designed to regulate the use of the seas and the exploitation of their resources. My delegation welcomes this development as being a positive one which could bring great benefits to all the countries of the world  coastal and land-locked  on the basis of equity and justice.81.	Nepal has often repeated its firm conviction that the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  of peaceful coexistence and of respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries are sacrosanct. We can never accept any justification for armed intervention.*  nor csin we recognize any situation created by such interventions.82.	It is therefore with deep regret that we note that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea has not yet come about  and that the efforts of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to find a peaceful settlement have made no progress. Nepal welcomes the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the leadership of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Nepal once again urges all parties concerned to join in the efforts of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to achieve a just political settlement of the problem.83.	In Afghanistan  likewise  the withdrawal of all foreign forces will constitute the essential first step towards the normalization of the situation. Only such normalization will enable the people of that country to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination. Nepal will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan.84.	The Middle East situation continues to dominate the affairs of the international community. The past year has regrettably seen no sign of progress towards a comprehensive peace  which alone can ensure a just and peaceful future for all the peoples and nations of the region. Nepal remains convinced that a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East has to be based on three basic principles: recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination  and their participation in the overall peace negotiations; withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied since 1967; and recognition of the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  free from threats and acts of force. In this respect. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have lost none of their validity with the passage of time. Given good will and accommodation  it is not impossible to achieve early arid full implementation of these resolutions  together with a pledge by the international community to assure the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Nepal hopes that the momentum generated by the recent important proposals for the settlement of the problem will not be allowed to dissipate.85.	When we talk of the Middle East our attention naturally turns to Lebanon. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon came as a big shock to my delegation. Nepal has strongly denounced the Israeli military invasionand demanded the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israeli forces.86.	Nepal repeats its appeal to two non-aligned countries  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq  to seek a peaceful solution of their dispute.87.	Nepal reiterates its call for a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus  a solution which respects the territorial integrity  sovereignty and non-aligned character of that country.88.	With regard to the Korean question  my Government continues to hold the view that the aspirations of the Korean people to national reunification should be fulfilled peacefully  without foreign interference or intervention.89.	Despite occasional reports of progress  the stalemate over Namibia continues.90.	The persistence of the policy of apartheid in South Africa causes us profound sorrow. In total defiance of world public opinion  the racist regime has continued its policy of denying the vast majority of the population elementary human rights  uprooting large numbers from their homeland  and compelling many others to live in so-called homelands against their wishes.91.	The Secretary-General has presented a serious analysis of the state of the Organization in his first report on the work of the Organization. His honest description of the erosion of the authority of the United Nations and his suggestions for the restoration of its effectiveness are matters for serious study by all Member States.92.	I cannot fail to express our great appreciation of the valuable support and assistance extended to us by the various bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations in our development efforts. Nepal believes that despite its serious limitations there can be no alternative to the United Nations in achieving the goals of international peace and security and the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. We have interwoven our faith in the United Nations and our respect for the lofty principles of the Charter with our policy of non-alignment. We have constantly endeavored to seek a coordinated approach to bilateral  regional and global issues. Guided by these ideas of mutual benefit and collective self-reliance  we have joined other nations to achieve a prudent exploitation of the vast human  material and natural resources for the collective benefit of the South Asian region. We are heartened by the unanimous support of all countries of our region for the concept of regional co-operation. Considerable progress ha; already been made in identifying the scope of co-operation in various agreed fields. Nepal believes that the promotion of mutual confidence and co-operation among neighbors can be a vehicle of peace  security and all-round economic development of the region. Our traditional national ideals  our unrelenting quest for peace and friendship  and our aspirations to development and co-operation are embodied in our proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace.93.	The United Nations keeps alive mankind's faith in its better self  in the ideals and principles which are worthy of being lived and striven for. In thedark hours of frustration and despair  these ideals renew man's determination to overcome problems that sometimes seem to overwhelm him. It is essential to renew dedication to these ideals. It is necessary to build  collectively and consciously  on the foundation that was laid 37 years ago  and to develop the vision to guarantee the future."
"104",5338,"NZL",37,1982,"Sir  I congratulate you on your election to the high office of the presidency. A heavy responsibility rests on your shoulders. This has been a turbulent year in international affairs. The shocks of the past 12 months are reflected in the agenda. This has been a testing time also for the new Secretary-General. He faces more hard tasks ahead.43.	We have endured a year of crisis in the world economy. The international monetary system has teetered on the brink of catastrophe. The twin evils of inflation and unemployment have ranged throughout the world; growth has slowed almost to a halt.44.	Nor has the world become a more peaceful and secure place. On the contrary. The Middle East has been a cockpit of war. We have just seen a massacre of unarmed civilians in Lebanon on a scale we find hard to believe. Afghanistan is still occupied and tyrannized by the Soviet Union. Vietnamese troops still hold Kampuchea. A totally avoidable war has been fought over some remote islands in the South Atlantic. Great-Power relationships have deteriorated. There has been no progress towards disarmament.45.	I want to say a little more about the world economic situation. As a small trading nation  New Zealand is acutely sensitive to fluctuations in the health of our major trading partners. New Zealand is classed as a developed country  but we share many of the problems of developing countries. Our prosperity depends on the export of a relatively few primary products. In the current world situation  terms of trade run against us. When the economic giants sneeze  we do not catch cold; we catch pneumonia.46.	It is not surprising therefore that my Government has taken a leading role in recent months in advocating a revitalization of the international economic and financial institutions. The system established at Bretton Woods 38 years ago served reasonably well during a long period of economic growth in the 1930s and 1960s. There is a widespread agreement that it needs to be improved and strengthened  not tom down. There is no consensus yet as to how that can be achieved.47.	At international meetings of Finance Ministers in recent weeks  the New Zealand Prime Minister has advocated an international conference to re-examine the role and adequacy of the international institutions established at Bretton Woods. Such a conference would require detailed groundwork and preparation. It is  perhaps  too early to spell out the agenda. What must first be demonstrated is the political will to undertake the task. My Government believes that that will exists in many countries  but some of the largest and most powerful Members of the Organi-zationóthose with the greatest economic cloutóhave still to be convinced.48.	One thing is clear. The efforts that have been made in the Organization to effect progress through a North-South dialogue have reached stalemate. The very term  North-South  polarizes attitudes. Doctrinaire argument will get us nowhere. Nor will a retreat into policies of economic isolationism. The growth of protectionism is one of the most disturbing by-products of economic recession. It will not help growth in the powerful economies of the major industrialized countries  and its effects on the vulnerable economies of the developing countries can only be disastrous.49.	Let me emphasize again the constructive purpose of my Government's call for a review of the international economic institutions. We wish to see them strengthened and  if necessary  supplemented. They may need new powers. They should be more responsive to genuine needs. In the financial field  they should be more flexible in the conditions they impose for lending. There should be a large increase in quotas to strengthen the position of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]. There is a need for discipline to apply to those countries which accumulate large surpluses in their balance of payments  as well as to tht.se which are forced into large deficits. This is sometimes called symmetrical surveillance. Greater regulatory powers than exist at present may be required. IMF is no longer facing cyclical downturns in member nations but long-term structural imbalances. Its rules must be adapted for longer-term lending and easier conditionality. A decision on these matters at a special meeting of the world community would make the political decision  country by country  to accept such changes much more easily.50.	But these are only suggestions on our part. I repeat that what is needed is a clear demonstration of political will to embark on a new program designed to restore confidence in the world economic system. Only thus can we look for the world consensus required to implement such a program. May I say that we look to the major economic Powers to display both more determined leadership and a greater understanding of the problems faced by smaller and weaker economies than they have so far.51.	Although far removed from the Middle East  New Zealand is closely concerned with what goes on there. We have friendly relations with all Middle East countries and important trading relations with an increasing number of them. The United Nations has an important role to play in maintaining peace in that area and it must continue to play that role despite the frustrations it faces. For many years New Zealand has contributed observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. We welcomed the restoration of peace between Egypt and Israel. We wanted to see a peace-keeping force established in the Sinai under United Nations auspices but  since that was not possible  we agreed to contribute to a force that was acceptable to both Egypt and Israel. In that way  we hope we have made an appropriate contribution not only to the peace-keeping but to the peace-making process.52.	It is a matter of great concern to us that L at process has not continued as intended. New Zealand has consistently supported Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We believe that Israel is entitled to exist in peace behind secure borders. Equally  we believe that the Palestinian people are entitled to determine their own futures: and to establish their own State  if that is what they wish  following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories. We believe also that all foreign combat troops should be withdrawn from Lebanon. The innocent civilian population in that war-torn country has suffered long enough  if necessary  after the present temporary three-nation force is withdrawn from Beirut  the role ol' the United Nations peace keeping force should be expanded to stabilize the situation in Lebanon for as long as may be necessary.53.	In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has commented with admirable frankness on the shortcomings of the United Nations in carrying out its primary task of preserving international peace and security. He has suggested ways in which the Security Council might operate with more authority. We support those suggestions. We believe that a greater willingness on the part of the great Powers to work together rather than against one another is the key to a more effective Security Council. Nevertheless  the non-permanent members also have an important part to play. We take seriously the obligation conferred by the Charter on the Members of the United Nations to make their own contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. It is with that obligation very much in mind that New Zealand has presented its candidature for membership of the Council at the forthcoming elections.54.	The situation in Kampuchea also remains of deep concern  h undermines the stability of Southeast Asia and adversely affects the security of our close friends in the Association of South-East Asian Nations. If unresolved  it carries the potential  by reviving great-Power rivalry in the area  to threaten the security of the wider Asia-Pacific region. More immediately the situation prolongs the human misery and suiting that have been a tragic fact of life m Kampuchea for too long.55.	New Zealand firmly believes that any lasting solution to the situation in Kampuchea will have to take into account their legitimate interests of all the parties concerned. We hope that the year ahead will see some progress. The formation of the coalition Government in Kampuchea is a step in the right direction. We have never condoned the crimes and atrocities of Pol Pot and his associates and we welcome the broader representation of the Kampuchean people in the Government of Democratic Kampuchea.56.	There is an important role for the United Nations in working out a settlement. We welcome the efforts of the Chairman of the /i J Hot Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea as part of it.57.	Another year has passed without progress in relations between North and South Korea. Tension remains high in the peninsula and the diversion of resources to military purposes continues. Families are still separated and a unique and ancient society remains divided. New Zealand does not believe that this situation need or should continue. My Government's view is that the way forward is through negotiations between the Korean peoples themselves. We exhort the North Korean authorities to respond positively to South Korea's various proposals for steps towards national reconciliation.58.	With regard to Africa  my Government has followed closely the efforts of the five-member contact group to negotiate the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia and permit the people of that country freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. Following the emergence of a Government in Zimbabwe reflecting the wishes of the majority  we expected to see more rapid progress towards the freeing of Namibia from illegal occupation. We hope that the situation will now be peacefully and speedily remedied and that the people of Namibia will very soon be able to decide their own future in free and fair elections. It is long since time Namibia took its rightful seat in the Organization.59.	New Zealand maintains its steadfast opposition to the system of institutionalized racism imposed by a minority Government in South Africa on the vast majority of its people. New Zealand has no diplomatic or consular representative in that country. For many years we have embargoed the export of arms to South Africa. In accordance with its obligations  as a member of the Commonwealth  under the Gleneagles Agreement my Government has consistently sought to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa. The great majority of New Zealand sport organizations  including the Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association have steadfastly refrained from such contacts.60.	It is time that the disgrace of apartheid was ended. It is an affront to human dignity. Tragically  the South African Government has ignored the calls of its own people and of the world that it dismantles the apartheid system and introduces one which upholds racial equality and respect for human rights and basic freedoms. Only then can South Africa resume a normal relationship with the rest of the world and play its proper role in a continent which has desperate need of its technology and resources.61.	I should like to end by saying something about the small island countries of the South Pacific and their problems. These are  after all  New Zealand's closest neighbors and friends. We have with them strong ties of history and culture. Many of their people have migrated to New Zealand but retain close links with their island homes. New Zealand's overseas aid program is increasingly concentrated in these countries. We welcome the fact that the great majority of the island countries have now achieved independence or an advanced stage of self-government. Some of them now speak with a distinctive South Pacific voice in the Organization.62.	it is good that self-determination in the South Pacific has been achieved peacefully. The process is  however  not yet complete. We welcome the progress that has taken place towards self-determination in the Trust Territory of Micronesia. We welcome also the program of reform which has been instituted by the French Government in New Caledonia. In common with our fellow members of the South Pacific Forum  we hope for quick progress towards the goal of self-determination for this Territory. We are actively promoting political development in the small island Territory of Tokelau and have welcomed visits by United Nations Missions to monitor its progress.63.	The fragile economies of small island States pose enormous problems for their development. The United Nations criteria for least-developed States take insufficient account of the problems of minute size  lack of resources and extreme isolation  which are common to many of these island States. New Zealand has sought to help overcome these problems by lowering trade barriers  promoting private investment and helping to develop regional shipping services. We have welcomed the increased involvement of the United Nations in the South Pacific area. But more outside help is needed  and the small size of the recipient countries should not deter the appropriate international agencies from making a more effective contribution than they have up to now.64.	One of the few significant resources which the South Pacific countries can export is fish. The most important part of this resource consists of the highly migratory species such as tuna. The establishment of the 200-mile economic zone under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea offers the island countries the opportunity to exploit this resource for their own benefit. It is for that reason  among others  that New Zealand and other South Pacific countries are strong supporters of that Convention and look forward to its early entry into force. My Government will continue to urge the major industrialized countries to accept and become parties to the Convention. All South Pacific countries are naturally sensitive to the possibility of pollution of the surrounding ocean  for example by the dumping of nuclear waste. We are also strong advocates of the complete cessation of nuclear-weapons testing  especially in the Pacific. It is a matter of great regret and concern that the negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty has virtually come to a halt.65.	New Zealand and its South Pacific neighbors will continue to press for the conclusion of a test-ban treaty. Such a treaty not only will remove a possible environmental threat from our own backyard  but will be an important step towards nuclear disarmament  which has seen no progress in the past year but becomes more urgent day by day."
"105",5383,"OMN",37,1982,"I should like to convey sincere congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session and to express our best wishes to him and to the officers of the Assembly for success in directing the work of the Assembly towards the achievement of our goals. I should like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the great efforts made by the former President  Mr. Kittani  during the thirty-sixth session and of the skilful manner in which he conducted its work and that of the General Assembly throughout its successive sessions and meetings this year.151.	The election of the new Secretary-General has been a source of pleasure to us  considering his outstanding position and wide experience in the work of the Organization as well as the respect and appreciation he has enjoyed for the tasks he has performed. While expressing our congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election by acclamation to his post  we should like to express our conviction that he is worthy of this universal trust and to wish him success in his important work and in realizing the hope that he may achieve the important tasks entrusted to him.152.	In reviewing the international situation and events since the previous sessions  we must unfortunately conclude that the picture is gloomy. Most of the problems which we discussed are becoming increasingly complicated. The views and hopes which we expressed have to a great extent not been realized. Many resolutions have been neither respected nor implemented. Our hopes for establishing good international relations based on the principles of the Charter and international law are still far from being achieved  and the United Nations—as the Secretary-General indicated in his report on the work of the Organization—has not been able to play its effective and decisive role as envisaged in the Charter  thus frustrating the hope that the Organization would be capable of maintaining peace and security and serving as a forum for negotiations. We must endeavour to put an end to this deviation from the Charter  to adhere  to it and to its principles  and to revive the concepts contained in it  which requires making a collective effort towards establishing peace  thereby strengthening the ability of the United Nations to perform its basic  function.153.	The list of problems before the Assembly at this session is  as usual  diverse  complicated and long   but we believe that such a list should not lead us to despair or make us give up endeavours towards the achievement of what we believe is right and fair. We have ho alternative but to continue our efforts and co-operation towards achieving the objectives that we set ourselves  including in particular the establishment of peace based on justice.154.	As at previous sessions  the Middle East problem  whose central issue is the Palestinian question  is the most urgent problem before us. We all know that the main obstacle to the solution of this problem is not the lack of efforts exerted within and outside the United Nations to solve it  but  first and foremost  the continued Israeli defiance of the will of the international community  Israel's flouting of the very principles governing the Organization.155.	This defiance of international public opinion and flouting of the Charter and resolutions is a serious matter  and the time has come to deal with it. Otherwise  the law of the jungle will prevail in international relations  and the remnant of confidence and hope of finding a peaceful solution to this problem  based on the principles of international law and justice  will collapse. This will also weaken the Organization's ability to find peaceful and just solutions to the disputes brought before it  as the Secretary-General stressed in his report.156.	The Sultanate of Oman is an advocate of peace  and the people of our region  who have suffered war and instability for a long time  look forward to an era of security and stability. The peace that we seek is a peace based on justice and on the principles adopted by the Organization. We seek a just and lasting peace that would put an end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people and would realize their legitimate rights to return to their home and to self-determination. That is why we have supported  and continue to support  all the efforts aimed at establishing peace in the region. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  in which we participated  laid the basis and provided the guidelines for a peaceful and just solution to the Middle East problem. Furthermore  the eight principles representing the Arab framework for solving this problem not depart  in general or in details  from the principles that have already been approved by the United Nations.157.	The recent initiative of Mr. Reagan  the President of the United States of America  directed to solving the Middle East problem contains positive points that might contribute to the efforts being made to settle this problem.158.	The peace initiative of the Arab States and President Reagan's initiative create together a climate conducive to finding a permanent and just settlement to the problem. We should take advantage of it and develop it  and the negative attitude of Israel should not be allowed to undermine our efforts. However  the Israeli persistence in frustrating all international efforts and rejecting all proposals for forward for solving the problem have led States to believe in the inevitability of the use of force in solving political problems involving Member States. This is a very serious matter.139. The Israeli aggression against the Arab sister State of Lebanon  resulting in the occupation of Lebanese territories and violation of Lebanon's sovereignty  demonstrates to the whole world that Israel believes only in the use of force  and not in peacel Therefore  the international community must once again censure these brutall actions and demand that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon immediately  and  further  that it assist the Lebanese people to realize their hopes of stability and security.160.	On 20 September 1982 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Oman issued the following statement about the events in Lebanon:  The Sultanate strongly denounces the barbaric massacres which have been committed and are being committed by Israel against unarmed Palestinian refugees  men  women and children  in the Sabra and Shatila camps in west Beirut.  These genocidal massacres are a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. They are a dangerous development  since they have contravened the spirit of peace and escalated tension and instability in the area. They recall the mass slaughter of Palestinians committed at Deir Yassin and Kafr Qasem by the Israeli authorities in 1948.  Israel's invasion of west Beirut and its massacre of defenceless Palestinian refugees  old men  women and children  were part of a policy of aggression and expansion which the Israeli occupation authorities were implementing  with civilians as their victims. Their actions have defied all human values and international mores.  Oman calls on the leaders of the world and the States which were responsible for the evacuation of the Palestinian fighters from west Beirut  as well as the international pubic and international and humanitarian organizations  to shoulder their responsibilities fully at this crucial stage so as to stop the inhuman slaughter of Palestinian refugees.161.	The withdrawal of Israel from the whole of Lebanon should be carried out immediately in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We express our hope that the return of the multinational peace-keeping force to Lebanon after supervising the departure of the Palestinian fighters will help the Lebanese Government exercise sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon.162.	The continuance of military conflict between the two neighbouring States of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran is a source of concern and instability for the entire Gulf region and represents a threat to all the peoples there  and indeed to world peace and security  since it involves innumerable dangers and is exhausting the greater part of the natural and human resources of those two States  resources which could be channelled into economic and social development.163.	We cannot but associate ourselves with those who have called for an immediate end to such human and economic waste and urge that a peaceful settlement between the two sister States be brought about as quickly as possible.164.	We welcomed the declaration by Iraq  within the framework of the League of Arab States  that it would withdraw its forces from Iranian territory to the international boundaries and was; ready to enter into negotiations to end the war. On the same principle and in the interest of peace and stability in the Gulf region  we urge the sister State of Iran to stop the war and move towards a peace which will take account of the legitimate rights of all the people.165.	Despite the numerous United Nations resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  the reiteration of the same demand by the Islamic Conference and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held at New Delhi  and the insistence on respect for the independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan  Soviet troops continue to occupy Moslem non-aligned Afghanistan in complete disregard of the resolutions of the United Nations and other international and regional organizations concerned with this matter.166.	We call once again from this rostrum for a cessation of the Soviet aggression and the immediate withdrawal of the Soviet troops so as to enable the sister State of Afghanistan to regain control over its destiny and to choose its own political  economic and social system without any foreign interference or coercion.167.	In the context of the problem of western Asia we cannot ignore the deteriorating situation in the adjacent region of South-East Asia  namely  the continued occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese troops. In this connection  we hope that at this session the Assembly will stress the need to respect the Charter and the principles embodied in it and the need to find a speedy and peaceful political solution based on the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and the non-use of force  as well as the necessity for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops  so that the Kampuchean people may determine their own destiny free from foreign interference and this region may enjoy peace.168.	Oman has a historical relationship with many of the countries and peoples of the African continent. We therefore share the aspirations of the peoples of the continent and their hope for a solution to the grave problems in southern Africa  particularly that of Namibia. We join the Africans in denouncing racial discrimination and we call for further efforts within and outside the United Nations to ensure that the aspirations of the African people to freedom and stability are fulfilled.169.	Because of its geographical position the Sultanate of Oman is directly concerned with events in the Horn of Africa. It regrets the continued attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the region. It condemns the acts of aggression against the Somali sister State and demands an end to foreign intervention in the internal affairs of that region lest it should fall victim to foreign expansionism and attempts to propagate social systems imported from abroad; foisting them upon the people of the area with a view to exploiting their resources.170.	Our concern with events in the Horn of Africa is closely associated with the security and safety of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean. The Sultanate of Oman  as one of those countries  is concerned for the security of this area and is therefore in favour of declaring it a zone of peace  It calls for an end to the competition between the super-Powers to establish spheres of influence in the region. As a member of the Ad Hoc Not Committee on the Indian Ocean  Oman is anxious to promote the efforts to arrange for the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which is scheduled to be held in Colombo in 1983  so that the goal of making the Indian Ocean region a demilitarized zone of peace may be achieved without further delay.171.	My delegation would like to express its satisfaction at the adoption by the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session of the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States. It hopes that this Declaration  which emphasizes respect for this important principle  will be complied with  thus guaranteeing the right of all peoples to shape their own destinies and choose their systems of government without any outside intervention  pressure or threat.172.	Oman  like other peaceful States  attached great hopes and importance to the second special session devoted to disarmament. We had entertained the hope that the negotiations and deliberations conducted during that session would be successful; but  as we all know  failure to reconcile the different points of view made it impossible to reach consensus on the major items on the agenda of that session  in spite of the preparatory meetings. We entertained the hope that the second special session would put into effect the Final Act of the Tenth Special Session of the general Assembly  which was adopted by consensus in 1978. In paragraph 126 of the document the Members of the Organization reaffirmed:  their determination to work for general  and complete disarmament and to make farther collective efforts aimed at strengthening peace and international security; eliminating the threat of war  particularly nuclear war; implementing practical measures aimed at halting and reversing the arms race; strengthening the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes; and reducing military expenses and utilizing the resources thus released in a manner which will help to promote the well-being of all peoples and to improve the economic conditions of the developing countries/'173.	The failure of the negotiations at the second special session and the subsequent disappointment to many parties are deplorable and regrettable. Nevertheless  we have to bear in mind that the responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament is a basic one which emanates^ as we indicated earlier  from its purposes and principles: to establish   the bases of peace and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The United Nations must urgently continue to assume this responsibility fully  without hesitation or despair. It is also imperative to mobilize the collective will to replace doubt with confidence  so that we can achieve positive results in this domain.174.	In this connection I should like to reiterate what the President of the second special session of theAssembly said. We should be ignoring reality if we failed to observe that this session is being convened at a turning point of the greatest concern in the field of international relations. Doubt  conflict  an increasing sense of insecurity and a tendency to resort to force still prevail.173. It is imperative that the international community now look seriously into the fabric of relations among States in order to restore the role of the principles of international law and respect for the Charter of the United Nations  for it will be impossible to achieve progress in the field of disarmament without the fundamental elements of confidence and respect.176.	Like many other countries of the world  my country is aware of the increasing importance of establishing a new international economic order based on a fair balance between the prices of raw materials and manufactured products  taking into account the needs of developing countries and the need to accelerate their development. That is why my country continues to support the decisions taken by the Group of 77 and the efforts made by the Group in this connection ever since the beginning of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  endorsed by the general  Assembly at its thirty-fourth session we should like to emphasize that it is not possible to find any solution to such problems except on the basis of a common  universally accepted approach to the current global economic problems involving all States  and through agreed solutions regarded as permanent and fair by all.177.	Since then  to our regret  my delegation has not seen any positive development in the global economic negotiations. On the contrary  it has witnessed a clear general deterioration in the economic situation in many countries of the world  and particularly in the developing countries. The obvious decline in the developing countries' terms of trade  the large increase in the cost of capital  inadequate demand for those countries' exports  frequent resort to the policy of protectionism  continued application of stringent and unfavourable terms for the transfer of technology to those countries—all this has weighed heavily on the economies of developing countries  disrupted their economic growth and led to a sharp increase in their balance-of payments deficit and foreign indebtedness.178.	Like any other developing country  the Sultanate of Oman feels the need for such international economic co-operation and considers it imperative that the developed countries increase their aid to the developing countries in order to raise the level of development in those countries  relieve their foreign indebtedness  and demonstrate increased flexibility and seriousness in the negotiations on the subject. The Sultanate of Oman feels that the international community is more than ever in duty bound to find a solution to the present economic crisis by devoting every effort to achieving the objectives and goals set forth in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. We hope that we shall soon witness positive results in this direction in response to the efforts of the Secretary-General.179.	Oman participated in the adoption of the final text of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  in New York on 30 April  in spite of the fact that the final text did not include proposals and views put forward by Oman during the deliberations of the United' Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during the past few years. We did so out of our belief that the Convention  in general  is fair to all and would put an end to the chaotic situation with respect to the seas—particularly as to exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed—in a way that would serve the interests of humanity at large without prejudice to the basic rights of the coastal States.180.	We hope that the States which could not  for one reason or another  vote in favour of the Convention will reconsider their positions  because that Convention is the outcome of long and continuous efforts exerted over the last 10 years  and it would be a waste of these efforts not to adopt it. Otherwise  States will resort to their former practices without any binding legal restraint defining their rights and obligations under the law of the sea.181.	Finally  I should like  with reference to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization to express my appreciation of his account of the situation in the world in general  and at the United Nations in particular. It merits attention far beyond that given to previous reports. It clearly and realistically reflects our feelings  especially with respect to the developing countries which  more than all the others need to see that the United Nations receives the necessary support to enable it to fulfil the effective and decisive role clearly envisaged for it in the Charter. We hope this report will receive the attention it deserves and that at the current session the Assembly will explore effective means of eliminating the points of weakness in the work of the Organization  particularly during the last years  so that it may regain the importance accorded it by the peoples of the world at its inception.182.	We renew the pledge we made in the Preamble to the Charter for a serious endeavour to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  reaffirm our belief in fundamental human rights  in the equality of the rights of men and women  as well as of nations  large and small  and we renew our commitment to the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations."
"106",5429,"PAK",37,1982,"I should like first to convey to you  Sir  the warm and sincere felicitations of the delegation of Pakistan on your ejection to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Your assumption of this high office is an acknowledgement by the international community of your outstanding merit and qualities as a statesman. it is also a tribute to your great country. I wish you every success in guiding the deliberations of the general  Assembly on the complex issues facing it in the year ahead. 1 should like to take this opportunity of expressing our esteem and admiration for your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who presided over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with great distinction and success. I should also like to convey our deep appreciation to Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his dedicated and unremitting efforts in search of peace during a year which has seen a succession of crises and continuing turmoil. We commend his resolve in the bleak international circumstances of today  to strengthen the role and influence of the United Nations in the conduct of international relations.73.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization is an eloquent and candid comment on the grim reality of the international situation  which he has succinctly described as international anarchy . in the recent past we have witnessed an alarming intensification of conflicts and tensions  use of force with impunity  growing mistrust among nations  increasing confrontation in East-West relations and a new escalation in the arms race  which in this nuclear age portends the gravest consequences for the very survival of mankind. This spiral of violence is accompanied by a deepening apathy regarding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and an indifference regarding the role of this institution as the primary multilateral instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.74.	The gravity of the international scene demands a rededication to the ideals of the United Nations in the same spirit of commitment as ted to the foundation of this world forum after the agony and horror of the Second World War. The strength of the United Nations  which is indispensable to world peace  is also a measure of our determination to achieve adjust and civilized world order and to prevent a universal holocaust.75.	The Middle East conflict remains the most serious crisis on the international horizon and a glaring record of persistent violations of international law and brazen defiance of the United Nations by an intransigent and implacable aggressor.76.	The recent massacre of Palestinians in west Beirut epitomizes the tragedy of the Palestinian nation. The shock and indignation felt throughout the world over this massacre should serve as a reminder of the continuing Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people  whose homeland has been usurped and who have been subjected to relentless persecution. Since its occupation of the Arab and Palestinian territories in 1967  Israel has been pursuing a systematic policy of annexing those territories by changing their demographic and historic character  establishing settlements there and driving the Arab and Palestinian population into exile. In the process Israel is determined to liquidate the identity and nationhood of Palestinians in their ancient homeland.77.	Beyond the occupied territories  Israel desires to establish its military diktat and hegemony in the region. It has attacked its neighbours at will and with impunity. The brutal invasion of Lebanon  the cruel siege of Beirut and the events which led to the Israeli advance into the city and the massacre of Palestinians fully expose Israeli ambitions in the region. The crisis in Lebanon should make it clear to Israel's friends and allies that their support and protection only encourage Israel to sustain its irredentist ambitions on the pretext of strengthening its security.78.	The valour with which the Palestinian freedom fighters withstood the ferocious Israeli attacks  and the sacrifices of the Palestinian people  bear testimony to the strength and justice of their cause  which cannot be trampled by terror and expansionism. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] has emerged with renewed vigour as the voice for Palestinian freedom and has won international acclaim for its restraint.79.	The proposals endorsed by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  constitute a major initiative for a durable peace in the Middle East and demonstrate the sincere desire of the Arab countries and the PLO to bring to a dignified and honourable end the chapter of conflict in the Middle East. Predictably  Israel has rejected the Fez plan  as well as the proposals by President Reagan  which illustrates Israel's obsession with holding on to the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories and its negative response to opportunities for peace.80.	In the immediate context  it is imperative that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon be secured  that civilian life be fully protected and conditions of peace and normality be restored in that ravaged country. The agony of the Palestinian people and the justice of its cause demand that the international community take determined action for the achievement of durable peace in the Middle East. Such peace depends on the imputable condition of Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the restitution of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to a sovereign State in its homeland.81.	In our neighbourhood  the crisis in Afghanistan resulting from Soviet military intervention in that country nearly three years ago persists  with no sign of reprieve in its severity. The Afghan national resistance has proved to be enduring and steadfast  despite the awesome military superiority and sophisticated modem equipment deployed against it.82.	The presence of 100 000 foreign military troops in Afghanistan  with its dangerous portents forthe stability of the entire region  continues to evoke deep concern in the international community  which has consistently pronounced itself on the illegality of that presence and has demanded its termination. The latest expression of this international concern was embodied in general Assembly resolution 36/34  adopted last year with the overwhelming support of 116 Member States  which outlined  once again  the essential elements of a just political solution of the Afghanistan problem  namely  the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan  the preservation of the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan  the right of the Afghan people to determine its own form of government and to choose its economic  political and social system free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever  and the creation of necessary conditions which would enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour.83.	Despite the repeated calls of the United Nations and similar demands by the movement of non-aligned countries and the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the end of the crisis in Afghanistan is not in sight. It is a matter of regret that the Soviet Union  which had traditionally enjoyed good relations with countries of the area  including Afghanistan  and which takes pride in its solidarity with third-world causes  should engage and persist in an action which has caused immense tragedy to the people of Afghanistan and which has been firmly opposed by the international community.84.	The grave political implications of the Afghanistan crisis are compounded by a vast and growing humanitarian problem in the exodus of the Afghan population on a massive scale from their country. Nearly 3 million Afghan refugees  who represent one fifth of the total population of Afghanistan  have been forced to seek shelter on our soil and have placed on us an enormous responsibility for their upkeep which we have willingly accepted as our humanitarian and Islamic duty.85.	As a country grievously affected by the crisis in its neighbourhood  Pakistan has a direct and vital stake in a peaceful solution of the Afghanistan problem. Consistent with the decisions of the United Nations  Pakistan has sincerely co-operated with every international endeavour  including the constructive efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative on Afghanistan. The Geneva discussions held in June under the good offices of the Secretary-General marked an important step in his efforts for a political settlement. We participated in those talks in a positive and constructive spirit and we look forward to further progress in the process of consultations initiated by the Secretary-General and assure him of our continued co-operation.86.	It remains our ardent hope that the Afghanistan crisis will soon be resolved in compliance with the decisions of the United Nations with the aim of strengthening peace and security in the region  white preserving respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State.87.	The ramifications of the crisis in Afghanistan and the disturbing security climate in our region have deepened our concern for the defence of our frontiers. We are seriously endeavouring to turn those borders into frontiers of permanent peace. But we have no control over developments in our neighbourhood and cannot turn our eyes away from the imperative of maintaining an adequate defence establishment commensurate with the size of the country and the extent of its international frontiers  which stretch across more than 5 000 kilometres. The strengthening of Pakistan's defence capability should not be a matter of concern to any other country-first  because any suggestion of such concern would have no relation to reality and  secondly  because those who make us assume the privilege of passing judgement on vital matters falling exclusively within our sovereign domain. We are tied to no bloc or strategic consensus  a/id our right to have a minimum defence capability of our own is an expression of our sovereign status as a non-aligned country.88.	The unfortunate conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq has been a source of deep anguish and concern for us. In addition to causing extensive human and material tosses  this was has aggravated the climate of insecurity in a highly sensitive region  and its early termination remains in the best interests of the peoples of the area. With this conviction  the President of Pakistan has made several efforts  singly and collectively  under the auspices of the Islamic Conference  and will continue to make every endeavour for the solution of this tragic conflict.89.	The conclusion of our neighbourhood have made us keenly aware of the perils of great-Power rivalry and confrontation to which  in an historic sense  the Indian Ocean region has always remained exposed. Pakistan has consistency supported Sri Lanka's proposal for the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  which symbolizes the shared aspirations of the people of the region for progress in conditions of peace and security. In the regional as well as international context  we will Co-operate with every initiative aimed at securing the elimination of any foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean region and the removal of threats  whether from within or from outside the area  to the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region.90.	I am happy to note that seven countries of South Asia have initiated concrete measures to promote regional co-operation aimed at the well-being and progress of their peoples; Joint studies have been undertaken and action programmes have been worked out to promote co-operation in important economic sectors for mutual benefit. The recently held meeting of the Foreign Secretaries of South Asian countries in Islamabad was the third in a series of such meetings establishing an auspicious tradition of co-operation and understanding among countries of South Asia which we are committed to strengthen in the future.91.	Apart from being a geo-political imperative  good-neighbourly relations between Pakistan and India are essential to the fulfilment of the aspirations and hopes of millions of people in the two countries to live in peace and to ensure for themselves and for succeeding generations a life of dignity  well-being and prosperity. In this spirit  Pakistan sincerely desires full normalization of relations with India which can be achieved with the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  the only outstanding problem between the two countries.92.	The Government of Pakistan has taken several Initiatives  including the offer of a non-aggression pact  to foster an atmosphere of trust and confidence. We are gratified that last January  the Foreign Ministers of the two countries agreed that the conclusion of such a pact would make a positive contribution to peace and stability in the region. We also welcomed the suggestion of the Prime Minister of India for the establishment of a joint commission between the two countries. Already an exchange of views on the substance of the proposals has been initiated which augurs well For the future of Pakistan-India relations  on which the peace and tranquillity of the region largely depend.93.	Pakistan has consistency maintained a firm position of principle on issues which concern the sovereignty and freedom of nations  whether these pertain to our region  or regions far beyond it. Accordingly  Pakistan supports the right of the people of Kampuchea to shape their own future free from outside intervention and has joined the international call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from that unfortunate and Pakistan welcomes the formation of a coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  headed by Prince Sihanouk and hopes that this Government will facilitate the creation of conditions conducive to the full implementation of the decisions of the general  Assembly on the Kampuchean question.94.	We feel equally concerned over the dangerous situation in the South Atlantic and hope that a negotiated solution to the problem will be found on the basis of the resolutions of the United Nations.93. The illegal occupation of Namibia and the abominable system perpetrated against the black population of South Africa continue to be an affront to human morality and values. The hopes which had been raised for an early independence of Namibia by the adoption of Security Council resolution 433 (1978) proved short-lived. South Africa  having first accepted the United Nations plan for free and fair elections in Namibia under the supervision and control of the Organization  baulked at its implementation and even questioned the impartiality of the United Nations. The authors of the United Nations plan  namely the members of the Western contact group  have a responsibility to ensure the implementation of the plan as the credibility of their commitment to this plan is at stake.96.	Pakistan joins the international community in its demand for the realization of the independence of Namibia without further delay  and reaffirms its total solidarity with the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization PO] to bring the dark chapter of colonialism in their country to a close.97.	Pakistan shares the dismay and disappointment of the international community at the failure of the second special session on disarmament. It is clear that heightened international tensions prevented any progress on important disarmament issues  for which a modicum of detente in East-West relations and improvement in the global political situation have become a prerequisite. However  the failure of the special session should not lead to pessimism; nor should it be seen as the defeat of an ideal. The cause of disarmament concerns the very survival of mankind and must be pursued with a deep commitment  a positive outlook and a sense of destiny.98.	Pakistan believes in a comprehensive approach to disarmament and emphasizes the need to pursue it at every level since these are all organically linked to each other. Progress in one direction could stimulate movement in the other. Consequently  we welcome initiatives  at the bilateral  regional or global level  and measures  either interim in character or undertaken in a long-term perspective.99.	The prevention of a nuclear war is a primary challenge of our age and imposes a grave responsibility on all  especially the major nuclear Powers. We welcome the non-first-u ) declaration by the Soviet Union in the same manner as we had welcomed an earlier commitment by China to the same effect. We are also encouraged by the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of theatre and strategic nuclear forces and we hope that this dialogue produces meaningful results.100.	Without prejudice to the usefulness of unilateral or bilateral initiatives  we are convinced that the complex issues of disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  can best be addressed in a multilateral context. The threat of nuclear weapons is pervasive and concerns equally every member of the international community. The United Nations  therefore  remains the most appropriate forum in which negotiations on disarmament could be effectively pursued.101.	Motivated by its commitment to the objective of general  and complete disarmament and to nuclear non-proliferation  Pakistan had taken initiatives at the United Nations for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia and for effective assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States against the use of nuclear weapons. Measures such as these could also strengthen the links in an overall comprehensive programme of disarmament.102.	The demands of security  disarmament and development are fundamentally interrelated. Progress in disarmament could release the colossal resources  currently consumed by the insane arms race  for economic development and for combating deprivation and disease  which afflict vast sections; of humanity. A common historical cause for a new world order must  therefore  motivate our efforts for strengthening international security and pursuing effective disarmament  and for alleviating injustices and disparities besetting the international economic situation.103.	Over the past few years we have passively witnessed a rapidly deteriorating crisis in the international economic system. A galloping cancer of stagnation  recession  inflation and mounting external debt have plunged the global economy to levels redolent of the Great Depression. This has led to the emergence of new attitudes and practices characterized by inward looking short-term solutions  elements contrary to the spirit of international economic cooperation and the principle of interdependence. Deflationary policies pursued by some developed countries have rapidly transferred the crisis to the developing countries because of the interdependent nature of the world economy.104.	White the contraction of the economies has been a universal phenomenon  the brunt of the crisis has fallen upon the developing countries. In 1981  for the first time since the 1950s  the per capita real income of the developing countries as a whole actually fell in absolute terms. The consequent deceleration in the process of development has led to record unemployment in both the developed and the developing countries  with resultant social unrest and growing political insecurity. The rapid deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries  rising protectionism and reduced financial flows have led to an enormous increase in their external debts resulting in drastic reductions in development budgets and growth rates. At the same time  the debt burden of oil-importing developing countries increased during 1981 by $50 billion over the 1978 level. This feeds into the recession by towering their capacity to import.105. The increasing current account deficits and the absence of property designed international mechanisms to finance these deficits in the short run or to correct the fundamental structural imbalance in international payments in the long run is the central dilemma confronting us today. It should be a matter of concern for the international community that the burden of this extraordinary adjustment is being passed on to the developing countries  the most vulnerable members of the international community.  106. We believe that it is possible for the international community to find solutions to its problems. The glaring shortcomings in the existing economic system which are responsible for the present crisis also present a rare opportunity to rebuild the various components of the international economic order on a just and equitable basis. There is a need for massive and urgent structural changes  the parameters for which are so clearly outlined in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the establishment of the new international economic order. The basic malady is not the shortage of liquidity in the international system but its gross misdistribution.107.	It is indeed regrettable that global negotiations  proposed at the thirty-fourth session of the Assembly  have not yet been launched. The assurances sought by the industrialized countries are already provided for in the proposal submitted by the Group of 77 on the subject. Let us  therefore  abandon suspicions and apprehensions about each other's intentions and move forward to the substantive issues. However  what is alarming is the fact that lack of progress in the launching of global negotiations has been accompanied by a similar situation in sector-wise negotiations.108.	Another disturbing development is the alarming erosion of the spirit of international co-operation at a time when increasing multilateral economic co-operation could play a critical role in triggering the process of international economic recovery. Eight years ago  when the general Assembly at its sixth special session adopted resolution 3201 (S-Vl)  the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  it unequivocally emphasized the reality of interdependence  an interdependence between the developed and the developing countries. The Assembly also recognized the fact that the political  economic and social well-being of present and future generations depended more than ever on co-operation between all the members of the international community on the basis of sovereign equality and the removal of the disequilibrium that exists between them.109.	Global interdependence demands that the restoration and growth of the international economy must be undertaken on the basis of international co-operation. We can find answers to the present problems involving financial transfers  protectionist sentiments and changing attitudes towards policies of development assistance only through a compact of mutual help and assistance. What we are looking for is not short-term financial and trade concessions  although they are important in themselves  but long-term structural changes which would involve creating a framework for expansion of world trade  provision of development finance on a long-term basis and the progressive democratization of the present international financial system to enable it to function in an equitable and efficient manner.110.	There is no alternative to a dialogue and mutual co-operation to overcome the malaise which has afflicted the economies of the North and the South alike. Increased interdependence in the world economy has ensured that no country or group of countries can achieve genuine recovery merely through efficient domestic management of their economies. A consensus on the root of the current problems and a co-ordination of responses to solve them are indispensable for this purpose.111. While calling for a global response to the present crisis  the developing countries are conscious of the need to promote economic co-operation among themselves. This is one area in which positive developments have taken place. We believe that expanding economic co-operation among developing countries is a dynamic and vital element in any effective restructuring of international economic relations. However  co-operation among developing countries can only complement  and cannot be a substitute for  a new international economic order based on equity and justice.112.	The present economic crisis calls for vision and imagination on the part of the leaders of the industrialized countries  and we look to the emergence of a new internationalism  the awakening of a new spirit of global Co-operation and recognition of the imperatives of interdependence  requiring a more equitable management of the international economic system. The world economy can be rebuilt only on a sound and permanent foundation of economic efficiency and economic justice with the full participation of developing countries in international decision-making  and not through their exclusion. This is an imperative which the world leaders can no longer afford to ignore in their search for reducing tension and promoting peace and harmony."
"107",5473,"PAN",37,1982,"Mr. President  your many years of association with the United Nations  during which you have demonstrated your wisdom  spirit of co-operation and human qualities  have earned you your election  which guarantees the successful outcome of our work for all States Members of the United Nations. We welcome your presidency of the General Assembly and should like to pledge the determined co-operation of the delegation of Panama. I am expressing the feelings of broad sectors of mankind when I say in addition that we wish to praise the outstanding job done by the distinguished statesman of the third world  Mr. Ismat Kittani  as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He is a tireless promoter of the ideals of the United Nations.3. Never before in the history of mankind has there been so many sombre political and economic factors as there are today which have created such an ominous world situation.4. Even for those who maintain that international law is an instrument of co-ordination and not confrontation  the major problems on the Assembly's agenda place us at a crossroads where negative factors in international life bring us to an impasse. There is the prospect of another possible conflagration with unpredictable results if common sense  wisdom and determination do not prevail in promoting the ideals. purposes and principle§ which inspired the authors of the San Francisco Charter to draft a system of collective security within the sphere of the United Nations for dealing with the major conflicts of our era which threaten to bring about the self-destruction of mankind.5.	In  the  peaceful  settlement  of disputes •and  in cases of breaches of international peace  we find ourselves confronted with an impossible  mission owing to the lack of political will on the part of the members of the Security Council  and in particular of tf1:.e permanent members. To undertake the task of making the United Nations system of security effective and imposing the coercive measures contempl3ted in the Charter. This action is necessary and urgent in situations as anachronistic and offensive to the  conscience of mankind as those occurring in Africa  the Middle East  the eastern Mediterranean  Asia and Latin America  especially in the Latin American South Atlantic.6. The large  medium-sized and small Powers in this world assembly cannot do much in the way of making a positive contribution as regards events which have occurred in 1982. There has been no progress in the global negotiations which created so much hope at one time as a means of realizing the aspirations of mankind embodied in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.7. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament resulted in' resounding failure in the face of the intensification of the arm  race between the super-Powers of the East and the West.8. As far as the non-aligned group is concerned  we were saddened to see that as a result of the fratricidal war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran it has not been possible to hold in Baghdad the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in which such hopes had been placed. The cycle had then been broken which caused the non-aligned countries  representing two thirds of mankind  to meet at the level of heads of State or Government in order to bring here to the Assembly their positive  strong non-aligned influence projecting the peace-loving doctrines of Nehru  Tito  Nasser  Makarios  Pandaranaike and other great apostles of peace.9. The injustices in the economic relations between the developed countries and the developing countries have become more severe in this ominous framework of inflation  public indebtedness  growing unemployment and economic crisis afflicting the poor countries particularly.10. UNCTAD  which during the past two decades had aroused the hopes of the developing countries  was originally scheduled to hold a session in Havana in 1983  but  for well-known reasons  it will not be held in that city. The preparations for Belgrade have been adversely affected by negative factors pertaining to economic relations and by the hard position lak n by the developed countries in regard to the legitimate demands of the countries of the third world.11. There are more and more reasons why the non-aligned movement and the Group of77 should intensify their efforts to strengthen those movements and bring about collective self-sufficiency so that the developing countries will be able to establish  in an effective and substantial manner. real and significant economic co-operation. To the extent that political and economic difficulties increase because of the resurgence of  colonialism and hegemonism on the part of the major Powers  the developing countries must strengthen co-operation among themselves both politically and economically.12.	The colonial aggression that Latin America had to endure in the spring of 1982 has reaffirmed the fraternal ties of unity  cooperation and solidarity among the countries of the region.13.	One positive event which should be stressed is the eighth meeting of the Latin American Council  the supreme body of the Latin American Economic System  which took place at Caracas at tile ministerial level in August 1982. Apart from support for Panama in the implementation of the Canal Treaties  which we have noted with gratitude  the most outstandingachievement of the meeting was the adoption of the programme of action for the implementation of the measures provided for the Panama Declaration on economic relations between Latin America and the United States  adopted on 1 December 1981 at the high-level consultative meeting of the Latin American Economic System  which took place on the date in the capital of my country. The Latin American Council  in its Decision 114  decided to endorse the Panama Declaration contained in Decision 87  which  as was stated by our Foreign Ministry:“…after. stressing the inequality in the terrors of trade between the United States and Latin America as a factor that obstructs economic  financial and social development in the Latin American region  establishes a programme of collective co-ordinated action and a working plan to rectify the asymmetries in the aforementioned trade. The document sets forth a common strategy for Latin America in these negotiations  based on the criteria and actions which the plan defines. The program the plan encompass all aspects of United States-Latin American economic relations and offer a series of recommendations which the countries of the region should take into account in their economic relations  both individual and collective  with the United States.""In the programme and in the plan to which I have referred  there are set forth in a positive manner fundamental principles to place  within the framework of justice  equity  good understanding and co-operation  the relations which have existed between this group of countries and the United States.14. Panama is situated in the extreme south of the Central American isthmus and practically in the middle of the so-called Caribbean basin. Its history and its geography have bound us indissolubly to Central America  to the Bolivarian countries and to the Antilles. Our geographical function  as a bridge between the oceans  has linked us with practically all the markets and countries of the world. Ever since the present Panama Canal was built it has  in addition  brought about special relations with the United States.15. At the same time Panama  is one of the countries with the most stable economic  social and political regimes in an area beset by complex social and international problems with dangerous implications. My country has the unavoidable responsibility of playing a role as conciliator. as part of the politicalefforts to overcome the crisis which might very web turn the region into a disaster zone.16. In defining that role  I should like to recall that the stability that exists in my country is due to the fact that in the past decade we have made consider-able progress towards peaceful revolution. Structural reforms have been carried out which have brought about a social and territorial redistribution of wealth that is much more just and balanced  and mixed and co-operative state sectors have been created with a productive economy  conceived of from the social point of view. Social security  education  health and communications have been considerably enhanced. A system of representation and popular participation in the political decision-making process has been created. National integration has been improved.17.	In contrast with many other countries of the region  these economic  social and cultural changes n:move the main causes of injustice  repression and social discontent which are at the root of the political disputes that have di5rupted many countries in the area or have polarized their relations.18.	My country cannot be indifferent to the climate of violence and the warlike acts that have occurred in the region--either for ethical  political or security reasons. Internal tension  to which should be added outside interference of one kind or another  in supportof one side or another in conflicts  has already created a structure of militarization of forces and alliances which could at any moment lead to a wide-spread conflict. This would have uncontrollable consequences and could cause bloodshed and inevitably jeopardize the entire international situation and destroy the region.19. Hence  for the past decade  Panama has been pursuing a regional policy that is most definitely aimed at trying to bring about a peaceful settlement of the problems of the area. We want to avoid a spiral of internal confrontations continuing in the region-this has already taken on genocidal proportions and has led to warlike acts between sister countries. We have found ourselves in considerable agreement with Mexico and Venezuela as we have sought solutions by means of multilateral political negotiations among all the parties in dispute within our area.20. For this reason  too  we have promoted the principle  the right and the duty of maintaining good relations with all countries of the region without exception  though they may have political systems different from our own. Peacefully we have defended the principle  the right and the duty of preserving the neutrality of Panama both as regards the forces in dispute in the area and as regards the super-Powers. We are aware that ongoing dialogue and under-standing with all the other countries and forces  aimed at detente and harmonious coexistence  are the only way to restore security in the area and preserve international security and the security of our own country.21. We want Panama to be a forum and an 'active communicator or intermediary in the bringing about of agreements aimed at detente  and we do not want to be one of the parties to a confrontation. For this reason  and in the best diplomatic traditions of my country  we have refused to be part of any blocs or pacts that would exclude other countries  although in certain cases we have no doubts about their good intentions.22. Stability in Panama is also largely due to the fact that during the past decade complex negotiations have been held with the United States regarding the status of the Panama Canal. The TreatiesI that arose from those negotiations met a large number of the national demands of Panama. In this respect Latin American solidarity was of decisive assistance  as was the solidarity of the third world countries and others  which encourage us in our anti-colonialist policies. Although we did not obtain everything to which we were entitled  great progress was made and the new Canal Treaties establish much mere balanced relations between Panama and the United States.23.	My country's rights over the Panama Canal are beyond any doubt  since it is a waterway fed by Panamanian fresh water and we have certain rights that spring from the permanent sovereignty of my country over its natural wealth and resources.24.	It is understandable and almost inevitable that an international pact should be designed to harmonize the interests of two sovereign countries that may well have common though not identical interests. There may  of course  be differences of interpretation between the parties when it is a question of implementation. That is what has happened in this case. In so far as the stipulations of the Treaty are concerned "" Law 96-70 of the United States Congress  which authorizes the American executive to implanted the Treaty  gave rise to differences of opinion between the two Governments. My Government has made that known to the international community.25. Last Friday  I October  Ricardo de la Espriella  President of Panama  and Ronald Reagan  President of the United States  had a working meeting in Washington  a meeting of the greatest importance  five years after the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and precisely on the third anniversary of the entry into force of those instruments.26. The purpose of the meeting was to consider relations between two friendly countries  to promote complete compliance with the Canal Treaties of 1977  to bring about more just economic relations between our peoples and to make effective the common purpose of creating the conditions of harmony  justice and understanding indispensable to the efficient and optimal functioning of the Panama Canal.27. One of the merits of the visit of President de la Espriella was that it brought about in the news media and United States public opinion an understanding of the reservations that the Panamanian Government had had regarding certain measures and actions by officials of the United States that were not in harmony with the Treaties. It is our hope that a just solution to the outstanding problems will be found  in particular as regards the elimination of the discriminatory salary scale known as the Panama Area Wage Base  which as a result of actions by the Panamanian leader  might be replaced by a general salary scale that is not discriminatory if  as we hope  the United States co-operates with Panama in the achievement of that result at the next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Panama Car.al Commission  which will take place in November in Washington.28.	We should like to add that perhaps the most serious concern  f my Government in this area has to do with a proper understanding of the spirit and purpose of the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.29.	Neutrality for the inter-oceanic waterway is a goal that my country has never been willing to abandon. Its security cannot be based on military considerations. We want the Canal at all times-in times of peace and in times of war-to be a path of concord open to all the countries and nations of the world. We have never wanted the Canal to serve warlike purposes. The Canal needs security in a world like ours  in which  notwithstanding the existence of the United Nations  war 'and the use of force remain means of settling differences or international disputes. We nevertheless consider that the security of the Canal is based on relations of goodwill  friendship and co-operation among nations.30. Defence of the Canal must be within the Canal  from the Canal and for the Canal. We cannot accept the possible use of armed forces stationed there or the weapons stocked there for missions or warlike actions outside the borders of Panama. We do not want our land or the Canal built in Panamanian territory to be used for actions that undermine the neutrality that Panama has declared to the entire world. We do not want to be exposed as a military target to the uncertainties or risks of war that are so alien to us in terms of both motives and aims.31.	Such are the purposes of the neutrality Treaty  and we have therefore called upon all the nations of the world to adhere to the Protocol attached to that Treaty. We should like to renew that call on this occasion.32.	According to the Charter  the United Nations and regional bodies are mechanisms for collective security and indispensable for the maintenance of international peace. It is only logical that in order for them to be effective this international body must encompass  without exception  all countries that have a right to membership.33.	The results of the last world conflagration and the cold war for many years made it impossible to obtain the goal of universality for the United Nations. As examples we need only cite the opposition to the admission of the representatives of the People’s Republic of China for 23 years and the resistance to admission to membership of Spain  which was finally admitted together with 15 other countries in E'55. In this latter case it was clear that the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors and ministers with a Government does not imply any judgement regarding the national policies of that government.34. Votes that are cast in the General Assembly for reasons of State do not always reflect the will of the peoples. In the cases that I have mentioned  and in many others  votes are often cast for reasons that arise from certain circumstances  and at times only later do justice  reason  common sense and good-will prevail internationally and in the decision-making process of Governments  which then express their goals in international forums.35.	The same things happen regionally; sometimes the smooth functioning of a region is impeded when important sectors do not participate in the system.36.	Over the years Panama has maintained that there is a need to restructure the bodies and norms of the inter-American system. In our opinion  if the Organization of American States [VAS] is to be effective  it must be a pluralist  all-encompassing forum open to dialogue dealing with more just economic relations in the American continent  like the North-South dialogue  with the participation of all the nations of the western hemisphere.37.	Viewed thus the OAS will require as an essential distinction should be drawn between meetings which element the contribution of the United States  and the incorporation of Canada would be desirable. The incorporation or the reincorporation of those States of Central America and the Caribbean which are not now part of and have been excluded from the organization would indeed be indispensable.38. In the inter-American system  situations arise which deserve serious and the dispassionate consideration  bearing in mind the interests of the States of the region. Frequently the question is asked: can the GAS function effectively without the United States? The answer is  obviously  that it cannot  on the understanding that the United States  like other member States  accepts the obligations set forth in the charter of the OAS and in the other agreements of the inter-American system and provided that it complies with those agreements.39.	There is no doubt that within a regional system properly understood  it would be appropriate to ask if the OAS  which is experiencing a profound crisis  would  be  able to  function  effectively  without  the participation of Belize  Canada  Cuba  Guyana and Puerto Rico. .40. The primary task of this new institutional conception of the inter-American system would be  in the political arena  examination of the Central American question and of the Caribbean  normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States  eradication of colonial enclaves in Latin America  the status of the Malvinas Islands and of the Guantanamo naval base and territorial disputes between the countries of the area  as well as exploration of the possibility that in this year  which marks the bicentenary of the birth of the Liberator Sim6n Bolivar  a fraternal solution might be found by which Bolivia might attain its legitimate aspiration to the sovereign outlet to the sea of its forefathers.41. In the economic sphere  the inter-American forum' must undertake the task of considering the economic relations between Latin America and the United States of America  to place them in adjust and equitable con-text  serving as a forum for negotiations within the frameworkof North-South relations.42. The problems besetting the region are numerous in the area of trade  commodities  financing  trans-national corporations  foreign investment and the might  be  convened  by  the OAS  within  the  inter-American system and meetings of a consultative or other nature at the purely Latin American Ievel.43. The idea of holding in Caracas 0"" 24 July 1983  or an appropriate date  a Latin American ‘Summit conference to commemorate the second centenary of the birth of the Liberator has been linked to the holding of a conference of Foreign Ministers of Latin America which might take place in Panama City  headquarters of the Amphictyonic Congress of 1826  which was convened by Bolivar on the eve of the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. At the same time  initiatives have been taken by the Governments of Uruguay and Colombia regarding the holding of an inter-American meeting of heads of State or Government of the region.44. In order to dispel any confusion on this matter  a distinction should be drawn between meetings which might be convened by the OAS within the inter-American system and meetings of a consultative or  other nature at the purely Latin American Level. The former  on inter-American meetings  are held within the framework of the OAS  a regional organization which the United States and the Latin American countries belong as of right  with the exception of Belize  Cuba and Guyana  which are not members of the regional body.45. The twelfth general assembly of the OAS  which will be attended by the foreign ministers of the United States and member States  will be held in a few weeks  in November of this year  in Washington. It would not be logical to consider the possibility of an inter-American meeting of Foreign Ministers in December  as the November meeting will offer an opportunity to consider at that level matters of common interest to the countries of the area.46.	A different matter would be a consultative meeting or a meeting to deal with matters contained in a previously agreed agenda  attended by all Latin American countries  including Belize  Cuba and Guyana  which are excluded from the OAS.47.	The Secretary-General of the OAS  Mr. Alejandro Orfila  effectively helped to clarify the situation when  on 14 September  he went on record in favour of the proposal for a hemispheric meeting of heads of State becau.se  in his opinion.  it is necessary to bring inter-American relations up to date. In his statement  Mr. Orfila visualized an inter-American summit meeting within the framework of the OAS and  of course  without the participation of Belize  Cuba and Guyana. However  Mr. Ortila went on to say that it is truly essential for Latin America to reach agreement on its own points of view  before those views are brought up at the hemispheric level. What Mr. Orfila meant was that this was a Latin American meeting  by Latin Americans and for Latin Americans. This cannot be interpreted in any other way.48. In his statement  Mr. Orfila considers the feasibility of a exclusively Latin American meeting at which  logically  Behze  Cuba and Guyana  which are Latin American countries  would also participate.49. The Latin American meeting  which is different from the inter-American meeting  would then be the framework within which  without hostility or antagonism towards any country  great or  small   an effort would be made to reach agreement on positions and strategies in the political and economic spheres to defend• and  promote common interests of Latin American  countries.50. The fact that the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance 2 that is  the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro of 1947  was ineffective during the South Atlantic crisis has naturally caused concern in all sectors of the Latin American region concerning the future of collective security for the countries of the hemisphere. This is unquestionably a matter deserving of the closest attention on the part of the Latin American countries. It should be the subject of consultations between them  in an effort’s to define onceand for all tile fate of this regional agreement. A Latin American consultation on that subject should precede a hemispheric meeting which  without doubt  must also  include in its agenda the status of the Rio Treaty.51. Lack of timely action would  in our opinion  mean that consideration might once again be given at title Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Commitment of Non-Aligners Countries  to be held b New Delhi in 1983  to the proposal to denounce the Rio Treaty put forward by the host country at the Sixth Conference held in Havana in 1979. That proposal was not discussed then because of Panama's firm opposition to that action. which it considered inopportune at that time  but it has been given a new dimension by the Malvinas crisis.52. International relations are now subject to a caustic cold war dialogue. Local confrontations have spread to other spheres and there are legitimate fears that the lack of understanding and communication which make possible peaceful intercourse among nations in conflict can gradually lead to a third world war.53.	Latin America has its own cultural characteristics and common interests of an economic and social nature. as well as historical roots which bind us to the nations of Central America. South America. Mexico and the Caribbean as a regional group with well-defined qualities of its own.54.	The community of Latin American nations attaches the highest importance to ail its relations with the United States and is seeking to develop them in a harmonious. friendly and cordial way in a spirit of reciprocal co-operation and of respect for its territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence and for the principle of the sovereign equality of States. When these relations have an adverse effect and when there is tension or friction between Latin American countries or between us and the United States as is the case with Cuba and Nicaragua  there is natural concern. 'as expressed b) the President 'Of Mexico  Jose L6pez Portillo  and the President of Venezuela  Luis Herrem Campins  and a desire to seek the path of conciliation  understanding and peace.55. The regional bodies bringing together exclusively Latin American countries. which historically were brought together by Bolivar  who wished to guide them towards unity and integration are today a political reality which is part of the system of international relations.56.	The most representative Latin American bodies are part of' the group of Latin American States within the' United Nations system and the Latin American Economic System  which is not only a mechanism for Latin American consultation and co-ordination but also a part of its strategy of conducting economic relations under the wise  skilful and admirable leader-ship of the Latin American statesman  Carlos Alzamora  to whom Panama expresses the appreciation and gratitude of the Latin American countries for what he has done to promote the genuine interests of Latin America.57.	In general  the regional organizations constitute a typical example of modern international law. This is not just a phenomenon pertaining to our region. Just as there is within the United Nations the regional Latin American group  there are also  as independent and separate entities  the group of Western European and other States  which includes the United States  the African group  the Asian group and the .Eastern European group.58. The importance of the regional groups of the third world of manifested by the Group of 771 made up primarily of the States of the Asian  African and Latin American groups. Its work affects the North-South dialogue has to do with the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  the 1980s  the process of global negotiations' and the adoption of criteria for programmes of action. As regards the sessions of UNCTAD  the sixth session will take place in Belgrade in 1983; each and Every regional group of the world including the Latin  American group  through the Latin American Economic System holds coordination meetings prior to UNCTAD sessions  which lead to a plenary meeting of the Group of 77  where spokesmen from. Latin America. Africa and Asia set forth criteria on each subject which will be put forward at the UNCTAD session.59. This explains why there are purely Latin American bodies with the right to participate on an equal footing as the Asian and African groups  and the group of Western Europe and other States  which includes the United States  the Eastern. European group and other organizations made up of countries with common interests  such as the Organization60. Latin America rightly wished to strengthen its capacity to negotiate within and outside this hemi-sphere using purely Latin American machinery. Latin America wants Latin American solutions to Latin American problems  from a Latin American point of view  implementing principles of friendship and"" co-operation with an countries of the world in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.61. The designs of the former colonial empires do not change in their anachronistic attempts to control the maritime routes to nearby countries in the ocean spaces to which they attribute strategic values. Both here in the Assembly and .in the Security Council  and in other international forums  we have said that colonialism is reprehensible and must be eliminated: regardless of the State or States practising It. We maintain that colonialism is an evil wherever it arises. In the inter-American system colonialism has no legitimacy. The concern expressed in t 940 by the Foreign Ministers of the States of the Americas as regards Nazi occupation of European countries with possessions in the Americas must  of course  apply to the eradication of colonial situations which still endure in this hemisphere  as Bolivar stated when the Panama Congress was convened.62. In accordance with its anti-colonialist position  which is one of the constant features of Panama's foreign policy  we support Argentina's sovereign claim to the Malvinas Islands. Panama considers that from the historic and legal point of view these islands and the adjacent waters are part of the territory of the Republic of Argentina. This was the position in law and in fact until  150 years ago  Great Britain  pursuing its imperialist designs  which had resulted in the domination of oceans and continents  set foot on those islands against the will of Argentina.63. The British colonial presence there today is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter  con-firmed and developed in so many General Assembly decisions to constitute a consistent body of legal norms condemning colonialism and expansionism  which must be respected by all Members of the Organization.64. Faithful to these decisions  my Government  together with other Latin American countries  sup-ported the request by 20 Foreign Ministers to include this item in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly  in the hope that by means of negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and on the basis of the principles and norms of inter-national law a final solution might be found to this problem  which disrupted international peace and security at the cost of so many human lives.65. This final solution must be based on the return to Argentine sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands and their dependencies  the early withdrawal of British forces and the adoption of a statute guaranteeing the orderly transfer from British administration to Argentine administration  safeguarding the interests of the employees of the English Falkland Islands Company and the British nationals who are residents of the islands.66. The case of the Maivinas Islands  which with its adjacent seas is de jure under the sovereignty of the Republic of Argentina  may be seen as similar to that of Namibia  which is so dear to the nations of southern Africa. South America has invoked security needs to prolong its arbitrary occupation of Namibia  saying that the Cape route  as a means of access to the South Atlantic and European and North American ports  is essential to the survival of western civilization. .67. In both cases the colonial Powers have raised obstacles to the settlement of nationals of the countries under colonial oppression and almost isolated the occupied territories to keep out anything which might go against the colonial structure  manipulating the demographic composition of the territories subjected to their colonial domination for their own evil purposes.68.	This is the Pretoria regime's pretext for its claim that the territory  waters and air space of Walvis Bay are an integral part of the territory of South Africa.69.	This pretension of South  Africa's sordid colonialism which has so frequently been rejected by the General Assembly  is the same as  that invoked by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to keep the Malvinas Islands occupied by force. It is argued in England that occupation of the Malvinas Islands by a State member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] is essential for the control of the maritime routes of the South Atlantic and for the transport of oil from the Persian Gulf to Western Europe and the eastern coast of the United States. That is also related to the British desire to maintain a strategic position in regard to its designs over Antarctica.70. With an effrontery equal to that of South Africa in its claims to control Walvis Bay  England wishes to take from Argentina by force the Malvinas Islands  an integral part of its sovereignty. Africa and Latin America  because of their anti-colonialist positions  and the rest of the third world  will not allow the British and the South Africans to continue in their brazen attitude and there will soon be independence for Namibia  including Walvis Bay as an integral part of its territory  just as the Malvinas Islands and their dependencies will be returned to Argentine sovereignty.71.	In the colonial war of the South Atlantic  Argentina's national honour remained untarnished. In that southern sea there was a brave display of heroism and courage by the Argentine armed forces  who shed their blood in defence of the integrity of their home-land  which is also part of the Latin American continent  and they will make further claims and show further courage for the homelands of Sarmiento and San Martin.72.	In the face of the colonial anachronism  Latin America will join hands to bring about the restoration of the Malvinas Islands to Argentina. Latin American nationalism must achieve that without delay. Impelled by the ideals and hopes of the Argentine people  we hope together for victory. We stand together with them and with the present and future generations of the heroic Argentine nation.73.	On 12 October  according to a communication we have received  there will be a commemoration around Nelson's Column entitled"" A victory march""  an attempt  o convey an imperialist picture of England. Why have they chosen 12 October? Why Columbus Day? On that day 500 million people celebrate their Hispanic cultural heritage. Why should they be insulted in this way? We should like to lodge a protest on behalf of the many human beings who are offended by this action  which has no justification in modern times.74. The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 solemnly proclaimed the need to bring to a speedy and unconditional end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations  an end to all practices of segregation and discrimination. That charter on decolonization is part of the spirit  of our era and it is aimed at the complete elimination of colonialism in the world and at overcoming the opposition of the colonial Powers to implementation of one of the basic  supreme principles of the San Francisco Charter.75.	There still exist in Africa  Latin America  Asia and Europe colonial enclaves which do not belong in today's world. Sources of conflict are the British enclaves of Gibraltar  Hong Kong and the Malvinas Islands  which are an offence to the countries to which they belong and must be returned to the sovereignty of Spain  the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Argentina respectively.76.	Let me take this opportunity to explain why the Government of China can reject the threat made by the British Prime Minister and the allegation that the treaties by which the Manchu Dynasty granted England the colony of Hong Kong are valid under international law. Beijing is right in saying that Hong Kong is part of the territory of China. The three treaties going back to the nineteenth century on which Great Britain rests its case are contrary to inter-national law because they were unequal treaties; they were never accepted by the people of China; consequently Beijing is entitled to recover the entire colony when the conditions are ripe.77.	These unequal treaties are no longer relevant. They are like the unequal treaties which were imposed on Spain in 1713 regarding Gibraltar and on Panama in 1903 regarding the inter-ocean waterway. Hong Kong  the Malvinas Islands and Gibraltar are unjustifiable anachronisms which are in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. They threaten inter-national peace and security. These enclaves must be returned to the People's Republic of China  the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain  as a sign of respect for the sovereignty of those countries and in the interests of justice  in harmony with the spirit of our time.78. I should like to refer to another subject. The situation in the Central American isthmus is a source of constant concern to my Government. The civil war in El Salvador  the violence and the terror which have gripped the countries in the area  endangering the lives of the people  are rooted in the exploitation of human effort  the economic and soci91 inequality which has existed and the violations of human rights and democratic principles which have prevailed for decades in the Latin American region. The present armed confrontation is an extreme and critical stage in the age-old fruitless struggle of thousands of men and women of all ages to secure proper living conditions within an economic  social and political system which each Central American country has chosen for itself without any foreign pressure or interference.79. As a result of civil war in Central America  peaceful people have been displaced and belligerants have been moved across frontiers  and this has given rise to clashes between the armed forces of the countries involved in those movements. Everything is ripe for a conflagration which could involve the entire region and be a pretext for open intervention by outside Powers and an international conflict of enormous proportions and complexity. That is whywe are alarmed at the increasingly crude language of the authorities of some countries in the area who speak glibly of the possibility of war between certain countries and refuse to foresee the terrible hardship which would ensue for thousands of women  children and old people in the area.80. All those who can view with equanimity this sinister possibility  which many in the area would have us do  recognize that this announced war would be a disaster for all contending parties equally. They would emerge from it impoverished and indebted and in a worse position  without ever having solved the problems they have to cope with today.81. It is the added misfortune of these heroic peoples that the rivalry of the super-Powers  which are unilaterally trying to seize world supremacy  has encroached on the Central American region  where they are threatening to make into pawns in their struggles people who seek only their identity  their independence  their freedom  justice and bread.82.	In that connection we can say confidently that Central American problems cannot be solved without a dialogue. Panama has always been prepared to promote a dialogue  with the participation of all interested parties-in particular  Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua.83.	Similar thoughts inspired President de la Espriella of Panama when lie said that there was an urgent need to promote machinery for regional and world reconciliation and to engage in negotiations about the internal and- external conflicts of the Latin American region. The President of Panama also said that he was much in sympathy with  and supported  the initiative taken by the Presidents of Mexico and Venezuela  Mr. Lopez Portillo and Mr. Herrera Campins  to resolve these disputes by negotiation. These leaders sent letters to Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra  Co-ordinator of the Governing Junta of Nicaragua  to Roberto Suazo C6rdova  President of Honduras  and to Ronald Reagan  President of the United States of America  in an effort to promote detente and peace in Central America.84. Panama's position on international affairs was clearly set out in the speech by Pesident de la Espriella to the diplomatic corps in Panama on 16 September last  when he said:""Consistent with the policies of Omar Torrijos  we have reaffirmed the Bolivarian  Latin America   neutral and non-aligned states of Panama and our recognition of the duties arising from that status. We confirm our country's tradition of developing friendly relations with all the peoples of the world  on a basis of equality and mutual respect  and our constant readiness to promote detente and the peaceful settlement of disputes  especially in the geographical area to which we belong.""We support the principle of the sovereign equality of States... We continue to support the collective purposes of the Latin American countries and the countries of the third world in their efforts to bring about a new international economic order and a new international political order  based on the sovereignty of States and the permanent sovereignty of all States over their natural resources.""This encompasses-Panama believes-the right to self-determination  which means that every people should be able to choose whatever political system it considers to be in accord with its interests and wishes  without outside interference. For this reason  we shall continue to support the efforts of the peoples to fight colonialism and defend their independence and integrity  rejecting all forms of interference and threats against other countries  especially those of our area.""Consistent with our Latin American commitment and our Bolivarian traditions  we reiterate Panama's willingness"" as the historic site of the Amphictyonic congress  to be the setting for the peaceful settlement of the problems of our area.""85. The independence of Puerto Rice) is one task of the liberating revolution of the Latin American countries which has been long delayed. Bolivar and other leaders of the prolonged struggle started by the rebel-lions for emancipation knew that their great enterprise in seeking independence would end only when all the peoples of the Antilles had rid themselves of the European colonizers.86. At the Congress of Panama there was discussion of the need for concerted action to bring about the independence of Cuba and Puerto Rico  which were subject to Spanish domination. That desire is not new in Panama or the other countries of Latin America. In 1903 Mr. Belisario Porras  three times President of the Republic and one of the greatest statesmen of this century said that the United States was opposed to Spanish domination of Cuba and Puerto Rico because it wished to exercise hegemony.87.	It was eight decades after the battle of Ayacucho before Cuba was liberated  but Puerto Rico emerged from Spanish domination only to fall under the domination of the United States. The people of Puerto Rico must be allowed to decide on their own the question of their nationality and the character and structure of their political organization  free from all pressure and without any interference from any quarter.88.	The question of Puerto Rico has historic roots. The fact that it has not been included in the agenda for this session does not mean that there is a solution and does not prove that the problem does not exist. It would be naive to believe that the votes cast here for reasons of State reflect public opinion in Latin America.. The debate in the General Committee and in the General Assembly should warn the administering Power that the vote of confidence many countries have given it is not forever.89  It is' clear that there must be a dialogue for peace and that an effort must be made to achieve a permanent  positive solution protecting the Political and cultural personality of Puerto Rico. Latin Americans have a special affection for the people of Puerto Rico and recognize their right to self-determination and their option to be part of the Latin American community  on an equal footing with all the other countries of the western hemisphere.90. The question of Lebanon is directly ""elated to the question of Palestine  which is the central element in the Middle East conflict with every passing day it is more and more clear that it is not possible to bring about a just  complete and lasting peace in the area without the Palestinian people exercising its .inalienable national rights.91. In its resolution 36/226 A of 1981  the General Assembly  inter alia  strongly condemned Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the continuous bombardment and destruction of its cities and villages  and all acts that constitute a violation of its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and the security of its people.92. Panama rejects and condemns terrorism  whether Moslem  Christian or Judaic whatever the source-but we also reject and condemn State terrorism  which is among the crimes that are the most execrable and offensive to the conscience of mankind. The massacre in the refugee camps in Beirut two weeks ago has horrified the universal conscience. Men  women  children and old people were killed in cold blood in numbers that amounted to genocide.93.	President Reagan  who has conceived a plan for a Palestinian homeland on the West Bank  was informed by the French Government of the chilling and terrible facts  which strike the hearer to the  soul. In his column on 22 September  James Reston reported that when the French troops arrived at the Palestinian refugee camps they were allowed to destroy the mines which had been buried  but the Israeli troops did not allow them to protect the refugee camps. The camps were entered by the IsraeIis' ""Christian"" allies  who killed the occupants while the Israeli troops stood on guard outside.94.	The massacres of Shatila and Sabra  for which world public (\pinion holds the Christian Phalangists and the State of Israel responsible  will be an eternal blot on the names of those who committed this crime against humanity. The condemnation of the world will hang over their heads  as a curse of dishonour and infamy  which will spread through time and space to hang over the heads of their descendants for successive generations. Those responsible for this atrocious crime cannot associate themselves with the ethical values of Christian or Jewish culture  which have so much to do with the civilization o our times.95.	The torture and suffering of the legendary Maccabees and the tragic martyrdom of the innocent children of Bethlehem murdered by the order of Herod have remained in the memory of mankind in the same way as will the enormity of the massacres at Shatila and Sabra. The Beirut martyrs will not have  died in vain if their sacrifice means the birth of the Palestinian nation.96. It may be appropriate to remind the Assembly that  in connection with the Conference of Ministers• for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries which took place in Belgrade in 197   on behalf of the Torrijos Government I defined certain fundamental principles of foreign policy of the Republic of Panama laid down in successive non-aligned conferences. These are equally valid in 1982  and I will repeat what said.97.	The Government of Panama maintains ""as a fundamental tenet of its foreign policy its rejection of the presence"" or foreign military forces in any country of the world. The Panamanitm Government does not justify or excuse any action by East or West against the right to self-determination and the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States.98. Panama recognizes that it has an historic mission to promote the scientific and technological development of the countries of its area  in order to bring about their economic and social liberation and to accelerate their integration. Panama promotes the idea of Latin American nationalism  based on solidarity and recognition of a pluralist reality. Panama reaffirms its view that we should strengthen that Latin American nationalism  which is particularly necessary so that we may deal with our problems  free from foreign interference  promote the interests of Latin America and prevent anything entering into Latin American policies which could undermine the personality of our peoples and the sovereignty of our States.99. Panama devotes priority attention to its relations with its sister Republics of Colombia and Costa Rica  which are neighbouring countries. It recognizes the need to co-ordinate efforts to promote development and the balance and harmonious exploitation of our border areas.100.	Panama respects human rights above and beyond any political or ideological considerations.101.	Panama  as a signatory of the Declaration of Ayacucho 3 respects the Treaty of Tlatelolc04 and co-operates in giving effect to the prohibition of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the limitation of conventional weapons in Latin American countries  although that does not affect our capacity to protect our territorial integrity and defend ourselves from colonialist aggression from this continent or other'"" continents.102.	Latin America is anxiously watching the controversy regarding possession of the territories of the Esequibo. All the countries of the Latin American region are confident that this dispute will be settled by negotiation and will be resolved rationally  with no room for ill feeling between neighbouring countries  on the basis of understanding and a sense of justice.103.	Panama welcomes the efforts to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. We restate our position in support of the termination of the embargo against Cuba and our solidarity with that country in its demand for the return of the Guantanamo naval base.104.	As a result of the good offices of the countries of the area  we hope that relations of Grenada and Nicaragua with the United States will be improved on the basis of understanding  co-operation and good-neighbourliness.105.	With regard to the Middle East  Panama believes that existing conflicts should be settled peacefully within the framework of the United Nations. A just  and lusting settlement  in the opinion of Panama  must include the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the right of Israel and all the peoples and countries of the area to live in peace within recognized and secure boundaries.106. Panama recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to its own independent State As regards Jerusalem  Panama  like the Vatican • does not recognize the annexation of Jerusalem and insists on  the  internationalization of the Holy Places. Similarly  we do not recognize the annexation of the' Golan Heights  which belong to Syria  or the annexation of any other occupied Arab territory.107.	Panama will continue to call for the withdrawal of the Turkish army from Cyprus and for respect for the territorial integrity  independence and non-aligned status of the island. We demand. compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and  in  particular  General Assembly resolution 3212  and Security Council resolution 365.108.	Panama deplores the continuance of the absurd war between Iran and Iraq  which must be brought to an end by means of a just and honourable political settlement which restores peace between those two sister countries in accordance with the principles If  the Charter of the United Nations.109. We hope that the great Korean nation will initiate a constructive dialogue between the: com-munities of the North and the South  leading to the peaceful brotherly reunification of that great political entity in the Korean peninsula.110. Tension must be reduced in South-East Asia and comprehensive politica1 solutions must be found through negotiations  with the active participation of all the parties concerned  in the hope that peace will quickly be restored to the area.Ill. As regards southern Africa  Panama is opposed to racism  racial discrimination  apartheid  and the unjust oppression by the Pretoria regime of the great African national majority. We support unreservedly the aspirations of the people of Namibia and Azania and reaffirm our solidarity with the front-line countries and the national liberation movements of South Africa  in particular the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the African National Congress [ANC].112.	Panama  which was the first Latin American country to recognize the existence of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  supports the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.113.	Panama was also one of the first countries to speak out against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan; calling for compliance with the resolutions of the General Assembly demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the territorial integrity independence and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.114.	As a maritime country using the Indian Ocean and belonging to the third world  Panama maintains its enthusiastic support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  and condemns the rivalry of the super-Powers of the East and the West in that area  since it constitutes a threat and a source"" of anxiety to the coastal States of the Indian Ocean.115. The ideas expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization [A/3711] are very thought-provoking. Although we do not wish to make any comparisons with the reports of his predecessors  in our opinion this is a document notable for its clarity and sincerity in describing the  5tuation of the United Nations and indicating the omissions  evasions and insufficiencies in the fulfilment of its responsibilities of under the Charter. The Secretary-General affirms that these shortcomings have undermined the confidence of the world public and makes positive suggestions as to the action that should be taken to regain that lost confidence.116. In 1978  when I participated in the general debate at the tenth special session  the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  I said:""The United Nations  which came into being at the end of the Second World War as a system of co-operation and not of confrontation  has not been able to operate successfully the machinery provided in the San Francisco Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Proof of that is to be found in the tragic conflicts between the Arab nation and the states of Israel in the Near East  the Calvary of the Palestinian nations with its inalienable rights trampled under foot  the infamous aggression and untold suffering to which the people of Lebanon have been subjected  the tragic occupation of the Republic of Cyprus by the illegitimate action of the Turkish army  the repugnant subjugation of Namibia by the racist regime of Pretoria  the abominable imposition of apartheid at the expense of the vast native majority in South Africa... the blood!' conflict among sister nations on the African constraint 2-.nd the reprehensible colonialist cells which still persist as hateful blots on the Latin American map:'117.   Without  trying  to  unravel  the  many political puzzles of the United Nations  Panama  during the six years of the past decade that it was a member of the Security Council  tried to free that United Nations organ from its inertia  so that it could carry out its sacred duties under the Charter.118. when we began our work of' found ourselves in a situation similar to that just before the Second World War  which came about as a result of the failure of the League of Nations  the cause of which was the negative attitude of the major Powers as manifested in their reluctance to take the enforcement action provided for in the Covenant  thus robbing the League of its effectiveness  bringing it into discredit  and finally to extinction.119. Hesitancy in dealing with critical situations that require preventive or corrective action to deal with conflicts  tensions and confrontations among Member States; failure to comply with General Assembly and Security Council decisions by large  medium-sized and small Member States; the persistence of the super-Powers in manufacturing and stockpiling nuclear weapons and conventional weapons with indiscriminate effects  including chemical and bacteriological weapons; the indifference of those countries to decisions adopted at special sessions of the General Assembly on disarmament and many other cases of a similar nature today  as in the past  have led to dismay and frustration on the part of the peoples of the entire world.120. Year after year  we the representatives of the small and medium-sized countries which make up the vast majority of the Organization  have been repeating our denunciations  confirming our aspirations  casting votes in support of solutions which are not only just but also obviously viable; but nothing has changed in the conduct of the Organization. There have been the same flouting of the law  the same deplorable conditions for hundreds of millions of human beings who are asking only for bread  justice and peace. We have brought these things to the Assembly's attention and debated them  but they have resulted only in thousands of pages now filed away in the archives of this body.121. All that is the background to the views put before us by the Secretary-General  which sound in our ears like a shout of alarm  a cry of anguish. We must repeat the truth  again and again  even though it is painful  to realize that whatever we say is a waste of breath. Nevertheless  it Is  impossible to resign ourselves to the deterioration of the Organization. This can be halted; it can be remedied. In carrying out my official duties I frequently travel throughout tile countries of the third world; that is why I am certain that the lack of confidence of peoples in the United Nations is not a repudiation of the Organization. They wish [0 revitalize the Organization  and enable it to solve the vital problems of mankind  utilizing the plentiful resources available.122. The small and m': Hum-sized countries will not renounce their ideals and aspirations  forged in the fires of the Second World War and expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. There will be no slackening of efforts for a just and lasting peace  no cessation of the call for collective and personal security. They have not resigned themselves to oppression  nor have they lost their faith in right. .123.	They are confident that their firmness will lead to the removal of the obstacles that have impeded action by the United Nations and obstructed the realization of the goals of the Charter-•the assurance of peace  the consolidation of security and the establishment of a new international economic order.124.	The small and medium-sized countries lack the physical means to build a more erective system of collective security. But what we can do is speak out in international forums  as we are doing in the General Assembly. We can speak in unison and call on the major Powers to stop their rivalry and confrontation and to place their resources and potential at the service of the United Nations  and implement the Secretary-General's proposal to hold a meeting of the Security Council at the highest possible level to discuss in depth the burning problems of the inter-national community.125. We must enhance the dignity of the United Nations by returning to the spirit which prevailed at its founding and devoting itself to the tasks jointly undertaken  in a moment of enlightenment  by the Powers which had suffered the material and human devastations of the Nazi..Fascist aggression .which caused the Second World War.126. With a sufficient amount of imagination and determination we can join forces to keep the sacred promise to mankind made in the San Francisco ChaI1er-to save present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war and self-destruction.127.	There is still time to heed the appeal of the non-aligned at New Delhi to turn a page in the history of mankind  a page revealing an awareness of our common destiny and the solidarity of all peoples."
"108",5519,"PER",37,1982,"1.	I should like at the outset  Sir  to convey to you the greetings and congratulations of the delegation of Peru on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This is recognition of your personal qualities as well as a tribute to Hungary  a country which has participated so actively and so significantly in the work of the United Nations.2.	My delegation also wishes to express its appreciation and to convey its congratulations to Mr. Tsmat Kittani  who at a critical time for the international community demonstrated his exceptional abilities as an experienced and skilful diplomat.3.	You will understand  Sir  with what satisfaction we greet Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary- General. Peru takes pride in his election and in the contribution that he is making t^ the cause of the international community.4.	Since it took office on 28 July 1980 the constitutional Government of Peru has shouldered the difficult task of putting into practice a spirit of democracy in which the effectiveness of a modem Consti-tution  the interplay of the branches of government  respect for human rights and the full enjoyment of freedoms should constitute the best assurance that we shall achieve our ideal of making man the supreme end of our social efforts.5.	Two years have elapsed under the present Government and Peru takes satisfaction in the fact that it is fulfilling its aims. Freedom of expression for all the communications media is now absolute in our country. The elections that took place in 1980 were followed in November 1981 by complementary elections at the municipal level. These indicated increased support for the party led by President Fernando Belaunde Terry  which gained 70 per cent of the votes cast at the national level.416.	The problems of the present-day world are clearly causing serious frustrations in society to which it is reacting in different ways. The great majorities opt for political avenues which  in various ways  seek to find within the legal order appropriate replies to the requirements of collective well-being. Unfortunately  there are also those who react to adversity in irrational  blind and irresponsible ways.7.	Despite the resolve and efforts of our Government to promote justice  well-being and progress within the framework of democratic principles  some minority groups  seeking to use violence to introduce an ill- defined political  economic and social programme  have resorted to acts which cause irreparable loss of human life and very serious material damage for a developing country. The Peruvian people rejects this criminal activity as shocking to its conscience and damaging to its interests  for what is destroyed is lost to all. Our whole country has  therefore  through its representative institutions and the broad range of political parties present in our national Parliament  condemned terrorism and continues to do so. Our Government has taken steps to prevent it  in strict observance of human rights. To that end  our Government will guarantee public peace with the necessary firmness  but without overstepping legal bounds in any respect. Persons involved in criminal offences have been brought before the judiciary the independence of which cannot be questioned for it is the only authority empowered to decide on the guilt of those involved and to apply the necessary penalties.8.	His Holiness Pope John Paul II  in his pontifical message of 1980  reminded us that building peace is the task of all men and all nations and that violence is an evil unworthy of man  unacceptable as a solution to our problems  contrary to the truth of our humanity and  indeed  destructive of what it seeks to defend: the dignity  life and freedom of the human being. But he told us also: ""We cannot sincerely condemn recourse to violence unless we engage in a corresponding effort to replace it by courageous political initiatives which aim at eliminating threats to peace by attacking the roots of injustice."" That is precisely what the Government of Peru is seeking to do at the domestic level.9.	Hence  together with the legitimate exercise of its constitutional responsibilities  the Government is pursuing a set of activities designed to bring about improvement in the depressed economic and social conditions of the poorest areas of our country  those areas in which the largest number of acts of violence have taken place. This poverty is the result of complex geographical conditions  isolation and the failure for over a century to address basic needs. It is being faced through courageous development programmes that will alleviate the difficult situation of the people living in those areas.10.	Peru has signed all the international agreements on human rights to which it could accede and the principles of those agreements are embodied in the new Constitution. Our Government bases its efforts upon those principles in bringing about the full realization of each person and a regime of democracy and social solidarity. The occasional stories reaching the international community which attempt to contradict the spirit of authentic respect for human dignity in my country today must surely come as a surprise to those who have had an opportunity to visit Peru and to witness the climate of freedom prevailing in my country.11.	In the international arena  Peru has sought further to achieve ever closer ties with its neighbour countries  links to which it attaches particular importance within its traditional policy of respect for the rights of others as well as zealous defence of its own rights.12.	Peru has continued to participate actively in the processes of regional economic co-operation and integration. My Government has supported and resolutely contributed to the reactivation of the Andean Croup and to promoting the Latin American Integration Association  as well as in regional consultations and co-operation  within the framework of the Latin American Economic System  which are institutions to which Peru attaches the greatest importance in the strengthening and unity of Latin America as an effective response to the frustrations and unusual economic measures that the region as a whole and some countries in particular have experienced during the recent crisis in the South Atlantic.13.	Moreover  in order to foster Latin American integration and co-operation  the Latin American region must be organized physically. In this respect  the Bolivarian Highway along the edge of the jungle  an initiative of President Belaunde Terry  which has received broad support from Latin American and Andean countries  is today in an advanced stage of completion. In the same spirit  President Belaunde has rescued the ambitious project of interconnecting the three major watersheds of the South American continent  a project which would make it possible to move large volumes of goods  services and passengers in the heart of our region. My Government is confident that  after the technical meeting on watershed inter-connection which took place last year in Lima  we will soon be able to undertake that work.14.	On the other hand  the project for the creation of a trust fund for the promotion of horizontal technical co-operation with the countries of Central America and the Caribbean  which I presented at the 6th meeting of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly  has met with broad support from the countries of that area and from the Administration of UNDP. We hope that that fund  too  will be established in the near future.Similarly  my country is participating in the necessary deliberations relating to the inter-American system. It is our view that it has become imperative to re-emphasize the capacity for concerted action among the countries of the region vis-a-vis the only country of the region which has world-wide interest. This task should not lead to exclusions of any kind  but rather to a clearer identification of our interests and a better representation and defence of those interests in continental and world forums.16. The number of critical situations in the world has increased and  paradoxically  none of those that have now become traditional has yet been overcome. The worsening of the situation is seriously infecting the United Nations  and the constantly repeated appeals to States to act in conformity with the principles of the Charter are no longer sufficient. It has become absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of a cynical attitude.17.	The basic elements of this situation are an alarming tendency to disregard the obligations of international law  in particular the obligation to abstain from the resort to aggression or the use or threat of force; policies of strength and the maintenance of spheres of influence or domination; interference in the internal affairs of States; the impossibility of getting the process of disarmament under way  and the frustrations encountered at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament; the obstacles that are preventing the establishment of a new international economic order; the difficulties experienced in concluding the process of decolonization; policies of apartheid and racial dis-crimination; and the crisis in the United Nations.18.	The Secretary-General has submitted his report on the work of the Organization  the importance and scope of which will be recognized by the world public. This report sums up the genuine anxiety of our peoples and shows the need to listen to the voice of reason and morality in the present dramatic circumstances. The Assembly will examine various aspects of the report  debate the proposals it contains and draw from it the new inspiration the Organization needs for the preservation of peace and the betterment of mankind and to ensure that it does not fail as the depositary of ideals which are beyond its ability and the will of our Governments to achieve.l9. The meagre results of the action of the Security Council compel us to ask whether the assumptions upon which the Organization was founded have been overtaken by events. What is required is concerted diplomatic action at the highest level  as proposed by the Secretary-General  or any other approach which can ensure that the position of political privilege conferred upon the permanent members of the Security Council will be used for the effective fulfilment of their responsibilities with regard to international peace and co-operation. Otherwise we shall have to consider amendments to the Charter.20.	We hope that the Secretary-General's firmness in presenting matters to the Assembly as he sees them and not as we would wish to see them will serve to promote a debate that will review the Orga-nization  because our peoples are beset by a two-fold anxiety: daily survival in terrible economic and social conditions  and survival as a species in the face of the increasing probability of a nuclear conflict.21.	Our region has brought to the Assembly the question of the Malvinas Islands. Everybody is aware of our support for the principle of decolonization of the Malvinas Islands and for the claim of the sister Republic of Argentina to sovereignty over that archipelago. This is also called for in resolutions of the United Nations and the Organization of American States and in declarations by the movement of non- aligned countries. Faithful to its dedication to peace  Peru has made intense and repeated efforts to ensure a negotiated solution of the conflict and will continue to support negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom through the intermediary of the Secretary-Genera).22.	In Central America there is a growing tendency towards confrontation  and the considerable difficulties faced by the peoples of the area are compounded by forms of foreign intervention  political polarization and internal and external armed struggle. It is necessary for States both within and outside this region  instead of trying for ideological reasons to decide how others should organize themselves to try urgently to provide broad support for their development.23.	Peru deeply regrets the recent deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. We have made clear our rejection of intervention in and military use of the territory of Lebanon^ in violation of its indepen-dence and sovereignty  the persistence of policies of force and the commission of genocidal crimes against the Palestinian people.24.	In this world forum  in the name of the Government and people of Peru  I reiterate our most vigorous condemnation  as already expressed by the Chief Executive of my country  of these acts  which violate the most elementary principles of human coexistence.25.	Recent developments have clearly and painfully shown that the question of Palestine constitutes the central factor of the Middle East crisis. It is our view that for reasons of principle  of history and of justice  the Palestinian people must exercise the inalienable rights of all people  as recognized by the Organization.26.	We renew our appeal to all the parties to the conflict to co-operate in the search for a comprehensive and definitive political settlement  taking into account the rights of all the peoples of the region  within the framework of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly.27.	The stability and well-being of South-East Asia are linked to the problem of Kampuchea. Peru is a member of the /It/ Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea  and we hope that the bases established by the General Assembly  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  will lead to a negotiated settlement.28.	We support the steps taken by the Secretary- General with respect to Afghanistan and Cyprus. Only with the political will of the parties will it be possible to achieve just and balanced agreements which  as in the case of Kampuchea  presupposes the withdrawal of foreign troops and self-determination for the peoples involved.29.	Peru hopes that the question of Korea can be resolved by peaceful and negotiated means by the parties.30.	The struggle for independence in Territories that have not yet overcome colonialism continues. Namibia must be rescued from the illegal occupation from which it is suffering. Peru  an active member of the Special Committee against apartheid; condemns and rejects this practice  which is an infringement of human dignity.31.	The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea' is the fruit of a long and arduous effort to reconcile the rights and interests of States in different circumstances by means of universal rules ensuring the rational utilization of the ocean areas not as an instrument of hegemony but as an instrument of justice  peace  security  co-operation  development and well-being for all peoples. Each State must now evaluate the advantages of a legal order  respect for and implementation of which would protect their most essential rights and interests both within and outside zones of national jurisdiction. My Government is making such an assessment in the light of certain provisions of our Constitution and the laws of our Republic. It will be for the Congress of my country to express its approval or disapproval of the Convention. Meanwhile we shall follow with close attention the statements made by other Governments  in the hope that the will for justice and international concord will prevail.32.	Peru will continue to defend its rights of sovereignty and jurisdiction over its adjacent waters and the sea-bed and subsoil thereof to the limit of 200 miles  for the purposes that have been foreseen since 1947  as part of its maritime territory and without prejudice to freedom of international communication. Furthermore  it will not renounce the defence of the rules established by the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Juris-diction  adopted in 1970 Those principles have been incorporated in the Convention  according to which the sea bed and its resources outside the limits of national jurisdiction constitute the common heritage of mankind and can be exploited only for the benefit of all countries  under an international regime and international machinery. We shall regard as illegal any use of the international sea-bed zone by States that have adopted unilateral legislation or which have subscribed to agreements of reciprocity contrary to the principles of the Convention. We trust that those States will refrain from following a course whose implications would be very grave in the area of international law and in the development of friendly co-operation among countries  as well as in relation to policies applicable to other areas of ocean space.33.	The results of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament are discouraging. Not only was there no progress with respect to what had been agreed at the first special session on disarmament  but the consensus of 1978 itself has apparently been challenged.34.	It is indispensable that all countries of the international community  particularly the nuclear Powers  participate in a new effort to move forward in the complex problem of disarmament. For its part  Peru will continue to exert efforts  both internationally and regionally  to effect limitation of arms expenditures and to protect Latin America and other regions of the developing world from the nuclear threat  in the conviction that the goal of disarmament will be reached only by approaches that take due account of the interests of all parties.35.	We are witnessing a day-by-day deterioration of the opportunities for diplomatic negotiation and political agreement. In view of this  the movement of non-aligned countries clearly has a role to play. Its objectives and its reason for existence as an independent factor in international relations have become all the more significant and relevant in view of the grim picture we are facing in all parts of the world.36.	The international economic situation could not be more critical. Inflation and recession continue to be the main features of a crisis that has ceased to be a mere slump in the business cycle. While it is true that the crisis affects everyone  it is also true that we are not all equally affected. Unemployment is the most serious social consequence of the international economic crisis  but the developing countries  unlike the industrialized countries  find it difficult to provide help for the unemployed. Capital goods have continued to rise in price  in inverse proportion to the prices of raw materials. Financing for development projects is becoming increasingly costly and difficult to find. The industrialized countriesósome more than othersóare beginning to introduce tariff and non- tariff barriers which are contrary to the spirit of free trade that they themselves champion. The mounting external debt now constitutes for all countries  industrialized and developing alike  both a burden and a thread not only to their economic progress but to the very stability of the international financial system.37.	Things cannot be allowed to remain as they are much longer. The international economic crisis is the result of grave difficulties of a political and social order fisting the international community. The sense of urgency among peoples of the world today is accompanied by a deep frustration at the lack of understanding and inability Governments have demonstrated in finding common approaches to alleviating the tragic situation facing them.38.	We must prevent despair from setting in  and we must remove tension in order to facilitate the solution of grave problems that directly affect international peace; and security. A supreme effort on the part of all members of the international community is required to find a minimum consensus that will enable them to reactivate the world economy  at the same time taking care to prevent the return of inflation.39.	We therefore consider it to be appropriate to agree on an emergency world economic plan  in which all States and international organizations would participate without discrimination or self-exclusion. To that effect  my Government will put forward at Session of the General Assembly  a proposal for the immediate adoption of such plan  in order to give impetus to the recovery of the world economy.40.	At the same time  we must continue our efforts for the construction of a new international economic order. We must emphasize that the launching of global negotiations is an imperative need for the international community as a whole  in order to rebuild  from the ground up  the imbalanced system of international economic relations.41.	My Government recognizes the position assumed by the developed countries at the Versailles Economic Summit in June  and is prepared to co-operate closely W3th the rest of the countries of the Group of 77  in the definition of a consensus that would permit the earliest possible beginning of global negotiations. In view of the urgency of the present circumstances  my Government expresses the hope that at this session the General Assembly will adopt a resolution stipulating the beginning of global negotiations.42.	Peru is also aware of the importance of the sixth session of UNCTAD  to be held next year in Belgrade. The serious problems faced by the developing countries make it imperative that that Conference achieves specific results  especially in the important areas of primary commodities  trade  currency and finance.43.	Peru also reiterates its support for the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the Common Fund for Commodities  as a central instrument for the organization of international trade in such com-modities.44.	My country  as a member of the Consultative Group of 18  is participating in preparations for the ministerial meeting of GATT to be held later this year. We find it indispensable that that meeting attach priority to the interests of the developing countries in view of the reduced benefits that they have derived from multilateral trade negotiations  bearing in mind that the process of global negotiations must not be disturbed.45.	Peru wishes to reaffirm the great importance of South-South co-operation for the developing countries and unreservedly supports the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the High-Level Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries in May 1981 at Caracas.^ In this context  we support the immediate convening of a meeting to establish a generalized system of preferences among the developing countries as a practical and effective means of promoting our economic links.46.	Next year the Republics of America will celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Liberator  Simon Bolivar  the founder of nations  a man of his time and of our time. We hope that his spirit of freedom and justice will preside over the endeavours of Governments today and we pay a well-deserved tribute to his memory and to his work.47.	This thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place in particularly difficult circumstances. It has been many years since we have seen an economic crisis such as that of today  in which communication among States is so charged with anxiety and discouragement is so prevalent among our peoples.48.	Our country has demonstrated its dedication to peace  defence of the principles of law and international conciliation  which we do not wish to abandon. We believe that the only way in which the urgent problems of mankind can be faced and overcome is through negotiation  and we reaffirm our faith in the United Nations as the highest forum of the peoples. For all these reasons  we declare that Peru will spare no effort to ensure that this session will be qualitatively different from others more effective and more committed to the goals of reconciliation and harmony  peace  freedom  law and justice."
"109",5566,"PHL",37,1982,"My delegation extends its warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. It is my pleasure to have known him for several years as a friend. His wide experience  especially in the affairs of the United Nations  and his richly deserved reputation for skill  patience and the accumulated wisdom of experience constitute a guarantee that this session will be fruitful and constructive. We look to his guidance and leadership in the resolution of the numerous problems that exist at this most critical period for the relations among nations.216.	To his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who served under similarly difficult circumstances and emerged with honour  my delegation also extends its congratulations.217.	We are delighted to welcome the new Secretary- General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. A thorough professional  he is universally regarded as a diplomat's diplomat  and we are happy that he is now at the head of the Organization. He has revealed to us the other side of his natureócourage and candour in admitting the deficiencies of the United Nations  together with constructive suggestions which should enable us to return to the first principles of the Charter. The Secretary-General has seen us as in a mirror and asked us to take a closer look at ourselves with a view to providing remedies for the ailments of the United Nations system. In expressing his views the Secretary- General has reminded us that the strengthening of the United Nations is the first order of business and that the performance of this task  difficult though it may be  is indispensable to the solution of the problems which threaten the peace of the world.218.	In the past we have often tended to substitute hyperbole for thought. Today the situation has changed: hyperbole has turned into fact. The tragic events in Lebanon  serious problems in themselves  reverberate throughout the entire Middle East and raise anew the unwelcome prospects of wider conflict. The Middle East is the vortex of crisis and  if the past is a guide to the future  it will almost certainly involve other Powers in a conflict which may well be larger and more destructive than any in the unending series of Middle East wars.219.	At the core of the problem is the issue of Palestine. The new and highly disturbing element is a widely perceived effort to solve the problem not through political means  but by the use of force. This is clearly unacceptable  not only in terms of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) but also in terms of the principles of the Charter.220.	No one is under any illusion that the Middle East situation can be solved on the instant  but it is quite correct to say that the end of armed conflict offers fresh opportunities for a new start. The intractable problem is ingrained psychological blocks which make dialogue more difficult than it should be. This is why negotiations must be a processóthat is  a continuing dialogue which makes compromises possible. For this reason  my delegation welcomes the initiatives of President Reagan and the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. We believe that these are starting- points which in the course of the negotiating process could be merged  in the legitimate interests of all the parties concerned.121. My delegation identifies with the positive elements of the United States proposal  which iß based on the Camp David accords ratified by the Israeli Knesset  notably the immediate freeze on the establishment of Jewish settlements and opposition to permanent control by Israel over the West Bank and Gaza.222.	My delegation maintains  however  that the full autonomy envisaged for these areas should lead to the implementation of the right of self-determination by the Palestinian people and the establishment of an independent State coexisting with Israel. We hold  furthermore  that at an appropriate stage in the process the PLO should be a party to the negotiations leading to permanent peace in the area.223.	It should be noted that neither the United States nor the Arab States have rejected each other's proposals. This fact leads to the hope  however tenuous  that each recognizes certain common denominators in the proposals and to the further recognition that in the existing circumstances  modality is of the utmost importance.224.	It is Israel that has proved to be intransigent  possibly in the euphoria of military success. But the one thing it must acknowledge is that its military victory over the PLO has  by a curious paradox  improved the political standing of the PLO. Because of the events in Lebanon  Israel may find itself with its back against the wall  with foes but no friends and isolated beyond hope of redemption. We very much doubt that this is what Israel wants. We therefore call upon Israel to heed the voices of reason and moderation. Too much blood has been spilled in the Middle East and too many bitter tears shed for Israel to ignore the growing clamour for peace with justice and honour.225.	Kampuchea  on the other side of the world  the hopeful sign is the formation of the Coalition of Kampuchean Nationalists under the leadership of Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. The formation of the Coalition signifies the determination of the Kampuchean nationalists to expel the foreign forces from Kampuchean soil and enable its people to exercise freely their right to self-determination.226.	In deciding on a coalition the Kampuchean nationalists have assumed the mantle of legality  a cloak denied them before although they fought and continue to fight  with valour  and in circumstances of insuperable difficulties.227.	If they are to succeed in their endeavour  they will require material assistance from friends that have in this very Hall condemned the illegitimate usurpation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam. At this very moment thousands of Kampucheans await the call in the determined effort to recover their birthright. We have every hope that  with the support of friends  the Kampuchean coalition or the democratic Government of Kampuchea will in the end pave the way for the restoration of Kampuchean sovereignty in free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. In the face of this development  Viet Nam has a final option: to wipe out the fledgling and under-supplied anti-Vietnamese forces before their movement gathers strength and momentum. There are reports that this is precisely what it intends to do. It is in this light that the need for support and assistance acquires urgency. We urge our friends to provide it.228.	Another potential source of tension in Asia is the uncertain and precarious relations between North and South Korea. Conflict in that divided country is bound to have a severe impact in the strategic region of North-East Asia. Therefore we would encourage the parties concerned to launch fresh initiatives which could lead towards the goal of reunification. President Chun of South Korea has taken the initiative in this regard and he deserves our support.229.	I shall refrain from dealing with subjects already touched upon by President Marcos when he addressed the Assembly the other day. I might only add that  with respect to the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  we might remind ourselves once more that these negotiations were conceived in the light of our shared concern over the steady deterioration of our economies. The need to establish a firm basis for global economic progress that is equitable to all acquires added importance in view of the inadequate response of some of our institutions to the problems of contemporary economic relations. In joint efforts and in an admirable spirit of compromise encouraged by the high-level meetings in Cancun  Ottawa  Versailles and New Delhi  among others  we have managed to reach agreements on nearly all the outstanding points of difference.230.	I recall that  at the signing of the Bretton Woods Agreement in New Hampshire in 1946  when I signed the Agreement on behalf of the Philippines  I then said:""The economic pattern being drawn here was established by the victorious Allies  but this will not last long. More members of the United Nations will join in the future. Last year we signed a United Nations Charter with 54 nations. I envision more than 100 nations will join. In that case they will decide that they want a new international economic order.""I said that in 1946  when we signed the Bretton Woods Agreement. That is now the North-South dialogue.231.	As we resume discussions at this session  we diverge on only two points. To those who hold differing views on these two points  these are no doubt of great importance  and their reluctance to accept either is therefore understandable. Yet the potential reward of agreement and the possible penalties of failure to reach agreement are of such magnitude that they allow us few  if any  options. Therefore I would urge all parties to look beyond narrower preoccupations for the sake of the larger good. On the part of the Philippines  my delegation is prepared to accept neither one nor the other formulation but both formulations in a common text. We do so in the firm belief that in practice and application the two points are not necessarily irreconcilable. Such an approach  in our view  would close the last remaining gap and thus enable the long-delayed global negotiations to get under way.232.	Turning to another subject of a global character  my delegation wishes to express its gratification at the completion of the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It has involved many years of difficult negotiations but it is certainty one of the more hopeful signs of the rich possibilities open in the way of international cooperation.233.	Although the Convention on the Law of the Sea was not adopted by consensus  as originally planned  this does not detract from the importance of the work of the Conference. The monumental document produced by the Conference will  when it enters into force  become the international law  or the law of mankind  which will govern the rights and duties of nations on the uses of the waters of the earth. We in ASEAN are proud that the President who steered the Conference on the Law of the Sea to that final declaration is Mr. Koh  the representative of Singapore  one of the nations of ASEAN. It is the earnest hope of my delegation  as well as of the 130 nations which voted for the Convention  that in the interests of an orderly regime on the seas of the world those that did not find it possible to vote for it will in the future accede to it and thus make the Convention universal in fact as well as in law.234.	Allow me to return to the subject of the Secretary-General's report. It is a subject of extreme importance and should  if we are aware of our responsibilities  provoke a great deal of thought among us.235.	For years my delegation  having in mind Article 109 of the Charter  which suggests the holding of a general conference for a review of the Charter  has proposed that steps be taken towards amending it. Unfortunately  the assumptions  not to speak of the circumstances  which inspired the founding fathers in framing the Charter of the United Nations changed almost immediately after its ratification. To press the issue of a general conference at this time would raise a political storm which we can ill afford in a time of persisting crises.236.	In recognition of the post-atomic realities  the Assembly did approve the creation of a Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization in a search for ways and means of improving the functioning of the United Nations within the framework of the present Charter. The Special Committee is now ready to present to the Assembly the first concrete document resulting from a labour of nearly seven years. The draft Manila declaration is a worthy attempt to provide specific interpretations of the Charter's provisions on the peaceful settlement of disputes and in this sense it constitutes a watershed in the efforts of the Organization to ensure the well- beingof peoples and the maintenance of international peace and security and in addition promote the progressive development of international law. If I read properly between the lines of the Secretary-General's report  that is precisely what he means.237.	It has been said that there are two United Nations  The first United Nations has on balance achieved remarkable progress in the economic and social fields  notably in assisting the younger nations in their first faltering efforts at development.238.	But the same cannot be said of the second  the other United Nations in its primary role of maintaining international peace and security. This is the theme which the Secretary-General develops in his bold and perceptive annual report. Thank God for aSecretary-General who sees through the difficulties that we face. His suggestions cannot be dismissed lightly for  as head of the Organization  his voice carries special weight and authority.239.	My delegation is prepared to support the Secretary-General's suggestion for a meeting of the Security Council ""at the highest possible level"" to discuss the problems which have impaired the proper functioning of the Organization as envisioned by its founders. I can do no better in closing than to quote the words of the Secretary-General which we should always bear in mind in this Hall:""... I am absolutely convinced that the United Nations is indispensable in a world fraught with tension and peril. Institutions such as this are not built in a day. They require constant constructive work and fidelity to the principles on which they are based.""We take the United Nations seriously when we desperately need it. I would urge that we also seriously consider the practical ways in which it should develop its capacity and be used as an essential institution in a stormy and uncertain world.""240.	As one who has been deeply involved in the United Nations from the very start and bitterly regretted its defeats and savoured its triumphs  I compliment the Secretary-General on his acute analysis of the United Nations. I share with him the view that we should work unremittingly to build a sense of world community on the firm foundation of a political and moral order which alone can lift mankind to the ""broad sunlit uplands"" of peace and security."
"110",5626,"PNG",37,1982,"Mr. President  I join the previous speakers in extending to you  on behalf of my Government  our congratulations on your election as President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. My congratulations also go to your predecessor for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session. This session of the General Assembly is convening at a time when the very foundations of international peace  stability and prosperity are being assailed by global disharmony and serious economic crisis. Hardly a day goes by without our attention being drawn to a new and terrible flashpoint where reason and negotiation yield to rash and precipitous conflicts under arms. Border wars rage  and nations parry and thrust over the negotiating table with all too little concern for the consequences of their inability to compromise. On a different plane  where the stakes are much higher and the destructive capabilities terrifyingly lethal the super Powers have yet again failed to secure any meaningful agreement on nuclear arms limitation. The impunity with which nations flout the Charter  too  gives rise to our fears that true and lasting peace Is an impossible dream. As a small country  far removed from these areas of conflict  Papua New Guinea has no illusions about its position in the scheme of things. However  we feel obligated to draw the Assembly's attention to the perspective we hold of the deterioration of relations between countries. Our concern also extends to the growing disparity between the industrial and non industrial countries. We are therefore compelled to express our concern at the indifference shown by industrial countries in procrastinating in the implementation of successive economic summits dealing with the world economic order.423Papua New Guinea believes that removing the threat of armed conflict and establishing procedures designed to assist the economic improvement of poor nations are the two issues requiring the urgent attention of the General Assembly. These are not new issues in the General Assembly's agenda. They have in fact been debated many times both here and in other international to rums. Regrettably  on each occasion  no satisfactory solution has been reached. My Government believes that the time is now overdue for all of us to make some real progress on these crucial issues. Instituting reforms to correct these anomalies will require a degree of strength and unity of purpose which has so far eluded the Assembly. My Government therefore hopes that at this session the Assembly will distinguish itself by finding common ground where these and other issues of global concern can be resolved. I now wish to address myself to those specific issues that my Government considers appropriate for debate in this forum. My Government continues to consider colonialism an anachronism of our times. We fully share the view that dependent and Non Self Governing Territories must be given the opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to self determination and independence as stipulated in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. Papua New Guinea  like other independent Pacific island countries  is particularly concerned with the remaining dependent Territories of the Pacific region. Since Papua New Guinea became independent seven years ago  we have been obliged to support independence for our Pacific island neighbors. Our resolve in this respect today is undiminished. We shall continue to ensure that the colonial era in the Pacific region comes to an end. We note with satisfaction the recent developments within New Caledonia resulting in greater participation of the Melanesian people in the Council of Government. We commend the French Government on the reforms which are aimed at achieving greater political  economic and social benefits for the indigenous Melanesian population. We trust that this is an integral part of an evolutionary process which will eventually lead New Caledonia to plan its own destiny towards independence. Hence  pleased as we are at the progress made so far  we cannot be fully content until we see the emergence of an independent New Caledonia. These views were echoed at the South Pacific Forum meeting in August. We urged the French Government to work closely with the Kanak people of New Caledonia in formulating a political programme for a peaceful transition to independence. We also hope that other French Territories in the Pacific are given equal opportunities to determine their own future.I also wish to state that Papua New Guinea cannot be indifferent if the Micronesian people of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands are denied their right to decide their own future. We acknowledge the efforts that are being made by the United States Government to place before the people of Micronesia a range of options which will include a plebiscite to enable them to determine their own future. To deny them these options would be contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the spirit of the Trusteeship. Who is better able to decide whether the Micronesian people are ready for self determination than the Micronesians themselves? Over the past few years we have witnessed the resurgence of a particularly deplorable world wide phenomenon. I speak here of the tendency of countries in recent times totally to disregard the principles of sovereignty and independence of other States by pursuing blatant acts of aggression and interference. It is indeed disheartening to note that those same States  which have representatives at the Assembly  freely abuse the principles of the Charter. The use of superior economic and military strength to invade small countries for the purpose of securing spheres of influence is a matter of the utmost concern to my Government.A prime example was Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea in late 1978  and its installation of a puppet regime. The Kampuchean people have suffered intolerably; thousands have been killed and others have fled to neighboring and far away countries to seek sanctuary. Together with other concerned countries  Papua New Guinea supported initiatives to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of Kampuchea. We actively participated in the International Conference on Kampuchea held here last year. 13. Last year Papua New Guinea  along with the Association of South East Asian Nations and many States Members of the United Nations  adopted a declaration which advocated a negotiated settlement of the problem of Kampuchea. Viet Nam's continued rejection of these calls has necessitated the recent formation of a Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We consider this development a positive move and therefore pledge our support  together with the member States of ASEAN  in welcoming the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. The Afghanistan issue is somewhat analogous to the Kampuchea issue. Papua New Guinea has opposed and will continue to oppose the foreign occupation of Afghanistan. We note with regret that the Soviet Union has not responded to Genera! Assembly resolution 36/34  calling for the immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. We believe that the situation in Afghanistan cannot be normalized as long as foreign troops are present in that country.While taking note of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament this year  we are dismayed that there has been no real effort to reduce the manufacturing and stockpiling of trade in both conventional and nuclear weapons. My Government  nevertheless  commends the efforts of the Committee on Disarmament to curb the arms race. While we have not succeeded in effecting a comprehensive reduction in arms  the fact that both bilateral and multilateral disarmament measures exist in the form of treaties and conventions provides some hope for optimism. There is  however  a great danger in the belief that armaments are causes of war. Arms do not decide to go to war; it is human decisions that put them to war. Arms control alone cannot remove the possibility of war  but arms control backed by political will can prevent war and contribute to peace and security. Another alarming aspect of the arms race is the expansion in nuclear weaponry. For a number of years now one of the major tasks of the United Nations has been to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy while attempting to deter its military application. In spite of those efforts  however  nations still find reason to develop nuclear weapons. Like our neighbors in the South Pacific  we are increasingly alarmed at the continued testing of nuclear weapons in the region by outside Powers. At this year's meeting of the South Pacific Forum  the Pacific island leaders again strongly condemned France for its nuclear activities in our region and called for an immediate halt to them. Furthermore  the Forum called on those States with nuclear capability not to store or dump nuclear wastes in the Pacific. We object to the long  term effects of nuclear experimentation  which could adversely affect the lives and the welfare of our people. It is against this background that Papua New Guinea is totally opposed to nuclear testing and to the dumping of nuclear wastes in the region. For many sessions now the Assembly has adopted resolutions condemning South Africa and seeking to eliminate its abhorrent policy of Papua New Guinea finds it difficult to understand why some members of this body continue to condone the actions of a regime which has persistently spumed United Nations resolutions and yet continue to support South Africa indirectly through trade and other relations. I make particular reference here to those countries which saw fit to veto a Security Council draft resolution in April 1981 requesting Members of the United Nations to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa. Their actions in this respect are indicative of the indifference of some Members of this world body who profess to be guardians of the rights and dignity of mankind. It is this kind of hypocrisy that provides reason for the Pretoria Government to continue pursuing its repugnant racist policies. The attitude so far displayed by these countries evokes no optimism concerning the total abolition. My delegation looks forward to the time when all Members of the Organization can sincerely and effectively impose trade and economic sanctions against South Africa. When that time comes  and my Government hopes it will come soon  it will be a triumphant vindication of the human values which have been totally repudiated by the South African Government.It would be remiss of me to bypass Namibia at this juncture. Papua New Guinea has supported and will continue to support United Nations efforts to accord Namibia the right to free itself from its subservient role to South Africa. We shall continue to press for an early and peaceful settlement to this long standing question  as provided for in Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 (1978). We find consolation in the efforts of the contact group of Western States. However  we strongly urge all concerned speedily to facilitate a durable solution for Namibia's independence. The Middle East issue will continue to be of grave concern if the recent and unfortunate events in Lebanon are not properly resolved. These events have surely undermined the efforts of the parties concerned to find a lasting solution to the problems of the sovereign State of Lebanon. We are particularly concerned that Israel's action has led to the massacre and undue suffering of hundreds of innocent Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees in west Beirut. We abhor such action  irrespective of whoever is responsible. Although we acknowledge Israel's right to exist and thus to defend its political and territorial integrity  Papua New Guinea also firmly believes that this longstanding crisis can never be resolved without acknowledging the Palestinians' right to have their own State. Papua New Guinea recognizes that right and will support any initiatives that are aimed at convening a conference on Palestine as a means to finding a lasting settlement to the Middle East situation. After many years of protracted negotiations  my Government was happy to welcome the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in April this year. We  however  remain disappointed that certain countries sought to alter some fundamental provisions of the Convention. I feel obliged to remind those countries that the provisions in question are there for the benefit of mankind. My Government is especially concerned that the United States has decided not to become a party to the Convention when it is opened for signature. Papua New Guinea's concern stems from the fact that key provisions within the Convention relating to sea bed mining may not be effectively implemented  white some industrial countries possessing sea bed mining technology fail to support the Convention. Papua New Guinea trusts and urges other industrial States to support the Convention as the principal treaty governing the exploitation of resources of the world's oceans. The single most important issue facing the world community today is the current global economic recession  especially the adverse impact it has had on the economic and social well being of all nations. Against the background of the current world economic crisis  Papua New Guinea joins other nations in recognizing that co operation at the international level is urgently requested in order to arrest and improve the deteriorating economic situation. We are aware that the world economy has suffered over the past decade from problems arising from inflation  high interest rates  exchange rate instability  deteriorating terms of trade in commodities  rising unemployment  slow growth and protectionism. Because of the general downturn in economic growth  industrial countries have had to apply so called safeguard measures in order to cope with their own domestic pressures. Thus we have seen substantial falls in the industrial countries' demands for non industrial country products  the proliferation of tariff and non tariff barriers and a general drift towards protectionism. In addition there has been  a substantial reduction m the flow of official aid and development finance to developing countries. Trade barriers in various forms have effectively curtailed markets for non industrial country exports Most of the restrictions have been concentrated on manufactured products  although agricultural products have been subjected to similar restrictions as well. As most of the barriers to trade exist outside international rules  efforts to limit their restrictive and trade distorting effects have never been successful. We in the Pacific have suffered because of a serious drop in the demand for those agricultural commodities upon which we are so dependent  such as copra  cocoa  palm oil  fish and timber. Our. small Pacific economies often rely for survival on the income from just one or two of these primary products Marginal changes in the volume and price of agricultural imports from industrial countries result in plummeting prices for non industrial countries like ours. At this point I must pay a tribute to the efforts of the European Economic Community to compensate its associated African  Caribbean and Pacific countries for drops m export earnings. Papua New Guinea has recently benefited from this STABEX scheme  Stabilization System for Export Earnings  and is due to receive additional loan and grant finance. This assistance is certainly appreciated  but let us all not forget that relatively small loans can only be partial compensation for the much larger drops in export earnings we have been forced to bear. STABEX though welcome  is merely a palliative. We must all still strive for a new international economic order in which the small producers are not forced to bear a disproportionate share of the sacrifices all have to make during times of economic recession. Papua New Guinea  like many other countries  is experiencing dramatic falls in foreign exchange earnings. Consequently  like other countries  it has been forced with very serious balance of payments difficulties and problems of debt servicing. Both industrial and non industrial countries have a responsibility to help revitalize and rearrange the current economic order. Economic recovery depends upon a number of factors  such as the elimination of trade barriers and the elimination of other barriers that restrict trade growth. In this"" regard  we urge GATT at the next ministerial meeting and UNCTAD at the sixth session to establish effective proposals for economic recovery. There is one other area of concern to my Government. This is in regard to the way in which quotas are distributed under current international commodity agreements. During the recent meetings of the International Coffee Organization in London  for example  it was quite evident that the major coffee producing nations used their economic power to increase. their quotas  to the detriment of smaller producers like my own country. Papua New Guinea would like to see a fairer  a more equitable distribution of quotas so that justice not only is done but is seen to be done. There are many problems that beset our world today. Although I have only touched on some of them  a!! of them need to be solved  and solve them we must. To do this  however  we need one another's shoulders to carry the burden jointly. But to do this effectively we need the political will to do it  a factor which is required if most of our collective endeavors are to succeed now and in the future. My delegation Relieves that it is pointless discussing what can be done unless we first establish that there is a collective will to do it. Only then can we hope to create a world order in which States can strive to live together in peace  stability and prosperity."
"111",5672,"POL",37,1982,"We are extremely pleased to see a representative of the sister Hungarian People's Republic elected to the high office of President of the current session of the General Assembly. Your election  Sir  testifies to the high standing of socialist Hungary and its peaceful policy in world affairs  it is a personal tribute to you by the international community. We sincerely congratulate you and wish you new successes in your work for the benefit of the Organization.We also address our friendly wishes for all success and determination to the new Secretary- General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.I wish to assure you  Mr. President  and the Secretary-General that Poland is as intent as ever on making a constructive contribution to the proceedings of another session of the General Assembly. The Polish delegation has come to the present session at a critical juncture in Poland's history. Last December our country found itself confronted with an alternative: descent into the abyss of fratricidal bloodshed  which was the goal of the enemies of socialism and forces of anarchy  or temporary recourse to emergency measures to steer Poland out of a profound crisis. The supreme interest of the nation and the State bade us  in compliance with the Consti¬tution of the Polish People's Republic  to proclaim martial law. Its purpose  as we stated in the official notification in pursuance of article 4 of the Interna¬tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was to reverse an excep¬tionally serious public emergency threatening the life of the nation and to create the conditions for the effective protection of Poland's sovereignty and independence.We are deeply convinced that the proclamation of martial law ultimately serves not only the most vital interests of Poland but also peace and security in Europe  for any dangerous development in the situation in my country  located as it is in the very heart of the European continent  could have disas¬trous consequences  especially as various forces hostile to detente have pinned on this hopes of under¬mining the existing relationship of forces.The origins of the causes and determinant factors which have led to the present situation in my country are complex. We have explained them on numerous occasions; they are on record in the authoritative statements of the supreme organs of State. Those abroad who were willing to understand them did understand. Others failed to show sufficient good will and respect for the norms of international relations to leave Polish affairs to Poles. For no one knows or can know better than the Poles themselves what is good and right for Poland.The proclamation of martial law in Poland  ratified in the Act passed by Parliament on 25 January this year  complied with all the requirements of the law. From first to last it was a sovereign Polish  and solely Polish  decision. No constitutional body  including the Parliament and the Government it had duly constituted  ceased to function as a consequence. They all continue to shoulder their great responsi¬bility for the destinies of the nation and the State  in a situation in which the survival and the future of independent Poland  for which many generations have fought  were at stake. At the price of emergency measures introduced on a temporary basis  Poland was spared a civil war. We know ourselves how high a price this is  but it is not as supremely high as would have been the loss  on a mass scale  of a fundamental human right—the right to life. No one is entitled to try to raise this price. More than once in the past Polish blood has been shed  and not always in the interests of the people of Poland. We are learning the lessons of history.In the passing months the Tightness of our indispensable decisions has been confirmed. They halted the process of disintegration of the State and collapse of the economy; they stopped the dangerous drift towards internationalization of the Polish crisis. Despite difficulties  the country's political and eco¬nomic life is proceeding towards normalization  to the accompaniment of a significant relaxation of the rigours of martial law.We do see the possibility of lifting the existing restrictions. We are determined to advance patiently and unswervingly along a path of national dialogue and accord  guided by realism and good will. We shall consistently follow the programme of the ninth Con¬gress of the Polish United Workers' Party—the socialist renewal of political  social and economic life  and the guarantees of socialist democracy. We shall develop it with absolute single-mindedness  with Polish hands and Polish minds and hearts.Unfortunately  some Western Government   in particular the United States Administration  and also imperialist propaganda centres  have decided to take advantage of developments in our country to start a violent and anti-Polish campaign. It is being conducted with a wilful incomprehension of Poland's raison d'etat and is based on a one-sided  tendentious appraisal of the situation as well as on false stereotypes. It has made Poland an object of inadmissible inter¬ference in its internal affairs and a target of economic blackmail. At the same time  all the weapons to be found in the arsenal of a propaganda aggression and instruction in subversion are being deployed against us. Indeed they bespeak attempts at a primitively conceived ideologization of international relations and translation of the relics of McCarthyism into this sphere.The opponents of peace in our country seem to be turning a blind eye to the massive process of positive change that is taking place in all areas of public life. We are carrying out an economic reform  backed by a broad network of new legislation. This includes important laws for the implementation of the reform—on State enterprises and workers' self- management in a State enterprise. The proclamation of martial law has in no way interrupted the work of legislative organs or the introduction of new legal regulations in major spheres of the country's social and economic life.A National Council for Culture and a Parlia¬mentary Economic and Social Council  as well as other organs pursuing important national issues  have been established. The Teachers' Charter  laws on higher education  on special rights of war veterans and on co-operatives were passed in Parliament. Intensive work continues on press legislation and on the law on trade unions.In the light of the foregoing  how would one assess in the United Nations the attacks against Poland  launched and conducted with unusual vicious- ness by certain Governments? We have already officially drawn these actions to the attention of the Governments on whose inspiration or from whose territories they are undertaken. Most of them  and especially radio programmes in the Polish language  consist of propaganda  based on attacking the country's internal order and incitement to change its socio-political system. In recent months they have acquired all the features of a propaganda aggression against  Poland. This cannot but amount to a contravention of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and a violation of the norms formu¬lated so far by the international community in the Held of information and mass communication  including in particular those of the United Nations and UNESCO. This has nothing to do with the right to freedom of information and the concept of its balanced flow. On the contrary  it represents their most evident abuse.It is also hard to resist surprise at the behaviour of certain Governments which seem deliberately to obstruct the functioning of the Polish economy. Do they not realize that they are thereby weakening Poland's Payment capacities? After all  the country's discharge of its financial obligations depends on the rate at which its economic balance can be restored. As far as this is concerned  we shall not be found wanting in resolve. We therefore welcome initiatives for the development of equitable and mutually profitable co¬operation with Poland. An altogether different approach  however  is taken by certain quarters in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. When observing their unfriendly and  indeed  unrealistic attitude towards Poland  when listening to their warnings and ""advice"" addressed to us  one is tempted to ask: have these gentlemen by any chance forgotten to whom they are speaking  have they forgotten that Poland is not part of NATO but it is and shall remain a sovereign and inseparable component of the community of socialist States?If the object of all anti-Polish actions is to force us to back down and abandon the socialist path of development  we can only answer in the words of Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski:""Poland has never yet bowed to a foreign ulti¬matum. Evidently not all abroad understand our history  our sense of pride and dignity. There are contradictions and conflicts in our country.  But it is not foreigners who are going to resolve them"".We gratefully acknowledge the attitude of our friends and partners who hurried forward with assistance at a difficult time for us  who displayed an understanding of our problems and continue to help us overcome them. Especially priceless is the aid of our neighbour and closest ally  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. If friends in need are friends indeed  so today again we are realizing who our true friend is.We reciprocate the understanding and sympathy of the developing countries which perceive in our situation a reflection of some of their own problems. We see in their attitude a fellow feeling of reciprocity for the numerous instances of Poland's resolute commitment to the struggle against colonialism  neo¬colonialism and imperialism.We also appreciate the attitude of those Western States which have not submitted to pressure and continue their normal relations with Poland.We should like to believe that there will soon be a return to dialogue with all our remaining part¬ners on a basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality. In this spirit  we uphold as being still timely the appeal made  in July last year  by the ninth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party to our partners in the West to intensify frank dialogue and exploration of ways of averting cold-war threats and preserving what has so far been achieved by detente. The internal affairs of any country  Poland included  must not be exploited for the purpose of exacerbating international tension and intensifying the arms race.I declare with absolute firmness: it is not Poland which is upsetting international relations. They are being upset by those who wish to take advantage of the internal situation in our country as one of the pretexts to stifle detente and impose a new ""cold war"" on the world  to divert attention from their own doings aimed against other nations and against peace.An ominous spectre is haunting the world—the spectre of nuclear war. Its danger is more evident today than ever before  as it is openly spoken of and is being prepared in the open. The genuine aspirations of the peoples lie on the side of peace. The first and supreme duty of politicians and Governments in the sphere of international relations is to keep awakening and perpetuating these aspirations and to do all they can to banish for ever an apocalyptic vision of the world. Whoever is unfaithful to this duty  whoever ignores his own and his country's responsibility for international peace and security and embarks on generating tension  escalating armaments and preaching intolerance  is betraying the trust of his own people  is striking at its peaceful aspirations and is no longer fit to voice them.We are witnessing disregard for the interests and security of States. This is destroying the labor¬iously assembled record of coexistence and detente and undermining the recognized foundations of inter¬national security  including the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The year that has passed since the thirty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly has regrettably seen the dangerous trends in the world grow stronger and many of them acquire the features of no less than political and military adventurism.Obsession with nuclear superiority and pursuit of an illusory security through remorseless expansion of military arsenals are intensifying the arms spiral  destabilizing military balance and undermining interna¬tional confidence.Peace is awaited in the Middle East. The bloody massacre of the defenceless population in Beirut has appalled the international community. A heinous crime has been committed before the eyes of the whole world. We most resolutely condemn it as well as its instigators  perpetrators and protectors. The genuine aspirations for a just and durable peace  challenged by the aggressive policies of Israel  have been expressed by the Arab World at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. The consistent policy of the socialist States  which has recently been spelled out in the six-point plan by Leonid Brezhnev  is aimed at ensuring lasting peace in that region of the world. Peace in the Middle East cannot be a sum total of separatist endeavours and agreements but a collective and comprehensive settlement that respects the fundamental and just rights of all its parties  and in particular the right of the people of Palestine to establish its own State.A tragic harvest is being reaped by the Iran-Iraq conflict. Events in that sensitive region today cheer the enemies of peace and of third world unity.The pressure of retrograde relics of colonialism  neo colonialism and racism continues undiminished. In particular  the lack of a settlement in Namibia that would accord with the just aspirations of its people fortifies the South African regime in its arrogance and aggressiveness  not only there but also at home  towards its own population  the victims of apartheid Attempts are being made to spread confronta¬tion and tension to all continents. The dangerous quality of the international situation at the beginning of the 1980s is not  however  a result of factors beyond human control. More than two years ago  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty noted in their declara¬tion that the main threat to peace and detente lies in the arms race  encouraged by cold-war quarters and military and industrial complexes  as well as in the attempts to revive a policy based on a position of strength. This appraisal is substantiated by the present policies of ruling circles of NATO which are at variance with the basic requirements of international realities and are founded on an over-estimation of their own capabilities and an under estimation of those of others. Serious threats arise from the increasingly frequent attempts to globalize the NATO theatre of operations.The picture of the contemporary world is not made up only of disturbing trends and actions. The world's progress towards peace is actively affected nowadays by a constructive factor—the community of socialist States. Faithful to the unchanged guide¬lines of their foreign policy  members of our com¬munity continue persistently to oppose the policy of armament and to counteract the threat of nuclear war. They resolutely declare themselves in favour of a peaceful and just settlement of the problems of the world of today  for detente and the strengthening of international security  the elimination of conflicts and trouble spots  as well as the expansion of all-round equitable and mutually beneficial international co¬operation.It would be hard  too  not to perceive the profound interest in expanding constructive co¬operation displayed by the non-aligned  developing and neutral States. Longings to remove the nuclear threat are surfacing with growing force among broad sections of the public  in the activities of social forces and religious movements.Despite their adversaries  detente tendencies have been lastingly embodied in the record of accom¬plishments of the international community. We realize that in today's divided world  detente is variously interpreted. But to consider it solely in terms of short- term gains and losses and to treat it expediently as a political instrument that can be discarded once it has ceased to serve one's momentary advantage reveals a profound lack of understanding of the laws of the contemporary world. For us it is the only effective instrument in the search for solutions to pressing world problems and for abiding guarantees of peace. Indeed  these accord with both the vital desires and interests of the Polish people and the requirements of progress in international relations. Polish foreign policy remains one of steadfast actions on behalf of detente and broad international dialogue. We have borne witness to this from the very beginning of Poland's membership in the United Nations  including our active participation in the work of the Security Council.In a few days 25 years will have passed since from this very rostrum Adam Rapacki presented a Polish plan  known by his name  for the denuclearisation of Central Europe.Unceasing in our efforts  several years later we presented a momentous regional initiative to convene a European security conference. Its great success should be attributed to the perseverance and single- mindedness of the socialist States and the under-standing of its significance by other participants. Consummated by the Final Act of Helsinki  the process of the Conference on Security and Co¬operation in Europe stands out as one of the most optimistic elements of contemporary international politics and an important confirmation of the genuine opportunities that exist for a positive evolution of East-West relations  which exert their decisive impact on the general climate of world affairs.The closeness of Europe's impingement on our destinies in no way obscures our perception of the wider international horizon  with all its determinants and needs. The interdependence of individual regions and the world as a whole has been the guiding factor in a number of Polish initiatives of a global nature  to mention only the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace  adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 33/73. Implementation in good faith by all States of its weighty provisions would help to build firm foundations for peace and co-operation  free from prejudice  arrogance and ill will.The lasting record of Poland's foreign policy comprises the process of the normalization of our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany initiated by the treaty of December 19707 That treaty is of historic significance for the two nations as well as for a constructive development of the European situation and the security of our continent. Practical implementation of its principles has yielded positive results  both for the two parties and for Europe at large. Poland is invariably motivated by the need for that process to be continued and  for its part  is ready to make a further contribution to its favourable advance. We expect also that the Federal Republic of Germany in its policy in relation to Poland will still be guided by its obligations under the treaty and by the supreme interests of European security and peace.Throughout the history of the Organization we have often heard it asked from this rostrum: what must be done to save mankind from the tragedy that would result from negative actions of certain States if not checked in time? We ask the question again  conscious as we are of its acute relevance and urgency. The most pressing task at present is to prevent a further deterioration of the situation which  inter alia  amounts to breaking the deadlock in disarmament negotiations and talks aimed at eliminating conflicts.The Polish Government has therefore par¬ticularly welcomed the commencement of Soviet-American talks on the limitation and reduction of nuclear arms in Europe and on strategic arms limitation and their reduction. They both fit the formula  from which all stand to benefit  of strengthening interna¬tional peace and security  that is  limitation and containment of the arms race as well as disarmament  which the Organization considers to be the most important problem facing the world today. The world awaits rapid and concrete results from these talks.It '<= also in the perspective of results that we evaluate the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We do not con¬ceal the fact that we find them insufficient by far. Nevertheless  the fact that the session was held in so complicated an international situation can be regarded as a positive development. Moreover  it witnessed an event of the calibre of an historic pre¬cedent: one of the nuclear Powers assumed a solemn obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. It would be hard to exaggerate the momentousness of that Soviet decision. If some other Powers see in it alleged undertones of propaganda  we can only encourage them to make similar ""propaganda"" by pledging also that they will not be the first ever to use nuclear weapons.The objectives of the special session were further helped by other important Soviet decisions  including the unilateral moratorium on deployment of medium-range missiles in the European part of the USSR and a unilateral reduction of a considerable number of such missiles. Taken in conjunction with the whole complex of issues put forward by the Soviet Union  at the twelfth special session  : the memorandum entitled ""Averting the growing nuclear threat""* and in the proposal entitled ""Basic provisions of a convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction"" * all these decisions and pro¬posals add up to a new and constructive impetus enhancing an effective disarmament dialogue on a basis of equality  reciprocity and undiminished secu¬rity of any party.133. For the time being  even partial progress in arms limitation and disarmament can exert a positive influence on the growth of the sense of security of States and thus on their readiness to enter into dialogue and deal with critical political problems. Among issues of primary importance that also appear on the agenda of this session are banishing the danger of an outbreak of nuclear war  eliminating chemical weapons  and forestalling an arms race in outer space In the light of the insane doctrines concerning the possibility of limited or local nuclear war  and even of winning a nuclear war  the Organization is facing tasks of a sempiternal order.In the province of closest interest to us  we are in favour of promptly restoring the business-like nature of the proceedings of the Madrid session of the Con¬ference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  including the adoption of a decision to convene a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. That would also facilitate progress in the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe.Other political issues await settlement  and they can be well served by the constructive proposals of the Sixth Conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam relating to the situation in their region and especially to non-interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and recognition of its rightful place in the UnitedNations.	Still of great significance arethe initiatives of the Government of Afghanistan concerning the situation in South West Asia and also the proposals of the Korean People's Democratic Republic for the settlement of the Korean question. They all have our full support.Viewing international security in purely military terms no longer meets the requirements of the times. The Government of Poland believes that the present- day catalogue of confidence-building measures will be incomplete until and unless it incorporates effective economic confidence-building measures. Their object should be to counteract the transfer of tensions to the sphere of economic and trade co-operation and so enable it to become a permanent material foundation for the process of detente and a factor easing political strain. Our concept of economic confidence-building measures encompasses the prohibition of unlawful economic restrictions and discrimination as well asthe pursuit by Governments of an active policy to induce economic units to discharge in full obligations incurred under relevant international instruments. We consider the adoption of large-scale and long-term projects in the basic fields of international economic co-operation to be an important element of economic confidence building.We are convinced that the elaboration and subsequent adoption and implementation of a set of economic confidence-building measures would also make an important contribution to the furtherance of the progressive ideas and objectives of the new international economic order  and of sound solutions within the global negotiations.The existence of the United Nations and its accomplishments and experience are proof that a com¬prehensive programme of positive action on an inter¬national scale is feasible even today  when various adverse developments in the world have led to. the weakening of the Organization as a recognized political authority and forum for the easing of conflicts. Con¬vincing reference to that effect has been made by the Secretary-General in his enlightening report on the work of the Organization.The United Nations grew out of the good win of nations and Governments. Whenever that good will is lacking  the threshold of its capacity for effective action is lowered. To act in the interests of strengthening the role of the United Nations and the principles of its Charter is to invest in it the confidence and political good will of Member States. The success of the founding fathers of the United Nations 37 years ago arose Rom the way in which  after the great tragedy of destruction and suffering  the common interest prevailed over that of the individual. The desire to secure one-sided advantages today only too often takes precedence over the common good. We have to overcome this tendency and return to the main underlying ideas of the Organization. Poland is ready to continue to act for the benefit of the supreme common purposes of the United Nations."
"112",5743,"PRT",37,1982,"Sir  may I start by congratulating you on your election as President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At the same time  I would like to convey to you our satisfaction at seeing such an experienced politician occupy this high post. Your merits will most certainly help us to achieve positive results in our endeavors.2.	I would also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  who carried out the duties of the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such competence and authority. His contribution deserves our admiration and gratitude.3.	I wish to address a special salute to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and express my satisfaction at seeing in this eminent position such an influential personality  whose human and diplomatic qualities have already been widely demonstrated.4.	The importance and complexity of the questions included in the agenda clearly show that dialogue among peoples is essential to international relations. However  a fruitful dialogue depends on the existence of a climate of international confidence. Confidence is not compatible with persistent acts of disrespect for the provisions enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  or with violations of sovereignty  that affect the territorial integrity of nations and disregard the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Confidence also excludes the tendency of certain States to impose on other countries  through the threat or use of force  a certain behavior or ideological submission  contrary to the deep-rooted feelings of their peoples.5.	The absence of this climate of confidence was evident during the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  undoubtedly one of the most ambitious efforts of the Organization. Disarmament  understood as a balanced and controlled reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons  does not stand as an autonomous category within the framework of the relations among States. However  the increasing tensions in international relations must neither be an excuse nor a justification for the modest results attained. Both the security and the future of humankind require that immediate action be taken on certain aspects of the arms race  in order to deflect it from its present course.6.	Accordingly  the initiation of negotiations at Geneva  between the United States and the USSR  to control and reduce nuclear weapons of intermediate range as well as strategic nuclear weapons  is ah encouraging step and responds to many concerns. We hope that important and substantial reductions will follow  mainly with respect to the ground systems which  being the most vulnerable  are the most destabilizing.7.	We also follow with great interest the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The new proposals recently presented by the West offer a possibility to break the present impasse. We believe they provide a good basis for progress.8.	The implementation of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act would be a decisive element towards international detente. Such detente must be global and indivisible  based on criteria of reciprocity  and must govern relations among countries with different social and political systems as well as among Governments with identical ideological structures. However  the debates at the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  in which my Government is so deeply engaged  shows that there  too  the effects of the present crisis of confidence are felt  thus impairing the attainment of positive results whenever a solution for basic problems is at stake.9.	Past and present events in Poland fully illustrate this state of affairs. This is the reason why the Portuguese Government has from the outset openly condemned such events  drawing there from the necessary conclusions.10.	The position of Portugal is that the obligation is undertaken in this Held must be executed in good faith. It is necessary to strive for the fulfillment of the objectives we ourselves have proposed  thus contributing to the full realization of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is not a question of drastically changing international reality. That would be unthinkable. Rather  it is a question of trying to ease tensions and increase confidence in relations among nations and peoplesósince these are also mentioned in the Final Act. Such an attitude cannot function in one direction only. It concerns all parties involved and it precludes proclamation of an official doctrine which  depending on the areas concerned and according to one's convenience  interprets coexistence either as co-operation or as intolerant confrontation. Only in this way can detente become a reality  translated into positive acts  and not merely a dialogue of the deaf.11.	The general considerations I have just formulated do not diminishórather  they emphasizeóthe importance of regional tensions susceptible of jeopardizing world stability. I shall mention only a few examples. I would like to refer first to the situation in Namibia  where the exercise of the right to self- determination continues to be delayed giving rise to serious risks of conflict in southern Africa. Portugal considers that the independence of Namibia  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is essential to the stabilization process in the region.12.	The repeated attacks against the territories of Angola and Mozambique  which Portugal has condemned in a timely and vigorous manner  cannot fail to be seen in this context  hence rendering more urgent a stable solution to the problem. Given the very special ties my country has with Angola and Mozambique Portuguese public opinion follows with deep interest the efforts made towards achieving peace  and the subsequent developments in southern Africa. The interrelationship between these two elements is made clear by the economic pressures to which those two countries and Zimbabwe have been subjected. In this context  we think that the goals being pursued by the Southern African Development Co-ordinations Conference may constitute a very positive contribution to a balanced development of the area.13.	I would like to make it clear that we do not wish any specific role for Portugal and that we put our trust in the efforts of the Secretary-General  and in the diplomatic initiatives and responsible role played by the contact group of five Western States and by the front-line States. However  the evolution of events shows that flexibility and rapid action are essential. Whenever necessary Portugal will be ready to cooperate  if requested. This my Government has already earnestly done.	t14.	The search for a solution to the Palestinian problem which would result in a global  lasting and just peace in the Middle East is today an essential element of international security. The most recent aspects of the problem emphasize even more strongly the need to respect the principle of self-determination and to consider the just claims of the Palestinian people  who long to create a new independent State.15.	But in the Middle East crisis it is equally necessary to state clearly the need for respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all nations in the area  in particular Lebanon and Israel  as well as the right of their respective peoples to live in peace within duly recognized and guaranteed international boundaries.16.	The Portuguese Government welcomes the most recent initiatives taken by the international community  namely. President Reagan's peace plan and the plan agreed by consensus at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. Neither of these plans should be considered separately. Both constitute a significant step towards the achievement of peace in the area. The complexity of the Middle East situation is now viewed on a more realistic basis which may lead to the compromise solutions long awaited and much desired by the international community  thus relegating to the realm of the unthinkable such horrifying massacres as those recently inflicted on the defenseless Palestinian refugees.17.	The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan  which so clearly infringes the juridical rules upon which the United Nations is based  has been repeatedly condemned in the Assembly and still gives rise to harsh criticism against the hegemonic purposes which were behind it.18.	The Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea is yet another source of tension. My Government supports the diplomatic efforts either recommended or already accomplished aimed at finding a peaceful solution to these conflicts.19.	From what has been said it is evident that the consequences of the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination are of great importance within the framework of international relations; therefore it is the duty of the United Nations to enforce the respect for that principle so uncompromisingly proclaimed by Member States and to which the great majority of the countries here represented owe allegiance.20.	It is in this context that the problem of East Timor should be seen. In the light of the principles concerning the rights of peoples  which the Organization is bound to defend  the problem of East Timor and the need for the international community to ensure the exercise of the rights of that Territory's population are for my country matters of high priority and undeniable importance. Portugal  which seven years ago ceased to be able to carry out its responsibilities as administering Power  has repeatedly declared that it makes no claim to the Territory of East Timor  to which my country is linked historically and by bonds of human solidarity that exist to this day. These bonds are reflected in the deep sensitivity with which the Portuguese nation as a whole follows this problem  while it hopes for a solution consistent with international ethics and justice.21.	The Portuguese State has often said that its only goal is the fulfillment of a national and moral duty. Aware of the justice of our cause and certain that we are interpreting the unanimous feeling of the Portuguese State and the Portuguese people  I wish to reaffirm clearly our desire to co-operate actively with the United Nations  using all the mechanisms envisaged in the Charter  so that through an open dialogue we may all find a solution that truly respects the interests and cultural identity of the people of East Timor and enables them to define their collective destiny.22.	We are going through particularly difficult times  in which the weight of economic problems has a growing influence and obvious repercussions in the political Held. The present state of the world economy continues to cause serious concern as we face a sombre reality  marked by persistent inflationary pressures  monetary fluctuations  high interest rates  unemployment and social tensions. The outlook for the near future cannot but be disquieting. The gradual deterioration of the economic situation has affected all countries  regardless of their political  economic or social system  but it is the poorest among us that have been most severely harmed.23.	The experience of the last few years has shown that global interdependence is an inescapable fact and as such requires greater solidarity among nations. This immense task is vital and demands the realistic  co-ordinate and untiring efforts of all members of the international community  without exception.24.	My Government believes in the importance and usefulness of a realistic  productive and action-oriented North-South dialogue. We are facing global problems which demand a global approach and global solutions. We trust therefore that it will be possible to reach agreement on the conditions which would make possible the launching of global negotiations in a spirit guided by common interest and respect for existing organizations. North-South relations are usually reduced to a formal and strict distinction between developed and developing countries  but such a dichotomy is far from the present reality.25.	Portugal  south of the North  is at an intermediate stage of economic and technological development: a donor country within the limits of its capacity  it is simultaneously a recipient of assistance essential to the process of national development in which it is engaged.26.	Being an Atlantic country  an active member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  a European country and a candidate for membership of the European Economic Community  Portugal is in a position in which it can understand not only the needs of the developing countries but also the difficulties facing the more advanced economies. Portugal's membership in the European Community  one of the priorities of our foreign policy  will  we are certain  enable 3s to reinforce our capacity to under-stand both sides of the problem and at the same time collaborate actively towards its solution. On the one hand we shall pursue more resolutely Portugal's development process and on the other wider perspectives will be opened for the privileged relations we maintain with many areas of the world other than the Portuguese-speaking African countries and the African continent.27.	My Government is engaged in increasing and diversifying its bilateral aid  but it is equally interested in developing co-operation projects  with the assistance of specialized agencies of the United Nations and with the co-operation of other countries. Aware of our limitations and possibilities  but conscious also that  besides quantitative aspects  there are also the qualitative ones  we shall strive to achieve these goals.28.	If the role played by small and medium enterprises has become increasingly important within our economy  in the international political system  too  the role of small and medium countries must be acknowledged as increasingly relevant.29.	Indeed  the perception and impact of questions such as the energy crisis  problems of investment and technology and protectionist policies are common to this group of countries and constitute  in their particular case  conditioning factors of a qualitative and not merely quantitative nature. This reality draws a distinction between us and the larger countries. We believe that  with a view to creating a realistic and useful basis for dialogue  it is of the utmost interest that we undertake a common consideration of this issue.30.	Like the others  my country is particularly sensitive to the energy problems that affect our balance of payments in a very negative way  reducing our possibilities of carrying out the measures necessary to pursue our development process. A sustained economic growth depends to a great extent on intensification of productive investments  increased productivity and the maintenance of an open trade system.31.	Although one must admit that the seriousness of the world economic situation has not caused a radical increase of protectionism  I should like to stress the concern of the Portuguese Government regarding some protectionist measures which affect exports from developing countries and from countries in an intermediate stage of development  like Portugal. We hope that during the next ministerial meeting of GATT important decisions will be taken contributing  in a decisive way  to fostering free international trade between all countries and groups of countries.32.	I should also like to refer to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  Last April Portugal voted in favor of the Convention. This decision was taken in the light of our own interests as a coastal State. It also took into account the interests of the international community  which may be greatly affected should an adequate regulation of these matters not be established. This does not mean that my country is satisfied with all the provisions contained in the Convention  namely  those regarding the composition of the International Sea-Bed Authority^ In fact the interests of semi-industrialized countries are not taken duly into account  especially in the case of those countries that  like Portugal  has ? face serious emigration problems. These considerations do not  however  impair our intention to sign and ratify the Convention  thus contributing towards avoiding chaos in international maritime relations. Accordingly  Portugal calls upon every country to make an additional effort to find a compromise formula which would render the Convention universally acceptable.33.	If  on the one hand  economic matters are intimately linked to political problems  it is also true that from them arise very serious consequences concerning human rights. Thus  when discussing here the best way to achieve the objectives we have pro-posed Cor ourselvesónamely  the creation of a more equitable international orderówe cannot overlook a basic fundamental principle: that the United Nations is  above all  a body at the service of humankind. Beyond the diversity of traditions  cultures and systems  man attains universal value as a subject of rights and fundamental freedoms  through intrinsic dignity. Conse-quently  in addition to those factors  there is yet another concern: we continue to be faced with the persistence of policies that ignore the essence of human rights and lead to serious violations of such rights  as a result of local conflicts or of situations of instability or intolerance.34.	Of such situations  the system of apartheid is a paradigm. This system is condemned by us  as it is our belief that any form of discrimination  besides being unacceptable on an ethical and human plane  is a denial of progress and culture.35.	As I have already stated  there are many areas in the world where the rights to self-determination  free choice of regime  independence and security of States are not respected. When it comes to human rightsómeaning relations between the Government and individualsóthe situations in which human beings are denied their basic rights are regrettably multiplying. I am referring to political repression  racism  foreign domination and poverty. The international community acknowledges the fact that human rights are inseparable from the rights of peoples and of nations and that both are closely related to peace  security and prosperity in the world. In order that international stability may be attained  States must respect the rights of other nations and those of their own citizens. In this context  the United Nations has a dual responsibility: the definition of principles through the enunciation of a code of conduct and supervision of their effective implementation.36.	The Portuguese Government attributes the greatest importance to the achievement of that aim. Accordingly  Portugal has adhered to the main international instruments concerning human rights  the latest one being the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  to which we acceded on 23 September.37.	The United Nations has created a system and institutions to promote and protect respect for human rights the world over. However  the number of cases that are violations of the moral conscience of nations is regrettably increasing.38.	In this context  we are deeply concerned with the difficult living conditions suffered by the Timorese people as well as with the violations of its cultural identity and its rights  caused by the present situation in the Territory of East Timor. Convergent reports and information reaching us from East Timor leave no doubt about the moral and physical sufferings endured by the people of Timor. The problem of East Timor was only recently discussed at Geneva when the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted resolution 1982/201 on this question  in which it acknowledged the diplomatic efforts made by Portugal to redress the situation in the Territory and called for international co-operation to defend the rights of the Timorese people. In this context as well  of great significance in the sphere of international morals and law  I wish to reiterate the Portuguese will to co-operate in the settlement within the wide framework of humanitarian questions  of several problems brought about by the situation in East Timor. I wish to reaffirm here that the Portuguese position as to principles and human rights is clear and that it constitutes the pursuit of an ethical and political duty which cannot be overlooked if we do not want to put in jeopardy the values that govern us. Likewise  I reiterate Portugal's firm determination to reach a global solution to this problem within the framework of the Organization  through an open and frank dialogue.39.	The history of the United Nations stands as an example of endeavor to give mankind its full dimension  free from the yoke of political domination  urgent material needs and deadly wars. Many are the difficulties that have been encountered when pursuing these aims. Some achievements have even brought about new and complex problems.40.	To admit that reforms must be introduced in certain structures and habits does not mean that we should question the provisions of the Charter. On the contrary  within the limitations imposed by the framework of international relations  those provisions still offer the best means of overcoming institutional impediments  and are at the same time an irreplaceable frame of reference when it comes to settling certain types of conflicts. The Portuguese Government sincerely believes that the Organization can handle confrontations and pave the way to their settlement by means of dialogue  at the same time and provide the necessary impartiality as a forum for negotiation.41.	If the Organization is affected by some shortcomings  that is not its fault. Those shortcomingsóso sharply described in the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization	óare caused by those who find them very convenient. That is why  when there is a common will  the United Nations offers the appropriate institutional means for the search for multilateral solutions. It is for the reaffirmation of such goals that all of us gathered here must strive  without any weakening or preconcep-tions  without any demagoguery or procrastination; the moral force of those who are in the right will always triumph in the end."
"113",5789,"PRY",37,1982,"On behalf of the delegation of Paraguay I should like to congratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to conduct the proceedings of the General Assembly  an honor that has been conferred upon him because of his personal integrity and his well recognized diplomatic experience.We extend to the Secretary General our best wishes for success in the important work before him. We do so not only because of the esteem in which we hold him but also because as South Americans we feel gratified at his election. We are pleased to see that every day he gives clear proof of his skills and his unquestionable dedication to his work  as evidenced by his report on the work of the Organization  a report that concisely sets forth many creative suggestions at a time when  though there has been hesitant progress  efforts are being made to achieve survival in peace and dignity.My delegation fully shares the deep anxiety of the Secretary General  who has urgently appealed to us for common sense and effective action. We note his hopes and offer him Paraguay's cooperation in his noble efforts to implement the Organization's mandate under the Charter to avoid the untold sorrow that results from war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and to establish conditions conducive to the general progress of all our peoples in a universal atmosphere of coexistence based on mutual respect  justice and freedom.Perhaps more than any other year in the life of the Organization  the past year has been characterized by continued violence in different parts of the world. As the Secretary General has pointed out  we are apt to forget with suicidal single mindedness the six years of global agony and destruction that preceded the San Francisco Conference  and it is true that thus far we have not learned to operate sensibly the system of collective security that is the only instrument available to us to preserve our generation and succeeding generations from total disaster. We are haunted by far justified and healthy fear that alerts us and prompts us to understand the dangers that stalk us. With all the defects inherent in human endeavor  the Charter remains the only valid instrument Car the finding of solutions which  though provisional  can defuse the critical situation that confronts us. The different conferences on disarmament that have taken place since the days of the frustrated League of Nations have not thus far offered the Rope of a promising course of action. The so called major Powers and those that try to be major Powers bear the tremendous responsibility of giving the world an example of wisdom and of real and effective respect for life  the most important human right. Statements on the principle of the sovereign equality of States are meaningless if the destiny of mankind is linked to the interests of those who wield atomic power  with all its horrors. Equally meaningless are the intentions of promoting the overall well being of peoples if vast sums are earmarked to annihilate them  in a vicious circle of dissuasion which can last only so long. Moreover  the terrorism which is exercised in the internal sphere and exported equally criminally beyond their own borders by some Governments is an eloquent expression of a state of madness which can be compared only to the threat of an atomic holocaust. In spite of the inexplicable difficulties involved in the consideration of this topic in the Sixth Committee  my delegation would ask that the study of draft international instruments aimed at removing the apocalyptic scourge of terrorism  such as  for example  the draft Code of Offences Against the Peace and Security of Mankind and a draft international convention against the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries be accelerated. Those and other legal instruments with binding force at the international level should  together with The Hague  Montreal and Tokyo Conventions  which my country has already signed  provide a body of provisions which can counteract that type of crime.A/37/PV.23Paraguay has heroic experience of wars. My country has itself suffered not only the incalculable loss of life of its sons and daughters in devastating numbers but also the hardships of foreign military occupation and the mutilation of its territorial heritage. Thus we repudiate and forcefully condemn the Soviet Union's subjugation of the sovereignty of Afghanistan  a country which is steadfastly struggling to defend its independence; we repudiate with equal force Viet Nam's intervention in Kampuchea; and we cannot fail to condemn the brutal genocide carried out against defenseless communities in Lebanon. All these and similar events of transitory notoriety seem to have the incredible purpose of lulling our consciences and anaesthetizing our sensitivities. Faced with this negative picture  which causes pessimism  my country welcomes the certain positive signs of understanding which have emerged in the international political sphere. We express the fervent hope for success in the efforts made by the Republic of Korea to bring about the unification of the peninsula through direct negotiations with the People's Democratic Republic of Korea  and we trust that  under the competent guidance of the Secretary General  the efforts which began in 1979 will continue. Paraguay has for more than a quarter of a century now enjoyed a climate of political  social and economic stability based on a system of sound democracy  administered with constant dedication to the higher interests of the Republic. In spite of the serious general deterioration which has dangerously affected the economic and financial situation of the world  my country maintains the conditions which make it possible for us to benefit from one of the highest growth rates on the continent  a very sound external public indebtedness record  a balanced administrative budget and a very low level of unemployment which is not in any way a social problem. None the less we are fully aware of the need and the obligation of the developing counties to remedy  through common action  the unacceptable shortcomings of an economic structure which affects the prices of our commodities  stimulates disorder in the monetary system and stultifies international trade. We have faith in the creative capacity of our nation. As far as we Paraguayans are concerned President Stroessner stated  at the beginning of his outstanding work of leadership that the people is the source of the spirit that has made Paraguay's Homeric record possible in the history of the nations of the world. The people is the substance that nourishes us  that gives us strength to react the summit without fail and to raise our flag as a lofty  lasting symbol of our national grandeur. My Government  together with those of other nations of the Americas  signed a request for the inclusion in the agenda for debate at the present session of the General Assembly of an item on the question of the Malvinas Islands. In doing so  Paraguay was merely endorsing the attitude it had already adopted at the two special sessions of the Assembly of the Organization of American States in May and June of this year in order to consider the armed conflict which broke out in the South Atlantic. Aware of the extreme seriousness of the military confrontation  which was then approaching our continent  my country joined hi the united action of the nations of the Americas to try to avoid the crisis  even though the situation resulting from the events that had taken place and from the ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching agreement  did not offer much hope of a negotiated solution. Now  in the same spirit of friendship towards the parties to the armed conflict over the Malvinas and with the same sense of responsibility regarding our duties towards the international community  the delegation of Paraguay is sponsoring  together with other nations of the Americas  a draft resolution to be submitted at this session of the General Assembly  with a view to achieving a just and honorable solution to the conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is our fervent hope that the disputes over territorial delimitations between Argentina and Chile  Ecuador and Peru and Guyana and Venezuela will be resolved in a dignified and intelligent way. Throughout the difficult process of institutional consolidation  the nations of the Americas without exception found it difficult to delimit their respective territories. These difficulties stemmed mainly from the confusing administrative legacy received from the Spanish Crown in the political sphere in which the colonial Power exercised its authority. This is the reason for the armed conflicts that have taken place among nations in our continent to resolve their disputes. Paraguay  for example  has throughout its history as a colonial political entity seen the shrinking of a territory which originally included what is now the vast region of the Rio de la Plata in addition to a strip of land 200 leagues in extent on the Pacific Ocean. Hence  in the sixteenth century my homeland was called the Vast Province of the Indies and the ocean adjacent to the present coast of Uruguay and Argentina was in the seventeenth century called the Paraguayan Sea. I mention this merely to recall that the process of delimiting our American republics has in every case been the result of an accumulation of circumstances  fortunate or otherwise  which  in the final analysis  have been accepted as the rule of history  In the light of this  it is difficult for us to imagine that a breakdown in diplomatic negotiations aimed at resolving territorial conflicts between our countries should give way to the theory of Clausewitz and that there should be recourse to armed force. My delegation expresses the very fervent hope that the aforementioned territorial disputes will be resolved in a strong Americanist spirit  which would do honor to the sincere and irreversible desire to build together an effective system guaranteeing the future and the well being of our peoples. Since I have just recalled the process of delimiting the borders of our American countries  it is relevant to point out that Paraguay has been reduced to a landlocked country and in this respect has every right to lay a claim to the legitimate means provided by the international community to countries that are deprived of a coastline. There are agreements between my country and neighboring countries aimed at facilitating river and road transportation for access to the sea. At the present time  the Government of Paraguay is considering  on the basis of an already developed project  the construction of the facilities needed to join its national railway to that of Brazil  making available to us another important channel of access to the ocean.Precisely because it is a land locked country  Paraguay has expressed its great interest in overcoming the limitations that stem from that condition. Thus  my country participated actively in the various conferences on the law of the sea held since 1958 and in the drafting of the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea  which will be open to signature countries in Jamaica next December. I should like to affirm my country's interest in obtaining through that Convention all the facilities for land locked countries provided for therein. In addition  situated as it is by geography in the Plata basin  my country is conducting a policy of genuine regional integration in order to exploit Ally the natural resources that we share with Argentina  Bolivia  Brazil and Uruguay. I am pleased to announce to the Assembly that  because of this  on 5 November 1982  at the border of our countries  the President of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner and the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil  General Joao Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo  will meet for the formal development of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant  the largest hydroelectric complex in the world  which will have an installed capacity of 12 600 megawatts and will produce approximately 75 billion kilowatt hours a year. I wished to conclude my statement with an affirmation of what peoples can do when they are inspired by genuine cooperation and understanding. President Stroessner has said: Peace is the basis of all that makes it possible for us to progress with a calm vision of the future; this is reason enough to defend it from those who make of war an instrument of domination and of democracy a pretext for extinguishing freedom. For the sister nations of America and all the nations of our world we hope for days of constructive peace. We hope that the pain that has affected the fraternal countries of our continent will come to an end. We hope that the Americas will be a powerful and respected force in the international sphere  with a sense of life that does honor to the ideal of independence and freedom  a flame kindled by Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia and Francisco Solano Lopez  Bolivar  Marti  Juarez  Jose Bonifacio  San Martin and so many other eminent individuals who gave our nations a lasting example of human dignity."
"114",5854,"QAT",37,1982,"      1. On behalf of the State of Qatar  it gives me great pleasure  Sir  to express to you warm felicitations on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who presided over the past session and conducted its proceedings with exemplary competence and objectivity. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to the Secretary General. I wish him  on behalf of my country  full success in all his efforts and activities aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Organization in the service of the international community. I also wish to thank his predecessor  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the praiseworthy and sincere efforts that he made throughout his term of office as Secretary General.2. The deteriorating political conditions which have recently dominated the entire world are a grave indicator of the incompetence of the Organization in contributing to international peace. It is not true that the Organization  despite all its great and meritorious endeavors  has not been able to resolve the problems before it and has not brought about the peace for which our world longs?3. I do not believe that we are the only ones that pose this question. In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary General  with commendable candor and objectivity  warns of the emergence of indications of such a sad state of affairs. Undoubtedly  the Secretary General reveals the heart of the matter and puts his finger on the root malaise when he states that  as a result of the breach of the provisions and principles of the Charter by certain States  the Security Council clearly all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts. This feeling of incompetence is intensified by the fact that Security Council resolutions  which include resolutions adopted unanimously  are increasingly defied and ignored by those who feel themselves strong enough to do so. That strength may be their own or may be derived from the absolute support given them by a super Power.4. This phenomenon did not emanate from a vacuum. It is surely the corollary of certain policies that have recently emerged on the international scene to resolve conflicts and problems on the basis of unilateral initiatives outside the effective framework of the UnitedNations  which is the only international organ qualified to solve such conflicts by peaceful means. As such practices and unilateral initiatives have increased  it is natural that the effectiveness of the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security not to mention the very credibility of the Organization  has diminished.5. The question of Palestine is a genuine embodiment of the aforementioned fact. Hundreds of resolutions have been adopted on this question  but Israel  with its customary tyranny and intransigence  has persistently rejected all those resolutions. It has gone so far as to violate them daily  cutting the whole world to the quick by trampling on its most noble human sentiments  propped up by States that shower it with financial and military aid. This aid is coupled with the individualistic political stand that opposes all the peace loving voices concerned with the general good of man and which seek to impose sanctions on the aggressor in such a way as to preserve the human rights and dignity of the victim.6. Israel is an anomalous phenomenon in the international community. It came into being through oppression and aggression. It murdered and rendered homeless thousands of Arab Palestinians for its selfish ends. This is its persistent policy and immutable creed: murder  murder and more murder. The most recent manifestation of its barbarism and racism was its genocidal onslaught on the camps of Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon  which claimed thousands of victims women and children who had lived in peace in those camps  suffering from alienation and dispossession. They have been driven there by Israelitself since 1947.7. As if the displacement it caused them were not enough and as if their agonizing plight  living in inhuman conditions in shanty towns  did not satiate it  Israel did not renounce the principle which brought it into being that genocidal principle to which it had previously had recourse in the Palestinian villages of Deir Yassin and Kafr Qasim  as well as in other massacres of the Palestinian people. Israel is well aware that wherever the Palestinian people exists  its right to its homeland and the right to return will remain unshaken.A/37/PY.228. The fact that Israel ravaged west Beirut and forced its way into civilian quarters after the forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization had withdrawn  under a guarantee from the United States Government that Israel would not intervene or harm the civilian population there  is irrefutable and is proof of the wanton Israeli practices that flout all covenants  values and instruments. In this connation  we affirm to the entire world that fraternal Lebanon  its territorial integrity and the security of its people should not be the subject of interpretation and discussions. This issue requires all of us  as an international community  to take the necessary effective measures to compel Israel to comply with Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) concerning immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Lebanese territory.9. My delegation holds the international community represented in the Organization responsible for allowing Israel to remain a Member of the Organization. My delegation calls for the suspension of its membership and the adoption of stringent measures against it to compel it to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Organization  the principal demands of which are total and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and that the Palestinian people be enabled to return to its homeland and establish its independent national entity.10. The core of what is termed the Middle East question is the Palestinian question. Unless the international community finds a just solution for it the situation there will remain unstable and there will be a state of constant turmoil and the threat of a conflagration at any moment. A collective Arab resolution was put forward on the basis of the comprehensive principles approved at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez in 1982. The Arabs considered this an acceptable basis upon which to resolve the Palestinian question peacefully and permanently  proceeding from the basic principles contained in United Nations resolutions. These principles provide a good opportunity to reach a peaceful solution to the question.11. However  there are other issues that produce permanent hotbeds of tension  including the security of the Arab Gulf and the war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The State of Qatar firmly believes that ensuring the security of the Gulf area is the task of the States of the area. This will be possible only when the big Powers refrain from interfering in their affairs.12. The Iraqi Iranian war constitutes a disturbing situation for and causes apprehension to all the States of the area and the whole world  because of its brutality  the time it has lasted and the act that it is raging in a strategic and important location for all States of the world. My country supports and sees a good omen in the Iraqi initiative under which Iraqi troops were withdrawn to the international borders  and Iraq indicated continued willingness to negotiate on a cessation of hostilities. We sincerely hope that the Government of Iran will respond to this good initiative to avert Moslem bloodshed and to allow these two brother peoples to apply themselves to the task of reconstruction and rehabilitation in order to repair the havoc wreaked in that fierce war.13. The establishment of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and that of the League of Arab States  reflected the will of six Gulf States. They envisaged it as a prime necessity to achieve political  economic and security complementarity and coordination. It is a testimony to the desire of those six States to achieve peace and prosperity for their region. We pledge that the member States of this Council will exert all possible efforts through it to maintain the security and peace of that strategic region of the world.14. My country views with concern the present situation in Afghanistan because it is an Islamic country with which we are linked by bonds of brotherhood and religion and because it is one of the hotbeds of tension in our area.15. We earnestly hope that the Soviet Union will heed the calls of the international community and withdraw all its forces from Afghan territory so that the Afghan refugees may return to their homeland and the Afghan people may choose their own political system and forge their destiny in freedom.16. We have pinned high hopes on the holding of an international conference to consider the issue of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  since this is one of our repeated demands. We hope that this will take place as soon as possible so as to contribute to world peace and stability.17. The situation on the African continent is also one of our concerns. We sincerely hope that appropriate solutions will be reached concerning the areas of tension there. We affirm our support for and solidarity with the people of Namibia in its just struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and the national majority in South Africa in the struggle being waged against the policies of	and racial discrimination pursued by the white minority Government. We call on all peace loving States to exercise all forms of pressure on the Government of South Africa to compel it to respond to international good offices aimed at achieving a comprehensive and just settlement of the situation there and nullifying South Africa's designs and stratagems to prevent agreement on a peaceful settlement.18. The whole world was bitterly disappointed when the second special session devoted to disarmament resulted in failure. That was clear evidence of the desire of certain parties to continue to develop means of destruction and place the entire world under constant fear and anxiety as a result. This effort should have been directed towards the achievement of tranquility and a peaceful life for all. The astronomical sums involved should be spent on developing and improving man's life everywhere on this planet.19. It has become clear to the international community that the establishment of a new international economic order is indispensable if we are to prevent the crises and problems that may occur in the future if international economic relations remain unchanged.20. The economy of each State in our world today is  in varying degrees  in constant interaction with the economies of other States. We are fully convinced that the sooner we determine the effects of this the greater will be our chance of averting exacerbation of the negative implications. We can then draw up national policies taking into account their implications for the international economy.21. Our target is stability for the international economy which is the cornerstone of the achievement of international economic progress. We maintain that the efforts being made to this end at present by various international organizations and agencies should be supported.22. If economic stability is jeopardized that creates a threat to international peace and security. Developing countries cannot overcome poverty and food problems  as well as their other economic problems  without concrete aid from the international community. This should be directed essentially to effecting structural changes in the economies of these countries to enable them to advance the wheel of development in such a way as to realize their ambition to achieve a proper degree of economic growth.23. The State of Qatar wishes to stress in this international forum its conviction that the task of grappling with and resolving the economic problems of the developing countries rests  in the first place  with the Governments and individuals of those countries. However  as we are all well aware  because of their nature the solution of these problems requires  in addition to the efforts of the developing countries  the consistent and collective efforts of the international community with regard to debts  the flow of financial and technical aid and the laying of the foundations of modem technology.24. We look forward to a sincere and constructive international dialogue in which all nations of the world participate to consider solutions for current international economic problems: world recession  currency fluctuations  deterioration of the terms of trade  increased indebtedness in the developing countries and chronic disequilibrium in the balance of payments of the least developed countries.25. As a Member of the United Nations  the State of Qatar pledges that it will cooperate fully with the rest of the Member States  sparing no effort to preserve the principles of the Organization  which are aimed at achieving dignity  security and stability for all mankind."
"115",5900,"ROU",37,1982,"  Sir  it gives me particular pleasure to extend to you the heartfelt congratulations and best wishes for success on your election to the lofty post of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.44.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express the Romanian Government's appreciation for the activities engaged in by the Secretary-General and to assure him of our Ml support in the discharge of the mandate of great responsibility entrusted to him.45.	The General Assembly at this session is called upon to take up particularly serious problems and questions of vital importance for the cause of peace and international co-operation and the independence and progress of all peoples.	 46.	International life is charged with extreme tension. Conflicts are raging in various parts of the world. We see an intensification of the imperialist policy of domination  of spheres of influence and of violation of the sacred right of nations to freedom and sovereignty. The arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race  is being pursued at an unprecedented rate and there is an increased risk of seeing a nuclear war break out  thereby imperilling the very existence of human civilization. The world economic crisis has been exacerbated and the gap between the developed and developing countries is widening. That gap between rich and poor countries is ever more acute and wider in scope  thus increasingly becoming the fundamental contradiction of our times.47.	On the other hand  there is in international life the growing will of peoples to put an end to the imperialist policies of force and diktat  to put an end to the arms race and to proceed to disarmament  primarily  nuclear disarmament. Never before have the aspirations of millions throughout the world to lead a life of dignity  freedom and independence and to co-operate in peace and goodwill been so obvious and achieved such scope. Never before have the protests of world public opinion been so vigorously raised against the arms race  against acts of aggression and interference  against inequity and inequality between States and  in particular  against war  which is the most abnormal way of dealing with international disputes. This awareness of the peoples  their refusal passively to accept a foreign policy doing great damage to their interests and eagerness with which they demand their right to life  freedom  peace and progress constitute a remarkable positive factor  a source of optimism and hope that a better future will dawn and that there will be a more equitable and reasonable world.48.	The solution  in the interests of peoples  of all problems constituting a heavy burden in international life which have caused serious tension in inter-state relations requires that all Governments and peoples unite their forces and co-operate more closely to halt the dangerous course of events in order to resolve  by political means  situations of war and tension and resume and strengthen the policy of detente  co-operation  independence and peace.49.	The highest duty of conscience for all heads of State and Government  for politicians of all persuasions  is to identify with the vital aspirations of their own peoples and of mankind as a whole  to devote their energies to serving them  to become faithful and active interpreters of the peaceful ideals of mankind  to prove themselves dynamic activists for the attainment of those ideals. That is the highest reason that should guide the statesman and politician in their task. It is also their chance to stamp their personalities on the destiny of our age  to go down in the history of these tumultuous times as shining examples of humanism and progress.In the spirit of those major requirements of the contemporary world  Romania and President Nicolae Ceaugescu himself are persevering to improve the international climate  to resolve by political means  in the interests of all peoples  the enormous problems confronting mankind  seeking to establish relations between States on the basis of new  democratic  equitable principles. The frequent meetings and talks by the head of our State with the leaders of other countries and politicans of all persuasions  and Romania's whole foreign policy  are constantly aimed at achieving better co-operation and understanding among States  at combining the efforts of all nations to eliminate force completely from relations among States  and at defending the freedom and independence of peoples and the fundamental right of and nations to live in peace in a world of co-operation and understanding  free from weapons and wars.33. The course of events has clearly shown that the outdated policy of the use of force and the threat of force  of domination and diktat  of ""might is right'  is the cause of phenomena which have led to and now maintain the present state of tension in the world  as manifested in various aspects of international affairs. Resort to force is the origin of hotbeds of tension and conflict  of all actions which disregard the legitimate rights of other peoples and the independence and sovereignty of States. It is one of the main reasons for confrontation and armed conflict and for the intensification of the arms race  and one of the main obstacles in the way of economic and social progress and the establishment of a new international economic order.54.	Resolving the major problems of mankind  ending existing conflicts and preventing new ones  therefore demands firm action to eliminate from international life the use of force or the threat of force  and the establishment of a new system of inter-State relations. Any strategy for tackling the problems of today  for striving to establish peace and bring about a new international political and economic order  must be based on the requirement that the use or threat of force must be completely renounced.55.	The complete rejection of the policy of force for the solution of international problems is deeply rooted in the traditions of the Romanian people. The great Romanian diplomat Nicolae Titulescu  Foreign Minister of Romania between the two world wars  whose centenary is being celebrated in many countries this year  said: ""War is never  absolutely never  the solution to a conflict."" That conviction led him to urge that the ""force of law"" replace the ""law of force"".56.	Today more than ever the use of force is a double- edged weapon. Apart from the human losses and material damage that it causes  as well as the opprobrium of world opinion and the vigour with which peoples unite in solidarity with the victims of acts of aggression  the very results of the acts of force turn against those who have perpetrated them. It is true that no people will any longer allow itself to be oppressed and that the brutal external policies of a State and the violation of the norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations in the end redound against the nation concerned. Therefore  the saying that a people that oppress other peoples can never be free is still valid  always and in all circumstances.57.	Today  in a period of profound revolutionary transformation  of broad changes and the reshaping of relationships on a world scale  of the establishment of a new balance between States and groups of States  the new system of international relations must be based on the principles of equality  of respect for national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of other peoples  and the settlement of all international problems and disputes by exclusively peaceful means. We firmly believe that there are no problems  however complicated  which cannot be resolved by peaceful means  by negotiation  if the starting-point is respect for the right of each people to develop in full freedom and independence and in accordance with the general interests of world peace and security. The Romanian Government also advocates  and acts resolutely in favour of  the settlement of all disputes and states of tension and conflict between States solely by political means  through negotiation; the total elimination of the policy of force and interference  and efforts by the States concerned to stifle a conflict as soon as it emerges in order to avoid new military confrontations likely to increase the dangers to world peace and security. As President Ceausescu recently emphasized  no matter how difficult and hard the negotiations  those are the means  and no others  that must be used to solve problems  completely renouncing military solutions and acts of force  which always bring about loss of human life and material damage  causing heavy losses and great suffering to peoples.58.	The talent and genius of statesmen in this field should be proved at the negotiating table  in the subtle and rational analysis of ways to eliminate conflict and promote understanding among nations  in seeking mutually acceptable solutions; there should be compromise between the parties  elimination of factors that provoke confrontation  and the safeguarding of understanding  friendship and co-operation between peoples. That was  is and always will be the great vocation of the real politicians who are destined to go down in history. Negotiations are preferable to even the smallest military conflict  and we must therefore everywhere and in all circumstances follow the normal path of starting negotiations with a view to preventing military actions  not begin peace talks after force has already been used  after blood has already been shed and after serious human and material losses have already been caused.59.	At this period so crucial for the fate of mankind  and for peace  the United Nations should carry out the task entrusted to it by the Charter and make good use of the possibilities open to it in terms of its purposes and principles and its universal character. It should support with its full authority the independence and sovereignty of States and the right of each people to decide its own destiny  as a central pillar for building new international relationships in which the non-use of force or threat of force should become an effective rule in international life.60.	In the light of these considerations  we believe that we must act without further delay  and as resolutely as possible  to resolve all conflicts between States by political means  through negotiations  in order to prevent new disputes and military confrontations.The grave situation in the Middle East  in particular that resulting from the aggressive actions of Israel against Lebanon and the Palestinian population in that country  is a cause of the utmost concern. The Romanian Government has strongly condemned the military invasion of Lebanon by Israel  and in particular the atrocities committed against the civilian population in the refugee camps of west Beirut  following the occupation of that part of the city by Israeli troops. We are strongly in favour of the prompt withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon  of the guaranteeing of that country's independence and national sovereignty  and its unity and territorial integrity  and of a broad-based reconciliation of all political forces in Lebanon  in order to permit the reconstruction of the country and to bring about peace and tranquillity.61.	It is now imperative that we step up political and diplomatic efforts to bring about a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the situation. in that area  on the basis of the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war; the solution of the problem of the Palestinian people through the recognition of its right to self- determination  including the establishment of its own independent State; and the guaranteeing of the integrity  independence and sovereignty of all the States of the area. In view of its conviction that the settlement of the Palestinian problem is the key to peace in the Middle East  Romania considers that a Palestinian State must be created alongside the independent Israeli State  and that everything must be done to ensure the peaceful coexistence of those two States and of all the countries of the region  each of them enjoying appropriate guarantees of its security and independence.62.	Romania and its President believe that it would be necessary and useful to convene an international conference under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all interested States and parties  including the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as well as other States which could make a positive contribution to the establishment of peace in that region  including a contribution to the solution of the Palestinian problem.63.	A series of proposals has recently been made for the resolution of the conflicts in the Middle East. These contain new elements and positive approaches and set forth a basis for the intensification of political and diplomatic activity in order to achieve a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the situation in that region.64.	Romania  which maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with both Iran and Iraq  considers that it is necessary to put and end to the fighting between those two neighbouring countries  which has already caused great losses of human life and of property for both parties  and that their troops must be withdrawn to the international boundaries which existed before the outbreak of the war. It is necessary to move on to a political solution of the problems between the two countries.65.	I take this opportunity also to reaffirm Romania's solidarity with and active support for the position and initiatives taken by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at the peaceful and independent unification of Korea.66.	While working for the elimination of existing conflicts  it is necessary to act resolutely and to adopt measures to forestall the appearance of new conflicts States must renounce all acts of force and settle all their disputes by peaceful means; the United Nations must make a greater contribution in this field. In this connection we have followed with interest  and we support  the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  which is an objective of vital interest for all States.67.	At this session the General Assembly is to take a decision on a draft declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes  which has been negotiated over the last three years. We believe that the adoption of that text by consensus would constitute an important concrete step towards strengthening the ability of the United Nations to make an effective contribution to the prevention of conflicts and to the peaceful settlement of disputes among nations.68.	Romania considers that  in order to prevent the appearance of new military confrontations and to find viable solutions to existing conflicts  it is necessary to create in the United Nations framework a special body for good offices  mediation and conciliation  which would act closely with the Security Council to organize talks and to resolve differences among States  exclusively by peaceful means.69.	Romania's initiative regarding the strengthening of good-neighbourliness between States is aimed at the same goal of consolidating international peace and security by stimulating the development of relations of co-operation and understanding between neighbouring States. We hope that the consideration at this session of the Secretary-General's report on ways of strengthening good-neighbourliness will constitute a step forward towards the attainment of this important goal.71. Three months ago it was my honour  on instructions from President Ceausescu and on the basis of the mandate handed down by the Grand National Assembly  to stand at this rostrum  at the 22nd meeting of the twelfth special session  and set forth Romania's position and proposals regarding disarmament problems.72.	That second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament highlighted the demand of the world's peoples to put an end to the arms race and to proceed to specific disarmament measures. Halting the arms race and moving towards disarmamentóin the first place  nuclear disarmamentóare the central problem facing mankind. The very existence of life on our planet  and of a civilization which has been built up over thousands of years  is threatened. Never before has the burden of the arms race weighed so heavily on the shoulders of all peoples  on the economies of all States  including the most powerful and highly developed; never before has the impact of the incredible military expenditures on economic development been so sorely felt.73.	Weaponry is a tragic and absurd waste of the resources of our plane and of the work of mankind  a terrible factor in the impoverishment of peoples  and an obstacle on the path of civilization  at the very time when two thirds of mankind can barely subsist. Nuclear catastrophe has become a world-wide obsession  a source of terror for all  and has left its gloomy imprint on future generations. It is high time for all men of conscience throughout the world to unite to put an end to this anomaly  this absurdity.Although at that special session the representatives of States came of strongly against the danger looming over mankind  the Assembly was unable to adopt decisions leading to concrete measures for disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  on the basis of a comprehensive programme. We consider that especially important proposals were put forward during the special session and that those proposals should be taken into consideration to identify common elements which could form the basis for the elaboration of the comprehensive programme of disarmament and which should be taken up by the working bodies on disarmament.73. Romania is expressing the unanimous will of the Romanian people  which has taken and continues to take broad action for disarmament and peace  by continuing to struggle for the achievement of the vital aspiration of mankind to live in a world free from weapons and free from war. At the special session  my Government for its part put forward a set of specific proposals on disarmament  the stronger for being subscribed to by 18 million of its citizens.76.	We believe that the highest priority must be given to nuclear disarmament and  first and foremost  to halting the manufacture of nuclear weapons and to moving forward to the gradual reduction of existing stockpiles to the point of their total elimination  and to banning completely all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That process should begin with the significant reduction of nuclear weapons by the two great Powers  for example a 30 per cent reduction in an initial phase  as a step towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.77.	in order to halt the arms race  Romania has proposed a freeze on military expenditures at 1982 levels  and their subsequent reduction by 40 to 13 per cent by 1983. A portion of the funds thus released would be used to support the efforts of developing countries  the remainder being devoted to the economic and social development of the countries which have made those reductions. Romania intends to act in that direction at the present session  to encourage efforts towards the freeze and reduction of military expenditures and towards the enunciation of principles which could govern the activities of States in this field.78.	Also of particular importance for the maintenance of international peace and security would be the adoption of effective measures for the substantial reduction of conventional weapons and for building confidence among States. Romania is in favour of the establishment of a common agreement on the part of the two blocs and  in general  between the two sides  on as low a ceiling as possible for the principal weapons: aeroplanes  tanks  warships  missiles  heavy guns  and so forth.79.	The implementation of a set of measures for halting the arms race and proceeding to disarmament should be carried out in conditions of reciprocal trust and equal security for all countries  through the achievement of a military balance at levels as low as possible and under suitable international control.80.	To this end  we are in favour of the creation within the context of the United Nations of an international body having the right to inspect and monitor the implementation of agreed disarmament measures. To make real progress towards disarmament it is necessary to do everything to dismantle opposing military blocs.81.	Given the particularly serious situation in Europe  we are resolutely in favour of a halt in the stationing of new medium-range missiles in Europe. We favour the withdrawal and destruction of missiles already installed and the elimination from the continent of all nuclear weapons. In this spirit Romania welcomed the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on medium-range nuclear missiles as well as those on strategic weapons and expressed the hope that those negotiations would yield positive results. Since the problem of medium- range missiles is of direct concern to all European nations  we expressed the opinion that in one way or another all States of the continent must participate in the Geneva negotiations. The bringing about of urgent agreements on these questions is of vital importance for all States  since missing this crucial opportunity would mean the opening up of a new long phase of military competition  with incalculable consequences for Europe as a whole and indeed for all mankind.82.	As a European country Romania is constantly endeavouring to bring about security and co-operation on the continent so that when it resumes its work the Madrid session of the Conference can proceed fruitfully and constructively and agree on the convening of a conference on confidence-building and disarmament in Europe and thus contribute to the full implementation of the provisions of the Final Act of Helsinki and ensure continuity in the proceedings of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.83.	As part and parcel of its policy of peace  security and disarmament in Europe  Romania is striving for the comprehensive development of relations among the States of the Balkans so as to transform that region into a zone of friendship  co-operation  good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence and a nuclear-weapon-free zone.84.	By its very structure and functions  and because it is a forum for all States  the United Nations must play a particularly important role in an authentic disarmament process. In view of the primary responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security its role and its contribution to disarmament must be strengthened by bringing about  under its auspices negotiations and the adoption and monitoring of disarmament measures.The extensive demonstrations for peace and disarmament that have taken place recently  and which continue to take place in a number of countries  including Romania  eloquently prove the strength of peoples and their ability to bring about  by acting in increasing unity  the transition to effective measures of disarmament that would stave off the nuclear danger. We believe that these movements must enjoy full support  including support from the United Nations  because in the present circumstances the role of the peoples of the world as a whole is really decisive in the bringing about of disarmament  in guaranteeing the national peace and independence of all States. In this regard a particular role and responsibility devolve on scientists  who know better than anyone the destructive capacity of modem weapons and the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear war. Through United Nations studies and research on disarmament  and conferences  symposiums and seminars organized with the broad participation of non-governmental organizations and the mass media  and with the help of scientists representing world public opinion  the United Nations can make a signal contribution to ensuring effective support for the struggle for disarmament.85.	Broad dissemination  within the framework of the World Disarmament Campaign  of the latest report of the Secretary-General entitled economic and social consequences of the arms race of military expenditures will help to emphasize the extremely harmful consequences of the increasing stockpiling of weapons for the economic and social life of all peoples and for world peace and security.86.	Still within the framework of the World Disarmament Campaign  Romania recently hosted at Mamaia an important meeting of representatives of public opinion with the participation of representatives of non-governmental organizations from the majority of European countries  the United States and Canada. They had a constructive and fruitful exchange of views on specific ways to halt the arms race and to bring about disarmament. In the same spirit  Romania proposed the convening of a world conference on the role of the mass mediaóradio  television  the pressóin promoting a climate of understanding  confidence and co-operation that could contribute to peace and disarmament.87.	The present division of the world into rich and poor countries  a result of the long policy of imperialist and colonialist domination  and the persistence of unjust and inequitable economic relations among States have engendered grave economic anomalies and tension in international life and have reduced  sometimes to nothing  the results of efforts at the economic and social level made by developing countries  worsening the economic gap between the developed countries and the developing countries. Unfortunately  the conferences and meetings that have taken place in recent years on the new international economic order have yielded virtually no result. Urgent actions are necessary to bring about the adoption  through international negotiations of effective measures to speed up the economic and social progress of the developing countries  to revitalize economic activity at the world level and to bring about new relations among States on justice and equity and mutually advantageous economic trade through ensuring that the developing countries have broad access to modem technology.88.	In this regard Romania believes that it is particularly important to embark on global negotiations without delay within the framework of a United Nations conference to examine and resolve basic problems concerning international economic cooperation. This is especially important and necessary since the world economy is now on a particularly dangerous slope.89.	The arms race and the economic policies followed by certain developed countries  far from opening up prospects for the overcoming of crisis phenomena and instability  which are proliferating  merely aggravate the situation  with extremely negative consequences for the developing countries. The recession in the capitalist developed countries  the high cost of energy  the excessive interest rates  the protectionist policiesand the drop in the price of raw material  coupled with increased prices for manufactured goods  have created obstacles in international economic relations and severely damaged the developing countries  thwarting their efforts to develop their human and material resources.90.	Given the growing interdependence that characterizes the world economy there is a real danger of being plunged into a crisis of devastating proportions. In one way or another  all the peoples of the world are affected by the world economic crisis. All nations are paying for the upheavals which have taken place in the world  and the effects of the continual slide of the economy are unforeseeable. It is in the interest of all States  irrespective of size  social system or degree of development  to act together in joint efforts to eliminate factors that artificially heighten the crisis  to find reasonable solutions to economic conflicts and contradictions  to bring about new and equitable relations among States so that the new international economic order may be established.91.	This present session of the General Assembly must also be availed of to launch comprehensive negotiations  and the sixth session of UNCTAD must be used to translate into reality the programmes of action adopted under the auspices of the United Nations and in general to produce a radical change inthe state of affairs that characterizes the world economy. Proceeding to disarmament is a major imperative in the maintenance of international peace and security  and the establishment on a new basis of economic relations among States is just as vital in the safeguarding of the prospects for progress of all the peoples of the world.92.	In recent years we have witnessed the intensification of the developed countries' practice of recruiting qualified personnel from the developing countries. The exodus of skilled people to the developed countries  which in fact represents an important transfer of human resources  only perpetuates and aggravates the imbalances and difficulties in the economies of the developing countries  with grave economic and social implications. Since it deprives these countries of an important part of their skilled labour forceóan essential factor in economic growth  for the training of which those countries made great efforts  expending important material and financial resourcesósuch an exodus of skilled people acts as a brake on economic and social development and thus contributes to widening further the gap between the developed and the developing countries. That is why Romania considers it necessary that the United Nations assume a greater role in extending international co-operation aimed at stopping this practice  encouraging the return to their countries of origin of qualified personnel settled in developed countries  compensating the developing countries for the expenses they have incurred and assisting the developing countries in training and retaining qualified personnel in accordance with the requirements of their national economies.In present circumstances  we believe that we must expand and intensify efforts staunchly to defend the supreme fundamental right of peoples and nations to life  peace and a free and independent existence. This right should be more forcefully and more Clearly reflectea in the debates and documents of the General Assembly. Priority attention should be given to the solution of problems as important to the human condition as the guarantee of the right to work for all members of society  the effective exercise of the right to education and the assurance of living conditions which permit the full flowering of the human personality.93.	Romania  the Romanian people  affirm their active solidarity with the Namibian people in their struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] to accede to complete national independence  and act consistently to ensure the elimination of the policy of	and racial discrimination in South Africa  condemning acts of aggression committed by that country against neighbouring States. We must most resolutely combat the activities and ideologies which foster hatred and violence  while taking every care to protect the younger generations from their baleful influence.94.	The problems facing youth will be thoroughly examined by the General Assembly in the framework of the preparations for International Youth Year  which will be celebrated id 1985 under the motto ""Participation  Development  Peace"". At its second session  the Advisory Committee for International Youth Year made substantive recommendations concerning the implementation of the Specific Programme of Measures and Activities to be undertaken prior to and during that Year. It is our view that activities undertaken during International Youth Year should be directed at strengthening international co-operation in the solution of the specific problems which are today of concern to the younger generations. We attach great importance to the proposal to draft a declaration on the rights and responsibilities of youth.95.	An important role will also be played by the Organization in 1983 in five regional meetings devoted to youth  including a meeting that the Romanian Government has offered to host in Romania. We believe that all these meetings will provide opportunities thoroughly to consider the specific problems of the younger generations on all continentsand will make a valuable contribution to the preparation for and successful celebration of International Youth Year. The Romanian delegation  aware of the ever greater interest of States in problems relating to youth  expresses its conviction that the General Assembly will approve all the recommendations drawn up by the Advisory Committee for International Youth Year at its second session.96.	If the complex problems confronting mankind today are to be solved it is more than ever necessary to strengthen the role that the United Nations is called upon to play in the maintenance and consolidation of peace and security  the promotion of international law in relations between States and the democratization of international life.97.	In the view of Romania and of President Ceausescu  the United Nations can and must play a more active role in resolving the major problems of the contemporary world in the interest of the peoples. It must act resolutely to establish relations between States on new and democratic bases which guarantee the participation in conditions of equality of allStates  irrespective of their system  size or potential  in solving the problems confronting mankind. It is particularly necessary to ensure conditions that will enable small and medium-sized countries  the developing countries and the non-aligned countries to play an increasingly active role in the debate on and the settlement of all problems arising in relations between States. We must not forget that the balance of power has changed radically  that a diversification of the centres of power has occurred  that the so-called third-world countries represent the great majority of the world's population and that  consequently  they must have an important voice in all world policies  in the consideration of controversial issues and in the search for new solutions which meet the interests not only of a group of States but of the international community as a whole. In this respect  we attach particular importance to the drafting and adoption of a universal code of conduct concerning the fundamental rights and obligations of States.98.	In order to obtain those goals  it is necessary to improve the activity of the United Nations  democratize its organs  structures and functions  increase its effectiveness and adapt it to the present and future requirements and realities of the international community. The United Nations must become a dynamic and effective forum for the political settlement of international problems  conflicts and situations of tension among States and for holding multilateral negotiations.99.	In order to enhance the role and the contribution of the United Nations in resolving international problems  it is imperative that each State strictly respect the decisions of the Organization and that the obligations and commitments undertaken during the negotiating process be fulfilled in good faith.100.	In conclusion  the Romanian delegation wishes to reaffirm from this rostrum its determination to co-operate closely with all other delegations in the search for the best way of achieving all those objectives  so that the present session may by its results discharge the great responsibilities with which the United Nations is entrusted in the fulfilment of the aspirations of all peoples to peace and progress."
"116",5946,"RUS",37,1982,"Mr. Hollai  allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and wish you full success in your most responsible task. We had the opportunity quite recently of complimenting the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  when he visited the Soviet Union and held important talks there. He received a deservedly warm welcome. A session of the General Assembly is a unique opportunity to review the international reality in all its diversity and to sense more profoundly what is of greatest concern to people on different continents. And  one becomes convinced once again that of the multitude of problems in today's world the main problem  the one that stands out  is that of averting the threat of nuclear war. Virtually everyone agrees that world developments have been evolving in an alarming way. People are asking themselves whether the insane arms race can be halted and the slipping towards the abyss prevented. What should be done to counter the policies of those who are playing out various scenarios of nuclear war as if it were some kind of a game of chance rather than a matter that affects the destinies of mankind?Those are legitimate questions. The Soviet Union is firmly convinced that peace  which is of the greatest universal value  can and must be preserved; and it must be a just peace  worthy of those heights which civilization on earth has attained. We draw this conviction from history itself  which contains many a tragic page but also examples of brilliantly devised solutions to the most acute international problems. Let us recall how the Charter  which is a universally recognized code of rules that must govern relations between States  came into being. The establishment of this Organization and the Charter crystallized  as it were  the experience of the struggle against and the great victory over fascism. At that time the hope was held out to the world that it would be possible to avert another global tragedy. For almost 40 years now  that hope has been a reality. Now let us look at the changes in international relations brought about in the 1970s  when the peoples of the world were given an opportunity to breathe the air of detente. Surely the differences in social systems and ideologies or in the world outlook were no less then than they are today. But even taking these differences fully into account  States and the leaders who guided their policies did find ways leading to constructive relations between nations. This constant in the experience of peaceful coexistence has taken root in the minds of peoples and in the fabric of inter-State relations  and it is not easy to discard. The urge to give orders to other countries  to dominate the world  must not be allowed to overshadow the experience of the past or muffle the voice of reason.	The Soviet people reject the gloomy view that mankind has no other path to follow than building up piles of armaments and preparing for war. It would be a mistake to underestimate the rising menace of war. But it is an even greater mistake to fail to see that possibilities do exist for putting up an insurmountable barrier against war. The Soviet Union and the Soviet people are placing all their political and moral potential and all the prestige of their policy on to the scales of peace. This is surely demonstrated by the obligation unilaterally assumed by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  an obligation solemnly stated in the message of Leonid Brezhnev at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament the twelfth special session [12th meeting]. That was an act of historic importance and it was seen as such throughout the world. Is it not time for our Western partners  the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  to assess in earnest the opportunities opened up by the Soviet Union's initiative? We expect them to weigh it carefully once again. In seeking to minimize the importance of the Soviet Union's peace initiatives  many Western leaders speak of the need for trust in relations between States. But how would that purpose best be served? It would be best served by renouncing preparations for war  the policy of the arms race and of whipping up world tensions. Why do they not assume the obligation  as the Soviet Union has done  not to be the first to use nuclear weapons? It is sometimes said that it is not merely a question of nuclear weapons alone  for there are conventional weapons as well. Yes  there are. But there is a convincing reply to that  too: we insist that all States assume an obligation to renounce any use or threat of force in their relations. As far back as 1976 the Soviet Union proposed that a world treaty be concluded on the non-use of force in international relations and it submitted a draft treaty to the General Assembly for its consideration. The draft treaty expressly provides that States would refrain from the use of force involving any types of weapons — and I emphasize  any types of weapons. It would be a good idea to inscribe this on the doors of every agency in Washington that is concerned with United States foreign policy. We note with satisfaction that the initiative concerning the non-use of force was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. Indeed  the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations was even established to draft such a treaty. Why  then has no such treaty been worked out? Because State members of NATO are thwarting it. Can the situation be remedied now? Yes  it can. The Soviet Union is prepared even today to come to the negotiating table in order to formalize strict obligations not to use force in settling disputes and differences which exist between States. No one would venture to deny that quite a few such disputes and differences have accumulated. But there are no problems among them that would not lend themselves to peaceful solutions. There are none in any part of the world or in any area of world politics — if  of course  one is motivated by the objectives of peace. It has to be noted  however  that the United States of America has chosen a different policy for itself. The essence of this policy is the desire to impose its will upon other States and peoples. That desire underlies all plans for the production of weapons and underlies United States foreign policy. The Soviet Union has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that such a policy poses a serious threat to peace. The objective of gaining an edge in armaments has been openly proclaimed in the United States. The idea that it has to be number one militarily has become something of an obsession. Huge sums are being allocated for building up the United States war machine and the pyramid of weapons is getting higher and higher. In the mean time there is continuously at work an assembly line fabricating all kinds of falsehoods about the Soviet Union's armed forces and its foreign policy. People are being deliberately misled. Why is all this being done? Simply because in an atmosphere of lies  hysteria and chauvinistic intoxication it is easier to get astronomical military budgets approved; it is easier to divert the country's resources to war preparations and away from peaceful purposes such as eliminating unemployment and fighting inflation  away from using them for the benefit of people  which is what the Soviet Union is calling for. There is no dearth of versions of nuclear war being planned by the apostles of the arms race: a blitzkrieg  a protracted war  a limited war  an all-out war. Every conceivable and inconceivable definition is being put into circulation. With the cold-blooded composure of grave diggers  they are speculating on the number of casualties each side would sustain in a nuclear catastrophe. They deliberately hush up the fact that if a nuclear war were to break out under present conditions  there would be no winners  and few people today would disagree with that. The Soviet Union has  on a number of occasions  including the sessions of the General Assembly  pointed to the dangerous nature of Washington's course aimed at upsetting the military equilibrium which has evolved between the USSR and the United States of America  and on the whole  between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO. Everywhere  on land and on sea  the United States is seeking to impose or strengthen its military presence and to set up new bases. Look at the bloody orgy that is taking place in the Middle East where a frantic search is under way for new clients to be harnessed to the Pentagon's militaristic strategy. It should  of course  be clear that the Soviet Union does not recognize anyone's fight to military superiority. And it will see to it that that does not happen. One of the principles recognized by the United Nations is non-interference by States in the Internal affairs of other States. It has been reiterated many times in United Nations decisions. However  the world is witnessing today a flagrant flouting of this principle. Who  we might well ask  has given Washington the right to tell sovereign States what they should and what they should not do in their own house? Who has given it the right to try to punish those who cherish their sovereignty and would not yield to pressure  to apply all kinds of sanctions  to impose economic blockades  and even to brandish arms? From what some say  it would appear that United States interests are being endangered almost everywhere in the world. This is an absurd thesis. Yet it is being used to justify crude interference in the affairs of others  used on a sweeping geographic scale  as regards both nearby countries and those situated many thousands of kilometres away from the United States. The Soviet Union has never permitted  nor will it ever allow  anybody to interfere in its internal affairs. This is the stand of the States of the socialist community  as well as of other countries which respect their independence and their legitimate rights. I should like to express the hope that no calls for outside interference in the affairs of other sovereign States will be made from this rostrum either. Otherwise  this high rostrum will cease to be what it is intended to be. And may the United Nations emblem  which is before the eyes of all those present in this Hall  serve as a warning to those who fail to distinguish between what is theirs and what belongs to others. No review of the international scene can overlook the situation taking shape in some regions of the world. In the first place  attention is riveted on the Middle East  for this session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when ashes have not yet settled in the streets of the ruthlessly destroyed ancient city of Beirut and when the blood of tens of thousands of victims of aggression has not yet been completely absorbed by the soil. An honest people all over the world feel outrage and disgust over the orgy of bloodshed staged by the aggressors in the Palestinian camps in west Beirut where defenceless Palestinians  mostly women  children and old people  were massacred. Could Israel commit aggression and perpetrate genocide against the Palestinians but for its so-called ""strategic consensus"" with the United States? As far as one can judge  in Israel they are now rubbing their hands gleefully. But this is what is called a Pyrrhic victory. The aggression was bound to turn  and has in fact turned  into a serious political and moral defeat for Israel. The rift between Israel and its neighbours has widened. New seeds of hatred and animosity have been sown  and they can bear the grapes of wrath. Those who determine Israel's policies seem to give little thought to the future of their country. And that is too bad  indeed. They are clearly hampered by chauvinistic intoxication. The root cause of the Lebanese tragedy lies in Camp David. It should be clear now to every unbiased person that separate anti-Arab deals only put off the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East. The aggressor and its accomplices say that Camp David means peace. Such an assertion makes a mockery of the profound  humane and noble idea of peace. What kind of peace it makes is evident from the fact that more blood has been shed since Camp David than during the Israeli aggression in 1967. Washington's recent statements  which it is serving up as a Middle East settlement plan  confirm that they are still thinking there in terms of diktat and enmity with regard to the Arabs  rather than in terms of peace. The overwhelming majority of States hold it as a political axiom that there can be no durable peace in the Middle East unless the question of an independent Palestinian State is resolved. The Washington plan  however  states explicitly that the United States is against the creation of such a State. It is widely accepted and recorded in United Nations decisions that the problem of fulfilling the national aspirations of the Palestinians cannot be solved without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  whereas the American plan makes no mention at all of the PLO as a party to the settlement. In fact  Washington also fully evades such a fundamental matter as Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories seized by it. All decisions taken by the United Nations proceed from the premise that genuine security in the Middle East can only be such as would be common to all States and peoples in that region. The so-called Washington initiative focuses everything on the security of Israel alone  and its interests are made paramount  with the United States itself  naturally  maintaining its arrogant and unjustified claims to a leading role in Middle East affairs. We regard positively the views on a Middle East settlement expressed at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. On the whole these views are on the same lines as those of the Soviet Union regarding a Middle East settlement. As Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again  a just and durable peace in the Middle East can and must be based on the following principles. First  the principle of the inadmissibility of seizure of foreign lands through aggression must be strictly observed. That means that all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 the Golan Heights  the West Bank of the Jordan river and the Gaza Strip  the Lebanese lands must be returned to the Arabs. The borders between Israel and its Arab neighbours should be declared inviolable. Secondly  the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State on the Palestinian lands which will be freed from the Israeli occupation on the West Bank of the Jordan river and in the Gaza Strip must be ensured in practice. Palestinian refugees must be given the possibility envisaged in United Nations decisions to return to their homes or be given appropriate compensation for the property they left behind. I ask the following in this connection: has anybody annulled the decision adopted by the United Nations in 1947  which envisages the establishment in the former mandated territory of Palestine of two sovereign States an Arab State and a Jewish State? Nobody has annulled it. Then what are the grounds for talking about the legitimate existence of the Jewish State alone  while impeding in every way the establishment of the other  Arab  State for over three and a half decades? There have been no such grounds  nor are there any now. Thirdly  the eastern part of Jerusalem  which was occupied by Israel in 1967  where one of the main Moslem shrines is located  must be returned to the Arabs and become an inseparable part of the Palestinian State. Freedom of access by believers to the holy places of the three religions must be ensured throughout Jerusalem. Fourthly  the right of all States in the region to a safe and independent existence and development must be ensured  naturally on the condition of full reciprocity  for the security of some cannot be ensured by flouting the security of others. Fifthly  the state of war between the Arab States and Israel must be terminated and peace between them must be established. That means that all parties to the conflict  including Israel and the Palestinian State  must assume an obligation reciprocally to respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of each other and to settle the disputes that may arise by peaceful means through negotiations. Sixthly  international guarantees of the settlement must be worked out and adopted. The role of the guarantor could be assumed by  say  the permanent members of the Security Council or by the Security Council as a whole. The path to a durable peace in the Middle East lies through collective efforts by all the parties concerned  including the PLO  and the best way towards this end is to convene an appropriate international conference. For almost two years now bloody hostilities have been going on between Iran and Iraq. This is a senseless war from the point of view of the vital interests of the peoples of the two countries. This conflict is also fraught with grave consequences. The fire should be put out before it spreads farther. The most reasonable thing to do would probably be for Iran and Iraq to put aside arms  to slip covers over the muzzles of their guns and to settle their differences at the negotiating table. The Soviet Union has invariably come out in favour of putting an end to the war between the two States  with which our country has maintained traditional ties  and it is doing all in its power to bring that about. We expect that other major Powers will abandon attempts to take advantage of the conflict. Dangerous scheming is still going on around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The foes of the Afghan people  including those who flaunt their commitment to democracy  are trying to hinder the building of a new and truly democratic life in that country. While in words a political solution to the problems which have arisen around Afghanistan is being advocated  in deeds the achievement of such a solution is being impeded in every possible way. Opportunities for such a solution do exist. They are embodied in the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which the Soviet Union fully supports. Only one thing is required  and that is to stop the armed intervention from outside against Afghanistan and not interfere in the internal affairs of that sovereign non-aligned State. In the Soviet Union we view as a step in the right direction the start of negotiations in Geneva between representatives of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan through a personal representative of the Secretary-General. We fully understand the legitimate concern of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean over the expansion there of the United States military presence. One can literally watch it grow  posing a threat also to the security of the USSR from the south. We cannot but draw our own conclusions from this. The Soviet Union endorses the idea put forward by the non-aligned countries to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. If it were not for the attempts by certain Powers  above all the United States of America  to frustrate implementation of General Assembly resolution 34/80 B on this matter  an international conference which could be of tangible benefit to the whole of that vast region would have been convened long ago. Even now  without waiting for the conference to be convened  we call upon all the States whose ships use the waters of the Indian Ocean to refrain from any steps that could complicate the situation in that region. This means not sending there large naval formations  not conducting military exercises and not expanding of modernizing military bases of those non-coastal States which possess such bases in the Indian Ocean. One example of the way in which States with different social systems can fruitfully co-operate to mutual advantage and in the interests of universal peace can be seen in Soviet-Indian relations. This co-operation is a concrete and impressive contribution to the cause of security on the South Asian subcontinent and in the international arena as a whole. A new and powerful impulse has been given to it by the results of the recent talks in Moscow between Leonid Brezhnev and the Prime Minister of India  Indira Gandhi. In another part of the Asian continent  South-East Asia  the Soviet Union supports the efforts aimed at turning that region into a zone of peace. A series of initiatives put forward jointly by Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea opens up prospects for both deepening the dialogue between them and the member ; of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and in general normalizing the situation in the area. These initiatives have been reaffirmed by such a display of goodwill as the partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. The peoples of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea have chosen their own road of social development. In their march along that road they are repelling those forces which are seeking to prevent them from building a new life. The USSR resolutely sides with those States. It is rendering and will continue to render them necessary assistance and support. The Soviet Union is prepared to seek  together with all the Far Eastern States  ways of enhancing the security of that region. Not so long ago we proposed that the time-tested experience gained in carrying out certain measures to build mutual confidence in Europe be considered from the point of view of its application to the Far East. The Soviet Union is ready to discuss this matter in a practical vein with the participation of the People's Republic of China and Japan. For decades now the situation on the Korean peninsula has not been normalized  which increases tensions in the Far East. The Korean problem can and must be settled by peaceful means without any outside interference  as is proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Socialist countries are taking the initiative in strengthening security on a scale embracing the entire Asian continent. This is the intent of the proposal made by the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the Asian and Pacific States. The Soviet Union supports this useful initiative. When a centre of tension appears in some part of the globe there can be no doubt that it is caused by the actions of those who have no regard for the legitimate interests of others. Not infrequently they are inspired by attempts to retain by force positions inherited from the colonial past. One case in point is the South Atlantic. It is to be hoped that the peoples have drawn appropriate conclusions from the recent events in that region. The Soviet Union has on a number of occasions publicly stated its position that a just settlement of the problem that has arisen there can be achieved through negotiations within the United Nations framework and on the basis of United Nations decisions. That continues to be our position today. Another case in point is southern Africa  where the South African racist regime  with the connivance of Western Powers  is actually waging an undeclared war against Angola and some other States of the region. Pretoria has been blatantly defying United Nations decisions on the granting of independence to Namibia. There is no doubt  however  that the Namibian people will attain freedom and independence. Still another case in point is the region of Central America and the Caribbean  where a campaign of pressure and threats is going on unabated against Cuba and Nicaragua  whose only fault is that they want to live according to their own standards. Attempts are being made to portray them as the trouble-makers in that region. Those are attempts made in bad faith. Together with other peoples and States of the Caribbean  Cuba and Nicaragua are in favour of turning it into a zone of peace  independence and development  and the Soviet Union has full sympathy for this goal. Is there anyone who does not know whose advisers and instructors  both uniformed and other-wise  are now in El Salvador  and who rules the roost there  trying to prop up the corrupt and unpopular regime? The USSR has opposed and will continue to oppose such actions. The sympathy and support of the Soviet people are entirely on the side of all the peoples fighting for their freedom and for national and social progress. If there was any lack of evidence that the peoples and States consider the continuing arms race to be one of the most critical issues of our time  the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has provided such evidence in abundance. Ardent appeals to avert nuclear war and halt the arms race were voiced from its rostrum. The Assembly failed to reach agreement at that session on concrete steps in this field  and it is well known who is responsible for that. Still  the determination of the overwhelming majority of States to ensure peace and achieve disarmament was expressed in no uncertain terms. At that session the Soviet Union submitted a detailed programme of measures to curb the arms race  ranging from nuclear and chemical weapons to limiting conventional weapons and naval activities of States. As has been repeatedly emphasized by Leonid Brezhnev  there is no type of weapon which our country would not be prepared to limit or ban on the basis of reciprocity. And if the accumulation of arms is not only continuing but accelerating  if this tragic competition is proceeding at a pace that leaves behind accords on arms limitation  and if the agreements already reached in this field are called into question  all this is the direct result of the United States policy aimed at building up its military muscle. It makes no secret of this policy line; indeed  it is bragging about it. To take a problem such as the limitation and reduction of strategic arms  that is  the most destructive weapons  the problem which is of utmost importance under present-day conditions  there had been many delays on the part of our partners before the Soviet-American talks started. Undoubtedly  the fact that they are being held is in itself of positive significance. But Chat alone is not enough. What is required is the desire on both sides to seek agreement. Without going into the details of the talks  it should  however  be emphasized that so far the other side has failed to show the desire to come to agreement. Surely one cannot take for such a desire the attempt to single out from the totality of weapons possessed by the USSR and the United States only those types of weapons in this particular case land- based missiles which constitute the backbone of the Soviet Union's strategic potential  and to make them alone the subject of reduction  leaving out all the rest  that is  submarine-launched missiles  strategic bombers and cruise missiles  where the United States preponderance is obvious. Certainly this lopsided approach promises no hope for the success of the negotiations. The principle of the equality and equal security of the sides must remain their unshakable foundation. Accuracy  science  balance of parameters  together with a careful evaluation of all elements of the problem — all these must be taken into account. There must be no room for deception  guile or juggling with facts  either in large or in small doses. It should be recalled that the Soviet Union has put forward an important proposal  namely  to agree to freeze the strategic armaments of the USSR and the United States quantitatively as soon as the talks begin  and at the same time to restrict their modernization to the utmost. We have proposed that for the duration of the talks the sides should take no actions that might upset the stability of the strategic situation. That is our concrete response to the mounting feeling in many countries of the world in favour of a freeze on the existing levels of nuclear arms  to be followed by their drastic reduction  which is advocated by the Soviet Union. Unfortunately  those who are conducting negotiations with us on this problem shudder at the mere words ""a freeze on arms"". What has actually been frozen on their side  and quite deeply at that  is the realization that the talks must be frank  in good faith and free from any lopsidedness. What is the state of affairs at the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe? Sometimes encouraging statements are heard from the United States side in this respect. But this is an assumed optimism. The so-called zero option — or  to be more precise  pseudo-zero option proposed by the United States does not offer a solution to the problem. It provides for the elimination only of Soviet land-based missiles  including those which the Soviet Union has possessed for over 20 years now. As to the medium-range nuclear forces of NATO  they are not to be subject to reduction by a single unit and can even be built up. We have no doubt that Washington realizes that the Soviet side would not agree to a one-sided solution that would run counter to the security interests of the USSR and its allies. Therefore  what is doubtful is whether Washington is really seeking an agreement. The Soviet Union's desire to come to agreement with the United States is buttressed by practical steps. As is well known  it has unilaterally discontinued further deployment of medium-range missiles in the European part of the USSR. And  what is more  ii is carrying out the reduction of a part of that force. Finally  we are not stationing any additional medium- range missiles beyond the Urals  from where Western Europe would be within their reach. The Soviet Union has faithfully kept its word in this matter too. Throughout the post-war period  since the emergence of the first atom bombs  the Soviet Union has been persistently seeking approaches to putting an end to the nuclear arms race. At that time it was much easier to ban the atomic weapon than it is nowadays  when there exists a huge arsenal of nuclear armaments. But even today this problem can be resolved. Mankind has no other reasonable option but to reduce the nuclear threat gradually though consistently  step by step  and ultimately eliminate it. In this context  it is extremely important to erect a barrier against the development of ever new types and systems of nuclear weapons a process which tends to destabilize the strategic situation for it entails the emergence of weapons which  because of their characteristics  would hardly lend themselves to verification. If this is so  the working out of relevant international agreements on their limitation and reduction is becoming more difficult. That is the reason why it is becoming increasingly urgent to stop nuclear-weapons tests and to erect a tangible physical barrier to the development of ever new kinds of nuclear weapons and thus slow down the arms race. The States of the world  with very few exceptions  demand a ban on all nuclear-weapon test explosions in all environments and for all times. Their will was reflected in a series of decisions adopted at the United Nations. Moreover  when signing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  all the parties to it  including the United States  undertook to do away with nuclear-weapon tests for good. In our view  it is the direct responsibility of the United Nations to demand that all countries  and the nuclear Powers in the first place  do their utmost to achieve that goal. As a nuclear Power  the Soviet Union declares that for its part  it is ready to do that. We propose the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an important and urgent item entitled ""Immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests"". What is proposed specifically? It is proposed to speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests and to put the talks on that subject in the Committee on Disarmament on a practical footing. The Soviet Union is submitting to the Assembly for its consideration ""Basic provisions of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests"" [see A/371243]  a document which takes into account the measure of agreement reached during the discussion of that problem in recent years. It also takes into account the views and suggestions advanced by many States  inter alia on questions of verification. In order to create more favourable conditions for the elaboration of the treaty  we propose that all nuclear-weapon States declare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions  including peaceful ones  as of a date to be agreed upon among them. Such a moratorium would be effective pending the inclusion of the treaty. In the context of the problem of the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  I wish to single out two more aspects of importance. First  the Soviet Union is prepared at any time to ratify — on a reciprocal basis — the treaties concluded with the United States on the limitation of underground nuclear-weapon tests and on nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Secondly  we are in favour of the resumption of the trilateral talks between the USSR  the United States and the United Kingdom. Those talks were under way. Then they were broken off  and it is public knowledge who was responsible for that. In the context of the struggle to lessen the nuclear threat  there is still another important problem to which the Soviet Union would like to draw the Assembly's attention. The number of non-military nuclear facilities  above all power installations  is increasing in various countries. This is an inevitable process  which is bound to grow in scope in the future. However  intentional destruction  even with the help of conventional weapons  of atomic power plants  research reactors and other similar installations might cause the release and dissemination of a huge amount of radioactive substances  which would have fatal consequences for the population. In other words  it would be tantamount in its effect to a nuclear explosion. As calculated by experts  the consequences of the destruction of a large atomic power plant are comparable to the radioactive contamination occurring after the explosion of a one-megaton nuclear bomb. Therefore  the need for ensuring a safe development of nuclear energy is closely linked with the task of preventing the unleashing of nuclear war. Being desirous of lessening the nuclear threat in this area  too  the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an urgent item entitled ""Multiplying efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and to ensure a safe development of nuclear energy"". The Soviet Union proposes that the General Assembly declare the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities with conventional weapons equivalent to an attack involving the use of nuclear weapons that is to say  it should equate such destruction with those actions which the United Nations has already qualified as the gravest crime against humanity. The question of a speedy elimination of chemical weapons presents itself in all its magnitude. This weapon is one of the means of mass annihilation. The unrestrained build-up of chemical weapons in the West  far from enhancing anybody's security  is only aggravating the risk of military conflicts with the use of these lethal weapons. The Soviet Union has consistently been advocating the exclusion of chemical weapons from the arsenals of States. The relevant proposals submitted by it have been referred to the Committee on Disarmament. We hope that its members will proceed  with all due sense of responsibility  to the elaboration of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of these barbaric weapons. There is an increasing danger that the arms race will acquire a qualitatively new dimension unless the necessary measures are urgently taken. Washington is now planning a military thrust into outer space. We are convinced that the arms race must not be permitted to spread into the boundless expanses of outer space. The United Nations can and must play its part in this respect. For a number of years now the Soviet Union has been seeking the conclusion of an international treaty prohibiting the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space. The expanses of outer space should be an area only for the peaceful co-operation of States. A separate question and a major one is the reduction of conventional armaments and of the numerical strength of armed forces. The Soviet Union wishes to see this problem  too  firmly integrated into the fabric of international negotiations and agreements. In relation to Central Europe  these problems are under discussion at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. For nine years now  these talks have been  figuratively speaking  marking time  and the time to find agreements that would ameliorate the situation in an area with the highest concentration of the opposing armies is long overdue. The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Treaty allies are doing their utmost to achieve that. It is a favourite allegation in the West that the Warsaw Treaty countries are superior to NATO in terms of conventional armaments in Europe. Yet at the Vienna talks the socialist countries are proposing to establish for both sides equal levels of armed forces stationed in Central Europe. Unfortunately  the conduct of our Western partners in the negotiations is not conducive to reaching such an agreement. Although some rouge  figuratively speaking  has recently been applied to their position  the essence has remained unchanged. So what is left of the so-called concern of the Western countries regarding the alleged superiority of the Warsaw Treaty over NATO? And what is worse  steps are being taken out-side the framework of the talks  which can only be described as provocative. What is there to say  for instance  about the recent agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States concerning the bringing from overseas of additional contingents of American troops under far-fetched pretexts? In other words  instead of reducing forces in that region  conditions are being prepared for increasing them by several more divisions. That is  of course  a mockery of common sense. The same applies to the planned redeployment of United States military units to the immediate vicinity of the borders of the German Democratic Republic. In Europe  as well as on other continents  the Soviet Union is countering the policy of confrontation with the policy of good-neighbourliness and co-operation. We understand and appreciate the desire of the Europeans to follow the path opened up by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. There exists a possibility of further progress towards making Europe a continent of peace and stability. The attainment of this goal would be largely facilitated by the implementation of the idea of convening a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. That is one of the principal issues at the Madrid meeting of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. If all its participants adopt a constructive approach at its resumed session in November  general agreement could be reached both with regard to the convening of the conference and to ensuring the success of the Madrid meeting. Seeking to alleviate tension throughout the world  we have recently proposed that the decision-making bodies of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization make declarations on the non-extension of the sphere of action of the two military and political groupings to Asia  Africa and Latin America. That would constitute a major step towards detente. All the members of the Warsaw Treaty support this proposal. We hope that the NATO countries will study this proposal and respond to it in a positive manner.	In recent years serious obstacles have emerged in restructuring international economic relations on a democratic and equal basis. The root cause lies in the policies of certain Western Powers aimed at keeping the developing countries in an unequal position  at facilitating the attempts of the monopoly capital to exercise its sway over those countries. A recent vivid example of that is the attitude of some Western Powers to the enormous work accomplished by States in preparing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Many years of effort have produced a document whose provisions do not prejudice anybody's interests. And what has become of it? The United States is hampering the adoption of that convention. We would like to express the hope that it will stop being in opposition to a vast majority of States and will adhere to the convention.	The USSR is in favour of democratization of both political and economic relations between States. As to our participation in rendering assistance to the newly freed States in overcoming their economic backwardness  in this respect to the Soviet Union is doing at least as much if not more than any of the developed capitalist countries. It is common knowledge that the foreign policy course of any State is an extension of its domestic policy. Our country sets itself economic and social tasks of vast magnitude. We need peace to accomplish them. The Soviet Union is extending its hand to every State which  for its part  is willing to maintain and develop good relations with us. That applies to Europe. We are prepared for a further expansion of co-operation with Western European countries on a peaceful and mutually beneficial basis. That applies to Asia  where the Soviet Union has long-standing and stable ties with many States. That applies to Latin America  where normal  business like relations are being established between the USSR and a number of countries  including Mexico  Brazil and Argentina. The same applies to the United States of America. We are convinced that from the viewpoint of a long-term policy of principle the deterioration of relations between the USSR and the United States is not in the interests of the United States itself. The American people is hardly different from other peoples as far as the desire to live in peace is concerned. Our country has on several occasions pronounced itself - in particular at the Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and at the USSR Supreme Soviet — in favour of developing normal relations with the United States. The policy of the Soviet Government aimed at preserving and strengthening peace and preventing another war is endorsed by all Soviet people  since all they aspire to is a peaceful — and only peaceful — future. At the end of this year the Soviet people will mark an important event the sixtieth anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Land of the Soviets is invariably faithful to the peaceful behests of the founder of our State  V. I. Lenin. As Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again  ""concern for peace is paramount in the policy of the Soviet Union"". This concern determines the fundamental direction of all foreign policy activities of the Soviet State  which are based on the Programme of Peace for the 1980s adopted by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This Programme is being implemented by the Soviet Union together with other countries of the socialist community  cemented together as they are by a common political system and world outlook  by the identity of goals and ideals. All the activities of socialist countries convincingly prove that peace is their policy aim. Every step  every foreign policy move made by them  serves the attainment of that noble goal. The Soviet Union has rebuffed and will continue to rebuff policies based on the cult of force. Those who come out for preventing a nuclear disaster and for strengthening peace can always count on its support and co-operation. All our actions in the international arena will continue to be inspired by our deep-held belief in the necessity and the possibility of saving the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war."
"117",5993,"RWA",37,1982,"I have the honor of extending to Mr. Hollai  on behalf of the delegation of Rwanda the warmest congratulation  echoing those already addressed to him from this rostrum by those speakers who have preceded me. His election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a tribute. Indeed  it duly recognizes the confidence which is owing to his personal qualities  particularly his competence  to which solemn homage has thus been paid. His election  moreover  is a mark of recognition of the important role that his country plays within the international community in the promotion of the ideals and principles inscribed in the Charter. In this context  the Rwandese delegation  whose readiness and sincere co-operation are assured him  is convinced that under his presidency the work of the current session will yield the results which the international community is entitled to expect in view of the objectives justifying the existence of the United Nations. May I also pay a tribute to Mr. Hollai's predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  who deserved well of the Organization by the wisdom  devotion  talent and dynamism with which he led the debates  which were undeniably long and difficult  that took place during the thirty-sixth session  as well as those of the seventh and ninth emergency special sessions and those of the special session devoted to disarmament. I should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate the congratulations of the Government of Rwanda to Mr. Perez de Cuellar following his election as Secretary-General. The Government and people of Rwanda again express their best wishes for his full success in his noble and difficult mission and commit themselves to supporting him and assuring him of their full co-operation  within their means  in giving concrete form to the ideals for which the United Nations remains the guarantor and trustee.In accordance with established tradition  the General Assembly is gathered here to take stock of a year of activities by the United Nations  primarily for the purpose of preparing for the future in accordance with the lessons  experiences and results of the past. As happens every year  a privileged opportunity has again been given to all Member States publicly and solemnly to express their positions with regard to problems which are currently of concern to the international community  as well as their hopes for the future-hopes whose realization will depend on the mobilization and contribution of all peoples within the framework of increasingly active solidarity  above and beyond pious wishes and simple declarations of intent.$53The concerns of the Rwandese delegation bear first of all on the international economic situation  which scarcely prompts optimism  following a structural crisis which is creating an increasingly wide gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries. World recession  monetary upheavals and increasingly heavy and crushing indebtedness confront the developing countries with problems that are at times inextricable and they are threatened in the end with bankruptcy.During the year which is drawing to an end  no tangible development has occurred to modify in any positive or lasting way that tragically alarming trend  which the international community has been deploring for several years. The world continues to flounder in this crisis  which reduces to naught the ambitions and hope of enabling the majority of three quarters of humanity to escape the suffering of poverty and wretchedness.The disorder of the international monetary system thus aggravates the problems of the third world countries which  while on the path to development with precarious resources  difficulties which are characterized notably by the persistence of inflationary pressures  the increasingly marked deterioration in terms of trade and the reduction of resources of institutions whose mission is to ensure financing.For many such countries  the deterioration of the food situation has already gone beyond the point at which they are forced to increase their dependence on imported products to such a degree that they are no longer in a position to make the adjustments necessary to break the spiral of a worsening food shortage.In this context  the countries which can afford to should abandon an exceedingly comfortable and simple attitude of inward withdrawal and should devote further efforts to ensuring that their official development assistance reaches the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product set within the framework of the Second United Nations Development Decade. In that connection  the Republic of Rwanda would like to hail the decision already taken by a certain number of industrialized countries  which intend to devote 0.15 per cent of their gross national product to assistance for the least developed countries  of which my country is unfortunately a member.My country at the same time welcomes the fact that the target of 0.15 per cent has been approved in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  a programme which the General Assembly endorsed in resolution 36/194. My delegation ventures to hope that donor countries  as well as all potential prime lenders  will take adequate steps forthwith so as to ensure the effective implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action. My delegation is thinking particularly of immediate steps making it possible to satisfy the most urgent needs of the least developed countries. I should like to refer  by way of example  to the provision of substantial resources to reduce shortages of foodstuffs and energy resources  immediate financial assistance in the form of the cancellation or (rescheduling of debts and support for the balance of payments  and the immediate provision of supplementary financial support  especially for identification of projects  the carrying out of feasibility studies and the detailed preparation of investment projects.The hardly encouraging picture of the world economy shows that the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equity is an urgent and imperative need. In that regard  I need not dwell on the disappointment caused by the impasse regarding the global negotiations. Since the eleventh special session of the General Assembly  in August 1980  two years have elapsed without delegations having succeeded in finding a compromise acceptable to all parties so as to permit the effective resumption of global negotiations.Although the present situation is undoubtedly one of impasse  certain parties like to praise the therapeutic virtues of the free play of market forces  which unfortunately benefit only the powerful and the strong  inasmuch as they do not fall within the framework of a real strategy of international co-operation and disregard economic interdependence  thus threatening to exacerbate the disagreements and disparities among States.The Government of Rwanda is firmly convinced that the development of the third world depends on a fundamental restructuring of international economic relations as a result of reforms designed to put an end to the present system  which tends to keep the poor majority subordinated to the wealthy minority. Interdependence is a crucial element which must constantly be borne in mind: it should inspire greater solidarity and complementarity in the organization of the economic relations between the industrialized countries  which possess the technology  and the developing countries  which possess raw materials. To disregard that reality would be to close our eyes deliberately to the facts and risk plunging the international community inextricably into a crisis.Interdependence should not  however  be limited to North-South relations; it should also be an important element in South-South relations  and should be understood to apply particularly to co-operation among developing countries-co-operation which the effective implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action would al low to develop and strengthen yet further.In this connection  Rwanda is working unceasingly and with all its strength to promote and strengthen its co-operation with other developing countries in general and neighboring countries in particular. With the latter Rwanda is endeavoring to develop relations of friendship and co-operation on the bilateral level and also within the framework of the sub regional communities. The Rwandese delegation is convinced that such co-operation  which is fully in keeping with the objectives set forth in the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa constitutes  with regard to the countries concerned  an important contribution to the achievement of international economic relations which serve the interests of all the parties. We are also convinced that we must foster exchanges which could enable the third world countries to confront the difficulties inherent in the imbalance of the present system  which is reflected in persistent disorder and profound structural problems.It is high time all States understood that all hope of peace and security will be vain as long as the world is ruled by a system which maintains three quarters of mankind in the worst conditions of poverty  malnutrition  hunger and even abject  pathetic and revolting squalor.The conclusions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have shown the skeptics that the Organization constitutes an ideal framework for constructive dialogue on problems and questions of world interest. Rwanda welcomed the adoption last April by a great majority of countries of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is not necessary to recall here the entire background of that Conference; its origins are well known to all delegations at this session of the General Assembly. My delegation would simply like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all the delegations that took an active part in the work of that important Conference  at which there were lengthy negotiations before arriving  after more than 10 years  at the drafting and adoption of an effective international instrument on the law of the sea.As a representative of a developing country which is  furthermore  deprived of direct access to the sea  I should like to take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Government and people of Rwanda  our sincere satisfaction with the provisions of the Convention concerning the right of access to and from the sea and also the exercise of the rights provided for in the Convention  especially those pertaining to the freedom of the high seas  the common heritage of mankind and the enjoyment of freedom of transit through the territory of transit States by all means of transportation. The land-locked countries would certainly have liked to see other provisions included in the Convention  but they refrained from insisting on that point so as not to jeopardize or block the consensus which was sought by all parties.We hope that the Convention will enter into force as soon as possible and that it will serve as a model for the management and sharing of the wealth of our planet for the benefit of all mankind in general and of the poorest in particular. With this in mind  my delegation hopes that the delegations that so far have not  for various reasons  been able to support the Convention on the Law of the Sea will reconsider their position and join the majority  so that the objectives which in this sphere are common to all Member States may be achieved.With the same optimism  we hope to see substantial and noteworthy progress made in the sphere of international trade  which for several years has been the object of important negotiations within UNCTAD. The gradual fall in the prices of raw materials and the inexorable increase in the prices of finished products make the economic situation of the developing countries increasingly catastrophic  for the deficits and the gaps to be filled compel them to contract more and more crushing debts and thus to become insolvent  which jeopardizes their future not only socially and economically but also politically.I shall not engage in the futile exercise of enumerating all the problems confronting the developing countries in general and the least developed and the land-locked countries in particular. I will simply draw the attention of the Assembly once more to the fact that all the defects of the world economy are at present affecting even more seriously this category of countries with weak and vulnerable economies. Therefore I reiterate that the time has come for solidarity and co-operation based on sharing  justice  equity and complementarity  in the framework of the democratization of international relations  which is an urgent necessity.The role of the United Nations is to contribute to this and thereby to achieve its primary objective  that of promoting and ensuring the maintenance of peace  security and justice  while working for individual and collective well-being and progress  for the benefit of all the peoples of the world.We are bound to note and to deplore the fact that the world does not seem to be prepared to lead from history and to give concrete form to the noble ideals to which all the Member States freely and solemnly subscribed.Since the policy of detente  which would allow different socio-economic and political systems to lay the groundwork for fruitful co-operation  is increasingly losing ground to confrontation and tension; we face a future fraught with anguish and uncertainty. The arms race in nuclear  bacteriological and classical weapons is accelerating at an alarming pace to the detriment of investment that might help save people in developing countries from dire poverty.Some references to problems of our times and a rapid overview show that overt conflicts and areas of tension which bring to bear grave threats to international peace and security are very much with us. Some are due to anachronistic colonialism or to the hateful and cynical policy of apartheid. All are linked to flagrant violations of the Charter and norms established by international law.In Africa  above and beyond socio-economic problems  one of the major concerns remains the situation prevailing in the southern part of that continent and the sufferings  sacrifices and tragedies imposed on the Namibian people and on black South Africans struggling for recognition of their most basic rights.As regards Namibia  which is still illegally occupied and administered by the minority racist Pretoria regime  the many actions undertaken by the United Nations to lead that Territory to independence-a matter for which the United Nations bears responsibility-have thus far come up against the intransigence  hesitation and dilatory maneuvers of South Africa  which arrogantly defies the international community. How can we fail to deplore the procrastination and the attempts to torpedo the United Nations plan for Namibia  when every day the Namibian people thirst for independence  for which it will continue to pay a heavy price  through the sufferings of freedom fighters who go as far as making the supreme sacrifice to emancipate their homeland?The Government of Rwanda  which has had the privilege and signal honor of taking part in the delegation sent by the OAU to the Western countries members of the contact group on Namibia  bitterly regrets that this year is likely to end without the date on which the Namibian people is to achieve self- determination and independence being firmly set. In this connection my delegation would like to reaffirm the conviction of the Government of Rwanda that the United Nations plan for Namibia remains the only realistic framework for any initiative pertaining to the future of the Namibian people. That is why the five Western countries that make up the contact group cannot bow out without betraying the hopes and desires that the overwhelming majority of the international community have for Namibia. That is why those countries should be encouraged to show greater determination  willingness and commitment to compel South Africa to agree to strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence should not  under any circumstance or any pretext  be sacrificed to the selfish interests of certain States Members of the United Nations  States which  deaf to the repeated appeals of the international community  happily continue their collaboration with the Pretoria regime in economic  military and other matters.The accession of Namibia to independence is an inevitable process which goes along with the tide of history. It is thus absolutely necessary for the Namibian people to be able without further delay to exercise its right to decide on its future for itself in complete independence and to choose for itself  free of any external interference  the political regime and socioeconomic system that would be in keeping with its legitimate aspirations.In recalling this position the Rwandese delegation once again hails the nationalist and anti-colonialist struggle being waged by that valiant people of heroes and martyrs under the aegis of SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative  to which Rwanda solemnly reiterates its unflagging support.The return to the policy of gunboat diplomacy and the wanton and exclusive quest for spheres of influence  which sacrifice principles sacred to the entire international community as well as the elementary rights of peoples  will in no way affect the justness of the cause of the Namibian people. It will at the most delay matters; it will not at all undermine the heroism of that people.I should also like to express the Rwandese Government's solidarity with the front-line States of southern Africa and more specifically the People's Republic of Angola and Mozambique  which are constantly victims of the bloody  barbarous aggressions and acts of sabotage in which the racist minority regime of South Africa takes pleasure.In South Africa itself the proponents of apartheid-the iniquitous  hateful and inhuman policy they have established as a system of Government  thus enshrining racism and racial segregation as State policy-are attempting to maintain domination without regard for morality and right. So it is-and this is only one of many examples-that they install the majority of the population in so-called independent Bantustans and have recourse to ignoble practices such as assassination  kidnapping  torture and imprisonment against nationalists.This regime  which has been abhorred by the great majority of Member States  furthermore stubbornly defies the international community by terrorizing all of southern Africa through armed invasions  assassinations  massacres  infiltration  political de- stabilization and acts of economic sabotage against neighboring States. Quite obviously such practices amount to a desperate strategy in the face of the sacred cause of the liberation of peoples defense of which is daily mobilizing greater strength and determination within South Africa itself. That tangible progress compels the South African Fascists to launch escalated guerrilla warfare and frequently to resort to the use of bands of mercenaries.In this context  in this International Year of Mobilization for Sanctions against South Africa it is important that the diplomatic world redouble its efforts to isolate completely the minority racist regime in South Africa  politically  economically and militarily.The situation in Chad is also a matter of concern to the African continent. The fratricidal conflict which has ravished that country has seemed for some months now to have died down to some extent  but what is temporary threatens to last  jeopardizing the settlement of the crisis  unless all the protagonists abandon once and for all their bitterness and resolutely commit themselves in a spirit of national reconciliation to the quest for a peaceful solution which will safeguard the higher interests of their country and  especially  preserve its territorial integrity. Such a development is an important prerequisite for the reconstruction and development of that country  tom by internecine strife. That reconstruction and development will be the taskof all its vital forces  and Member States will not spare their support in this long-term endeavor  thereby showing the value they attach to the maintenance of peace and security  which the people of Chad so badly need.Still in Africa  the question of Western Sahara is also a topical one and a major concern for our continent. For my country  the essential aspect of this issue is the need to apply the universal principle of the right of peoples to self-determination. It is in that spirit that  since 1976  it has recognized the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.Reference to the principles which inspire and underlie international ethics and politics requires that the African countries  which have always shown their support for peoples struggling for recognition of their right to self-determination  bury their disputes on Western Sahara in order to preserve their vital unity in the OAU  without denying the principles they have freely subscribed to or sacrificing either the interests or the rights of the Sahraoui people.Other fratricidal conflicts which play their part in the proliferation of areas of tension continue in Africa  where they seriously threaten peace  security and stability in the regions and areas concerned and could encourage outside interference.With full respect for the sovereignty of other States  the position of Rwanda with regard to these conflicts and tensions  which constitute grave obstacles to development  is to put its trust in the wisdom of the parties involved and hope that the spirit of conciliation will prevail over hatred and that recourse to compromise solutions will help to preserve peace  security and stability in Africa  with strict respect for the principles of the charter of the OAU and that of the United Nations.For more than 30 years tension and murderous confusion have persisted in the Middle East  against the background of the intolerable martyrdom constantly imposed on the Palestinian people. Today more than ever this troubled region is characterized by the intransigence and barbarity of the State of Israel  which scorns the decisions of the international community and resorts to the policy of an ostrich  burying its head and refusing to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In the orgy of fire and Mood of which Lebanon has recently been the scene  this year has been marked by an unprecedented increase in acts of violence  launched by Israel on the pretext of reprisals against the PLO and of self-defense against the other States in the region.At the same time  the repression in the occupied Arab territories has never been so brutal and savage. Armed with its arrogance  which has been denounced and condemned many times by the Assembly  Israel arrogates to itself the right to annex the Syrian Golan Heights in flagrant violation of the Charter and of the established principles of international law. Its invasion of Lebanon  its provocation and harassment of all kinds in the occupied territories and the establishment of new settlements are all elements which clearly illustrate Israel's contempt for international morality and ethics as affirmed in many resolutions of the United Nations  to which that ungrateful State owes its birth.The many repercussions of the situation in the Middle East demonstrate the absolute and imperative need for a comprehensive solution. In this context  Rwanda remains convinced that any just and lasting solution in this region must necessarily involve the restoration to the Palestinian people of its fundamental and legitimate rights  especially its right to self-determination  the right to its own homeland to establish there  under the aegis of the PLO  its sole legitimate representative  the governmental structures of its choice. As long as this key problem is not satisfactorily solved  as long as the State of Israel refuses to return the Arab territories it has been occupying by force since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  as long as it persists in rejecting full participation by the PLO in the initiatives designed to promote the peace process in the Middle East  it will be an illusion to expect positive and constructive developments in this region so vital to international peace and security.The diaspora imposed on the valiant Palestinian people will not give the slightest legitimacy to acts designed to stifle its legitimate aspirations  any more than the policy of terror and occupation of the Israeli Government will deflect the international community from its duty to promote  everywhere and in all circumstances  peace and justice  which are the foundations of the Charter.Above and beyond the Israeli-Arab conflict  the state of war which persists between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  despite the many attempts at mediation  also continues to be a cause of deep concern in that already explosive region and for the whole of the international community. That war  in which the victims can be counted in thousands  is seriously disrupting the economies of the two parties to the conflict  for which it involves a considerable loss of business. The Rwandese delegation pays a tribute to all people of good will who have spared no effort to seek a settlement of this fratricidal conflict. Rwanda hopes that these two non-aligned countries which  furthermore  have the some Islamic faith  will not remain deaf to the urgent appeals of the international community urging them to find once again the way to concord and co-operation  instead of following the easy way which leads to hatred and destruction  and so that they may seek the honor of promoting peace  understanding and co-operation.In central Asia  the Afghan crisis persists and clearly shows the precariousness and fragile nature of East-West detente. The events which have occurred in Afghanistan have in fact provoked a deep division in the policy of detente  a division which has increased following the Polish crisis  exacerbating suspicions which have become only too commonplace when they involve a struggle for influence on the international scene.Rwanda believes in the need to establish and develop a calmer climate which may allow all nations to make further development efforts. Rwanda feels at the same time that attempts to promote detente cannot exclude the third world in general  and Africa in particular  without running the risk of being ineffective.In Indo-China  Kampuchea is still torn asunder by a continuing fratricidal struggle  with outside interference  for the control of power.The Rwandese Government believes that respect for the sovereignty of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes should allow for an end to such conflicts  which are obstacles to the security and peace needed by the international community  for they go hand in hand with the arms race.As regards divided nations  Rwanda supports the right of peoples directly concerned in this problem to seek ways and means to rediscover their unity. They should exercise this right peacefully  free from any interference or outside pressure.It is with this in view that the Rwandese Republic remains firmly convinced that the Korean nation cannot achieve its reunification unless all foreign troops withdraw from that area.The Rwandese Government also considers that current relations between the two German States are a reflection of the spirit of detente which underlies their relations. The co-operation established between those two States should attenuate at least to some degree the effects of division and gradually create a political climate which will not exclude the idea of a free and peaceful reunification of the German nation.Our concern in the face of an increase of areas of tension and the persistence of conflicts should not lead us to forget that the greatest danger to international peace and security is the unbridled arms race which causes the threat of an unprecedented holocaust to loom large over the world.The second special session on disarmament  which was of such great interest to the General Assembly  showed sufficiently that the provisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly were not applied in a satisfactory manner.The dawning of an era of peace  progress and justice for all peoples is still impeded by the constant increase and spectacular improvement of massive means of destruction. Research programmes and military development in this regard are disquieting  for immense financial  material and human resources are being increasingly mobilized to refine the techniques of the extermination of the human race  thereby increasing the risk of conflict and conflagration.The Rwandese Government solemnly reiterates its appeal that this formidable scientific and technological potential  as well as the financial means and human resources which allow for its development  be further exploited for peaceful purposes  especially to reduce the gap separating the wealthy from the still developing countries.Will the international community be able to face the great challenge of our century  that is  the close relationship between disarmament and development? This is the outlook which all States Members of the United Nations-especially the developed countries in general and the great Powers in particular-should adopt in seeking elements of a solution to the problems of our times  without any ulterior motive or evasion  but armed first and foremost with the firm determination and genuine will to promote concord  solidarity and co-operation among all peoples.This is the message of hope which I wish to transmit from this rostrum on behalf of the Government and people of Rwanda  in the conviction that the work of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly will lead to results specifically in keeping with the expectations of the United Nations  the Organization which is responsible to the whole international community for results which will consolidate and enhance its prestige."
"118",6038,"SAU",37,1982,"113.	Sheikh ALHEGELAN (Saudi Arabia) I wish at the outset to convey to you  Sir  our sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. That election was indeed a wise decision and testifies to your great competence for this post. 1 cannot fail to pay a tribute to the outgoing President of the thirty-sixth session of the general Assembly  Mr. Kittani  and to express to him my country's very great appreciation of his untiring efforts in presiding over the proceedings of the general Assembly. 1 also thank him sincerely for his successful presidency of that session. It gives me great pleasure  too  to express on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia our sincere congratulations to Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his election as Secretary-General. We wish to express to him our hopes for his success in strengthening the effectiveness of the Organization so that it can achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter.114. The thirty-seventh session has opened in an atmosphere of tension and anxiety. International conflicts and crises are becoming all the more complex and interlinked  and the factors that divide nations outweigh those that bring them together. The agenda of the Assembly is replete with complex problems that involve a genuine danger to international peace and security. A careful consideration of the international situation reveals to us clearly that the gap between our aspirations to a peaceful world  where relations between peoples are based on right and justice  and the actual situation  dominated by criteria of force  the policies of hegemony and attempts to impose apartheid exists and has indeed probably widened.113. International relations at present are characterized by grave indications of cold war. Polarization breeds instability in the world and detente  which marked relations between East and West in the last decade  has turned into confrontation  with unforeseeable consequences.116. There is an escalation in the arms race. The use and threat of force and terrorism have become dominant characteristics in international relations. On the other hand  the continued stagnation of the North-South dialogue and the resultant widening of the gap between the industrialized and the developing countries have resulted in a further deterioration of the international situation  which has dashed the hope of establishing a more stable world. In short  the world is gliding back to the old system based on zones of. political and economic influence based on hegemony  domination and dependence. There is no doubt that this is a source of anxiety and fear. Hence we must master all our resources to tackle this grave situation.117.	Is it not ironical that man  who in this age has been able to achieve incredible progress in science and technology  is unable to solve some of the problems that he himself has caused? Is that not enough to make us intensify our efforts to face these challenges and seek ways of ensuring stability  peace and security for the international community and of protecting the interests of peoples and nations? It is not enough simply to draw attention to international crises and problems. In order to solve and eliminate them it is necessary  after taking objective stock of the international situation  to put forward practical concepts and positive ideas which will enable the international community to face the dangers that confront it.118.	As pointed out by His Majesty King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz in hi& address to the Saudi people last August  we in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia   ... work on the comprehensive international scene within the framework of the United Nations  its agencies and organs. We abide by its Charter  support its efforts and fight any abnormal action aimed at weakening it and restricting the force of international law with a view to replacing it by the force of arms and the language of terrorism. Our actions have effectively reflected and will continue to reflect our sense of commitment to the international community  as one family  no matter what the difference in interests  and our belief in the principles of peace based on right and justice. We believe that international security and political stability are linked to economic justice.119.	Proceeding from that premise  we believe that the following conditions must be fulfilled in order to erect a solid edifice of relations between States through which it will be possible to reduce international tension and overcome many of the dangers that threaten international peace and security.120.	First  we join those who insist on the need for reform of the present political system and believe that in this respect the following must be taken into account.121.	One of the main things that encourage nations to try to acquire zones of influence and to adopt a policy of force to solve problems is that they do not accept the rule of law or respect moral and ethical principles. Therefore if such States really want to maintain peace and stability in the world and ensure prosperity  progress  wealth and well-being for the peoples  they must scrupulously observe moral principles and be guided by them in the labyrinthine complexities of contemporary international relations. In this respect  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia offers its experience to the international community as its contribution to ensuring stability and peace and eliminating the problems that jeopardize the very existence and survival of nations.122.	As pointed out by His Majesty King Fahd   Saudi Arabia is one of the Islamic nations and was created so that the law of God would be respected and God has honoured it by allowing it to serve as His house of worship and the sanctuary of His Prophet. Thus its responsibility was increased  its policy became set and its duties expanded. It performs those duties on the international scene by respecting God's way of wisdom and morality. Islam is a religion of mercy  of mind and of strength; it fights terrorism and overcomes disorder  weakness and humiliation.123.	The United Nations is the principal body for the promotion of freedom  peace  and justice  security and international co-operation. Therefore we must make available to it all that it needs to face the challenges that confront it. It should become an effective instrument for promoting world peace and economic and social progress for all. If the Organization is to continue as an effective instrument of peace  the peoples of the world should place their trust in it  and our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter should be beyond discussion or doubt.124.	The arms race and the magnitude of the resulting expenditure has increased tension in the world  and that has forced many countries  and especially the least developed  to devote a great portion of their limited resources to defence  at the expense of their progress and economic and social development. We hope that the efforts which the international community expects the Organization to exertand the positive role that it can play in this respect will lead to concrete progress which will protect humanity from the dangers which threaten it and will spare the developing countries the conflicts and struggles for influence that have become a danger to humanity in general.125.	Secondly  one of the important goals of our contemporary world and for the future is the establishment of a new and more equitable international economic order which will meet the aspirations of the peoples of the world to higher standards of living and a better life. In order to establish such a system we must grapple with the many important economic subjects that demand our attention.126.	The agenda includes many subjects and issues of extreme importance as regards international economic co-operation for development. Therefore we deem it important that the launching of a new round of global negotiations be accelerated in a serious attempt to improve the economic performance and increase the efficiency of international co-operation for development.127.	It is regrettable that the general Assembly's efforts aimed at the launching of a new round of global economic negotiations have been hampered by the existence of differences over certain procedural questions which we had earnestly hoped would be solved in the light of the conclusions of the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  which was held at Cancun in 1981  for the establishment of confidence between developed and developing countries. We also maintain that real efforts should be exerted to achieve the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and to support in every wayFAO  WFC  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and WFP in their efforts to overcome world food problems in general and to increase food and agricultural aid to Africa.128.	I should also like to stress the importance of economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries. In Saudi Arabia we consider it to be complementary to but not a substitute for co-operation between developed and developing countries. The international community should pay careful Attention to this.129.	Thirdly  word peace  security and stability are affected by a number of international problems at present afflicting the international community. If we really want to maintain international peace and security and to make progress  well-being and prosperity available to the countries and peoples of the world  we must  intensify international efforts and work tirelessly to find rapid and equitable solutions for those problems. These problems increase and worsen with the passing of time and increasingly threaten world peace and security.130.	In South Africa  the racist regime continues to enforce a policy of racial discrimination and	M against the vast majority of that country's population. That violates the most elementary international norms and humanitarian principles. While we support the people of South Africa  we call on the international community to exert the necessary pressure on the States which support the racist South African regime in order to put an end to it and to force the regime to submit to the will of the international community. South Africa must cease its invidious practices  immediately halt launching attacks on neighbouring African countries  put an end to its occupation of Namibia and comply with relevant United Nations resolutions.131.	We further call on the international community to take a firm stand against the aggressive attitude manifested in the present co-operation between South Africa and Israel  especially in the nuclear field  and in their joint nuclear tests in particular. That poses a direct threat to the peoples of Africa  to the Arab nations and to the rest of the peoples of the world.132.	One of the most serious problems facing the international community and requiring an effective  urgent solution is that of Afghanistan. The continued foreign military interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan constitutes a flagrant violation by a superpower of the sovereignty and independence of a small  non-aligned country. Today  after almost three years of Soviet interference in Afghanistan-coupled with continuous acts of aggression against the Afghan people  against mosques and peaceful villages  bombardment with incendiary bombs  the use of chemical warfare  and violations of the most elementary principles of human rights-we once again urge the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan so that the fraternal Afghan people may regain its freedom and independence and have the final say in the choice of its leaders and representatives and so that it may exercise sovereignty over its own land.133.	The raging war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran is another problem which troubles us. Saudi Arabia is pained by that war  because it is being waged between two Islamic countries. In this regard  we wish to express our hope that the Iranian Government will respond to Iraq's offers and to the missions of good offices of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the United Nations and the non-aligned movement  so that a just settlement may be achieved  thus ending the bloodshed and destruction  establishing a good-neighbourly policy. That solution would be based on the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and international law.134. One of the gravest problems threatening international peace and security  one which is prejudicing stability and prosperity  not only in the Middle East but throughout the world  stems from Israel's continuing aggression and its terrible racist settlements policy. Israel's continuing defiance and its aggression constitute a most dangerous factor in the Palestinian issue  which is an important issue for all those who believe in the right of every people to self-determination and the right to expression of free will. When we speak of Israeli aggression  we do net describe it merely as aggression against a secure people settled in its own homeland  or as usurpation of that people's territory and property  or as disregard for all human ideals  or as a flagrant violation of and challenge to the resolutions of the Organization. We describe it as aggression against the Charter of the United Nations and all the ethical and humanitarian principles enshrined therein.133. I do not wish to go into the history of the Palestinian question  which stretches back over 34 years. We in Saudi Arabia consider this our primary cause  but it has rightly become the cause of the whole world. It has absorbed more of the efforts of the Organization than any other issue. Despite recognition by most of the countries and peoples of the world of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its own territory  and despite the fact that the international community has come increasingly to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  Israel persists in its aggressive policy and its imperialist settlement policy on the land of Palestine.136.	By means of its policy of physically liquidating the Palestinian people  and its attempts to distort the history of Palestine and destroy its religious and cultural institutions  as well as to bring about changes in the demographic pattern there  Israel is attempting to put an end to Palestinian identity  with no respect either for international public opinion or for the United Nations.137.	If Palestine is our primary cause  the Holy City of Jerusalem is its essence. In this connection  Saudi Arabia  on its own behalf and on behalf of the Islamic countries which are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  reaffirms its determination to preserve the Islamic Arab character of Jerusalem and to return the Holy City to Arab sovereignty  under which it was always a meeting place for all believers in the three revealed religions and a place of hope  tolerance and coexistence for the followers of the various religions.138. Israel persists in following a policy of force and aggression  and it does not confine its aggression against the Palestinian people to occupied Palestine. It goes far beyond that territory to commit acts of aggression against neighbouring Arab countries. The flagrant and barbaric act of aggression against the fraternal people of Lebanon  and all the consequent massacres  which constitute a source of shame for all of humanity  are a violation of the principles and norms of international law and signal a return to the law of the jungle. They are a setback for the principles and ideals which the international community has observed  enshrined and safeguarded.139.	Israel's use  in its barbaric aggression against Lebanon  of the most destructive and deadly weapons against civilians-women  children and the aged- does not merely reveal Israel's malicious  aggressive  terrorist and evil nature; it also lays responsibility at the door of the countries that supply Israel with weapons. Sophisticated weaponry flows to Israel under the fallacy  which has been spread throughout the Western world and of which Israel has been able to convince the highest-level politicians  that it is needed for Israel to secure its safety. But that is a very dangerous policy and Israel's arsenal and nuclear capability have become a direct threat to world peace and security.140.	Israel's theory of security is the most dangerous and aggressive that has been seen in our era. It is no less dangerous than the Nazi and Fascist theories which dragged the world into a destructive war. Today in the Middle East  the Zionists are trying to apply the same theories as the Nazis applied in Europe before the Second World War.141.	The barbaric acts committed by Israel in west Beirut  to which thousands of Palestinian refugees -women  children and the aged-have fallen victim in the Shatila and Sabra camps  are but further confirmation of Israel's aggressive nature and criminal character. These massacres of innocent and defenceless civilians were not only aimed at the Palestinian and Lebanese people  but are a shameful stigma for humanity itself. They have given the lie to Israel's calumny and its fallacious claims that Israeli troops entered west Beirut to maintain peace and security. For it has been proved beyond doubt that this flagrant act of aggression was aimed at liquidating the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.142.	We call on the international community to support Lebanon  to assist it in regaining its sovereignty and securing the unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli invading forces from its territory  and to take all necessary measures against Israel so that it will be unable to pursue the policy of hegemony and force that it has tried to impose in the Middle East. The international community should be no less courageous than the voices heard in Israel itself in denouncing Israel's aggressive practices in Lebanon and requesting that they leave. The absence of international deterrence and the abuse of the veto in the Security Council encouraged Israel to persist in its arrogance and to depend on force to achieve its expansionist aims and ambitions. We call on all countries  especially those which support the Zionist entity and provide it with political  military and economic help.to stop that help forthwith so as to put an end to Israel's aggressive policy in the Middle East.143.	Israel should not be allowed to continue its unlawful acts with impunity. It is time for the international community to go beyond the stage of condemnation and take effective measures to stop such conduct. Those who blatantly support the Zionist entity encourage the most hateful and dangerous theories against humanity and its rights and support aggression and expansion.144.	The Arab world is eager to maintain the principles of peace  stability  right and justice. We wish to live in peace on our territory and to have equal and proper relations in order to achieve those goals  and to choose our friends and enemies on these noble principles. Thusthe Israeli aggression which seeks to impose hegemony in the area is met by a genuine trend in the Arab countries  seeking the consolidation of stability and peace in the Middle East and the world as a whole.145.	The Arab position is based on the principles adopted at the Arab summit conferences  especially the Twelfth Conference held in Fez last month  the resolutions of which have confirmed that the Arabs seek to achieve right  peace and justice and to exert every effort to maintain a peace which is just and comprehensive in the Middle East in compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.146.	The resolutions of the Fez Summit Conference reaffirmed the Arab will for peace based on justice because it took into account the true situation in the area and that involved the principles and bases which could be an objective starting point for establishing a just and lasting peace. Among those principles is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its own territory and under the leadership of the PLO  its sole legitimate representative. This is in accordance with the principles of right and justice and the resolutions of the United Nations. Thus at a time when the Arab countries reaffirm by resolution adopted at Fez their will to establish peace base on justice  Israel proves  through its conduct  that it does not wish peace but rather seeks more expansion and more occupation of territory. It has become clear that Israel is not the party that seeks security. Those who look for security are the Arabs.147.	Peace will not be achieved as long as there is a people suffering oppression  occupation  humiliation  racism  imperialism and other forms of domination. History has taught us that the people who have been deprived of their basic rights have stood resolutely in defence of those rights. That resistance has taken different shapes and forms. Genuine peace in the Middle East will not be established unless there is a complete recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State  and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab occupied countries  including the Holy City of Jerusalem. There will hot be genuine peace in the Middle East so long as Israel persists in violating the simplest principles of human rights in the occupied territories and in Lebanon. Peace will not be realized so long as Israel adheres to its expansionist designs and racist policy.148.	Last  but not least  finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian question will be a starting point for the solution of many international problems which pose a danger to international peace and security. If such a solution is not reached  then international tension and a deterioration of the situation in an unpredictable way will be a constant source of danger.149.	If we want to keep the world away from the edge of the abyss and from the policies of extremism  force and aggression  then wisdom and reason should prevail in all our conduct and we should also observe all the principles and bases that can lessen international tension and overcome many of the dangers to international peace and security to which I have referred. We should co-operate to find a solution for all international problems and conflicts  in order to establish an international community which enjoys stability  progress  peace and security."
"119",6075,"SDN",37,1982,"Sir  I should like at the outset to extend to you  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan  sincere congratulations upon your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience and wisdom will enable you to lead our deliberations successfully.46.	We should also like to take this opportunity to express to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our deep appreciation of his indefatigable efforts for the success - of the thirty-sixth session  and to wish him all the best in his future endeavors.47.	Since this is the first regular session of the General Assembly since the election of the new Secre¬tary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I should like to congratulate him first on his election  and secondly on his excellent report on the work of the Organization. The report is of special importance  in our view  for two reasons: first  for its candour and courage in identifying the weakness in the Organi¬zation and of its authority  and secondly  for its timeliness  as it was released at a time when the authority and prestige of the Organization were waning and when the Security Council  the principal organ entrusted with the maintenance of peace and security  was almost paralysed.48.	We say this with specific reference to the failure of the Security Council to deter Israel and to put an end to its aggressive actions  the latest of which was the invasion and occupation of Lebanon and of its capital  Beirut and the genocide carried out against Palestinians and Lebanese in southern Lebanon and west Beirut which culminated in the massacres at the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps. Session after session  the overwhelming majority of the members of the international community represented in the Assembly have warned about and called attention to the aggres¬sive nature of Israel  its expansionist policies and its sinister design to exterminate the Palestinian people. Its latest act of aggression against Lebanon and the Palestinians is but additional proof of those sinister designs.49.	The records attests to this assertion: first  the Israeli invasion of Lebanon was mounted under extremely dubious pretexts at a time when the PLO was fully respecting the 1981 cease-fire agreement; secondly  the invasion and the genocide that followed took place at a time when the Security Council was constantly meeting  adopting resolution after resolu¬tion to no avail; thirdly  the invasion and its gruesome aftermath took place while the whole world  through the mass media  was watching the carnage; fourthly  Israel persisted in its barbaric activities in Lebanon despite the advice  the warning  the opposition and the denunciation of the whole international community  including Israel's allies; fifthly  Israel not only defied the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council  but went further  defying and brushing aside the authority of the Security Council represented by the United Nations peace-keeping forces in southern Lebanon: sixthly  the Beirut mas¬sacre was a further manifestation not only of Israel's defiance of the United Nations but also of its defiance of the whole international community and of its Mends when it blatantly violated the Beirut agreement  under which the Palestinian fighters left Beirut  leaving thousands of Palestinian civilians under the sole protection of the guarantees contained in that agreement.50.	Israel is committing all these atrocities under the pretext of defending its security. What kind of security is Israel referring to? Is it the indefinable security that was the pretext for bombing the Iraqi nuclear research centre  hundreds of miles away and across the territory of two sovereign countries at a time when the Israeli nuclear reactor in Daymona operates outside the obligations contained in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and outside the monitoring and safe¬guards of IAEA? Is it the security that was the pretext for annexing Arab Jerusalem and declaring it the eternal capital of Israel over the objection of the world and against the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council? Is it the security that was the pretext for occupying and then annexing the Syrian Golan Heights  the strategic heights that overlook Damascus? Is it the security that was the pretext for the perpetual occupation of the West Bank and for the planting of fortified settlements and armed settlers in the midst of hundreds of thou¬sands of unarmed Palestinian villagers? Is it the secu¬rity that was the pretext for storming through southern Lebanon  destroying its towns and villages  besieging Beirut and interring in Lebanon's internal affairs after violating its sovereignty and destroying its national unity? Is it  in the final analysis  the security that was the pretext for exterminating thousands of unarmed Palestinians  women  old peo¬ple and children  because more than 30 years of homelessness and oppression had not silenced their demands for the fulfilment of their legitimate rights?51.	What security and secure boundaries does Israel want? Is it the kind of security that does not recognize the right of others to security or the kind where bound¬aries are continuously shifting and expanding? Is it not painfully puzzling that some of us still argue that peace in the Middle East will not obtain unless Israel's security is guaranteed? To whom are the security guarantees more vital: to Israel  that spreads its troops and modem war machine all over the region; or to Lebanon  Syria  Jordan  the other Arab coun¬tries and the homeless Palestinian people  victims of daily Israeli aggression?52.	We have opted and we shall continue to opt for peace  peace that is based on justice and not peace imposed by guns. The Twelfth Arab Summit Confer¬ence at Fez clearly reflected this strong commitment to just and lasting peace in the Middle East  peace that will guarantee the security of all States in the region and the achievement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their State on their land. That peace will not be achieved unless the Palestinians  represented by the PLO  their sole legitimate representative  participate in negotiating that peace.53.	It is now abundantly clear to the Assembly  which represents the conscience of the international community  that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question  which remains the core of the Middle East conflict. This solution must guarantee the achievement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination  sovereignty and independence and to the establishment of their independent State on their land. This will not be achieved without ensuring Israeli compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly calling for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Arab Jerusalem  and for the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.54.	At the Fez Conference the Arabs were unani¬mous concerning peace based on justice  and con¬firmed their genuine desire for it. In our view  the Fez decision has created  for the first time in the history of this issue  a favorable climate for all parties con¬cerned to bring about a just settlement of the conflict in the Middle East  especially bearing in mind the new  positive development in the American attitude. This is reflected in President Reagan's initiative and his expressed desire for a peaceful settlement that will end the tragic suffering in the Middle East.55.	We welcome all the efforts now being exerted to ensure a just settlement of the Middle East prob¬lem and hope that those efforts and endeavors will not be nullified by the intransigence of the Israeli Government.56.	In surveying the present international situation  we clearly note the gap between the prevailing situa¬tion in international relations and that situation which the peoples of the world aspire to in regard to the realization of international peace and security. The problems we are facing are becoming more complicated and hotbeds of tension and conflict throughout the world continue to pose serious threats to international peace and security.57.	The Sudan is following with increasing concern the Iran-Iraqi war  which has been going on for more than two years now despite all efforts to stop it. From this rostrum  we commend the Iraqi initiatives and efforts  made within and outside the United Nations  to stop the suffering of the peoples of those two Moslem countries. We call on Iran to respond positively to those efforts so that Moslem resources and wealth can be utilized for the good of the Moslem nation.58.	The Sudan firmly believes in the principles of respect for the sovereignty and independence of all countries and peoples  the illegality of intervention in all its forms in internal affairs  the inadmissibility of the use or threat of use of force in international relations and the necessity of halting all forms of aggression and pressure—covert or overt—that threaten the sovereignty and political independence of other countries.59.	That is why we view with anxiety the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We reiterate our call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops so that the peoples of those two countries can exercise their inalienable right to decide on the politi¬cal  social and economic systems they deem fit for their countries  without foreign intervention or domi¬nation.60.	We also hope that efforts to arrive at a just and peaceful solution to the questions of Korea and Cyprus will meet with success and bring peace  stability  development and national unity  which are the aspirations of the peoples of those countries.61.	The Sudan is following with great concern and attention the developments of the political situation in South Africa. In this regard  it is about time for the racist clique in Pretoria to learn that neither peripheral nor cosmetic changes can remedy that abhorrent situation. What is needed is radical and far-reaching change that will abolish the apartheid system and establish a just and democratic society  where the majority enjoy their freedom as well as their inalien¬able sovereign rights. It is our conviction that  no matter how long it takes  that goal will be achieved through the ongoing heroic struggle of the national resistance movement in South Africa.62.	One cannot venture to address the problems in southern Africa without addressing the question of Namibia  which the international community had expected would take its rightful place in this body.It is time for the international community to put an end to the delay in the settlement of the Namibian issue. It is our understanding that the latest round of negotiations has achieved some positive results  which we hope will lead to the adoption of accelerated measures in implementing the peaceful plan for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).63.	We in the Sudan hail the heroic role of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and its capable handling of the arduous negotiations despite the maneuvers employed by South Africa in that process. We also commend the role of the front¬line African States and the wisdom  co-operation and flexibility they exhibited in the course of those negotiations. Moreover  we appreciate the role played by the Western contact group in the initial efforts  which helped make possible the adoption of resolu¬tion 435 (1978). However  now more than ever before  we urge the contact group  to do its utmost to exert the necessary influence on South Africa so that it will meet its commitment as stipulated in the plan within the framework of a declared timetable  before we lose this valuable opportunity  which may be the last. It is also imperative that such a move ultimately lead to the peaceful termination of the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and allow the people of Namibia to exercise their legitimate right to self- determination.64.	In view of its commitment to the cause of African liberation in general and the independence of Namibia in particular  as well as its uncompromising belief in the effective role which the United Nations must play in settling the Namibian problem  the Sudan has agreed in principle to participate in the United Nations peace-keeping force envisaged for the transitional period of the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia. This was originally stated by President Jaafar Mohamed al Nemery  at the thirty- third session of the General Assembly meeting  in his capacity as Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in 1978. We should like once again to confirm from this rostrum the fact that we agree to participate in the United Nations peace¬keeping force for Namibia. That participation is  indeed  in pursuance of our African obligations to render moral and material support to SWAPO and to the people of Namibia to enable them to manage their own affairs after independence.65.	Despite the aspirations that led the international community to convene the second special session devoted to disarmament  last June  that session failed to meet those aspirations to even the minimum degree.66.	However  the failure of that session should not preclude us from stressing the importance of the comprehensive programme of disarmament  which would determine the specific measures of disarmament which should be implemented within a defined time¬frame  as well as other measures to prepare the way for future negotiations leading towards general and complete disarmament. Priority in disarmament negotiations should be given to nuclear weapons  and then other weapons of mass destruction  including chemical weapons and any others which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or o have indiscriminate effects.67.	The Sudan firmly believes that the establish¬ment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements or arrangements freely reached among the States of the zones concerned constitutes an important disarmament measure. In that conviction  the Sudan has consistently supported the efforts of the Organiza¬tion to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  free from the arms race and foreign military presence manifested in the form of military bases and installation  nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  and any manifestation of great- Power rivalry.68.	To that end the Sudan will spare no effort  in sincere co-operation with the States of the region  to crystallize the concept of '.the Red Sea as a lake of peace free from big-Power military strategic rivalry.71. Faithful to the decisions of the OAU  the Sudan also consistently stresses the necessity to transform the African continent into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and eliminate all forms of foreign influence and intervention therein.72.	The economic reports issued recently by Govern¬ments and various bodies of the United Nations system all indicate that the present international economic crisis is the most serious crisis since the 1930s. This evaluation is made more disturbing by all the economic indicators in developed countries. Unemployment has broken all the records of the past 50 years. Growth rates are becoming slower than ever and inflation is not yet under control. Trade restrictions and barriers threaten the world with new trade wars that would complete the similarity between the current crisis and that of the 1930s.73.	The most dangerous aspect of the present crisis is its devastating impact on the economies of the developing countries  particularly the least developed and the African countries  and its negative impact on international economic co-operation  which is characterized at present by a diminished commitment to multilateralism and a decline in official develop¬ment assistance  which is essential to the development efforts of he least developed countries. The financial crisis in UNDP and the difficulties connected with the sixth replenishment of the International Develop¬ment Association and other international development institutions are clear proofs of this dangerous trend.74.	The Sudan and the other least developed coun¬tries are the hardest hit by the international economic crisis  and the least capable of cushioning the recur¬rent international economic shocks. Despite this unfavorable international economic climate  the Sudan is endeavoring to overcome its economic problems with a two-pronged approach. The first is self-reliance and the mobilization and involvement of its citizens and regions in the process of development. The second is the utilization of bilateral  regional and international economic co-operation for its benefit and that of its partners.75.	The most outstanding achievement internally is the implementation of the new regional government system in the Sudan  a country with a territory of 1 million square miles  which must broaden the political and economic participation and involvement of all parts of the country. Under this system  the Sudan is divided into six regions  each with a parliament  a cabinet and a governor  enjoying wide powers  especially in economic and social development and the provision of various services. It is our hope that the application of this system will accelerate regional development  consolidate the principle of self-reliance and facilitate the fair distribution of the fruits of economic and social development throughout the country.76.	In spite of our own efforts and self-reliance  we have to admit that the present stage in the prevail¬ing international economic situation necessitates increasing support from the international community for our development efforts  particularly through increasing official development assistance  bilaterally and multilateral  and technical co-operation through UNDP and other United Nations agencies.77.	True to its racial  cultural and historical identity  the Sudan  which belongs to the Arab African region  has worked actively for Afro-Arab solidarity and the strengthening of the machinery and economic and political institutions that serve that end. In Africa the Sudan consistently calls for adherence to the policy of good-neighborliness  the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes through political solutions  because these are the lasting solutions. We do this in the conviction that such a policy will bring Africa peace  stability and progress. Only in that way can Africa channel all its abilities towards develop¬ment and construction  rather than waste them in disputes and conflicts. Africa is in great need of the tractor and other means of construction rather than the cannon and other means of destruction.78.	Matching words with deeds  the Sudan works seriously for the strengthening of relations with neighbouring countries. Bilateral and tripartite ministerial committees have been established with many of those countries  with a view to consolidating and strengthening those relations  ensuring respect for the independence and security of those countries  the well-being of their peoples and the enhancement of their socio-economic development.79.	As a result of that conviction  and with the aim of achieving such objectives  a charter of integration between Egypt and the Sudan has been drafted and will be signed in the next few days. This charter represents the organizational framework for steering the development process in the two countries through the implementation of a number of projects of eco¬nomic  social and cultural integration. By establishing such an interaction  the Sudan and Egypt are attempting to create an example of regional co-oper¬ation. The charter of integration between the Sudan and Egypt constitutes a serious step towards the achievement of regional co-operation and integration in Africa  in accordance with the Lagos Plan of Action adopted by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government in April 1980.280.	The OAU was created as an embodiment of African wisdom inspire by a heritage deeply rooted in historyand as a manifestation of Africa's ability to overcome all the obstacles in its path. Since its inception in 1963 the organization has upheld the same lofty and noble  principles and objectives as the United Nations. As envisaged by its founding fathers  the OAU has come to be regarded as a tributary of this international Organization whose aim it is to strengthen and uphold the same ideals and principles. Throughout the years the OAU has proved to be resilient in the face of the afflictions and crises it has faced  and it has proved stronger than the problems imposed upon it. It has also resisted attempts to weaken it or disrupt its unity or to hinder the achieve¬ment of its objectives. The OAU has continued to be the embodiment of the conviction of all African peoples that solving African problems is the respon-sibility of the Africans themselves and should be faced with African wisdom and determination and dealt with through the institutions and machinery devised at sessions of the OAU Assembly for the settlement of these problems. We trust that  despite the crises it faces today  that organization will be able to contain the differences confronting it. Faithful to the objec¬tives and principles of the OAU  the Sudan and its African brothers will spare no effort to enable the organization to overcome those differences and to attain the objectives for which it has been created.81.	Unlike other least developed countries  the Sudan suffers not only from the impact of the international economic crisis but also from a continuous influx of refugees  which adds an additional burden that drains resources and efforts already earmarked for financial  economic and social development. The refugees registered by the United Nations in the Sudan total more than a half million  although the number actually entering the country across the borders with its eight neighbors far exceeds that. In spite of this heavy burden and its disruptive consequences  the Sudan has succeeded in developing a unique experiment in the field of receiving and caring for refugees. Our experience in rehabilitating refugees  in an exemplary manner commended by the international community  has enriched the experience of the Sudanese authorities concerned and created an able cadre in that Held. As a result  the problem of the refugees in the Sudan has gone from the stage of immediate relief to a system of planning for the relocation of refugees in well-prepared accommodations  together with basic educational and health services and employment opportunities  which allow the refugees to become independent.82.	To implement these projects  the Sudan made considerable efforts to mobilize resources from Governments  international organizations and volun¬tary agencies. In this context  in June 1980 the Sudan organized the International Conference on Refugees  in Khartoum  and declared 1980 the Year of Refugees in the Sudan. In continuation of those efforts an inter¬national seminar was held in Khartoum on 11 Sep¬tember of this year. Participants in that seminar included international experts in the field of refugee problems as well as representatives of the refugees themselves. The seminar discussed a number of issues  the most important being the integration of the refugee projects into local and national develop¬ment plans. The Sudan has always pursued positive policies on refugee questions  for humane and ethical reasons  and also in compliance with regional and international instruments—to which the Sudan is a party and which it has incorporated in its Constitu¬tion—as well as practices  providing for such rights.83.	The Sudan welcomed the convening of the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held at Geneva in April 1981  and commended its outcome as a step in the right direction to be followed by other international measures commensurate with the needs of those refugees  taking into account their continuous influx and the negative impact on the host countries and peoples.84.	My delegation would like to reiterate the impor¬tance of holding a follow-up conference in 1983 to evaluate the progress achieved in the implementation of the recommendations and decisions of the first Conference  to consider ways and means of over¬coming the difficulties and problems hindering the implementation of some of the recommendations and decisions of that Conference and to urge the inter¬national community to honour its commitments to African refugees and African host countries.85.	At the thirty-sixth session I con¬cluded my statement to the Assembly by reaffirming the Sudan's unequivocal belief in the role of the United Nations  particularly with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security. Today I shall conclude by reiterating our call for the con¬solidation and strengthening of the United Nations  especially the Security Council  so that the Organi¬zation can fulfill its basic role in the maintenance of peace. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization has courageously and frankly reflected the concerns of the majority of the Member States about what has become of the Organization and of its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. We hope that the Secretary- General's ideas and proposals will be seriously considered by all Member States  and particularly by the Security Council—perhaps at a high-level meeting  as the Secretary-General has proposed. In this regard it suffices to submit the following observations.86.	First  we agree with the Secretary-General that the establishment of the collective security system provided for in the Charter is the only way for the United Nations to carry out its basic task. Reinforcing the collective security system would protect the small and weak nations and save the vast resources now wasted on armaments in a world that respects only force.87.	Secondly  the reluctance of some States to resort to the Security Council for the settlement of disputes or the maintenance of peace or to do so only when it is too late  defeats the main objective behind its creation. It is worth mentioning here that adjudication by the Council must be coupled with an absolute commitment on the part of Council members  especially ifs permanent members  which have a special responsibility in this respect  just as they have special rights  to fulfill their responsibility.88.	Thirdly  the Security Council must consider appropriate ways of making Member States observe and respect its decisions. The Council will have to be ready to deal with those States which violate its decisions.89.	Fourthly  the role played by the United Nations peace-keeping forces cannot be separated from the efficacy of the Council in exercising its authority and using its prestige and in ensuring that its resolutions will be implemented. Peace-keeping forces  as we all know  are a moral rather than a military deterrent. We believe that the Secretary-General's proposal for strengthening peace-keeping operations through collective guarantees is a matter which deserves serious study.90.	In conclusion  the commitment of Member States to the Charter and its objectives is the only guarantee of its effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security and ensuring prosperity for all the peoples of the world."
"120",6121,"SEN",37,1982,"I should like first of all to express the heartfelt congratulations of the Senegalese delegation to you  Sir  on your brilliant election to the presidency of the Assembly. Your long experience in the United Nations  your unanimously recognized competence  your solid intellectual and moral qualities is all a guarantee of the success of this important session.84.	It is also a great pleasure for me to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the remarkable way in which he conducted the debates at the thirty- sixth session. We express these feelings to him  with pride and appreciation  convinced that the results attained at the many sessions that took place this year are due in large measure to the expertise and intelligent authority that he demonstrated in accomplishing his delicate task.85.	I wish to pay a tribute also to the Secretary- General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts and to congratulate him warmly once again on behalf of Mr. Abdou Diouf  President of the Republic of Senegal  and on behalf of the Government and people of Senegal  on his election as Secretary-General. For almost a year now  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  through his repeated initiatives and courageous actions  has been engaged in the promising beginning of work that Will be remembered in history as particularly positive for the peace and security of the world.86.	The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is opening at an especially disquieting time in international affairs with an increase and intensification of hotbeds of tension and various conflicts as well as an ever-worsening imbalance in political and economic relations among nations. Thus relations between the major Powers are steadily deteriorating  the prospects for effective disarmament seem to be receding and throughout the world the problems dividing peoples are multiplying dangerously. Moreover  progress in reorganizing the world economy on a more just and agreed basis is perilously slow.87.	We must therefore determine how to use the framework  structures and procedures provided us by the United Nations to improve  in peace and stability  the situation of the world.88.	In contributing to this debate  we should like to express first of all  on behalf of Mr. Abdou Diouf  head of State  and of our country  Senegal  the fervent hope that at this session the Assembly will not shy away from the need for a lucid analysis of the problems confronting the international community nor from the courageous and persistent search for the most appropriate solutions  so that mankind may at last come to experience an era of peace  security and prosperity in the very spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.89.	Indeed  the situation facing the community of nations is but a sign that the international order which was established after the Second World War has run its course. Among the anomalies in this international order  colonialism and apartheid have shown exceptional longevity. Outlawed by the international community for many years now for its odious system of government  South Africa  supported materially  financially and militarily by certain industrialized States  still arrogantly ignores the resolutions and recommendations of the Organization. Today  four and a half years after the adoption of the settlement plan which was to have led Namibia to independence  the Pretoria racist regime is still trying  through unspeakable maneuvers  to promote the establishment of a so-called internal Settlementóas though the edifying example of Zimbabwe had not demonstrated the fate that history unfailingly reserves for that type of undertaking. Not satisfied with trampling underfoot the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  the Government of South Africa persists in its use of violence and repression against Namibian patriots while perpetrating ever more acts of aggression against neighbouring States in general  and in particular  against Angola  part of whose territory remains occupied illegally by Pretoria's troops.90.	It is none the less a fact that the mobilization of South Africa's political and military apparatus can in no way affect the outcome of the freedom fight waged by our brothers of the South West Africa People's Organization.91.	A year ago  during the eighth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the question of Namibia  a good number of us still harbored the hope that 1982 would be the year of independence for Namibia. Those hopes were dashed  basically because of the delaying tactics of the Pretoria leaders. In fact  in response to the responsible and courageous attitude taken by SWAPO in the negotiations initiated by the contact group of the five Western countries  South Africa  running out of pretexts  is today attempting to give an East-West dimension to a strictly colonial-type problem by making new demands of certain sovereign States in the region at every stage.92.	My delegation wishes once again to appeal to the group of Western countries that initiated the settlement plan to bring more pressure to bear on the Pretoria regime to induce it  in the negotiations under way  to comply with the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the only valid framework in which a solution in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people can be founds93.	In this respect  it is fitting to underscore the efforts undertaken  in sometimes difficult conditions  by the five countries of the contact group. May they find in our words renewed encouragement to continue these efforts  because a solution to the Namibian problem will be an important stage towards peace and stability in that part of the world?94.	We say ""stage"" because genuine peace cannot be established in southern Africa so long as the racist minority continues to deny the majority in South Africa itself the fundamental right to a life of dignity and freedom. The condemned system of apartheid  which has created a dangerous and explosive situation throughout southern Africa  calls for active solidarity on the part of all of us with the oppressed majority of South Africa. I take this opportunity to reaffirm here  on behalf of my country  the determination of the Government and the people of Senegal to continue to provide aid and support to our brothers in South Africa organized in the African National Congress and the Pan AfricanistCongress.95.	At the other end of the continent  Western Sahara is today the basis for problems which Africa couM and should have been able to avoid. We in Senegal continue to hope that a dynamic African-style compromise will be found soon in order to extract the continental organization from the present dangerous impasse.96.	As for the Comorian island of Mayotte  we shall continue to encourage the parties concerned to engage in constant dialogue and we reiterate our readiness to do everything within our means to help them to do that.97.	It often happens that on the eve of a session an important event moves to front stage on the international scene. This applies today to the Middle East crisis. The deterioration of the situation in that part of the world has now reached alarming proportions. The problem before us in that region is all the mote alarming because the Security Council has still not managed to obtain the implementation of the measures it has adopted to achieve the restoration of a just peace in that area through respect for the immutable principles of international law.98.	Since the last three sessions of the General Assembly  the Israeli leaders have not confined themselves to making further claims on the occupied Arab territories: they have again moved into action with the annexation of the eastern part of the city of Jerusalem in June 1980  action which the international community condemned in the most categorical terms and which my country  Senegal  continues to oppose within the Al Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.100. Thus  after having annexed the Syrian Golan Heights last December  the Tel Aviv authorities  deaf to the repeated appeals of the international community  seem today to have decided to accelerate the process of annexing the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  while the occupation of part of the Lebanese territory continues. The criminal massacre just a few days ago of innocent Palestinian civiliansówomen  children and the elderlyóunfortunate once again demonstrates a policy which is immoral and categorically condemned by international law. By that new act of blind violence  Israel has once become an outlaw in our communally  which has M down its rules for peaceful and sound coexistence based on philosophical and political principles that have constituted and still constitute the positive extension of all that is lofty and great in the history of human endeavor.101.	Need we recall the bloody premeditated invasion of Lebanon by Israel in June 1982  with the avowed purpose of drowning the resistance of Palestinian patriots in blood? The military liquidation of the PLO  in Israeli logic  was designed to allow the Tel Aviv authorities to impose on the inhabitants of the occupied territories an ' autonomous"" status which would only facilitate the final annexation of the territories occupied by force since 1967. The blind massacre of Lebanese id Palestinian civilians therefore compounded the most serious challenge that has ever been posed to the authority of the Organization.102.	Thus defying with impunity the authority of the United Nations  Israel continues to demand that the legitimate rights of the peoples of the region be sacrificed to the imperatives of its so-called security. It is clear that the United Nations could not and cannot accept the dangerous prospect of such a situation.103.	The Palestinian nation exists; it is built on suffering and frustration and seasoned by years of struggle for freedom and independence. As it hails the courage and determination with which the valiant Palestinian patriots continue to resist the repeated assaults of the Israeli aggressor  my country  Senegal  wishes solemnly to reaffirm here its constant and unswerving support of the Palestinian cause  under the guidance of its authentic and legitimate representative  the PLO  courageously led by Yasser Arafat  to whom I wish here  on behalf of my country  to pay a heartfelt tribute for the admirable and victorious way in which for several weeks he organized the heroic Palestinian resistance in west Beirut. To that I add the support of the Senegalese people for the brother people of Lebanon which  through its dignity and spirit of self-sacrifice  is providing the world a living example of its genius and capacity for survival.104.	The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  over which my country has the honor to preside  long ago outlined the framework for a just and comprehensive solution of the Middle East question. In the past as today  our basic objective must be to implement the recommendations of that Committee  as well as those of theSecurity Council  so that the Palestinian people will not lose hope in the triumph of international law  for  if it did  that would only pointlessly prolong a tragedy whose outcome in the short or long run is perfectly clear: nothing can be imposed on a people which refuses to submit.105.	The stakes are high. At issue is the credibility of the United Nations in small countries and with oppressed peoples  which  like the Palestinian people  are only claiming their right to freedom and independence.106.	It makes our countries very bitter to note that the indifference to the appeals of the community of nations has become almost deafness today when problems directly affecting the freedom and dignity of third-world peoples are involved. Like the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Palestine  the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan remain subject to laws imposed upon them by foreign Borders in defiance of the principles of the Charter  in all those cases the Nations has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of the occupying troops and the restoration the sovereignty of those States by the formation of legitimately chosen government. My country  Senegal with continue to support law and justice  which are on the side of those who are subjected by force to intolerable situation  as is the case today of Kampuchea and Afghanistan.107.	With respect more particular to the problem of Kampuchea  the Net/ Committee Mel's was created by the International Conference convened on the question in July 1981óa Committee ever which my country presidesóis continuing it?  efforts to formulate concrete proposals so Chat negotiations may at last take place  to the benefit of the Kampuchean people  which has suffered so much from this tragedy. True  a solution is certainly not yet in sight  but there is reason for hope  as attested to by the formation last June of coalition government composed of the various components of the heroic resistance of the people of Kampuchea.108.	With regard to Afghanistan  my country has been following with sustained interest the efforts made by the Secretary-General to achieve an acceptable solution to this problem in the true interest of this sorely tried brother people. We remain ready  in the name of solidarity among nations and the principles contained in the Charter  to contribute to these peace efforts within the limits of our modest possibilities  convinced as we are that a stubborn desire to find a solution by force will simply pointlessly prolong the tragedy of the people of Afghanistan and serve only to increase tension among the States of the region.109.	As for the distressing Iraq-Iran conflict  the international community should show greater tenacity by increasing and strengthening the efforts already undertaken under various auspices to induce the two belligerents to settle their dispute by peaceful means  within the framework of a comprehensive  just and honorable solution. The Islamic Peace Committee  established in January 1981 at Taif  the mediation committee of the movement of non-aligned countries  and the United Nations have made praiseworthy efforts in this connection; the international community should encourage pursuit of those efforts in order to put an end to a conflict with many repercussions for international security.110.	We should also give our attention to the question of Korea. The principle of reunification  which has been accepted by both countries  should be encouraged by the Organization.111.	Peace through law  the basis for 4he foundation of the United Nations  has not yet been established as a guarantee of international security. Quite the contrary  peace through terror seems to have replaced the rule of law in a world now more than ever before dominated by clashes between the interests of Powers and ideologies.112.	While many decisions of the Organization remain unimplemented  3th race for destructive power continues inexorably  posing an increasing threat to the pea e and security of our planet.113.	The difficulty of changing this situation  which is so dangerous for the future of mankind  has just been demonstrated once again by the failure of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which had inspired legitimate hope in all those  like us  for whom halting the arms race is one of the major concerns of our time. It is disquieting  to say the least  the sum international situation which is constantly deteriorating  at that session it was not possible to achieve some minimal results; this points to a lack of genuine political will to achieve progress. But the fact that that session did not lead to concrete results only strengthens our attachment to the historic validity of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly and to the comprehensive program of disarmament prescribed therein  which has become more imperative than ever. That failure  however regrettable it may be  must not win out over our determination to redouble our efforts to succeed in the task of disarmament  which remains one of the essential keys to international peace and security.114.	Important items on the agenda of that session ófor example  those concerning studies  the improve-ment of the effectiveness of institutional machinery for disarmament and new initiativesówere not considered substantively. Along with other delegations present here  we hope that this thirty-seventh session will provide us with the opportunity to go more deeply into these matters in our debates; they have the highest priority of any  for on them depends the security of the world.115.	While current political events are a source of preoccupation for the international community  the economic situation  too  points to the need to mobilize all possible political will to make genuine progress. Indeed  if there are anomalies in international political relations  these exist alsoóand certainly to a greater extentóin economic relations among nations. It is good that everyone has realized this and that there is unanimous agreement that one of the great problems of our day is the revision of economic relations  particular between the rich countries and the poor countries.116.	That problem is all the more crucial because the disparities in the world economy  especially between North and Southóand their consequences for international co-operation for developmentófoster a practically chronic instability in world political relations.117. Within nations  revolutions have always resulted from injustice  abuses and social inequalities But this time the shock-waves could affect the international order itself  for we are heartened by a vast worldwide confrontation which could bring the rich of the world into dangerous collision with the poor.H8. Unfortunately  this year  like past years  has provided a significant illustration of the inadequacy of the efforts made by the developed countries on behalf of the developing countries.119.	There is  of course  some cause for satisfaction  such as the successful outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. But the various summits of the countries of the North have not lived up with the expectations of the countries of the South. They have not resulted in the necessary decisions  which would have been such as to lead to a resumption of the North-South dialogue.120.	In our view  the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is all the more important because of the solutions it must strive to find for the many imbalances at present facing the international economy. In that connection  this session should promote the launching of global negotiations  which will provide a long-term framework for changing the present irrational and unjust system of international economic relations.121.	The head of State of Senegal  President Abdou Diouf  has constantly emphasized the special im-portance attached by my country to the launching of global negotiations in order to promote the international co-operation they are bound to foster. For three years the General Assembly has been adopting by consensus resolutions concerning the global round of negotiations. It is urgent; we feel that the necessary political will will finally emerge in order to bring about the consensus needed to open the negotiations on an acceptable and just basis.122.	I now come to a question to which my Government attaches very great importance. I refer to the drafting by the Organization of an international convention against the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries.123.	The Government of Senegal  indeed  has always defended here and elsewhere  on every occasion  the principles recognized by the United Nations  including those regarding the independence  national sovereignty and equality in law of States  non-interference in their internal affairs  and the non-use of force in relations between States. There is no need to stress that respect for those principles is an important condition for the establishment of international peace and security.124.	In that spirit  my Government believes that no consideration of any kind can justify the recruitment  use  financing and training of mercenaries  or armed support for the actions of certain groups which rise up in rebellion against the legal Governments of sovereign States.125.	It will be recalled that my country was a sponsor of the text adopted as resolution 35/48 and played an active part in its adoption by the Assembly. That resolution established the Ad hoc Committee on the Drafting if an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries. We played that role because Senegal believes that an international convention on the subject would make a contribution to the elimination of a major cause of disturbances and destabilization in relations between States.126.	The threat posed by the activities of mercenaries in the third world in general  and in Africa in particular  has been growing. Unfortunately  despite the impressive number of resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly  as well as by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] condemning the activities of mercenaries  it can easily be stated that the recruitment and use of mercenaries  with orders to take destabilizing action in independent African countries  has not  it seems to us  noticeably diminished.127.	In the face of that situation  the African countries  through the OAU  have adopted a convention on the elimination of mercenarism in Africa. But that legal instrument is of only regional scope and cannot solve the problem throughout the world. To do that  there must be a contribution by all the States members of the community of nations  for most of those mercenaries come from non-African countries. Thus  only rational international co-operation can rid the African continent and the rest of the third world of the constant grave threat posed by that danger.128.	It is therefore the responsibility of the Organization  and more specifically the General Assembly  to draw up and adopt as swiftly as possible the text of an international convention against the recruitment  use  training and financing of mercenaries in order to respond adequately to the hopes the international community has placed and continues to place in the Organization.129.	In this connection we should like to welcome the draft convention that has been introduced by Nigeria. We would venture to hope that the Ad Hoc Committee will continue to give this document all the attention its urgency and importance merit. Furthermore  it is to be hoped that the Ad Hoc Committee will not fail in its mandate and that  after the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  a convention on mercenaries will complement the range of legal instruments adopted by the United Nations in order to provide effective protection of human rights and the rights of peoples throughout the world.130.	The confidence which we place in the United Nations has prompted us at this session to reaffirm with all sincerity our earnest commitment to seeking a permanent solution to the burning issues of the present day. If relations among nations are to be based on genuine peaceful coexistence  it is essential that conciliation rather than conflict  co-operation rather than confrontation  be the general rule in these relations. Only thus can our ultimate goalóto bring about world peace on a total basis and in perpetuity  together with prosperity and justiceóbe achieved. To that end  a restructuring of the Organization is more necessary than ever.131.	In the state of restless change that is the fundamental law of our present-day worldóand never has change been as swift as it is todayóit is essential that peoples and institutions adapt to new conditions. The United Nations  our Organization  can be no exception.132.	The revision or  rather  the adaptation of the Charter to the present international situation is essential if we are to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in settling problems relating to peace and security throughout the world. In this connection the delegation of Senegal  in accordance with instructions received from its Government  would like to reiterate its support for and confidence in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and would encourage it to pursue its work actively so as to conclude its mandate as expeditiously as possible.133.	It should not be forgotten that  by virtue of the role it has played and continues to play in the major turning-points in the history of mankind  the United Nations remains the support and hope  the refuge and benchmark for nations in their ceaseless quest for peace and happiness. It is for that reason that Senegal Supports it and pledges its co-operation in its historic  noble and inspiring work for the survival of mankind."
"121",6167,"SGP",37,1982,"I should like to begin by extending my delegation's congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. He has served many years in the Organization. The reputation he has acquired among his peers is that of an extremely able  knowledgeable  affable man of goodwill. I should also like to say a word of thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the excellent job he did.207.	I have read the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization with great admiration. It is refreshingly frank and self-critical. I agree with him that our most urgent goal is to reconstruct the United Nations collective security system. With¬out such a system  first  Governments will feel it necessary to arm themselves beyond their means for their own security; secondly  the world com¬munity will remain powerless to deal with military adventures such as Israel's invasion of Lebanon  the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan and Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea; thirdly  local conflicts will threaten to widen and escalate; fourthly  there will be no reliable defense for the small and weak nations; and finally  all our efforts on the economic and social side may well falter.208.	The Secretary-General has made a number of specific recommendations on how to strengthen the United Nations collective security system. The Independent Commission on Security and Disarma¬ment Issues  chaired by Mr. Olof Palme of Sweden  has also made a number of interesting recommen¬dations on the same subject."" I urge the Security Council to consider these recommendations as soon as possible.209.	Turning to the specific conflicts and situations which threaten international peace and security  the Secretary-General was cautiously optimistic on Namibia. He reports that after many setbacks  we now see some signs of the possibility of a solution. Apart from the solitary exception of Namibia  the past year has witnessed no progress in our efforts to promote negotiated settlements on the conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere.210.	In the conflict in Kampuchea  our various reso¬lutions have not brought about the withdrawal of Viet¬namese forces. But the unambiguous position of the vast majority of nations  as reflected in the resolution and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea  has denied legitimacy to the aggres¬sor  has stiffened and heartened patriotic resistance to foreign occupation and encouraged the various resistance factions to unite their efforts under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Thus  the aggressor has not been allowed to enjoy the fruits of its actions.211.	The position of my delegation on the other questions on the agenda of this session will be enun¬ciated when these items are considered by the General Assembly.212.	All the conflicts which the Assembly was con¬sidering when we last met are still with us today. The new wars in the South Atlantic and Lebanon have shown us how quickly and unexpectedly violence and turmoil can spread. Every day newspaper headlines and the television screen bring the terrible carnage into every home.213.	While these events have captured the attention of the world  an economic crisis  no less lethal In its effects on people  has been spreading through the world. One symptom of this crisis is the debt prob¬lem. In recent months the world's headlines have drawn attention to the problem of third-world debt. It is estimated that the third_ world's debt js more than $US 500 billion. These debts were not accumu¬lated overnight. The problem has been brewing for some time. It is a combination of the problem of non- oil-producing third world countries trying to adjust to changes in energy costs and the oil-producing third world countries embarking on massive development projects in anticipation of future oil income214.	The non-oil-producing third world countries were first hit by high energy prices. They were then hjt from another direction as the industrialized coun¬tries increased the prices of their products to meet increased energy costs. To add to these difficulties  the recession in the industrialized countries depressed the prices of the primary commodities produced by these third world countries. Squeezed between high costs and falling incomes  these poor countries have had to resort to massive borrowing for consumption and not for investment. It is inconceivable to me how this debt can be repaid or the interest serviced.215.	Default on even a portion of the massive debts that have accumulated could trigger a total collapse of the global financial system  which would  in turn  lead to a deep global recession. The mild panic that seized the financial pundits of the West when they grasped the implications of the situation that they had got themselves into now seems to have been replaced by a mood of superficial confidence  perhaps because no one dares believe otherwise; no one dares say that the emperor has no clothes.216.	Another problem with grave implications is that of starvation. As much as 40 per cent of the world's population suffers from some form of undernourish¬ment. The fate of millions is downright starvation. As the population continues to increase in the poorest regions of the world  more and more people will be forced below the subsistence level of food intake. Undernourishment and starvation are the work not of fate but of human action. They can be prevented. Much of the increasing starvation can be attributed to the failure of national policies. But we are not here to pass judgment on national policies; we are here to see how we as members of an international community can help these nations in their plight. The problem is particularly severe in Africa  where food con¬sumption per person is 10 per cent less today than it was a decade ago.217.	The problems of debt and famine  which I have quoted as examples of the less headline-grabbing prob¬lems of the global community  are themselves only symptoms of a far more serious malaise in the inter¬national economy.218.	While the problem of global equity remains serious  what we are confronted with today is not simply the failure of the North to respond to the South's call for a more equitable economic relation¬ship but the incipient disintegration of the entire economic system that has sustained both North and South for the past 40 years. The consequences of such a total collapse would far outweigh the present injustices of the system. A renowned professor of the London School of Economics  which is not unsympathetic to the third world  once remarked that the misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all.219.	The liberal trading regime set up after the Second World War and institutionalized in GATT has clearly been unable to cope with the stresses and strains generated by new conditions. The developed countries have been unable to cope with the increas¬ingly sensitive impact that one national economy has on another under conditions of interdependence and they have been unable to restructure their domestic economies to deal with new patterns of international trade  production and consumption.220.	The result has been increasing protectionism in the form of a complex system of ""orderly marketing arrangements""  ""voluntary export re¬straints"" and a host of other euphemistically named non-tariff barriers designed to circumvent GATT. So prevalent have such practices become that the danger is that exceptions to GATT will become more numerous than instances of compliance. The effect of such protectionism has been to freeze the existing distribution of industrial capability and wealth. One recent study has demonstrated that three quarters of all actions to restrict imports under safeguard  surveillance and anti-dumping provisions dealt with only three product groups: steel  textiles and clothing. Locational advantages in such production have shifted rapidly  and  by and large  the lowest- cost producers are now countries in the third world  which are now being penalized for their success.221.	The problems of debt  famine and protectionism are interrelated. Protectionism freezes existing patterns of international trade in which the developed countries have consistently enjoyed huge trade sur¬pluses W.s-n-ws the developing countries. Such imbalances require financing and thus necessitate heavy borrowing and a growing debt burden.222.	Protectionism also deliberately restricts levels of food production. In Japan  North America and Europe protectionist agricultural systems have included measures to curtail the production of surpluses of major cereals and some other commodities. The European Economic Community has for two decades subsidized farm production while keeping out cheaper imports. The inevitable surplus stocks lie idle white much of the world starves. The lesson is clear. The liberal trading system  in spite of all its faults  offers the best framework for a more equitable international economic system. It is increasingly clear that more developing countries are becoming competitive in the international market. It is also becoming clear that if the principles of comparative advantage are allowed to operate unhindered  this must result in a correction of the grossly disproportionate consumption of the world's resources by the developed countries. We cannot hope for a more equitable distribution of global income if the liberal trading regime continues to be under¬mined.223.	To my mind  the basic cause of protectionism is the failure of the developed countries to manage State welfare within national means and to direct economic growth to keep pace with technological changes. Over-expenditure on welfare has resulted in inflexible domestic political structures. Governments of the developed countries have been deprived of the political flexibility needed to make changes in international patterns of trade and production without resort to protectionism.224.	The pressure for protectionism comes from many quarters. It comes from industries in developed countries which have not modernized their production processes and thus find themselves unable to compete with more efficient and lower-cost plants in developing countries. But the political pressures for protectionism also come from trade union movements in the devel-oped countries  which  acting from a short-sighted desire to protect workers in declining industries  have urged and forced protectionist measures on Governments.225.	They have sought to organize boycotts of third- world products and services under the guise of con¬cern for the heath of workers in developing countries or of preventing exploitation of workers in those countries. The charge that exports from developing countries are based on cheap labor is simplistic. It is true that the wages of third-world workers are lower than those of workers in developed countries. But the choice before the workers in the third world is either one meal or starvation. For no third world country with all the inherent drawbacks of its low development status can be competitive if its workers are paid the wages of workers in developed coun¬tries. Thus  when union leaders in some developed countries insist that wages and working conditions enjoyed by them must be accorded to workers in the third world countries  they are in fact telling the workers in the third world to starve. There are no welfare benefits and unemployment pay in most third world countries. The irony is that low-cost imports from the third world would certainly benefit the con¬sumer in developed countries by reducing his cost of living.226.	There has been a great change in the attitude of the developed countries towards third-world devel¬opment. In the immediate post-war years  the developed countries took a very positive view of economic development in the third world. From the late 1940s to the 1960s  they believed that it was in their interest to help in the economic development of the poorer nations of the world. These three decades of generous technical and monetary assistance to help these countries take advantage of the benefits of the free-trade system.227.	Today the attitude of the rich nations to eco¬nomic development in the third world is a mixture of disillusionment and fear. To be frank  much of the blame for the disillusionment can be laid at the door of developing countries themselves. The launching of over-ambitious and prestigious projects has not encour¬aged those who are sympathetic to aid programmes. More important  huge arms expenditures in pursuit of ancient conflicts and animosities against neighbors has crippled economic growth in some developing countries. Much emphasis has lately been placed on economic co-operation among developing countries. The most vital form of co-operation among developing countries is co-operation to maintain peace and stability among neighbors.228.	In this respect I should like to point to the regional grouping of the Association of South-East Asian Nations	which has created an area of peace  amity and co-operation among its five members. Its members have therefore been able to derive the maximum benefit from their national economic devel¬opment policies.229.	While we must not ignore the shortcomings in the third world  it is also true that a number of third world countries  in response to Western exhortations that they should trade rather than depend on aid  have manifested a capacity to compete with the West in industrial areas involving low technology. The response in the developed world to this modest suc¬cess at development has not been praise or encour¬agement. Rather  there have been alarmist calls for protection from entrepreneurs and labour unions in developed countries.230.	The developing countries of the third world are thus caught in a ""no-win"" situation. If they are unsuccessful in their development efforts  they are condemned for inefficiency  corruption  xenophobia and a host of other evils. If they should succeed  they are penalized for their very success.231.	The slow strangulation of a liberal trading system with increase international tension. The television cameras may not notice the process  but I fear that  if we continue to neglect the problem  we shall have all too much drama. The major devel-oped countries are increasingly divided among them¬selves. The North and the South will move further apart. Desperation will breed irresponsibility. The benefits of all this will redound to those Powers that profit from and exploit instability and divisions. The result will be an increase in international insta¬bility. This threat to the stability of the international system is fundamental. In an interdependent world  autarky is no longer a viable option for any nation. The question that all of us must face is whether we can muster sufficient political will to preserve the integrity of the system before the point of no return is reached."
"122",6247,"SLE",37,1982,"At the outset  on behalf of the Government and people of Sierra Leone  I would offer Mr. Hollai warm felicitations on his unanimous election as President of this thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and express my delegation's confidence that under his able guidance the session will be a successful one. We are aware of his distinguished record as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of his country  and we have no doubt that his experience adequately equips him for the posi¬tion he has now been called upon to assume.135.	I would also express my delegation's gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for his efforts and contributions at the last session of the Assembly.136.	This is the first opportunity I have had per¬sonally and publicly to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cueliar on his election to the high and exacting office of Secretary-General. Of course  the Government of Sierra Leone communicated its felicitations and good wishes through the usual channels immediately after his election.137.	The United Nations was founded on the ashes of global destruction which made man resolve that force would never again be used save in the collective defense of our common good. Regrettably  over the years we have strayed from the goals and ideals that inspired the efforts culminating in the founding of the United Nations  a fact which has contributed to the increasing and heightening of global tension and insecurity on an unprecedented scale  and we have failed to establish the scheme for collective security planned by the founding fathers of the Organization.138. Today there is a recrudescence of resort to unilateral force by States. This is in total disregard of the scheme and provisions of the Charter and the Organization. As a consequence the world today faces a massive betrayal of faith  whether it be in the problems of divided nations  the situation in Southeast Asia  Namibia's accession to independence  or recognition and affirmation of the inalienable right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. States or groups of States increasingly resort to special arrange¬ments in total disregard of the collective pledge we made 37 years ago ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"".139.	This phenomenon manifests itself today in an unprecedented global arms race wherein nations large and small pursue the elusive goal of national security in the strength of national arms. This goal has so far proved illusory  and after two special sessions of the General Assembly devoted to the question of disarma¬ment  it remains illusory.140.	It is this need for the reaffirmation of faith in the basic principles and ideals that gave birth to the Organization that has impelled the Government of Sierra Leone to seek the inclusion in the agenda of the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly of an item entitled ""Implementation of the collective security provisions of the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security"". This is both an exercise in practical utility and a reaffirma¬tion of faith. On the one hand  it will demonstrate to those who are minded to resort to unilateral force that the rest of us can and will stand up to them; on the other  it is a reaffirmation of our faith that only in our collective security and its maintenance and pursuit lies our individual safety and salvation. Perhaps at this stage it is timely to recall that it was the failure of the international community in another era to observe these imperatives that resulted in the demise of the League of Nations. We do not want to reap another harvest of failure in the United Nations.141.	Indeed  we feel at one with the cri de caeur of the Secretary-General when he bemoans  in his report on the work of the Organization  the fact that the procedures and methods collectively agreed upon are blithely ignored and set aside in pursuit of national parochial interests when it comes to the maintenance of international peace and security. We support histimely call for measures to strengthen the integrity and credibility of the Organization and to restore its effectiveness.142.	It is for that reason that I want to commend to the Assembly's attention and consideration the modest proposal of the Government of Sierra Leone.143.	This year has certainly been a particularly chilling one for the forces of international peace and co-operation. We have witnessed  in succession  a retreat in the ranks of two important international organizations that together complement the endeavors of the United Nations in strengthening the delicate fabric of international peace and security. I refer to the seeming paralysis affecting the OAU and the non-aligned movement  which this year had caused to abandon their important meetings because of dif¬ferences among their members.144.	In the case of the non-aligned movement  the regrettable war between Iran and Iraq—two important members of the movement—forced it to postpone the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was to have been held in Baghdad this year. Happily  the resilience of the members of the non-aligned movement and their dedication to the ideals and principles of peace have enabled them to agree on New Delhi as a new venue. For this  the Government of Sierra Leone wishes in advance to express its appreciation to the Government and people of India for their readiness to serve as host to that important meeting in the fine and historical tradition of India as a defender of the values of the non-aligned movement.145.	We can only hope that these developments will have brought home to the two warring countries of Iran and Iraq the inescapable and compelling necessity to bring their hostilities to a speedy end.146.	In the case of the OAU  it is evidently the admission to membership in that organization of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic that has pre¬cipitated the crisis. It should be realized that this is an issue on which there are strong and deep-seated feelings among members of the OAU. That is why the Government of Sierra Leone  which only recently had the exacting but rewarding task of serving as Chairman of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government  believes that through patient and con¬structive dialogue and respect for the rights and posi¬tions of the parties to the Western Sahara question  coupled with the determination of every African country  we can and should make the OAU functional again.147.	In that connection  Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone  recently addressed certain modest proposals to the current Chairman of the OAU Assembly  President Daniel Arap Moi of the Republic of Kenya  in order to reactivate the orga¬nization so as to enable it to continue its work  complementary to that of the United Nations  of advancing the frontiers of peace and co-operation.148.	A review of the politic:' landscape of our world infuses the observer with nothing but deep gloom and foreboding  accentuating the extent to which we have strayed from the path we charted for ourselves some 37 years ago. Persistent violations of the basic principles of international relations have led to foreign aggression and occupation  domination and interference in the internal affairs of States. Indeed  never before in recorded history has the incidence of violence and the readiness to resort to violence been so high as it is in our time. We are witnesses to ugly scenes of political rivalry  needless violence  social injustice and a steady  inexorable degradation of human values.149.	It was with shock and dismay that we received the news of the massacre in the refugee camps of Shatila and Sabm in Lebanon of innocent and defenseless Palestinian men  women and children whose only crime was to hunger for a State of their own. These atrocities have rightly offended and revolted the con¬science of right-thinking men and women throughout the world.150.	The state of affairs in the Middle East is a classic manifestation of that betrayal of faith I referred to earlier and a further demonstration of the extent to which we have strayed from the goals we set ourselves sometimes. In 1947  it may be recalled  the Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II)  positing the partitioning of Palestine into both a Jewish entity and a Palestinian entity. That measure  though it smacked of usurpation to the Arab population of Palestine at the time  was none the less a visionary and humanitarian act by the rest of the international community  under the shadow of the gruesome spectacle of Auschwitz  Treblinka and Dachau  to provide a homeland for an ancient  gifted and much-maligned people. Thus was the State of Israel created with the imprimatur of the interna¬tional community. Today  what do we see? Arrogance  self-righteous defiance  even a denial of faith and the human stirrings of the emotions that made Israel itself possible. The rest of the world is not against the State and people of Israel  but against the obdurate  inflex¬ible  short-sighted and misguided policies of the present Israeli leadership.151.	The present Israeli authorities  against massive international public opinion  have continued on their dangerous course of presenting the world with various faits accomplis—with the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and the extension of Israeli settle¬ments on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Those are measures which the Government of Sierra Leone totally rejects; I reiterate its condemnation.152.	Recent activities  by way of proposals to find a solution to the Middle East problem  will be enriched  be more acceptable and prove enduring if they are particularly faithful to the spirit of resolution 181 (II): namely  the need to have in Palestine both an Israeli State and a State for the Palestinians  both together  with other States in the area  living in peace and security. It is in that spirit that we welcome the recent proposals by Arab leaders at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference in Fez.153.	There is no magic formula for a solution to the Middle East problem; this  we submit  is the key to the problem  and a solution is not so impossible to achieve. AH that is required is vision  courage and flexibility on the part of Israel  for Israel cannot claim the right to live and deny that right to the Palestinians.154.	We take this opportunity to proffer to the Government and people of Lebanon our deep sympathy on the loss of lives and destruction to property it has been their lot to endure through historical and geographical circumstances  resulting directly from the lack of a satisfactory settlement to the Palestinian problem. And while we wish the new Government of Lebanon well  in the hope that it will consolidate the national unity of that country  we want to emphasize the necessity to preserve and observe the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon—and this applies particularly to Israel— and to reiterate our rejection and condemnation of Israel's recent activities in Lebanon  especially in Beirut.155.	Still on the subject of the Middle East  the situation in the Gulf continues to give cause for con¬cern. The Iranian-Iraqi conflict has intensified since the last session of the Assembly. We have witnessed another massive offensive recently by both parties to the conflict  in the mistaken belief that one side can impose its will by force of arms on the other. We renew our call on both parties to harken to the summons of peace by the international community  in various forums  and to arrive at a lasting soluhon to their problems.156.	A return to normalcy is yet to be achieved in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. This is because respect for and observance of the principles and purposes of the Organization are still to be achieved. We are con¬cerned over the inhuman conditions prevailing in those countries  resulting in the exodus of peaceful citizens to neighbouring States to seek refuge  a situation that has created in its wake  enormous social and economic problems for those countries. We reiterate cur belief that it is the imprescriptible right of the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to work out their own destinies without let or hindrance by foreign inter¬vention or domination.157.	My Government is concerned about the problem of divided nations  for we believe that a people can only realize its fullest potential in unity and peace. It is in that spirit  therefore  that the Government of Sierra Leone looks forward to the resumption of nego¬tiations aimed at a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. For we believe that in unity the valiant and historic people of the Korean peninsula will have greater contributions to make to our world in the search for solutions to our problems.158.	In the same vein  we hope that now that the intercommunal talks on Cyprus have resumed  and at an accelerated pace  there will soon emerge a formula for peace acceptable to both sides and in consonance with the territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus. We urge all those who can contribute to helping this process to do whatever they can to ensure its progress.159.	Even as we talk about the problems of divided nations  we are still confronted with peoples yearning to be free. A particular responsibility of the Organi¬zation in this regard is the accession of the people and Territory of Namibia to independence. When the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978)  we thought that we were on the eve of Namibia's inde¬pendence; but today  four years later  the process seems to be caught in the welter of negotiations that quite frankly do not have anything to do with the problem. The linkage of the presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the issue of Namibia's independence is  in our view  extraneous and quite unrelated to the issue of self-determination for the Territory of Namibia and the cessation of South Africa's illegal occupa¬tion thereof. This is all the more evident when it is recalled that almost from its inception the United Nations has been concerned about the fate of the Terri¬tory of Namibia  even long before Angola's indepen¬dence and well before the advent of Cuban troops therein.160.	Regrettably  the process of Namibia's accession to independence is  at one turn or the other  attended by delay  vacillation  subterfuge  and sometimes even plain double talk. It is the view of the Government of Sierra Leone that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the sole basis for the accession of Namibia to independence. Therefore  to bring in the question of the presence of foreign troops in neigh¬bouring territories is to us but a further betrayal of the goals which the authors of resolution 435 (1978) themselves postulated in the highest organ of the Organization.161.	This is also  sadly  a further manifestation of the departure from the goals we set ourselves which often compounds the problems of our world. Namibia must be free. We therefore want to take this oppor¬tunity to urge all States Members of the United Nations  especially the authors of resolution 435 (1978)  to help us and themselves keep faith with our common pledge to ensure that Namibia achieves inde¬pendence without further delay. Enough is enough.162.	In South Africa itself the racist Pretoria regime pursues with reckless abandon its policy of disregard for the revulsion felt by the rest of the international community at the abomination that is apartheid. The black majority of the inhabitants of that unhappy country continue to be denied in the daily round of their lives their very essence and dignity as human beings  simply on the score of the pigmentation of their skin. We have heard about recent moves even by the very practitioners and proponents of to temper its rigors and harshness. But the absurdity of the exercise explains its lukewarm reception  even by its supposed beneficiaries. I refer here to the so- called constitutional proposals for power-sharing by Indians and so-called Coloureds in a presidential council is a system which represents the negation of man's humanity and cannot be modified but must be wholly extirpated. In defiance of world public opinion  the Pretoria regime continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Today we stand helpless while the independent neigh¬bouring States fall victim to South Africa's predatory activities  acts of aggression  sabotage and destabilization.163.	Moreover  in furtherance of these despicable policies  South Africa resorts to brutal methods of political assassination  even against victims who take refuge from it in neighbouring countries.164.	Such activities cannot be allowed to go on unchallenged and unchecked. We therefore call for the comprehensive application of the provisions of Chap¬ter VII of the Charter  to remove the threat to interna¬tional peace and security that South Africa represents. For  without doubt  to allow South Africa to continue with abandon its depredations represents a further betrayal of that collective pledge we made to ""reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women"".165.	Even as the world is faced with a depressing and deteriorating political climate  we can draw no comfort from the burning economic problems which all coun¬tries  developed and developing  are going through. It is clear that the developing countries  by virtue of the fragility of their economic structures  have had to contend to a more serious degree with the devastating and far-reaching effects of global economic tremors. Evidence of this has come out with forceful emphasis and candor in successive reports on the current world economic situation by development and finan¬cial institutions.166.	For most  if not all developing countries  the prevailing economic circumstances can be referred to as a nightmare from which they cannot escape without immediate substantial assistance. Stagnant  and in some cases declining  economic growth  low productivity  poor and diminishing returns for in¬creasing export of their raw materials  high interest rates  diminishing financial flows from bilateral and multilateral sources  intolerable debt burdens running at some $600 billion and the cost of servicing this burden are fetters on an economic wheel that is gradually grinding to a halt in the third world  con¬demning thereby two thirds of our world to a life of misery and squalor.167.	Let it be recalled that one of the purposes and principles of the United Nations is that it should be a centre for the harmonization of the actions of nations in the achievement of international co-operation for the solution of various problems  particularly of an economic nature. This explains the relentless efforts within the halls and organs of the Organization to ensure the establishment of a new international eco¬nomic order.168.	When  three years ago  by General Assembly resolution 34/138  it was decided to launch the global round of negotiations  high hopes and expectations were aroused in the majority of mankind that at last the real problems of the world in such crucial areas as money and finance  trade and development and natural resources and energy were about to be grappled with in a meaningful and constructive manner and within a more comprehensive framework of mutual interests  underscoring the aspirations of both rich and poor nations.169.	Unfortunately  those hopes and expectations have so far not been realized  even though at the International Meeting on Co-operation and Develop¬ment at Cancun last year commitments were made at the highest political level by a cross-section of the international community. We wish to emphasize here and now our earnest belief that it is time that the global negotiations were got under way.170.	We appeal to and urge all countries not to allow short-term and ephemeral national interests to spoil the chances of these global negotiations. My coun¬try  for its part  is ready and willing to do everything in its power to promote understanding and co-operation between all nations  North and South  East and West  in order to contribute towards the establishment of a new and just international economic order from which all countries  developed and developing  will assuredly stand to benefit.171.	As the sixth session of UNCTAD approaches  ft is our earnest hope that Member States will work towards conducting meaningful exchanges in that forum and the adoption of effective decisions that will enhance our collective well-being. We have no doubt that the agenda which has been adopted will render such discourse possible.172.	On behalf of the delegation of Sierra Leone I take this opportunity to thank the Government and people of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for generously agreeing to host that session.173.	With regard to the forthcoming ministerial ses¬sion of GATT  it is my delegation's firm belief that that organization can serve as an effective instrument of economic advancements and as a catalyst for interna¬tional trade  particularly in the developing countries. We therefore hope that the forthcoming session will give positive consideration to such topical issues as protectionism and structural adjustment  preferential trade treatment and trade in commodities  with the aim of finding more acceptable and just solutions to these problems. My country will endeavor to play its own part in this respect.174.	One of the most urgent problems requiring solution  particularly in Africa  is related to the produc¬tion of adequate  secure and sustained food supplies for that continent's growing population and the development of agriculture in general. It is significant that  while the world food situation is generally said to have taken a turn for the better  the only exception in this happy trend is Africa. No one can deny the will and readiness of all African countries to find solu¬tions to their food and agricultural difficulties. However  with the greatest number of poor and least developed countries  Africa cannot succeed in doing this alone without sufficient aid from the international community. With an annual population growth estimated at 2.5 per cent  a decline in food production of 1.2 per cent in the 1970s and an even worse projec¬tion for the 1980s  Africa and the international com¬munity will be required to mobilize tremendous resources in order to arrive at solutions commensurate with the seriousness of the issue and the magnitude of the task.175.	One common denominator in all the economic issues I have highlighted is the need to translate our avowed commitment to the principles of interna¬tional co-operation and development into practical measures to make such co-operation meaningful and productive. In this connection  my Government has noted with considerable disappointment the downward trend in the flow of financial resources  both bilateral and multilateral  particularly over the last few years  to development agencies such as the World Bank and UNDP.176.	This tendency weakens the effectiveness of those bodies  on which many developing countries depend for supplementary resources in their struggle for survival and social and economic progress. Further  it puts in doubt the well-accepted norm of friendly multilateral co-operation  the linchpin of which has  over the years  been the provision of financial grants and concessionary loans by the developed to the developing countries  not out of charity but out of enlightened self-interest  based on our interde¬pendence.t44177.	The role which agencies like UNDP  FAO  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank  to name but a few  are playing in the fight against poverty  malnutrition  ignorance and the omnibus problems of underdevelopment  cannot be over-emphasized. It therefore behoves all nations  big and small  in a position to do so to reawaken in themselves that spirit of internationalism which for a long time characterized the ideals of international co¬operation and adopt measures that will strengthen the fabric of United Nations agencies for co-operation for development  and at the same time give true meaning to the noble concept of friendly relations among nations.178.	My delegation considers it appropriate to high¬light once again the crucial role which we believe multilateral financial institutions such as the Interna¬tional Monetary Fund [IMF] and the World Bank and their affiliated agencies can play in the establish¬ment of social justice and international peace and security  given the right kind of understanding and appreciation of all the issues at stake in their bid to help developing countries.179.	However  it seems somewhat unreasonable to suggest that the only way to cure the ills of developing nations  which by nature and often because of factors outside their control are weak  is to administer to them medicinal doses which have more debilitating and sometimes destructive effects. It is therefore our candid hope that these institutions will continue to review their policies and practices towards countries which stand in need of their aid  with particular reference to the individual circumstances and situa¬tions peculiar to these countries.180.	A review of the world economic situation would not be complete without reference to some of the issues which are of immense importance for the acceleration of growth  not only in the developing countries but in the world as a whole. The international community  including the specialized agencies of the United Nations system and non governmental orga¬nizations  should be unrelenting in their search for practical solutions in the fields of health  science and technology for development  the environment  industrialization  new and renewable sources of energy  population control  and development and economic co-operation among developing countries.181.	It is gratifying to note that all these questions appear as items on the agenda of this session. We hope that they will be attended by free  fair and frank exchanges in the interest of restructuring and revi¬talizing the global economy to our collective benefit.182.	At the 10th meeting of the thirty-sixth session I acknowledged that some time ago the Assembly had  with wisdom  recognized the need to give par¬ticular attention to the most economically dis¬advantaged States in the international community  which have come to be known euphemistically as the least-developed countries. The prospects of these States  even in the midst of booming prosperity in other parts of the world  became at best uncertain and their very survival precarious. It is most depressing and self-defeating to acknowledge that the number of such States continues to increase  whatever the criteria applied. I am forced to report that in Sierra Leone our economic situation has worsened  the purchasing power of our exports has progressively diminished and there has been  in real terms  a reversal against us in both the terms and the balance of our trade with our trading partners. All this made it necessary for the Economic and Social Council to take a long hard look at cur situation and  in its resolution 1982/41  to recommend that Sierra Leone be classified as a least-developed country. I want to take this opportunity here  if I may  to commend the Council's recommendation for approval at the appropriate time  and to express the hope that  given the resilience of the Sierra Leonean people  coupled with the concerted efforts of their Government and with the co-operation of the international community  this classification may be only temporary.183.	After some eight years of negotiations  we note with satisfaction that the Third United Nations Con-ference on the Law of the Sea will it is hoped  be brought safe home to harbor this year with the meeting of plenipotentiaries to sign the Convention on the Law of the Sea.^ This document  which has been painstakingly negotiated  represents a new order for the oceans and reassuringly demonstrates that with co-operation and goodwill the United Nations can and  indeed  should be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the rationalization of the rules and procedures that should govern the management  exploitation and use not only of this important aspect of our environment  but of other facets of our lives as well.184.	The successful completion of this venture has not only enhanced the reality of international co-operation  but it should also—and rightly so—advance the prospects for global co-operation in other vital areas of our one world. It is in this spirit that we would reiterate our appeal to the Government of the United States to stay with the rest of the international com¬munity and to approve this important instrument.185.	In the face of the unhappy world political and economic situation in which we find ourselves today  all nations—large and small  rich and poor—are indissolubly linked. It is now therefore more pressing than ever before that we answer the summons to international peace and co-operation in its various aspects. In this venture  all the nations of the world should reaffirm their resolve to adhere to the spirit and essence of the United Nations. When all is said and done  the United Nations symbolizes mankind's efforts at pursuing a better world order. The path to the attainment of that goal has often been rugged  tedious and sometimes almost impassable. Never-theless  mankind has been persistent in its endeavors to pursue undaunted  within this edifice  its quest for peace  security and economic well-being. For we realize that it is only within the United Nations that we all  together  can hope to achieve a peaceful and affluent world. For its part  the Government of Sierra Leone  here and now  pledges itself anew to uphold the principles and objectives of the Organization."
"123",6293,"SLV",37,1982,"First of all  Mr. President  I wish to convey to you my most sincere congratulations on your assumption of your office at this thirty- seventh session of the General Assembly. I also wish to express my Government's and my own pleasure at the good work done so tirelessly by the Secretary- General since the day he assumed the lofty and important responsibilities of his office. We are certain that his sound knowledge  his broad judgement  his sensitivity and his experience are and will continue to be positive factors that  together with his realistic outlook  will lead to the accomplishment of the mission entrusted to the Organization by the peoples of the world.I should now like to present the general foreign policy views of the Government of National Unity  which I represent. Beginning in 1979  El Salvador took the first steps towards the establishment of appropriate and effective mechanisms to make the frequently postponed process of social  economic and political change a reality; to enable the great majority of the population to enjoy better living conditions  democracy and social justice; to bring about effective enjoyment of human rights by the exercise of self- determination; in short  to enable Salvadorian society to improve its overall way of life. Now  as then  my Government is engaged in a hard struggle to reduce the numbers of people living in or on the borderline of poverty  while also attempting to establish new structures with the sole purpose of fostering the development of the human person.The entire world already clearly recognizes the scope of the structural reforms my Government has undertaken  particularly agrarian reform  which has been termed the most thorough ever undertaken in the Americas  and the nationalization of banking and foreign trade. At the same time  we are undergoing a political  democratic  participatory and pluralistic process the legitimacy of which was confirmed when  on 28 March this year  our country entered into history through the open door of elections held under the scrutiny of observers from more than 50 countries  recognized international organizations and institutions and some 300 foreign journalists. On that day  before the eyes of a world that was half indifferent and half amazed  the people of El Salvador rejected violence  totalitarianism and terrorism and opted for the exercise of self-determination by peaceful and rational means as a solution to our many problems. The country chose the formula of pluralism and a multi-party system. The present Government thus joined the political forces that represent 92 per cent of the electorate and  acting in keeping with the aspirations of the people  adopted the basic platform of government known as the Pact of Apaneca  which emerged from the common objectives of the various political parties as expressed in the electoral campaign. Those basic objectives are peace  democratization  human rights  the consolidation of social reforms  the establishment of a climate of institutional and juridical confidence  the strengthening of international relations and economic recovery.Naturally  since we are aware that good declarations are the framework of great actions  and that at the present time pragmatic steps that can achieve visible results are called for  my Government has set up three commissions: a political commission  a peace commission and a human rights commission. The Political Commission  which is made up  infer of the forces that were proved most representative by the elections  is designed to bring a greater dynamism to the democratic process  to ensure its effective implementation and to adopt the necessary measures for the implementation of the Government's basic platform. The Peace Commission seeks the attainment of peace in a social climate that will enable all Salvadorians to live  work and fulfil themselves as human beings through national reconciliation  the abandonment of sectarian attitudes and the channeling of political interests along an institutional path. It also proposes the solutions necessary to bring about lasting harmony and social stability. The Human Rights Commission serves as an instrument for the protection  promotion and maintenance of human rights in the broadest sense and recommends appropriate measures for the effective attainment of human rights.To give an example of the way in which these commissions operate  I am able to announce that the Political Commission has prepared a timetable which includes deadlines for important political events  among them the holding of presidential and municipal elections on 28 March 1984 at the latest. We hope that in these elections all political sectors will be represented  without distinction as to ideological or political views. It is clear that we are moving forward along the path leading to peace  harmony  justice and national unity.A/37/PV.28We must emphasize that the overall solution to the problem in El Salvador is not to be found in El Salvador alone  since everybody knows that there is a general situation of conflict in Central America which gives rise to fresh tension and fosters old tension  making it difficult for any political project to be viable and stable. In this connection  the existence of various political projects designed to meet and overcome the conditions resulting from underdevelopment at the social  political and economic levels gives rise to tension and conflict when there is an attempt to give one priority over the other  and in certain sectors this nurtures the illusion that the concepts are mutually exclusive. Thus  when there is interventionist behaviour  regional peace is endangered in Central America.On the other hand  the situation in the region is not isolated from the serious disorders in the international monetary system  the high rates of unemployment  excessive protectionism and the many other negative symptoms  all of which the Central American subregion is encountering in its own social and political crisis.Thus it is that there will be no peace in Central America if the arms race continues; there will be no peace if the traffic in arms continues; there will be no peace as long as people continue   to support armed groups which seek to overthrow established Governments; there will be no peace if there is no respect for the right of peoples to self-determination; there will be no peace if people do not reject overt or covert foreign intervention; there will be no peace if there is no respect for ideological pluralism; there will be no peace if unfair social and economic structures are not eliminated; there will be no peace if democratic institutions are not strengthened and if human rights are not fully exercised. In sum  there will be no peace if people do not have faith and work for peace.Through the introduction of political interests alien to Central America  which derive from confrontations on a larger scale  countries of the region tend to perpetuate our problems and to play the game of the merchants of war. If we do not begin to formulate ideas which lead to harmony based on trust  cooperation  our common origin  our common geography and our common destiny  our peoples can begin to write their own obituary-unless men of good will devote themselves with great enthusiasm to the quest for peace. As long as there is no peaceful coexistence  as long as there is no respect for the principles of the self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  as long as base foreign interests influence the behavior of some countries in the region  stability  peace  democracy  development and social justice will be beyond our reach.That is why I pledge the good will of my Government in the efforts to achieve that peace  which is the first and the essential factor in the attainment of the other conditions in which the well-being of the peoples can increase. For the same reason  it is essential that Central American countries adopt consistent policies to limit armament and military equipment; that end all traffic in arms; that we neither accept provocation nor harass a neighbor; for we are all entitledto organize ourselves at the social  economic and political levels in the manner determined by the sovereign will of our peoples. My appeal  the appeal of my people and of my Government  is for the establishment of democracy  the full enjoyment of human rights  the rule of social justice and peace  tolerance and brotherhood among the peoples of Central America.Aware of the fact that ideological pluralism must be the philosophy which inspires our Government so as to make possible the free interplay of ideas and thus the promotion of democracy  our domestic position can be reflected at the international level only by an attitude of respect for the struggles of the third world countries  which find expression in political forums such as those of the Group of 77 and the non-aligned movement. In the latter  El Salvador retains its observer status  bearing in mind the origin and the true doctrine which led to its foundation. Thus we wish to stand aloof from East-West confrontations so as to facilitate progress along our true path to development  while we strengthen our freedom  our independence and our sovereignty.There is no doubt that so far in 1982 situations of conflict have arisen which have led to serious breaches of world peace. Some of those conflicts started a long time ago; others have emerged in more recent times and situations.Certainly the behavior of the super-Powers in their mutual relations as well as with regard to countries that are within their respective spheres of influence has left much to be desired when it comes to the quest for peace. Such situations lead only to greater conflict  increasing suspicion and the stepping up of the arms race.Historical experience of relations between nations convinces us that no country remains indifferent to a disproportionate increase in a neighbor's arsenal  although the latter may claim threats to its territorial integrity as an excuse. Even an endless arms buildup cannot alter the absurdity of that argument. That is why  in principle  the technological and economic gap between the developed and the developing countries must be closed  especially when developing countries are poor in financial and investment resources.The question arises as to whether this might be a legitimate need in terms of security  and the answer is obviously that it is not. The pretense of absolute security when dealing with a super-Power is either an absurdity in itself or a pretext for extending hegemonistic designs. The irrational arms buildup is offensive in its internal effects on the poor countries  a source of concern for the wiser and more prudent statesmen of the peoples living in the relevant region and sows the seed of discord. National situations which are exacerbated demagogically from outside and international tension provoked by the extremist policies of ideological unilateralism which denies pluralism constitute an explosive mixture which  unless action is taken  could set the region ablaze.We recognize that the process of change in societies becomes irreversible both nationally and internationally and that the strategy to be followed is not to fight against the march of history but rather to adapt existing institutions to the necessary and inevitable change. But  if we have firm conviction and faith in the destiny of Central America  we can overcome our differences with a view to adopting  by mutual agreement  methods which  without sacrificing our vital interests  would allow harmonious coexistence in the region  bearing in mind that the peoples are those who  in the final analysis  will define and determine their own destiny.In this sensitive and complicated context  the Governments of Costa Rica  Honduras and El Salvador established in San Jose  Costa Rica  on 19 January 1982  the Central American Democratic Community  a noble integration initiative based on the common historical destiny resulting from an identity of ideals  unswerving devotion to democracy  recognition of the economic and social interdependence of our peoples and the firm will to resolve  in a coordinated manner and on a basis of solidarity  the social  political and economic problems which beset Central America.We wish to express cur disappointment at the results of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which dealt particularly with the problems of nuclear armament and the dangers this poses at the present stage of history. Peoples all over the world  although they have certainly been more vocal in certain regions than in others  have clearly expressed their commitment to peace and their rejection of any atomic confrontation  however limited.Recent events in Lebanon  including the reprehensible massacre in the refugee camps  constitute a clear call to seek  by means of new political formulas  a lasting and just agreement in regard to the Palestinian problem  which continues to be at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The absence of an overall solution in the Middle East constitutes a permanent threat to world peace. We believe that President Reagan's proposal  which was made known on 1 September  is truly intended to lead to a viable and just formula. There is no doubt that  because of the influence the United States has on events relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict  the initiative of the United States President represents a step towards the solution of the problem and therefore towards the achievement of peace in the Middle East. This initiative is also in keeping with the letter and the spirit of Camp David. In the circumstances we cannot but applaud such a praiseworthy proposal  which points in the right direction.I need not repeat that my country condemns the acquisition of territories by force regardless of the method used to that end but we also believe that the formal existence of the State of Israel must be recognized and also its right to live  free from all threats or pressures  within its own boundaries. This is a legitimate aspiration  and equally legitimate is the aspiration of the Palestinian people to establish its own State.We must also refer to the question of Lebanon. After the trials that this nation has experienced  the international community must see to it that Lebanon enjoys full sovereignty  eliminating from its territory all foreign military forces regardless of the pretext that may be used for remaining there  and restoring to it  as an independent country  complete control and jurisdiction over its territory. In other words  Lebanon should be allowed to exercise all the attributes of a sovereign State  capable of rejecting foreign intervention or occupation. El Salvador  which does not and never will permit interference by foreign troops in its territory  supports any international initiative designed to enable Lebanon  as a free and independent State  to achieve its political unity and territorial integrity.The agenda of this session of the General Assembly again includes the question of Cyprus  which has been debated for many years. Thus the international community is justly concerned over reaching a definitive agreement. We have taken note with satisfaction of the continued efforts of the Secretary-General and his missions of good offices with a view to promoting talks between the two communities  a mechanism which so far has proved the best vehicle for solving the problem in a concerted manner. We must recognize in this case that UNFICYP has fully carried out its basic mission of maintaining and preserving the necessary climate of political tranquility to enable the talks between the Turkish and Cypriot communities to be successful.We also wish to express our concern over the continued war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. This international conflict has demonstrated the impotence of the United Nations. Had we not known that the Security Council had discussed the matter and that the Secretariat had made renewed efforts to resolve the dispute by peaceful means  we would say that the entire machinery set up by the Charter to end international disputes was a dead letter. How much longer will war between those two nations continue without the international community stopping it? The conduct of those two countries has undoubtedly increased scepticism about the Organization.Afghanistan continues to be a source of tension for the international community. So long as the Afghan people is unable to determine its own future  free from the flagrant intervention represented by the presence of almost 100 000 Soviet soldiers  in violation of the most basic principles of the Charter  there will be no just political solution.That situation has its counterpart in the occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese troops  which has harmed the peace efforts in the entire region of South-east Asia. An agreement to end this abnormal state of affairs should be sought in the light of the tenets of the Charter. The withdrawal of foreign troops is a prerequisite  because the United Nations was created precisely to prevent such gross violations of international peace and security.El Salvador condemns in the strongest terms racial discrimination  which has become the normal practice in the Government of South Africa. The world's conscience has condemned apartheid which is the antithesis of humanism. Therefore  cannot be reconciled with the values of equity and harmonious coexistence. It is a link in the chain of causes of the intermittent outbursts of violence which have been manifestations of protest and rebelliousness against a clearly unjust state of affairs. That is why we shall continue to co-operate in the United Nations efforts to bring South Africa to respect the universally accepted standards of the Charter.The other question affecting southern Africa is related to South Africa's behavior in Namibia. Through the United Nations  the international community has promoted a framework for a solution by which Namibia may attain its independence. To date South Africa has been able  through subterfuge  to undermine a political settlement  thus continuing its illegal occupation of the territory. What is more  the territory has been used to launch continuous acts of aggression. Therefore  efforts should be redoubled to remove obstacles and bring about the prompt liberation of the people of Namibia  thus eliminating another source of tension which is poisoning international  including East-West  relations.At the global level  the United Nations will continue to be an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises and ending conflicts  if we collectively renew our faith in it. But its institutional machinery should not be .abused by diverting it towards propaganda  for the benefit of sectarian interests  in the knowledge that such action would be aimed not at the solution of problems but  rather  at a temporary effect on public opinion.Nevertheless  the threat to the United Nations as an institution is even greater when it is given competence in the domestic affairs of States  simply because these issues are linked with ideological trends. In that case  the possible influence of the Organization would be an obstacle to overcoming problems whose only solution should lie  because of its character and nature  in the hands of the people of the country  which knows its own situation better than anyone. The artificiality of giving an international character to national situations clashes with the essential principle of the self-determination of peoples. I do not need to say that in giving such situations that artificial character the interventionist interests at work violate the principle of non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States.I turn to another matter-the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It has been an exercise in patient negotiation in an attempt to reconcile very varied interests. For that reason alone  it is logical to say that no State could be completely satisfied. How far have legitimate expectations been expressed in the final text which has now been adopted? In our view that is the question which all States are asking themselves. On their answer will depend the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  an international instrument governing the norms and laws of the seas  including the sea-bed. The vote on 30 April this year shows that this international instrument commands wide acceptance.Peace and development: these are two key words. Economic conflicts  such as the North-South confrontation affect international relations just as the hotbeds of political tension do. In that context  we all know that the question of global negotiations was reexamined by the General Assembly at its eleventh special session  just as it was at the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth sessions  without progress being made. ' I do not believe that we should waste time by futilely apportioning blame for the lack of progress. Rather  we must emphasize the need to break out of this impasse  which has hurt economic relations between developed and developing countries so much.The great family of the Americas has so far this year given two exceptional examples of solidarity  to which I wish to refer because of the great significance of joint  simultaneous action which presages the better days of which the Liberator Simon Bolivar dreamt. I refer  in chronological order  to the valuable and emotional-but none the less objective-backing which El Salvador's process of democratization received from the overwhelming majority of brother countries of Latin America  gathered at a meeting of the Organization of American States in Castries  Saint Lucia. Thanks largely to that support  the elections of 28 March this year were transformed from ideals into reality.The other demonstration of hemispheric solidarity was on behalf of the sister Republic of Argentina  arising out of the stubborn persistence of an obsolete colonialism. I am referring to the Malvinas Islands. My Government supports Argentina's aspirations to achieve full exercise of its sovereignty over the islands  on the basis not only of hemispheric solidarity and of law  but also on the basis of the principles contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). In keeping with these principles  El Salvador has supported  still supports and will continue to support the process of decolonization everywhere in the world. In reaffirming its commitment to peace  El Salvador urges the parties involved to seek the means available through international law to put an end to the dispute  in particular by recourse to negotiation.Today we celebrate the discovery of America. Irrespective of polemics  legends or the myths of ""popular history"" concerning who was the first navigator to sight American coasts and where he came from  what is certain is that Columbus and Spain represent a symbol: the symbol of the faith and the value of a man  the symbol of the faith and the value of a kingdom.Like the peoples of bygone days  the peoples of today are witness to incredible feats  which are not unworthy of the great epics recorded and transmitted by history.However  to our shame  the peoples today  just as those of bygone days  continue to witness remnants of colonialism that defy the trend of history  provocations  hegemonism  aggression and exploitation. While it is true that mankind has made prodigious technological advances in its organization  procedures  aspirations and psychology  there yet remains something akin to that mankind which once lived in caves.It is imperative for us to bring technological development into line with social development  and vice versa. It is imperative for us to break away from that absurd contradiction of a human race that has not changed much since the Stone Age  with a technology that takes the elements of war into outer space. It is imperative for us  for mankind  to recognize the false steps that are taking us to the edge of the abyss. It is imperative for us all to remember that the victories of peace are nobler and more desirable than the victories of war."
"124",6365,"SOM",37,1982,"I wish to extend  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  warm congratulations to Mr. Hollai on his well-deserved election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His accession to this high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and wide knowledge and experience of international affairs. I assure him of my delegation's co-operation in the months ahead. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Kittani on the wisdom and competence he displayed in guiding the debates of the thirty-sixth session  and to express our gratitude for his devoted service to the work of the General Assembly. It is a pleasure for me to pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General  whose first year in office has been particularly difficult. He has faced the challenges of his office with courage  realism and persistence. By his efforts on behalf of world peace and the authority of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar has shown himself to be worthy of the great responsibility upon his shoulders.219. As the General Assembly takes stock once again of the world situation  there can be little cause for satisfaction over the state of international"" affairs. Whether we consider the proliferation of dangerous regional conflicts or the inability of the United Nations to maintain peace and security through collective action  the outlook is not encouraging.220. In the Middle East  the Horn of Africa  southern Africa  Afghanistan and South-East Asia and in the recent Falkland (Malvinas) Islands dispute  the United Nations has not been able to fulfil its most fundamental purposes of peace-making and peace-keeper. In many cases when people suffering from injustice  oppression and foreign domination turn to the United Nations for redress  basing their hopes on the provisions of the221. After nearly four decades of experience in using the Charter as the legal standard governing inter-national relations  the wisdom and validity of its principles remain incontestable. However  its wide  global objectives continue to be subordinated to narrowly conceived national interests. In our view  this is the cause of the current breakdown in inter-national law and order. Unless Member States address themselves seriously and sincerely to this dilemma  they cannot hope to achieve workable solutions to222.	In the Middle East Israel's denial of Palestinian rights is the driving force behind its lawless and barbarous devastation of Lebanon. International anarchy is nowhere so rampant as in this area  where Israel has shown that there are no limits to its con-tempt for international law and its callous inhumanity. Not content with denying Palestinian rights  the Israelis are seeking to exterminate the Palestinians themselves. In pursuit of their final solution to the problem they have launched a criminal aggression against a sovereign State  and they have had no qualms about the destruction of cities through saturation bombing and the killing and maiming of thousands of civilians  including women and children  by the use of vicious phosphorous and anti-personnel cluster bombs.223.	The recent massacres in the Shatila and Sabra camps in west Beirut have confronted us with horrors similar to those of the holocaust of the Second World War. Israel cannot escape responsibility for aiding  and abetting the perpetration of the crimes against the defenceless civilians of those camp-rimes which have been strongly condemned by the entire world community. Israel has in the past claimed in inter-national forums that its actions stem from a special religious and moral authority. Are we now asked to believe that the wanton destruction of life and property in Lebanon was carried out at the dictate of a just Creator  or that tragedies of the past which have no bearing on the Middle East justify Israel's expansionist greed and genocidal policies?224. My Government hopes that the General Assembly will be uncompromising in its condemnation of Israel for the carnage in Lebanon and will also be vigilant in opposing any Israeli attempts at imposing new faits accomplis with regard to Lebanese territory. It must demand Israel's 'immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal from Lebanon.225.	The General Assembly must also keep inter-national public opinion focused on Israel's arrogant annexations of Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem. It must be reaffirmed that the status of the city  which is sacred to Moslems and Christians as well as to Jews  cannot be unilaterally determined. The increased level of persecution in the West Bank and Gaza and the defiant escalation of the illegal settlement policy must also continue to be strongly condemned. .226.	The failure of the Security Council in the past to take effective measures against Israel for its violations of international law certainly encouraged the Israeli Government to believe that it could flout any international convention  commit any act of aggression or carry out any atrocity with impunity. It is more than time for it to be disabused of this belief. Israel has undoubtedly breached the peace of the Middle East and threatened world peace and security. Its outright rejection of all proposals which could serve as a basis for negotiations shows that it has turned its back on peace and that it plans to continue with is expansionism at any cost. In our view  if the Security Council is to maintain any credibility and authority in world affairs it must be prepared to take significant action  including the imposition of sanctions  in order to check Israel's dangerous and irresponsible course.227. The tragic conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran is another unfortunate reflection of our troubled times. My Government sincerely I hopes that the ongoing mediation efforts will succeed in the difficult and sensitive task of bringing an end to this conflict which has destabilized the Gulf area. Somalia adds its voice to the appeals of other Member States for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the start of negotiations which would ensure a return to peace and amity in the region.228. The problems of southern Africa have always involved the fundamental principles of the Charter and over the years have increasingly threatened regional and international peace and security. These problems remain acute in spite of the fact that the struggle against South Africa's racist and colonial policies is in its final stages. .229.	Unfortunately  the Pretoria regime is encouraged by the continued political  economic and military support of its main trading partners to intensify its racist oppression in South Africa  to remain illegally in Namibia and to attempt to dominate the southern African region through military aggression  political pressure and economic subversion. Clearly  the General Assembly must reiterate its call for unremitting efforts by the world community to eliminate apartheid and to enable the United Nations to carry out its legal responsibility for leading Namibia to independence.230.	Within South Africa the racist policies of the apartheid system are being applied with ever- increasing severity as the liberation struggle gains in effectiveness and strength. The legitimacy of that struggle cannot be over-emphasized. In the long history of the uprising of peoples against tyrannical and colonial forms of oppression  revolutionary wars have been fought for much less pressing reasons than the degrading inhumanity of apartheid.231.	The liberation movements within and outside South Africa deserve the strongest moral  material and political support for their efforts to regain the human dignity and fundamental right of the majority of the population. As for South Africa's ruling minority  it should be ostracized and isolated until it is prepared to take steps to establish a just society.232.	In the case of Namibia the salient factor is the illegality of South Africa's presence in the Territory  a status determined by the International Court of Justice and Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which remains the only valid basis for a settlement. It is now four years since South Africa began its machinations aimed at obstructing Namibia's independence. No longer can the international community tolerate South Africa's bad faith  its oppressive domination of the Namibian people and its brutal war against their liberation movement under the leadership of SWAPO.233. My Government sincerely hopes that the current optimism over the prospect of a Namibian settlement is justified. However  in view of South Africa's past performance we believe that the General Assembly must not fail to remind the five Western States of their commitment to independence for Namibia as speedily as possible. In our view  there will be little progress on Namibia or on other southern African issues unless South Africa is made to understand General Assembly-Thirty-seventh Session-Plenary Meetings that it will certainly face comprehensive economic sanctions if it continues its intransigent  aggressive and inhuman policies.234. The growing use of brute force as an instrument of foreign policy is disturbingly evident in the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Afghanistan  a small non-aligned State  and in its attempt to crush the resistance of the proud and courageous Afghan people. The same super-Power which invokes in the United Nations the doctrine of the non-use of force in international relations is responsible for the loss of thousands of innocent lives at the hands of its invading forces  for the devastation of Afghanistan's economy and for the creation of one of the world's largest refugee populations.235. The ruthless nature of this war is further illustrated by the use of Afghanistan as a testing ground for forms of chemical warfare long condemned as barbarous by the international community. The General assembly must continue to keep the plight of Afghanistan before the attention of the world and to stand firmly by its resolutions and those of the Security Council which call for the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country.236. The presence of foreign troops in Democratic Kampuchea is another example of the subversion of national independence through foreign domination. Here again military aggression and alien rule have given rise to a tragic refugee situation and to chronic tension and conflict. My Government hopes that the efforts of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other States to ensure the restoration of legitimacy and national independence in Democratic Kampuchea will be successful and that the constructive proposals made at the recent International Conference on Kampuchea will be fruitful. A political settlement would undoubtedly have far-reaching effects on the peace and stability of the whole South-East Asian region.237. Since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) on the Indian Ocean  serious obstacles have been placed in the way of implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace by Soviet military intervention in the affairs of the countries of the region and in their local conflicts. Moreover  with the military and naval forces of the  Soviet Union firmly entrenched in bases provided to it by certain regional States  there has been a steady deterioration in the stability and security of the countries of the region. These dangerous developments have set the stage for the escalation of super-Power confrontation and military rivalry in the Indian Ocean. It is  therefore  more important than ever for Member States to reaffirm their commitment to the principles enshrined in resolution 2832 (XXVI) and to the provisions of the Final Document of the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.238. In supporting these principles and provisions my delegation places particular emphasis on the dismantling of all foreign bases and the withdrawal of all foreign forces  including surrogate troops  from the regional and on the obligation of the regional States to settle disputes with one another by peaceful means  on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter.239. The Horn of Africa  my own area  continues to be affected by tension and conflict  not because of territorial or boundary disputes  as Ethiopian propaganda would have the international community believe  but because of the denial of the right to self-determination by the colonial regime of Ethiopia to its subject peoples of Western Somalia and of Eretria.. The importance of this right is emphasized in Chapter I  Article 2  of the Charter  which directs the United-Nations to develop friendly relations among States based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the right to self-determination of peoples.240. The grave regional and international repercussions of the denial of those rights continue to trouble the Horn of Africa. The exodus of the hundreds of thousands who fled from persecutions and oppression to take refuge in Somalia and other neighbouring countries involved great human suffering  placed intolerable burdens on host countries and continues today to be a disaster situation calling for humanitarian assistance from the international community.241. My Government's overriding concern in its approach to the problems of Ethiopian colonialism is that the peoples of Western Somalia and Eritrea be allowed to exercise the rights guaranteed under General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). Certainly  if the European colonial Powers had opposed the freedom struggle in Africa with the same arguments which Ethiopia continues to advance today to explain its continued occupation of Western Somalia  very few colonial peoples would have been able to take advantage of the provisions of resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).242. It is important for the world community to understand that until the 1890s when the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik joined the European Powers in their scramble for Africa  the people of Western Somalia enjoyed an independent existence and controlled their own affairs. It was in the course of MeneJik's presumptuous attempt to extend the Ethiopian Empire from Khartoum to Lake Nyanza that the Ogaden was brutally seized.243. Unfortunately  it served the interests of the colonial Powers to support Menelik's territorial ambitions  and in typical imperialist fashion illegal treaties purporting to transfer Somali territory to the Ethiopian Empire were concluded-without the knowledge of the people of Western Somalia. It was particularly ironic that the supposed authority for transferring Somali territory was the series of treaties between the colonial Powers and Somali chiefs which guaranteed that the Somali people would be protected by those same Powers and that their territory would not be ceded to any other Power.244. It should be noted that Ethiopia was unable to exercise sovereignty over an area which was clearly outside its normal political  cultural and ethnic influence until after the Second World War  and in some instances as recently as 1955. During the Halo Abyssinian war of 1935-1936 Western Somalia was occupied by Italy. Shortly afterwards the British conquered former Italian Somaliland and Western Somaliaand  together with Somali territories already under British colonialism  virtually all of Somaliland was united under a single colonial Power. In ""1942 Britain restored Ethiopian sovereignty in Ethiopia proper which it had captured from Italy during the war  but it retained the administration of Western Somalia. Unfortunately  the inhabitants of the territory were once again betrayed by the British Government and transferred against their will to Ethiopian rule in 1948 and 1955.245.	I take the liberty of recounting these historical facts not only to refresh the memory of representatives present in the Assembly but also to underscore the fact that the Territory of Western Somalia is no different from other Territories which have since the Second World War benefited from the process of decolonization in recognition of the universal principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and national independence  as enshrined in the Charter. It is the denial ofthat right by the Empire State of Ethiopia which is at the root of the conflict in the Horn of Africa.246.	As I have already stated  Ethiopian colonial repression has generated refugees numbering millions. In Somalia alone there are 700 000 persons in camps and a similar number are living among the population all over the country. Unless the problem of Western Somalia is resolved on the basis of the exercise of self-determination by the people of Western Somalia  the refugees will not be able to return to their homes in safety and honour  and there is every likelihood that their presence in Somalia and other countries of the Horn of Africa besides constituting a grave danger for the peace and security of the region will also take on a permanent character necessitating continued relief aid and assistance by the international community. The dangerous situation already existing in the Horn of Africa  owing to colonialist Ethiopia's policies of repression and genocide at its denial of the right to self-determination to the people of Western Somalia-and  indeed  to the other subject peoples within the Empire State of Ethiopia such as Eritrea  Oromia and Tigray-has been further aggravated by that country's wanton invasion of the territory of the Somali Democratic Republic since 1 July of this year.247. As representatives are no doubt aware  my Government has addressed several communications to States Members of the United Nations regarding this invasion and has given details of the nature and extent of the unprovoked aggression  in which tanks and armoured personnel carriers  long-range artillery and fighter bombers  supplied to Ethiopia in massive quantities by a super-Power have been deployed. Heavily armed Ethiopian infantry brigades. supported by foreign forces  have managed to cross the de facto border-at one point as deep as 32 kilometers in an effort to cut the important arterial road which links the southern and northern parts of the Somali Democratic Republic in order to disrupt a major lifeline of our country. The town of Galdogob and the village of Blambal1e have been captured and Galcayo  the regional capital of Mudug  has been subjected to several aerial attacks by MIG-23s.248. Somalia has opposed this invasion of its sovereignty and territorial integrity in conformity with its right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter and has so far repelled further incursions into its territory. Unfortunately  both sides have stuttered heavy casualties and considerable damage has been caused to property in those areas of my country which have been attacked.249. Ethiopia has attempted to spread the fiction that its forces are not responsible for this naked act of aggression against Somali territory. However  the recorded statements of deserters and prisoners  along with captured documents in Russian and Amharic  substantiate beyond any shadow of doubt that it is the Ethiopian army which has undertaken the large-scale aggression mounted against my country.250. The use of T-55 tanks  MIG-23s  armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery  much of them new and complete with Soviet operation manuals dated 1982 and bearing Ethiopian military insignia is indisputable evidence  of Ethiopia's direct responsibility for its invasion.251. It is ironic that the major Ethiopian air base at Gode in occupied Ogaden. from which Ethiopian planes make their murderous attacks on the Somali population  is the same airport which the Ethiopian regime requested the United Nations  through a report of the Secretary-General of 12 September 1980 8 to finance and reconstruct  supposedly as a centre for humanitarian missions in the area.252. The international community has strongly condemned Ethiopia for its invasion of my country -its shameless denials notwithstanding. By way of example  the 69th Inter-Parliamentary Conference. which was held in Rome in September. strongly condemned Ethiopia's invasion and called for  among other things  the immediate  total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territoryof the Somali Democratic Republic Similarly  the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held at Fez in September  also strongly condemned Ethiopia for its invasion and called for the strict observance of Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.253. The Somali people are united in their determination to stand firm against Ethiopian aggression  and the Somali armed forces will continue to repel the attacks against our country. However  it is not my Government's wish that the Horn of Africa should become a permanent trouble spot threatening regional and international peace and security. Colonialist Ethiopia must therefore be forced by the international community to evacuate its forces from Somali territory and to desist from committing further aggression against our soil. For our part we remain ready to co-operate in the search for effective political solutions to the problems of the area. What is certain is that these problems will not be solved by oppressive measures and premeditated aggression. Peace and stability can be achieved only if historical wrongs are redressed and legitimate national aspirations are recognized and respected.254. My Government is deeply disappointed by the failure of the second special session on disarmament to draw up a comprehensive programme of disarmament. We deplore also the continued spiralling of the arms race in nuclear weapons  the setback to negotiations for a test-ban treaty and the stalemate on the establishment of a convention prohibiting the use of chemical weapons.255.	It is clear therefore that there must be redoubled efforts on the part of the nuclear Powers and militarily significant States to translate the goals of the tenth special session into practical terms.256.	Bold new initiatives and higher levels of statesmanship will be required if the nuclear Powers are to break out of the vicious circle of mutual suspicion in which they are caught and if they are to remove the threat of nuclear annihilation that hangs over the world. In this regard the start of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of strategic weapons and the high level of public interest and involvement in disarmament issues are grounds for some optimism.257. It has been repeated so often that the nuclear-arms race and the search for new weapons of mass destruction endanger mankind's survival  that this very real threat is unfortunately in danger of losing its persuasive power to bring about progress towards nuclear disarmament. One pressing reality which cannot be denied or ignored is that the astronomical sums spent each year on nuclear and sophisticated conventional weapons fuel world inflation and obstruct the establishment of amore just international economic order.258. World inflation of course affects all States but its effects on developing countries have been particularly cruel. Where in developed countries inflation means the curtailment of luxuries  in the least developed it often t leans deprivation of the necessities of life. For the (ïeast developed  many of which  like Somalia  suffer from natural and man-made disasters  the enormous debt problems caused by inflation  the worsened conditions of trade and the drop in development assistance have been catastrophic.259. It is no doubt true that  except in the case of a few relatively prosperous developed countries  the development goals to which the United Nations membership is committed have never been so far from achievement as at the present time  when we have already entered the Third United Nations Development Decade.260. My Government joins in calling on the developed countries to co-operate in the launching of global negotiations-an initiative which could give new impetus to the implementing of established development goals. The steadily increasing gap between rich and poor countries cannot be in the interest of peace with progress. We hope it win be understood that the economic arrangement of the past cannot justly serve the needs of an interdependent world  that the peace and stability so desperately need\ d today go hand in hand with economic growth and  finality that it will be for the benefit of all if the poorer countries are helped to develop their resources to the point where they in turn can contribute to a prosperous world economy.261. In conclusion 1 should like to observe that  while there is undoubted cause for deep concern over the inability of the United Nations to solve inter-national political problems  it is important that the blame for this situation be ascribed not to the Organization and the Charter but to those who treat the obligations of membership with indifference  neglect or contempt and who are prepared to su1pport the world body only when its decisions conform to their interest. As the Secretary-General points out in his report  in the context of the peaceful settlement of disputes  we site lack a binding sense of international community believe  however  that a sense of inter-national community has developed through the wide-ranging achievements of the United Nations in social  economic and humanitarian fields.262.	As the agenda shows  the responsibilities under-taken by the international community under the aegis of the United Nations range from the sea-bed to outer space. The nexus of relationships and responsibilities established in less political fields will not easily be broken. In the last resort the United Nations remains an unparalleled centre for international diplomacy and mankind's best hope for peace."
"125",6402,"STP",37,1982,"The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe cannot remain silent in the Assembly regarding its profound concern at the grave problems beclouding the &ea of international relations  which by their very gravity are imperilling the security of the world and threatening peace and solidarity among nations.197.	Today more than ever before the peoples of the world want to live in dignity and freedom  but they are threatened. They are the victims of barbarous aggression  intolerable interference and covert blackmail by those whose vocation and nature it is to sow grief  pain  suffering  terror  poverty and destruction wherever people are proclaiming their right to self-determination  wherever people are fighting and dying for freedom.198.	We cannot fail at such a time to be conscious of the heroism of the Palestinian people  the courage and determination of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] and its brave fighters  who  in the face of a deluge of fire and steel  have taught Zionism and its allies a masterly lesson in popular resistance.199.	It is almost unbelievable that so much horror and barbarism should have b en committed at the threshold of the twenty-first century by an imposter State protected by guilty accomplices  a State which has now reached the last stages of paranoia. These atrocities demonstrate clearly to responsible mankind the dangers which lie in wait for it and which can only be dispelled by a greater determination in ourcommon defence of the ideals and cardinal principles cherished by the peoples of the world and by forging a network of unbroken solidarity.200. The plot aimed at exterminating the Palestinian people must be denounced  condemned and resisted  vigorously and with determination  by the international community. The appalling pictures of the holocaust in west Beirut and the most recent massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps have stirred the conscience of the millions of men and women who have identified with the Palestinian cause and firmly refuse to take refuge in blindness and amnesia in the face of the most monstrous crimes in the history of the struggle of peoples for self-determination and independence.201. What crime is it that Zionism and the imperialist forces hold against the Palestinian people and the PLO? The Palestinian people has quite rightly proclaimed its right to a homeland  to the establishment of the State of its .choice and to the recovery of its territories occupied by force. What is that people to do  that people robbed of its land for 35 years  condemned to exile and murder  other than fight for' the recognition of its inalienable rights  which others affect to ignore.202. Israeli barbarism in Lebanon  the occupation by the Zionist forces of part of the territory of that sovereign State  a Member of the Organization  and the' systematic use of the right of veto by the United States to prevent any unanimous condemnation of these criminal acts and the application of sanctions under the Charter lead us to the conclusion that law and international practice governing relations between States are being scornfully disregarded by some in order the better to preserve their unnatural alliances.203.	Sao Tome and Principe supports the Palestinian people and the PLO  its sole representative  because we also cherish honour  dignity and national independence as high values which no one will ever succeed in destroying.204.	The invasion of Lebanon and the occupation by force of the Arab territories by Zionist troops lead us to mention the invasion of the People's Republic of Angola and the occupation of parts of its territory by the racist and terrorist troops of the apartheid regime  which is another shameful phenomenon of contemporary life. Those actions illustrate the identity and the complementary nature of the views and actions of Tel Aviv and Pretoria.205. To link the independence of Namibia  under the aegis of SWAPO  with the withdrawal of the inter-nationalist Cuban forces from Angolan territory is intolerable interference inthe affairs of a sovereign State  a Member of the United Nations. Furthermore  no one can claim to be unaware of the reasons which led the Angolan Government to appeal for the solidarity of friendly countries the better to defend the sovereignty and integrity of its territory  so seriously threatened by the massive presence of terrorist racist South African troops. Those troops are illegally occupying part of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola and once again the international community seems to be acquiescing in a situation where inter-national rules are being flagrantly violated. This passivity is of the greatest possible benefit to South Africa  which is able with total impunity to massacre the innocent civilians  destroy socio-economic infrastructures and maintain its illegal occupation.206.	In spite of the existence of a recognized political and juridical framework for conducting the negotiations on the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  those negotiations are at a standstill and all possible pre-texts  even the most threadbare  are being presented as pre-conditions for any settlement of the Namibian problem. Certain Western countries which have economic and strategic interests in Namibia want to prevent that Territory from becoming truly independent and the Namibian people  represented by SWAPO  its sole and legitimate representative  from being able to live in peace  freedom and dignity .207.	In South Africa  in Western Sahara  in East Timor and in Puerto Rico  heroic struggles are being waged by their peoples to put an end to apartheid illegal occupation  colonialism and foreign oppression.208. The presence of foreign troops is preventing the peoples of Cyprus and Korea from realizing their legitimate aspirations.209. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe wishes to reaffirm from this rostrum its unswerving support for and Its active solidarity with the people of East Timor and express the hope that the statements of the administering Power on the subject of the decolonization of East Timor will lead to recourse being had to the machinery provided under the Charter to permit the Maubere people to express its views freely on its own future.210. Our delegation also wishes to express its militant support for the peoples of Western Sahara  Puerto Rico  Cyprus and Korea in their struggle to preserve their national sovereignty  self-determination  independence  national unity and peaceful reunification.211. A vast plot by the imperialist and reactionary forces is threatening the peoples and Governments of Africa  Latin America  Asia and elsewhere. An infernalmachine is being unleashed against us in order to destabilize regimes freely chosen by our peoples and all possible means are being used-the creation of puppet movements and armed gangs  the dispatching of mercenaries  the establishment of military bases  the persistent refusal to make the necessary changes in the structure and machinery of international economic relations  the stopping of investment credits  aid blackmail  and so on. These actions have one purpose in common: to safeguard the economic and strategic neo-colonialist and imperialist interests in the region.212. Furthermore  armed border conflicts are being fanned into flame and fuelled among the developing countries to weaken our human and material resources and prevent our using our strength and solidarity in true programme of national reconstruction.213.	In this vast plot  international and regional organizations are not spared. Those bodies are threatened with paralysis and may very we))  in this context  cease functioning. It is as if the forces ofevil want to prevent the peoples of the third world from gaining access to credible forums where they can denounce and condemn the plots  the manoeuvres and the massacres and diminish the historic role of those bodies  that is  to defend the struggle for emancipation of the peoples of the world against every kind of exploitation and discrimination.214. It is because the United Nations  the OAU and the non-aligned movement have remained faithful to their original vocation that serious threats are posed to their future and their capacity to take just and courageous decisions enabling responsible mankind to undertake commitments of solidarity and jointly to meet the challenge.215. In this context the task of the new Secretary-Charter  they are offered only resolutions which remain General are not an easy one. A son of the third world  renowned for his qualities and his experience  General is not an easy one. A son of the third world  renowned for his qualities and his experience  he will through his enlightened leadership enable the United Nations to succeed in defending international order  justice  peace and the progress of the peoples of the world so that the Organization can continue to deserve the confidence of all peoples and in particular of the peoples whose human dignity has been diminished. The United Nations  in particular at the sessions of the General Assembly  must not become a kind of confessional  where we all find ourselves under the spell of words and exorcise the evil spirits  thus relieving our conscience  because in sanctioning the practice of the use of words without accompanying action the Organization is likely to become the graveyard of the hopes of the peoples.216. Our delegation is among those that whole-the many complex political problems on the agenda  of  heartedly endorse the idea that the United Nations the General Assembly for the establishment of a new international order in which dignity  freedom  wellbeing  peace and progress can become a reality and not a mirage for mankind.217. The delegation of Sao Tome and Principe wishes to assure the Secretary-General that the people and Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe will make a constructive contribution to the performance of this honourable task."
"126",6434,"SUR",37,1982,"It gives me great pleasure to add the voice of the delegation of Suriname to the voices of many others that have congratulated Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election to preside over our deliberations at the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His knowledge and experience will surely prove to be important assets for the success of this session  especially at a time when international institutions like the United Nations face a serious crisis. May I also take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  for the skilled leadership with which he guided the proceedings of the Assembly at the sessions held during his tenure of office. I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  a great son of the courageous Peruvian people  on his election to that high post. My country sees in him a true representative and protagonist of Latin American and Caribbean unity. In view of the fact that Latin America and the Caribbean region have developed a tradition of peace for more than a hundred years  we trust that his election at this difficult juncture in history will contribute towards international peace and progress. We agree that  as has been eloquently stated by a great number of speakers who have preceded me in the general debate  the Organization is going through a serious credibility crisis. At the same time  we note with satisfaction that this session is enjoying the maximum attendance of the family of States Members of the Organization. We have to face facts. The Secretary General has been very frank in describing the present international crisis  politically  economically and institutionally. We join the Secretary General in calling upon all Member States to use all possible inventiveness and creativity to equip the United Nations institutionally in order to enhance its capacity to cope with the present international crisis. That appeal applies in particular to the members of the Security Council which bear a special responsibility to ensure the urgent restoration of peace in various regions of the world. The cause of predictability of conduct of nations  as well as adherence to principles and rules of international law  must guide us in our effort to prevent the international community from slipping into a state characterized by the primitive use of force and coercive influence. My Government holds the view that the existing inequalities in the distribution of economic and political advantages are at the core of the problems we are faced with on a national and international scale. More specifically  the present international division of labour and the adoption of political systems conceived and propagated by States that continue to hold power over ether States have created a situation where the basic needs and justified interests and aspirations of the masses are subordinated to the interests of traditionalist and elitist Powers. Suriname has committed itself to contribute within the limits of its capacity towards ending flagrant inequalities existing on the national and the international levels. On the national level  Suriname has made substantial progress in conceiving and implementing an economic and political system based on the interests and participation of the majority of its people. In doing so Suriname adheres to the genuine principles of democracy. We believe that consultation  participation and control by broad sections of our people offer the best guarantees to achieve the goal of nation building in a country where at least six ethnic groups from all parts of the world were brought together during the colonial era. Moreover  we are exerting serious efforts to make this unity an effective instrument for the proper and effective implementation of developmental programmes. In our international policy we have developed a strategy geared towards maximum diversification of development cooperation and solidarity in the struggle for the just causes of developing countries. In doing so we adhere to the principles of non alignment. In this respect  we reiterate our full commitment to the basic principles of this movement  such as national sovereignty  self determination  non interference  non intervention  the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the acceptance of ideological pluralism in international affairs. Moreover  my Government holds the view that we should continue to intensify financial  technological and marketing relations with other developing countries and join in the efforts of the developing world in restructuring the North South relationship in order to create the kind of international balance that can advance the cause of peace and development. Taking into consideration the fact that the ongoing decolonization of Suriname is closely linked to a clear understanding that it must share the fate of the Latin American and Caribbean States  Suriname will continue to participate in all endeavours to strengthen political and economic ties with the countries of its region. In regard to the implications of Argentina's actions to recover its sovereignty over the Malvinas  we understand the position of some sister Caribbean States  but those actions constitute only a part of the Malvinas experience. The Malvinas issue made it very clear to us that the Western States  in spite of existing treaties  took a collective stand against 3 sister State in Latin America. That collective action was not limited to economic measures of a coercive nature  but extended to military  political and diplomatic support. My Government feels that an important lesson must be drawn from this experience. The facts have proved that it is of vital importance for Latin America and the Caribbean States to bury their differences and to join hands in defining and implementing clear cut programmes geared towards economic and political cooperation. My Government welcomes the inclusion of this question in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. It is our hope that a more constructive and compromise oriented attitude will be displayed in the deliberations to end the colonial occupation of the Malvinas  thus correcting the injustice done to the Argentine people over many years. The Caribbean Basin is an area of special concern; indeed  it has become explosive in nature. We cannot but return to the historical causes of this situation  to identify a general state of utter poverty amongst the majority of the people  in flagrant contradistinction to the wealth of a minority. We find in that a situation which is in itself conducive to violence and civil war. In that regard  the introduction of East West rivalry in the region  falsely identified as the main source of conflict  has eclipsed the real causes of the problem. The present situation in El Salvador  placed in the context of the Caribbean Basin  is illustrative of this growing tension and constitutes a danger leading to the loss of human lives and a stagnation in development. My Government therefore favors all peace proposals derived from a fundamental analysis of this problem. That implies that Suriname condemns all outside interference of whatever nature into the internal affairs of El Salvador. We call upon the rival parties in this domestic struggle to take the road of effective dialogue to stop the ongoing violence. The people of El Salvador are those most capable of forging a fundamental solution to their economic and political problems. A11 outside interference  whether bona fide or mala fide  can lead only to further complications in the present situation and will ultimately serve the interests of foreign Powers  to the detriment of the interests of the majority of the Salvadorian people. My Government pledges support to all regional efforts to bring about an atmosphere in which such a dialogue can take place. The principle of peaceful dialogue does not apply only to the domestic situation of the individual States  but should be applied also to solve the problems that have arisen between sister States in Latin America. My Government calls upon all members of the Latin American and Caribbean community to refrain from the use or threat of use of force or economic measures of a coercive nature in the pursuit of solutions to problems that are not inherent in the actual relationship between our respective peoples but find their cause in the colonialist and imperialist history of our continent. The Latin American and Caribbean States should  in our opinion  follow the wise course of seeking a peaceful settlement of disputes so as to protect and preserve our excellent record as a region of peace. We must face the fact that global developments present a gloomy picture. The ongoing economic crises  combined with the arms race  resulted in grave and explosive situations in various regions. The tragedy that we have witnessed over a quarter of a century in the Middle East has recently evolved into a sequence of events which have horrified the human conscience. Even when guided by the utmost prudence in approaching this complex problem one cannot but lay the blame for this disturbing state of affairs on the State of Israel. While Israel occasionally professes the wish to live in peace with its neighbours  it has over the months systematically applied an aggressive policy and has acted against vested principles and rules of international law and  more specifically  against the territorial integrity of its neighbours. In this connection I wish to recall the annexation of the Syrian territory of the Golan Heights  the provocative and oppressive acts of the Israeli army against Palestinian civilians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and  lately  the transgression of Lebanese borders  leading to the massacre of thousands of defenceless Palestinian men  women and children. That crime against humanity has deservedly received universal condemnation  not only of those who committed that savage act but equally of those who facilitated that repulsive crime. Reaching the goal of durable peace in the Middle East will obviously require more than the adoption of resolutions by the Assembly and other international forums. The fate of the numerous resolutions adopted by the United Nations pertinent to this question is proof that this approach is insufficient. It will require maximum efforts by the world community in general to bring an end to the continuing tragic events. Those members of the international community that are in a position to bring pressure to bear on the parties to the conflict have a special responsibility in this respect. My Government notes with satisfaction that there is an emerging consensus. Any solution of the Middle East conflict proposed will be futile if it ignores the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self determination and to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State. It is with pleasure that I note the growing numbers of countries adhering to this basic principle for solving the Middle East problem. Furthermore  my delegation expresses its satisfaction with the consensus reached during the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference on the proposed peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. Most of the preceding speakers have forthrightly rejected and condemned South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its aggression towards neighbouring States. We cannot but agree with that position. In our view  the application of racist policies by South Africa is not just a case of violence by a minority against the majority  but amounts to a qualitative contempt for and lack of respect for the people living under that system  and a clear expression of the economic exploitation of the racial majority in that country. My delegation therefore holds the position that South Africa's domestic policies and its stand towards neighbouring States can be dealt with effectively by the world community  in general  and by the developed countries  in particular  only by applying international measures designed to bring about a fundamental restructuring within the South African social and economic system. With regard to the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan  my delegation reiterates its support for the resolutions of the Assembly calling for their withdrawal. Our support for a political settlement of this issue on the basis of General Assembly resolution 36/34 remains unchanged. Concerning the situation in the Korean peninsula  my delegation again calls upon both parties to make all possible efforts to promote reconciliation between the North and the South through dialogue in order to achieve the peaceful unification of their divided homeland. it is a matter of serious concern to our Government that very little progress has been made in solving the problem of Kampuchea. It is our hope that the opposing parties will approach this problem along the lines of the basic principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. Moreover  we express the sincere wish that the countries members of the Association of South East Asian Nations together with the Indo Chinese countries involved  can cooperate to find an acceptable solution to the problem in order to make South East Asia a region of peace  stability and cooperation. Within the chain of events that have cast a shadow on the life and standing of the United Nations during the past year  the failure of the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament stands out  and has given rise to serious concern for the Attire of world peace and stability. The arms race continues at an unprecedented pace. It is the opinion of my delegation that the lack of tangible progress in our attempts to halt this costly and dangerous activity will have increasingly adverse effects on the inclination of States to settle their disputes through peaceful means  thus making peacekeeping ever more difficult for the United Nations. It is our belief that the availability of vast quantities of arms is responsible for the frequent use or threat of use of force in international relations. It is unfortunate that many States are still inclined to believe that they can better secure what they perceive to be their interests through military strength rather than by relying on peaceful means. Notwithstanding the right of individual States to take the necessary measures to defend their territorial integrity  we cannot but condemn the acceleration of the arms race which represents a vicious circle. Under the pretext of protecting alleged domestic interests  States devote to it the very resources that are needed to create the conditions for domestic and international peace and progress  drawing upon financial  natural and human resources that are so direly needed for development. Recent history has proved that the use of violence between developing countries has been detrimental to the countries involved and has seriously weakened their capacity for independent development. We therefore hold the view that developing countries should refrain from any participation in the arms race  and should collectively exert pressure on the super Powers and other powerful nations to discontinue the absurdity of creating tension in order falsely to justify their continuation of the arms race. We reiterate Suriname's commitment to all regional and global disarmament endeavours. Not since the great economic depression has the world economy experienced such great instability and such severe disruption of sustained growth. Independent of the levels of development or the economic structures of various States  economic expansion has decelerated markedly on a global scale. The situation confronting the developing countries is manifested in increased unemployment  high rates of inflation  serious deterioration in terms of trade and increasing current account deficits and debt service payments. The declining prices of primary commodities compared to the rising costs of manufactured imports have not only seriously affected the developmental process in many developing countries but  also as a result  substantially affected the basic needs of their peoples. Within the context of the present international economic situation we believe that it is of urgent and crucial importance to launch the round of global negotiations in the field of raw materials  energy  trade and finance. Suriname maintains the view that resolution 34/138  by which the General Assembly decided to launch global negotiations  incorporates the appropriate set of elements needed to tackle the present international economic structure and achieve a steady  equal and just economic order. It is clear that science and technology are major instruments in the developmental process. It is therefore regrettable that in the world of today the developing countries are still confronted with the monopolization of scientific and technological achievements. A few States and transnational corporations still control the available scientific and technological know how. In this respect my delegation considers it imperative that any bilateral or multilateral arrangement in the field of finance and investment  whether private or public  include clauses dealing with the transfer of science and technology suitable to the level of development of developing countries. On the other hand  third world countries must continue to devise and implement programmes which may facilitate the transfer of technology among themselves. The international problems related to the financial crisis of the world require close evaluation and concerted effort in order to create the effects that are so urgently needed. We note that there are two important tendencies in the field of investment for development. In the first place we had a tendency to move away from multilateral aid to bilateral aid. Secondly  we had that within bilateral treaties the Government to Government approach is being gradually replaced by investments through private financing institutions. Suriname is of the opinion that these trends are detrimental to the development of the recipient States  for the following reasons. First  they weaken the regional integration that is vital to their international bargaining power vis a vis the industrialized States. Secondly  they create an atmosphere favouring measures of a coercive nature  which seriously affects a country's capacity for its own development either politically or economically. Thirdly  with respect to the emphasis on private investments  in the experience of the developing countries it is becoming virtually impossible to attract foreign investors in the field of infrastructural and social programmes essential for sustained and steady economic growth. As a result  investments for industrial or commercial development are not in accord with comprehensive planning for development. We are in favour of a blend of bilateral and multilateral aid  within which emphasis must be placed on multilateral aid. However  we cannot but insist that for multilateral aid to be effective substantial changes in the rules and procedures guiding these multilateral institutions are necessary. A major step forward in this regard would be a fundamental change in the existing voting structure in order to allow developing countries greater participation in the decision making process of these international institutions. A majority of developing countries are faced with the problem of immense foreign debts. In this respect we underline the need to implement part B of resolution 165 adopted by the Trade and Development Board on 11 March 1978  at its ninth special session  and which deals with the renegotiation of the debts of developing countries. As a small developing and trading nation  Suriname is sensitive to fluctuations in trade with our major trading partners. Our prosperity  like that of many other developing countries  depends greatly on the export of relatively few primary products. The quantitative and qualitative improvement of our exports is the target of ambitious industrialization programmes  which absorb large amounts of capital. Whether we consider our present trade position or the intended improvement  the developing countries are faced with a growing crisis in the world market. This crisis is mainly characterized by increasing protectionist measures by the industrialized States. To eliminate these tradebarriers the role of GATT must be directed towards new normative tasks  such as the establishment of rules which do not hamper access by the developing countries to international markets and which do not hinder their capacity to regulate their own internal markets. Hence  my delegation strongly appeals for a review of the international economic institutions. Without relaxing our efforts to work for more just and equitable terms of trade in the North South relationship  it is important to consider the intensification of trade among developing countries as an integral part of collective action for the establishment of a new international economic order. My Government holds the view that in regional  sub regional and bilateral relations efforts should be made to concentrate on exploring and exploiting trade possibilities between developing countries. In this respect it is of vital importance that we take a pragmatic approach and try to end specific areas of trade. My Government is of the opinion that the private sector in developing countries may provide an excellent start for broadening and deepening trade relations. The negotiations with regard to the law of the sea  which lasted almost 10 years  ended on 30 April of this year with the adoption of the most ambitious Convention in history  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Convention  which seeks to regulate almost every aspect of human activity in the oceans and tries to uphold the United Nations resolution calling for the deep sea bed to be regarded as the common heritage of mankind  is now ready to be signed officially.  From the Convention we may expect legal security  confidence and reliability  which preclude anarchy in the area of the international sea bed. It is regrettable that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea failed to meet its goal of unanimous adoption of the Convention. In this situation  with a good many of the industrialized States failing to support the Convention  its viability and consequently its standing in international law are being undermined. We reject any separate arrangement in which the major industrialized States would simply proceed to share the sea bed amongst themselves. We therefore fully support the statement made by the President of the Conference on the Law of the Sea to the press on 3 May of this year  indicating that the General Assembly should be requested to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legality of mining outside the Convention if the mining companies proceeded to mine under unilateral legislation or a limited multilateral agreement. We welcome the recent statement made by the Soviet Union that it will sign the Convention  and we urgently appeal to the States that have rejected or failed to commit themselves to the Convention on account of rigid ideological considerations based on a free market philosophy  or for other reasons  to be more pragmatic and become signatories when the Convention is presented to government representatives in Jamaica in early December of this year. Despite all the problems involved  the Convention can be considered as the greatest step in international relations since the founding of the United Nations. We  representatives of the developing countries  had hoped that the Convention would be a major step forward towards the new international economic order which we have so long been demanding. We therefore call for the good will and cooperation of the industrialized States  without which the effort to establish a regime for  among other things  the common heritage of mankind will have been largely wasted. Failure of the major industrialized countries to cooperate will only justify the conclusion that the political will to shape economic developments along equitable lines in the context of the North South dialogue is still a long way off. I shall now turn to a number of humanitarian and social issues. In our view  at this session the General Assembly will need to pay more attention to the plight of people who are forced to flee their homelands. The effects of the 1982 war in Lebanon on the civil population will undoubtedly add to the major concentrations of refugees and displaced persons caused by regional conflicts during the last few years. Major refugee concentrations in Somalia  the Sudan  Pakistan and South East Asia continue to cause concern  because in most cases little progress has been made in arranging for the refugees to return to their homelands. It is our expectation that discussions at this thirty seventh session on the status of women will focus on the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  to be held in 1985. We cannot but praise the good work done among the rural and the poor women by the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women. It is a well known fact that an overwhelming majority of the disabled population of the world live in developing countries  where the problems of resources and the lack of adequate  trained personnel are considered to be the great obstacles to progress. The delegation of Suriname hopes  therefore  that international programmes established to assist the disabled will result in an adequate transfer of technology and resources to developing countries.My delegation is anxiously looking forward to a progress report on the implementation of the Specific Programme of Measures and Activities'"" prepared by the Secretary General in consultation with Member States  specialized agencies and international youth organizations  especially in view of International Youth Year  which is scheduled for 1985. The increasing unemployment among the young members of our society is causing us great concern. My Government is trying to give high priority to resolving the problems of the young.While we speak of the young  we should not neglect the elderly. Although Suriname has not escaped the adverse effects of a worldwide economic recession  the Suriname Government is taking progressive measures to improve the situation of the aging in the fields of health  housing and social welfare. Much has been done to provide geriatric and other training  with the assistance of international organizations.We are pleased at the adoption of the International Plan of Action on Aging at the World Assembly on Aging held in Vienna and express the hope that this Plan will be guide for Member States in dealing with problems brought about by the rapidly increasing numbers of elderly persons all over the world. May I affirm ay Government's commitment to the cause of the aged and state that a society cannot call itself advanced or progressive if it does not respect  protect  help and honour the elderly and the aged.The international system has entered a new phase. The intensification of international relations is unparalleled in history. At the same time we find that the political  economic and institutional crisis which we are faced with tends to discourage us in our quest for the creation of a world in which interdependence and a more collective approach to matters of common interest are globally accepted. My Government is of the opinion that defeatism could be replaced by optimism if we return to the basic principles and motives that led to the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.The goals of peace and development are still high on the banner of the Organization. We call upon all Member States to support the Secretary General in his efforts to adapt and equip the United Nations in order to enable the Organization to cope with the present crises. As we did in 1975  my Government renews its pledge to uphold the principles and objectives of the United Nations."
"127",6528,"SWE",37,1982,"I should like first of all to congratulate the President on his election to his office for this session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that  with his wide experience of the United Nations  he will successfully carry out the important tasks ahead of him. I should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Kittani  who presided over the previous session with great distinction and skill. It gives me great pleasure to join the many preceding speakers who have congratulated the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar  on his election to his high office. In the exercise of his functions he has already earned a reputation for great dedication and integrity. I can assure him and his staff of the Swedish Government's full support for their endeavours in pursuit of international peace and co-operation.The international situation has increasingly deteriorated since the late 1970s. We are living in an era of distrust. The policy of detente has been superseded by a policy of confrontation between the super-Powers. A dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union has  it is true  been initiated  but there is reason to be sceptical about the possibility of its yielding any quick results. We must  by our concerted efforts  reverse these trends.My country has chosen to pursue a policy of neutrality  one of non-participation in alliances in peace time and neutrality in the event of war. This policy  supported by a strong defence relative to our situation  contributes to the calm and stability in our part of the world. We shall pursue this policy with firmness and consistency.Swedish territory will be protected from violations with all available means. Such violations will be treated with equal determination  no matter whence they emanate. International law gives us the right and the duty to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity. Let no one entertain fears or expectations that Sweden would  even under strong external pressure  abandon its policy of neutrality.Our policy of neutrality does not  however  condemn us to silence or passivity. On the contrary  it challenges us to pursue an active foreign policy in the cause of peace  freedom and international co-operation.Sweden will  in accordance with its traditions  seek to promote peaceful solutions and to play an intermediary role in international conflicts. In common with so many others  we have three fundamental values to safeguard  namely  sovereignty  security and solidarity.All our considerations must start from the right of peoples to determine their own future. National sovereignty is the foundation of political legitimacy in international contexts. This is self-evident  but not uncontested. Peoples have had to struggle for their independence  and that struggle is still going on. More than 100 States have gained their independence in recent decades. But they know  as do all other small and medium-sized States  that in a world dominated by great Powers and powerful transnational economic interests  this is a struggle that must go on for a long time to come. The real content of sovereignty is largely conditioned by the ability to pursue an independent  effective economic policy.Against that background it is not surprising that the movement of non-aligned countries has attracted such a large membership and has shown such great vitality  despite internal crises and conflicts of interests. National sovereignty must always be safeguarded. One recent example of the violation of this principle is Israel's invasion of Lebanon. By invading Lebanon  Israel has demonstrated indifference to the principles of the Charter and of international law. It is a tragedy that the State in whose creation the United Nations played such a decisive role now acts in a way that counteracts the authority of the Organization. The international community has rightly condemned Israel's assault and demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops.Sweden has on repeated occasions condemned acts of terrorism perpetrated against Israel. But in our view these can never justify what has now taken place in Lebanon.The massacre of Palestinians in Beirut aroused feelings of horror and disgust in my country. The immediate responsibility for these crimes rests with their perpetrators. But this outrage would not have been possible had its perpetrators not been allowed into the camps.Thirty-five years have now passed and five wars have been fought in the region since the adoption of the United Nations partition plan for Palestine. A just and. realistic solution presupposes that Israel and the PLO acknowledge one another as negotiating parties. The PLO must recognize Israel's right to live within secure and recognized borders. Israel must  for its part  recognize the Palestinians' right to determine their own future  including the right to establish a State of their own  in the spirit of the original partition plan.The borders existing before the 1967 war are more time-honoured and internationally recognized than any others. Obviously  the two parties must be at liberty to agree between themselves on adjustments of these borders which both can accept.The Israeli Government's claim of supremacy over the occupied areas has no basis in international law. The settlements policy pursued in these areas constitutes a serious obstacle to the efforts to solve the problems of the Middle East. The acquisition of territory by force cannot be tolerated. Israel must discontinue its occupation of the areas it captured in 1967. A solution must also include arrangements as regards Jerusalem which guarantee the right of free access to the Holy Places for all religious worshippers  regardless of nationality.The various proposals and plans recently put forward from different quarters contain many constructive elements. Together with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) they should be able to form the basis of a lasting peace in the Middle East.For the United Nations to play a role in solving the conflict  it is necessary that Israel remain a Member of the United Nations and that the FLO continue to be able to present its views before this forum. My Government disassociates itself from any attempt to deprive Israel of its membership or to limit it. To be elective the United Nations must rest on the principle of universality.The Soviet Union has occupied Afghanistan for nearly three years now. The Assembly has condemned this brutal assault. But the Soviet troops are still there  and reports leak out about continued assaults on the civilian population. This is all the more serious when we consider the fact that the Soviet Union is a permanent member of the Security Council with special responsibility to uphold the principles of the Charter relating to peace and security. We demand that the Soviet troops leave Afghanistan  and we hope that the talks which have now begun under the auspices of the United Nations will be able to create the conditions necessary for a durable settlement of this issue.The right to determine their own future without interference from outside is also the due of the people in Kampuchea. There  too  a peaceful solution must be found in accordance with the principles of the Charter  and the foreign troops must be withdrawn. In recent months some signs of an incipient dialogue between the countries in the region have been evident. We welcome this as a step in the right direction.Namibia is still being denied by armed force its self-evident right to national independence. South Africa's illegal occupation of the country is in flagrant defiance of United Nations resolutions. South Africa continues to delay the United Nations plan for Namibia. This plan is the only course for achieving a peaceful and democratic solution. There is a risk that this course will be abandoned if elements alien to the United Nations plan are introduced into the negotiations on Namibia. The countries in the contact group bear a special responsibility for ensuring that the liberation of Namibia is not further delayed.South Africa is constantly guilty of subversion and armed aggression against the States neighbouring it. It is not enough to condemn these lawless pursuits. The South African Government should be subjected to increased and effective pressure from the United Nations as a peaceful means for achieving the abolition of the 	system. The Security Council should  as quickly as possible  impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa. We are surprised to hear from States which have resorted to sanctions in several other contexts outside the United Nations framework that sanctions against South Africa would not be effective.The international community must give the afflicted States and liberation movements in southern Africa all the political  economic and humanitarian assistance it can mobilize.The ever-growing use of force in various parts of the world is a cause of concern. The Charter contains a clear and unequivocal prohibition of the use of force in international relations. This is one of the foundations of international law.In our time  the issues of national security have assumed a new dimension. Beyond the question of who is right or wrong in a conflict  there looms the greater question of the survival of mankind. In the world of the super-Powers  one side cannot achieve security at the expense of the other. We must  together  try to find common security for everyone's survival.Nuclear weapons have changed the rules of the game. If that ultimate weapon is used  the result will be collective suicide. We must create the political conditions which will ensure that weapons of mass destruction will never be used.In Europe  considerable headway had been made in the process of detente at the beginning of the 1970s. The two military pacts were on the way to finding a new way based on an approximate balance of military power and on mutual respect. Relations between the two German States improved. Willy Brandt's	was a pioneer achievement. Contacts developed across the borders between individuals and peoples. The increase in economic exchange was of mutual benefit. Detente between the super-Powers provided greater scope for small and medium- sized States in the region to have their legitimate interests respected. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held at Helsinki laid the foundation for continued peaceful relations between the States of Europe.The process of detente must be resumed and carried forward. National security is promoted by extensive exchanges across borders in the interests of all parties. The common interest in peaceful development will then grow.At their meeting in Stockholm in August  the Foreign Ministers of the neutral and non-aligned States in Europe declared their intention to play an active and constructive role in the meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be resumed at Madrid. Provided the two super-Powers show a minimum degree of willingness to compromise  at that meeting the Conference should be able to achieve a comprehensive and balanced final document on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act and also to decide on the convening of a conference for disarmament in Europe.In our part of Europe  close and trustful cooperation has existed for many years. There are no nuclear weapons in the Nordic countries. It is essential that this situation remain unchanged. Sweden is striving to achieve agreements which  among other things  will make the Nordic region a nuclear-weapon- free zone. Agreements of that kind can ease the tension between the blocs and reduce the risk of those countries being subjected to nuclear attack.In Europe  there is the most horrifying accumulation of weapons of destruction anywhere in the world or at any time in history  as well as the largest standing armies. It is a prepared battlefield. Nevertheless  we must not in Africa  Asia and Latin America that the wars have been fought  ever since the end of the Second World War. Those wars have already claimed  and are still claiming  innumerable victims. Starvation  disease and deprivation follow in their wake.AH this is very largely due to a colonialism which is not so far back in the past. The world is still shaken by the convulsions of liberation  which are the more violent and the more prolonged the longer the powers-that-be try to suppress the peoples' struggle for independence.In Central America  centuries of oppression have given rise to a revolutionary situation. It is absurd to claim that the workers  the farmers  the students and the middle class have revolted in Nicaragua  El Salvador and Guatemala because some foreign Power asked them to do so. On the other hand  it is obvious that a foreign Power—the United States—plays a crucial role when it comes to keeping tottering dictatorships on their feet.The violence in Central America is provoked by those who oppose the demands of the people for a bearable life. Peace in the region also presupposes respect for the national independence of all States. It is still possible to achieve negotiated solutions and put an end to the bloodbath. More and more Governments  both in Europe and Latin America  are joining the call for a political solution in the region.Fundamental national security may not and cannot be won at the expense of the freedom and development possibilities of other nations. Peaceful development on reasonable terms for everyone presupposes solidarity. The demand for solidarity must be equally strong whether it applies to individuals in the struggle for human rights or to nations in the struggle for international justice.In our neighbouring country Poland  the central trade union confederation  Solidarity  has bee-a declared illegal. The military take-over shucked us deeply. The process of democratization was interrupted  and fundamental human rights are still being trampled underfoot  in contravention of the Helsinki Final Act. And thus  the dream of genuine reform has been temporarily shattered. If real dialogue and reconciliation are to be achieved in Poland  martial law must be lifted  imprisoned and interned trade union leaders and other political prisoners must be released and trade union activities must be allowed to be carried on freely  in accordance with ILO Conventions which Poland has undertaken to resect. The strikes and protests of the last few days confirm the fact that the Polish workers are not prepared to accept an imposed model for their trade union activities.Our protests also apply to the military dictatorship in Turkey  where political parties are banned and trade unions are prevented from working freely. The regime's opponents are subjected to mass arrests and mock trials.Demands for democracy  for social justice  for human dignity and for national independence are made with the conviction in the East as in the West  in the North as in the South. Oppression may assume different guises and forms  but it causes its victims the same human suffering  the same enslavement. Our solidarity must therefore never be one-sided.It is obviously in the interest of all to have rules governing political relations. Presumably they also wish to have rules governing economic exchanges. But in the long run  rules of this kind work only if they can satisfy the legitimate interests of all parties.World trade and world production have been experiencing the deepest crisis of the post-war period for several years now. The international system of payments is creaking at the joints. The world has been confronted by acute and chronic problems in regard to its supplies of energy. The North-South dialogue has become a series of parallel monologues. Small countries have a particular interest in trying to strengthen international co-operation. In the prevailing economic situation  the GATT Ministerial Meeting and the coming world trade conference will be of great importance.For three years we have been trying in vain to agree on a formula for global economic negotiations. There is  however  the capacity in the United Nations system to negotiate the answers to at least the most urgent questions and there is  after all  little difference in positions as regards the initiation of the global negotiations. A few years ago the Independent Commission on International Development Issues  under the chairmanship of Willy Brandt  presented a report with the challenging title. The members of the Commission were people of varying political convictions and geographic origin; nevertheless they succeeded in arriving at common conclusions. Their report becomes increasingly valid.A common strategy is needed to solve the growing problems of the international payments system. More and more countries are staggering under a debt burden which stifles expansion potential not only for the countries themselves but also for their trading partners. Transfer of resources must be increased and as far as possible reformed in order to make them more automatic and predictable. The need for concessional resources is particularly great for the poorest countries. A common strategy is necessary also for the adjustment of world trade to new realities. One such reality is the industrial development of the developing countries.Sweden is among those countries which  as a result of their own experience  regard free trade as extremely beneficial. The industrialized countries must now demonstrate that they are prepared to allow other countries and peoples to enjoy the fruits of free trade. An adjustment of this kind must take place  with account being taken of two conflicting but equally legitimate interests: the need of the developing countries to create sufficient resources so that they can participate in trade for their own benefit and the need of the traditionally industrialized countries to realign their production without creating even greater unemployment.The countries producing raw materials must receive reasonable and foreseeable incomes from their production and gradually acquire the capacity to process a much greater proportion of their own raw materials. No country should be confined to the role of mere suppliers of raw materials.In a world marked by heightened antagonism between the great Powers it is essential to emphasize the possibilities which none the less are available. The Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  under the chairmanship of Olof Palme  consisted  like the Brandt Commission  of people with varying backgrounds and political convictions. In spite of considerable conflict of interests  they also managed to achieve a measure of mutual understanding. Allow me to comment briefly on a few points. The Commission proposes a total ban on nuclear-weapon tests. This has long been the central issue in the disarmament negotiations. Sweden has for its part  by its own proposals and monitoring efforts  done all it can for the attainment of this goal. I wish to indicate the Swedish Government's satisfaction at the fact that the Soviet Union has submitted to the Assembly a draft agreement which is largely based on previous common endeavours. It is our hope that the other nuclear-weapon Powers will demonstrate a corresponding will to negotiate  so that agreement may finally be reached. May I also emphasize that a test ban is a focal element in the efforts to freeze the nuclear-weapon capacity and to proceed to reductions. I am convinced that the freeze idea will play an important role during this session. In this context I wish to express our appreciation of those popular movements which work independently for disarmament and peace. The military forces stationed in Europe today are much larger than can be justified by the security requirements of the parties concerned. In fact  large balanced reductions would increase security.The vast number of nuclear weapons deployed in Europe or targeted against that continent are the source of special problems. Substantial reductions of these arsenals of nuclear weapons are necessary; but there is a connection between nuclear weapons in Europe and balance between East and West as regards conventional forces. One condition for getting rid of nuclear weapons in Europe is that both sides should also agree on a rough parity in conventional forces. The smaller—so-called battlefield—nuclear weapons in Europe constitute a particular danger  as they could be used at a very early stage of a conflict. The Commission proposes that these battlefield weapons be withdrawn from the most forward positions and that a zone be created in Europe which is entirely free of these weapons  a zone which could stretch 150 kilometres on each side of the East-West border. This idea has our full support.The Swedish Government attaches great importance to all negotiations  such as those on mutual and balanced force reductions and on theatre nuclear forces and the planned European disarmament conference  which aim in this way to reduce or abolish the role of nuclear weapons in Europe.The Commission also proposes an international agreement on the total prohibition of chemical weapons  as well as a chemical-weapon-free zone in Europe. In the view of the Swedish Government  the pre-conditions of implementing such an arrangement for the purposes of confidence-building should be examined more closely. The proposal should also be used in the extensive efforts being made in the disarmament negotiations in Geneva to achieve the total prohibition of all chemical weapons.The most important instrument we have for achieving common security is the United Nations. It is encouraging that during this debate so many Governments have emphasized that it should be possible to use this instrument for preserving peace and security in the world in a more resolute way.The Secretary-General has emphasized the importance of this question by devoting the whole of his first report on the work of the Organization to it. His report is a clear-sighted assessment of the international situation and of the role of the United Nations in the international system. By departing from the standards and duties which we set ourselves in the Charter of the United Nations we are as the Secretary-General warns  ""perilously near to a new international anarchy"".No purpose of the United Nations is more important than the maintenance of international peace and security. Yet the United Nations has repeatedly failed to realize that purpose and never have the failures been more evident than in the last few years. In the long run no organization can survive if the members do not respect its rules. The prohibition in the Charter of the threat or use of force in relations between States is absolute; so is the obligation to use only peaceful means for the settlement of international disputes.We need a more active and imaginative approach by the Security Council to potential conflict situations. There are many ways of achieving this. One is improved co-operation with the Secretary-General  who has already announced his intention to develop and activate the preventive role foreseen for him under Article 99 of the Charter.A factor which has greatly contributed to the erosion of the authority of the United Nations is the repeated failure of the Security Council to secure the implementation of its own decisions. These are  according to the Charter  mandatory for all Member States  and yet we have repeatedly seen them flouted by those to whom they were addressed. The Council must not  because of lack of foresight or for some other reason  place the Secretary-General in impossible situations but  on the contrary  must give him all possible support in the assignments he is given.Many ideas similar to those tut forward by the Secretary-General are to be found in the report of the Palme Commission  to which I have already referred. The report deals  with the need for agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council on early action primarily in border countries in certain predetermined areas. This would mean that in case of such conflicts it would be possible to initiate action by the United Nations in time to prevent the use of force. In this way the risk of great-Power rivalry in areas of conflict would diminish.It is inevitable that the permanent members of the Security Council  by virtue of the special powers and ability to act vested in them by the Charter  have special reason to reflect seriously upon the role they play. To put it simply  the United Nations cannot carry out its functions without the full co-operation of the great Powers  among themselves and with the rest of the world. They should use that power and influence for the purpose of making the ideals of the United Nations come true. This session of the General Assembly has been convened at a time when many of the world's problems have assumed crisis proportions. It is therefore only natural to dwell particularly on the responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace and security  and its ability to contribute to a solution of the economic crisis. The defence of the principles of international law is a vital task for the United Nations. This is a challenge for the future. With the rapid advances in the field of technology  more and more issues are of a kind that cannot be solved by each State on its own. Here we are faced with the necessity for common solutions.We must co-operate. The future always contains both promise and threat. Let us together ward off the threat and fulfil the promise."
"128",6641,"SYR",37,1982,"It gives me pleasure to con¬gratulate Mr. Hollai on his unanimous election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to wish him success in his noble mis¬sion. I am confident that his ability  experience and wisdom will lead to the desired success of our work at this session. My country's delegation will do its utmost to co-operate with him towards that end  especially since the development of cordial relations between our two countries will render our co-operation closer and more comprehensive.189.	I wish to laud the achievements of the out¬going President  Mr. Ismat Kittam  during whose tenure the General Assembly held several special and emergency special sessions  in addition to the regular thirty-sixth session. Mr  Kittani conducted the work of the various sessions in an efficient manner that is worthy of our full appreciation and praise.190.	I also laud the Secretary-General  during whose term of office we hope that the Organization will take longer strides towards the attainment of its purposes and objectives.191.	The present session is being held at a time when our international community is facing extremely dif¬ficult circumstances. Danger is threatening around every comer. Hotbeds of tension and acts of violence and aggression are intensifying and expanding  in the Middle East in particular  but also in Asia  Africa and Latin America. All these situations pose a major threat to international peace and security.192.	There is no doubt that the imperialist camp is directly responsible for the intensification of tension and aggression in and against those continents. It wants to use those countries as a testing ground for its lethal arms so that those countries will remain helpless  the victims of ruin and destruction. By the same token  their peoples will remain backward and unable to catch up with the achievements of civ¬ilization. The imperialists wish to keep a vast domain at their disposal for exploitation  both political and economic. Needless to say  neo-colonialism has perfected its methods and techniques in this field.193.	The imperialist camp is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on arsenals of war and destruction. This is at a time when 600 million human beings on our planet are suffering from malnutrition  when 1.5 billion people are without shelter or are living in tragic circumstances  and when more than one quarter of the world's children are deprived of education and proper nutrition. It would have been far better for those many billions spent on menacing humanity with a horrible world massacre to have been spent on meeting the needs of the poor countries and raising the living standards of their peoples.194.	Most of the statements delivered at the second special session on disarmament last June portrayed a tragic picture of today's world. They urgently and sincerely drew attention to the dangers facing humanity because of the uncontrollable armaments problem. They also pointed to the gloomy fate awaiting all mankind. They expressed the desire of the non- nuclear countries—which constitute the great majority of the world community—to protect themselves against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. They called for the banning of nuclear tests and for a halt to the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons and the destruction of the present stockpiles. They advocated the establishment of zones of peace  as well as nuclear-free zones in the Middle East  Africa  South-East Asia and other parts of the world.195.	None the less  despite all these sincere and con¬tinuing calls and appeal  we are in fact witnessing the transfer to the aggressor countries of the most sophis¬ticated equipment of aggression. We can see that internationally banned weapons are being used. The world has recently witnessed tens of thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese citizens—mostly children  women and elderly people—falling victim to cluster bombs  vacuum bombs and nerve gases made in the United States of America  during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and its capital  Beirut.196.	Domination  exploitation  the plundering of national resources  persecution  aggression and the protection of the aggressor have become the rules guiding the conduct of imperialist  racist and Zionist threes in international relations. Most States Members of the United Nations and the world public have declared that international peace and security cannot be realized and stabilized until the principles of the Charter and international law replace the law of the jungle  and unless injustice  persecution and oppres-sion are eliminated and all forms of racism  including Zionism  are uprooted  unless peoples regain their usurped rights  and unless colonialism  neo¬colonialism  domination  hegemony and the plundering of the peoples' national resources are eradicated root and branch. We thus consider that the interna¬tional community must strive to realize the following objectives if we want to attain a better world  free from the tragedies and woes of war.197.	First  colonialism and neo-colonialism and all forms of racism and racial discrimination must be eliminated.198.	Secondly  in relations among countries  sover¬eignty and the rule of international law and the prin-ciples of right  justice and equity  including respect for the principle of the peoples' right to self- determination  must be consolidated. This would eliminate hegemony  oppression and aggression and remove the immediate and secondary causes of inter¬national crises and problems.199.	Thirdly  the United Nations must be strength¬ened so as to prevent it from becoming immobilized and so as to affirm the credibility and effectiveness of its resolutions and enhance its capabilities to address and solve various issues  guided by the Charter and the principles for which it was created.200.	Fourthly  the specter of the cold war and of international tension must be banished and the mad race in both conventional and nuclear weapons halted  and we must persist in our efforts to ban the produc¬tion  stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons.201.	Fifthly  an economic world order based on the relevant General Assembly resolution must be estab¬lished  in order to bridge the great gap and remove the major discrepancies between the advanced and developing countries and to create a greater balance in relations between the developed countries and third world countries.202.	A review of the current international situation shows very clearly the great distance separating the present status of international affairs from the status we desire and hope for. We notice  rather  that problems are increasing and being further complicated and that sources of tension in the world are being dangerously aggravated and becoming a serious threat to international peace and security.203.	The racist regime in Pretoria  like the racist Zionist regime in Palestine  has not only detonated explosive situations of conflict and tension  but its practices have always been an affront to humanity and a blot on its history. The peoples of South Africa and Namibia are still being made to labour under the yoke of injustice and colonialism by the racist minority regime. The Organization must take a firm stand in confronting the conspiracies and manipu¬lations of the imperialist forces  in order to save those peoples from their enslavers and oppressors by sup¬porting and backing their national liberation move-ments and by extending to them effective material aid in their struggle for their rights to self-deter-mination  independence and national sovereignty and in order to deter that racist regime from persisting in its acts of aggression against neighbouring coun¬tries  particularly Angola. We appeal to the Security Council to take the measures provided for in the Charter in order to put an end to this regime and to its practices and acts of aggression.204.	The Assembly is still considering an item on the situation in Afghanistan and its consequences for international peace and security. It is our opinion that the Afghan Government has the right to defend the independence of Afghanistan against all types of outside intervention in its internal affairs. We have close historical and cultural relations with Afghanistan; moreover it is a member of the non-aligned movement  and we are keen that it should always remain so. The Afghan people are fully entitled to choose their own system of government. We therefore attach great importance to the conducting of negotiations between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its neighbors in order to achieve peaceful solutions that would guarantee the security and stability of that region and preserve the unity  independence and non-alignment of Afghanistan.205.	The question of Cyprus is at a standstill to this very day despite the number of years that have passed since it first arose. We sincerely hope that negotiations between the two Cypriot communities will resume under the auspices of the Secretary-General  in accordance with United Nations resolutions  on the basis of respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of Cyprus.206.	The problem of the unification of Korea is still unsolved  despite the new initiative and proposals submitted by the Government of the People's Demo¬cratic Republic of Korea. We support the unification of Korea on the just and practical bases suggested by the Pyong Yang Government.207.	A sad and regrettable war took place in the South Atlantic. The question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) awaits discussion during this session of the General Assembly. We call for the resumption of negotiations between the two parties concerned  namely  Argentina and the United Kingdom  under the auspices of the United Nations  in order to find a peaceful settlement based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the principles of the Charter. The efforts of the Secretary-General in this respect are both necessary and desirable in order to facilitate the realization of the desired peaceful settlement.208.	The dangerous and tragic situation in the Middle East clearly reflects the disruption which the interna¬tional community has undergone as a result of the constant Israeli aggression. The tragedy of the Pal¬estinian people and the whole Middle East region dates back to the establishment of Israel on the soil of Palestine. Much suffering and bleeding continue as a result of the plots of world Zionism to establish a racist empire starting in Palestine and extending to other parts of the Arab world  defined by the Zionist doctrine as being from the Nile to the Eu¬phrates—an empire that would dominate the Middle East and control the international situation through such hegemony  because of the strategic and economic importance of the Middle East  which is the meeting point for three continents in the heart of the Arab World  adjacent to the strategic interests of the great Powers  in addition to the known huge energy reserves and revenues of this region.209.	The Zionist peril  with its racialist nature and expansionist aims  is not confined to the Arab world. It has  rather  become a growing  immediate danger jeopardizing the security and interests of all the peoples of the world.210.	World Zionism is plotting to become  through its control of the region and its natural resources—energy ranking foremost—a force controlling this basic com¬modity and forcing the world to deal with the region through it. This explains the aggressive attitude of world Zionism and its base  Israel  built on a permanent callous contempt of the nations  organizations and international institutions of the world.211.	From the beginning of this year  Israel has refused to implement the following Security Council resolutions: 497 (1981)  and resolutions 508 (1982)  509 (1982)  511 (1982) to 513 (1982) and 515 (1982) to 521 (1982). It has also refused to abide by the reso¬lutions of the General Assembly passed at its special emergency sessions this year. AH this should be added to the long list of United Nations and other interna¬tional resolutions.212.	The Arab Palestinian people have paid a very dear price for the scandalous collusion between British imperialism in Palestine and world Zionism  which led to opening the gates of Palestine for Jewish immigration and facilitating the establishment of Israel at the expense of the Arab Palestinian people and their homeland. The Palestinians are still being forced to continue to pay the price in the form of expulsion and mass murder. They still suffer from homelessness  deprived of their lands and their homes. They still aspire  with great yearning and determi¬nation  to the restoration of the homeland which has been usurped and the rights which have been violated. The Arabs have paid very dearly for the collusion between world Zionism and the Western countries  which have renounced all their commitments towards the Arabs and supported the establishment of the Hebrew State  extending to it all means of aggression.213.	In 1948 the Israelis introduced the slogan of ""negotiating peace with the Arabs"" and under this false pretext occupied the demilitarized zone  which was under Arab control and supervision. In 1967  under the motto of ""security""  the Israelis launched the June aggression and then began to build settlements in the newly occupied Arab territories. Now they demand security for these settlements  built on the occupied Arab lands  contrary to international instru¬ments  the principles of international law and United Nations resolutions.214.	Israel has refused to implement all international resolutions calling for its withdrawal from the Arab lands that it occupied in 1967  and it has rejected all peace initiatives  including the American initiatives. It rejected and foiled both the Jarring and Rogers initiatives. AH international efforts to determine the borders of the State of Israel have failed. A num¬ber of Israeli leaders have introduced an insolent  dangerous and arrogant definition of borders  unpre¬cedented in history  by declaring that Israel's borders stretch to wherever the Israeli soldier can reach. Such a definition simply means continued aggression and constant expansion until the dreams of world Zionism are achieved by the establishment of the Zionist empire in the Arab world. In a notorious statement  reminiscent of the Nazi concepts which were de¬nounced by all mankind  the Israeli Minister of Defense states that he believes that Israel's lebensranum will stretch to include Pakistan in the east and North African countries in the west.215.	On 14 December 1981 Israel's Knesset enacted a ""law"" annexing the Syrian Golan Heights. This annexation was rejected by the Security Council in its resolution 497 (1981) and by the General Assembly in resolution ES-9/1 of 5 February 1982 at its ninth emergency special session. During this year Israel's threats against the Arab countries and Palestinian people have escalated. Israel has continued to pursue its aggressive policy by bombarding Lebanon's towns and villages  and the whole world knows about the savagery of Israel's shelling of Beirut  which killed hundreds of innocent victims. On 4 June Israel's army launched an all-out attack on Lebanon  preceded by air and sea raids on various Lebanese areas.216.	Despite Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982)  the Israeli invaders continued their advance till they besieged Beirut and unleashed on it an inferno of bombs from the air  land and sea in a way unprecedented in the history of war. In one day the Lebanese capital was hit by over 250 000 Israeli bombs and rockets  as reported by the world news agencies at the time.217.	In this war  the Israelis killed tens of thousands of people  mostly civilians—women  children and elderly people. They also displaced hundreds of thousands and destroyed villages  towns and civilian installations. Even hospitals and places of worship were not spared. They used internationally banned weapons. And all this came under the title of ""Peace for Gallilee"".218.	A survey of Israeli decisions  together with the statements of Israeli leaders  shows us that the aggres¬sion on Lebanon had the following objectives: first  to liquidate the PLO and displace the Palestinians anew; secondly  to control Lebanon through what they call the establishment of ""a strong Government""  as if any Government installed by foreign occupation can ever be ""strong""; thirdly  to impose a ""peace treaty"" on the State of Lebanon; fourthly  to usurp parts of Lebanon—witness Israel's current measures in the occupied Lebanese territory  where attempts are under way to plunder the waters of the Litani river and to create a new settlement; and  fifthly  to deal a military blow to Syria  and weaken it in order to weaken Arab resistance to Israeli aggression  since Syria is the base and pivot of this resistance.219.	To realize those aims  Israel began its invasion of Lebanon  in which tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese were massacred and towns and villages were destroyed. To realize those aims  Israel's forces entered Beirut  in spite of an agreement arranged by President Reagan's envoy  Mr. Philip Habib  in spite of the United States guarantees that the Israeli forces  after the implementation of the agreement  would never enter Beirut  and although we were repeatedly in¬formed that the Israeli forces would start withdrawing from around Beirut as a first step towards complete withdrawal.220.	Then came the horrible massacre perpetrated by the Israeli forces of occupation in the refugee camps of Sabra  Shatila and other localities. Israeli forces beat burned and massacred more than 1 400 innocent Palestinian citizens  mostly women and children  in a bloodbath reminiscent of the massacre of Deir Yassin  perpetrated by Begin on 9 April 1947. This horrible carnage  which exceeds all the crimes of nazism  confirms that a genocidal war of extermination is being waged by Israel against the Palestinian and Lebanese people before the very eyes of the whole world.221.	The storming of Beirut and the horrible massacre committed there despite the aforementioned agree¬ment  and despite American pledges  calls into ques¬tion the value and credibility of the guarantees given by a super-Power like the United States of America. It also casts grave doubts on the validity of such guarantees whenever Israel is involved m a problem.222.	The practices of the leaders of Israel show that they are indeed a terrorist gang that has not learned the lessons of history. They have not learned from past records  nor do they wish to understand the present or future. Crime has blotted out their vision  and racism has completely blurred their perception of the present and the future.223.	Those leaders must realize that the Arab masses  which throughout history ha ve gone into battle for their cause and their dignity  will not be cowed by Israeli terrorism or by the crimes of the Israeli leaders. They must realize that sooner or later they will pay a high price for the hideous crimes they have committed and commit still  and that a just punishment will be inflicted sooner or later. Never in history has a tyrant escaped punishment. The crimes the Israelis are committing against the Arab nations will only strengthen cur determination to resist aggression and strengthen our commitment to our cause and to final victory. We are aware that we have chosen the hard path  the path which is paved with suffering  blood and sacrifice. But we shall pursue our march regardless of the immensity of the sacrifices and the difficulties. We have no choice but to struggle to liberate our land and preserve the future of our nation. Our road is long and agonizing  the road of freedom is always difficult and bloody  but it is the road to victory.224.	The international community has rejected the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  and that invasion has been condemned by all nations and peoples of the world  individually and collectively. But is that enough  in the face of this perilous situation?225.	The countries which voted in favor of admitting Israel to membership of the Organization based their approval on the Israeli pledge that Israel would be a peace-loving State  committed to the Charter and the principles of the United Nations. Are not Israel's racist crimes  its barbarous acts of aggression  its invasion of Lebanon and the war of extermination it is waging against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples enough to make those countries reconsider their attitude to that State  which was originally founded on aggression and which has grown and expanded through ag¬gression?226.	Another question is directed specifically to the United States of America  since it supplies the ag-gressors with all the means of aggression  killing and destruction in the form of the most modem products of the American arsenal. Are the Israelis committing these criminal acts to serve their racist Zionist interests or on behalf of the United States and its interests?227.	If Israel's crimes against the Arabs are not com¬mitted on behalf of the United States or its interests  why does it provide this support and backing to Israel? Why does it give Israel the most modem American aircraft and missiles  and reconnaissance  detection and jamming equipment? Why does it give Israel cluster bombs and chemical weapons  which are interna¬tionally prohibited? Is this consistent with the responsi¬bilities of the United States  a permanent member of the Security Council  under the Charter?228.	Is peace in the region and throughout the world achieved through wars  by killing tens of thousands  by rendering millions homeless and by destroying towns and villages?229.	The United States of America bears a special responsibility for all Israel's crimes and acts of aggres¬sion against the Arabs. Therefore  the United States should immediately withdraw its political and military protection from Israel and should pave the way for the international community to impose sanctions against that racist aggressor State  to end all types of assist¬ance  including military and economic aid  and to suspend the participation of Israel in the Organization.230.	Those who have not helped in the past to isolate Israel and impose sanctions against it are today required to translate their condemnation of the aggres¬sion into punishment of the aggressor.231.	The history of the First and Second World Wars proves that condoning aggression has always encouraged the commission of further aggression. The lenient attitude towards the Nazis during the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia encouraged them to invade Poland  an act which led to the eruption of the Second World War. Taking a lenient attitude towards the aggressor on the pretext of leaving the possibility open of persuading it to desist from its aggressive policies can lead only to more acts of aggression  more crimes and more disregard of the will of the international community.232.	No country in the world—either in the ancient or in the modem world—has a record as dark as Israel's. It is a record abounding in racist crimes  acts of aggression  wars and crimes against humanity. Israel has thus exceeded all the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and the Fascist forces during the first half of this century. Recent history has not seen another aggressor like Israel  which has shelled houses with bombs of a type never before used in war  thereby killing countless innocent women  children and elderly people. A look at the destroyed  burnt and bereaved city of Beirut is proof enough of the nature of Israel and of its aims.233.	In spite of all this the Israelis still claim that they want peace. Is that any different from what the Nazis used to say when they were destroying towns and villages and killing the innocent population  including women and children? Israelis claim they want peace; what they want is the peace of the grave.234.	Peace cannot be bused on aggression  oppres¬sion  killing and destruction; nor can it be based on racist and aggressive doctrines. The Arabs believe in the importance of establishing a just and lasting peace in the region. They also understand the repercussions of events in the region on the interests and the future of the peoples of the world. But they should not have to pay a price for their belief in peace  justice and right.235.	Despite all the tragedies suffered by the Arabs as a result of the aggressive presence of the Israelis in the region  and in spite of the wars waged by Israeli troops in Lebanon against the Arab nation  at the recent Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez  a peace plan was announced based on the following principles: first  complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories; secondly  recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to return  to self-determination and to establish their own inde¬pendent State under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative; and  thirdly  the formulation by the Security Council of the guarantees of peace. The Security Council would guarantee the implementation of these principles  which are based on two things: the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Charter  and the Arabs' conviction that peace is important and necessary for the international com¬munity.236.	In announcing these principles  which are recog¬nized by the United Nations and by most countries of the world  the Arabs are well aware that Israel is seeking not peace based on right and justice  but rather to impose capitulation by force  aggression and oppression.237.	Today more than ever before we are confident that the Arabs will defeat the aggressor. They will struggle by all means possible to recover their rights and resist aggression  for in doing this they will be defending not only their rights  interests and dignity  but those of all other nations as well.238.	The night of the aggressor shall not weaken our struggle against aggression; it will only strengthen and consolidate this struggle. We are confident that our Arab nation  despite its present state of affairs  will concert its efforts and potential to repel aggression and injustice and to fight humiliation and subjugation.239.	The States Members of the United Nations are required today to take a clear and specific stand to protect international peace and security and to safeguard the Charter. Such a stand requires a reso¬lution that provides for  first  ceasing all kinds of dealings between the Members of the Organization and Israel; secondly  asking the United States of America to stop all forms of military  economic and political assistance to Israel; thirdly  adopting a resolution abrogating General Assembly resolu¬tion 273 (III) of 1949 under which Israel was admitted to United Nations membership; fourthly  extending all forms of assistance and backing to the Arab coun¬tries to resist and confront the aggression.240.	A resolution to that effect would not only repel the aggression but would consolidate the role of the Organization and prevent the threat to peace and security not only in the Middle East region but also throughout the world. It is high time that the Organiza¬tion adopted a practical position to face the series of Israeli acts of aggression; otherwise one would be skeptical about the usefulness of the Organization.241.	While asking all countries of the world to back up and support Arab rights  which are the victim of Israeli aggression  we renew our determination to continue the struggle by all means to defend our threatened existence and to restore our usurped rights  no matter how difficult  arduous and long our path may be. Difficulties and hardships will never hinder or restrict the struggle of the people for their liberty and dignity."
"129",6686,"TCD",37,1982,"This session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is being held at a time of acute international tensions and a world economic crisis of singular gravity. The entire international community is facing numerous problems which require from us as government officials a critical analysis conducive to appropriate solutions being sought in the higher interest of international peace and security as well as for the prosperity of our peoples and nations. In order to achieve those noble objectives  it is more than ever essential that the Members of the Organization scrupulously honor the obligations that they have assumed under the Charter. The whole world unanimously deplores the inability of the United Nations to resolve the major problems of our day  but what we do not denounce enough is the fact that such weakness on the part of the United Nations is the immediate consequence of the lack of political will of each of its Members to behave in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter. This is why our delegation unreservedly supports the highly intelligent recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization as regards strengthening its role and especially the action of the Security Council for maintaining international peace and security.$49By electing Mr. Hollai President of its thirty- seventh session  the General Assembly affirmed its trust in his outstanding qualities as a diplomat and experienced statesman. In so doing it crowned his long career  which has been basically directed towards international relations. My delegation  confident in his ability to conduct the work of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly successfully  extends its warm congratulations to him and assures him of its full co-operation in his difficult but exalting responsibilities. I should like also to express the esteem and appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Kittani  his predecessor  who accomplished his noble work with courage and dignity in spite of the complexity of the tragic events that have shaken the world throughout the past year. Lastly  it is an agreeable duty for me to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless and most commendable efforts during the first year of his term of office in attempting to find peaceful solutions to the disputes that divide certain Member States. He may be assured of the readiness of the Government of Chad to help him in his future work for world peace and development.Before briefly expressing my delegation's position on certain important items of the agenda of the present session  I should like  as the representative of a country which has been the subject of conversation internationally in recent years because of the long and tragic situation of war that it has experienced  to outline the situation now prevailing in Chad.While it is true that peace in Chad was restored only at the cost of great sacrifices  it is equally true that the tragedy endured for almost 20 years by our people was not without cause. War is never a matter of fate. In order better to grasp the true dimensions of the peace and security restored by the people of Chad last 7 June  it would be useful for me to outline briefly the internal and external causes of the tragedy experienced by my country.The first major people's revolt in Chad after independence dates back to 1965. It was a genuinely national revolt  directed against an oppressive system imposed from outside. Through that war for national liberation  directed by the National Liberation Front  which courageously faced the neo-colonial troops and other expeditionary bodies  there were many people of Chad who saw their loved ones fall  their villages bumed and their homes plundered. Many were also forced into exile. The regime of the day  which had become anachronistic and dictatorial  supported as it was by troops from the former metropolitan country  in 1975 fell victim to its own mistake of attempting to impose itself on our people against their will. Thus its own army seized power from it. Unfortunately  the hopes raised were soon disappointed.Instead of offering the people of Chad dialogue and reconciliation  the military junta in tarn committed the same mistakes and bloodthirsty acts as the former regime. Defying the six-month cease-fire that had been unilaterally declared by the National Liberation Front  whose Armed Forces of the North are the patriotic branch  the junta maintained a policy of repression and neo-colonial war. It was only in 1978 that the military regime  undermined by its notorious inability to meet internal and external challenges  accepted  for tactical reasons  the historic compromise of the Khartoum agreement. That was the first time since the popular uprisings of 1965 that an agreement frankly set forth the different problems of Chad and proposed comprehensive and lasting solutions.A/37/PV.30The implementation of the basic charter that emerged from the Khartoum agreement would have spared our people a great deal of suffering. Unfortunately  however  that charter was interpreted in different ways  which quickly led to a governmental crisis. Despite the twofold proposal of the Armed Forces of the North  to consult lawyers of internationally recognized competence if problems of a legal nature arose  or to amend the charter if the problem was of a political nature; despite our people's desire for peace as expressed in many demonstrations-yes  despite all that  part of the neo-colonial army  mobilized along personal  tribal  religious and regional lines  took the dangerous step  on 12 February of opening fire on students whose only fault was that to call for the peaceful and immediate implementation of the basic charter. The results of that war are known to all of us: massacre of the civilian population and a breakdown of trust among the regional components of our people; above all  that war opened the door for additional interference by foreign forces.Supported by our people  and without external support  the Armed Forces of the North emerged victorious from that trial. The balance of power was in our favor. None the less  Comrade Hissein Habre stated that there were neither victors nor vanquished and that it would be possible for the people of Chad to reach an understanding among themselves-but without foreign interference. We therefore proposed to the other components the Kano-1 meeting in order to widen the power base by including all people of Chad who would participate in genuine reconciliation.In spite of the Kano agreements  which called on all neighboring States not to interfere in the internal affairs of Chad  certain Powers  sensing that they were losing ground on the Chad political chessboard  hastily formed armed factions along ethnic lines and that would serve their own interests. Unfortunately  at the Kano-11 meeting we failed in our patriotic attempt to remove some of our brothers from external domination; thus we were composed of H political-military factions when we met in Lagos in August 1979.In spite of our conviction about the anti-national character of certain political-military factions  we nevertheless agreed to sign the Lagos agreement. That agreement reiterated the call to all neighboring States not to interfere in Chad's internal affairs. An important point in that agreement was the establishment of a consensus Government  whose term of office was set as 18 months  with the task of preparing free elections and completing the work of national reconciliation. The President of that Government would therefore have no personal powers.In flagrant violation of the provisions of the Lagos agreement  a neighboring country and other foreign Powers openly intervened in our affairs. Despite our determination to avoid war and in spite of the mediation offered by eminent national and foreign personalities  certain factions  feeling strong because of their external support  unleashed the war of 21 March. By attacking elements of the Armed Forces of the North  the nucleus of the integrated national army envisaged in the Lagos agreement  that coalition brought about the start of another war-one which was certainly the deadliest and the longest that our people has had to endure. After nine months of national resistance  in the face of what became a plot to recolonize Chad  which met with a staunch resistance with the exclusive support of our people  on 15 December 1980 we undertook tactical withdrawal in order to spare our people from genocide and to deal in an appropriate manner with the occupier's overwhelming superiority in weaponry.As the occupying forces established themselves on our territory  the national and international public realized their real intentions and those of the coalition. At the same time  the patriotic struggle continued with a resolve matched only by our love for our homeland and our dedication to the universal values of freedom and dignity. It was in that context that the enemy was to begin the withdrawal of its troops. We then unilaterally and immediately decreed a cease-fire  with no prior conditions. Our desire for peace led us to give unreserved support to the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity of 11 February 1982. It was that same desire for dialogue and peace which governed the rate at which we advanced on the capital. For more than four months we intentionally delayed taking the capital  in the sole hope of softening the belligerent attitude of our brothers. It was that same desire for peace and dialogue among the Chad people that underlay the successive visits of Comrade Hissein Habre to Gabon and Zaire  after the N'Djamena meeting.Today once again  before the Assembly  we affirm our attachment to the spirit of dialogue  without bitterness or ulterior motives. We solemnly invite all our brothers  including the former officials  to reflect on the wise words of Comrade Hissein Habre:""Let us bury the recriminations of unwarranted  unjustifiable and sterile hatred; let us exercise restraint and still our emotions; let us arm ourselves with common sense and reason; let us work for the benefit of the homeland and the people  and let us respond to its hopes of peace and unity  rather than attempt to bind the people to our whims.""And we invite them to return to Chad  as many have already done  for the sake of peace and reconstruction.Although this outline has been lengthy  we believe it was necessary in order to provide an accurate picture of the dynamics of war in whose grip Chad so recently found itself.For the first time since 1978  a single administration effectively controls the 14 sub-divisions of our country. This is also the first time since 1965 that security has prevailed throughout our national territory. We are gratified to affirm before the Assembly that peace and security have been achieved following a long patriotic struggle and that they remain our constant objective.The people of Chad remain touched by the sympathy expressed towards our cause by fraternal African peoples and all people of good will. Hence  we should like to express our deep gratitude to the African heads of State for their selfless contribution and especially to the founding President of the Togolese People's Assembly  General Gnassigbe Eyadema who  at the risk of his life  went in the midst of war to N'Djamena to attempt to obtain a cease-fire. We also extend our thanks to our great pan-African organization  the Organization of African Unity.These achievements are and will remain fragile and could at any time be lost if Chad's neighboring and other countries do not stop from interfering in our internal affairs by encouraging the people of Chad to rekindle the flames of war. We would therefore recall that States are duty bound to respect the principles inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU  in particular  the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of others  respect for territorial integrity  national independence and the non-acquisition of territories by Aarce.After the restoration of peace and the beginning of national reconciliation  a Council of State was established in order to guarantee the continuity of the State and the management of the affairs of the country. A Government will be formed on the basis of consultations which are now under way. It will have as its task the completion of reconciliation among all the people of Chad  a start on the work of national reconstruction and the creation of favorable conditions for the establishment of democratic institutions.Peace and security do not suffice to guarantee genuine stability in a country if they are not supported by action for socio-economic development. Chad  already disadvantaged by its situation as a land-locked country  has suffered from a dislocated economy since independence. The combined effects of drought and war have worsened its already alarming economic situation. In fact  at this very moment the country is devastated  most public and social buildings have been destroyed  our economic and highways infrastructure is in a state of complete disrepair  communications with other countries are almost non-existent  hospitals and schools lack staff and equipment  people in certain regions are dying of hunger and the massive return of refugees is posing a problem as regards their resettlement and rehabilitation; and the list goes on.Chad intends to maintain friendly relations with other countries which are mutually beneficial  but without infringing upon its freedom of judgment and action. By the same token  we reaffirm our firm attachment to the principles of the immutability of frontiers bequeathed by colonization and of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It is in this spirit that Comrade Hissein Habre reaffirmed in his statement to the nation of 18 June that:""Our international relations are guided by the relevant principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU: non-interference and mutually advantageous and reciprocally friendly cooperation; positive and dynamic non-alignment which in no way excludes our taking a position on various subjects of international interest; the implacable struggle against hegemony  whatever its source and active solidarity with all neighboring countries. We firmly state that Chad will never be a base for subversion or aggression against fraternal neighboring countries'For several years now constant conflicts have marked the relations among States Members of the Organization; recourse to the threat or use of force  political  diplomatic  economic and military pressures are common currency. This has led the Secretary- General in his report on the work of the Organization to state: ""We are perilously near to a new international anarchy"".These acts of insecurity are leading to the proliferation of hotbeds of crisis the world over. This applies especially to the question of Western Sahara  the situation in southern Africa  the problem of the Middle East and conflicts in Asia.The problem of Western Sahara has become an alarming one for the international community and especially for Africa. My country has continually called for a peaceful solution to this problem in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and of the United Nations  and in particular in accordance with the decisions adopted at the eighteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Nairobi in June 1981.In southern Africa  our major concern remains the establishment of genuine freedom. We must restore dignity to our African brothers who are suffering in Namibia and Azania  the last bastions of the most blatant form of colonialism. As regards the Namibian problem  the international community is aware today that the South African regime does not understand the language of dialogue  but rather that of force. The racist regime in Pretoria and its allies do not wish to let go of Namibia  but to continue to exploit the wealth of that Territory. That racist regime could not have adopted such an arrogant attitude or have rejected the determination of the international community had it not relied on the assistance and support of its allies.We reaffirm our steadfast support for the South West Africa People's Organization  the authentic representative of the Namibian people  and call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in order to establish a cease-fire and proceed to free elections. We urge the countries which continue their economic  cultural  military and nuclear co-operation with the racist regime of South Africa to put an end to these relations and to cooperate sincerely with the United Nations so as to achieve a rapid solution to the Namibian problem.In South Africa itself  the racists stick to their policy of segregation in its most demeaning form  thereby perpetuating the greatest scourge of mankind. My delegation cannot fail to reiterate its condemnation of that hateful system. It also condemns the aggression against and invasion of the People's Republic of Angola  as well as the constant violation of the territories of other front-line States by racist troops.The crisis which is unsettling the Horn of Africa is not likely to foster unity and cohesion in our continent but  rather  to perpetuate permanent tension. We venture to hope that the two fraternal countries will finally come to the negotiating table to find a peaceful solution to their dispute.As regards the situation in the Middle East  many initiatives have been undertaken by the international community  but unfortunately they have not been followed up in a promising way because of the warlike attitude of the State of Israel. Everyone is convinced that the outcome of this conflict  which has been of concern to peoples who cherish peace and freedom for more than a quarter of a century  rests on the implementation of the resolutions of the Organization. This involves the evacuation by the Jewish State of ail Arab and Palestinian territories which it occupies; the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable rights to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State in its own homeland; the recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole representative of the Palestinian people; recognition of and respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of each State in the region and the right of each State to live in peace within internationally recognized borders.My delegation condemns the invasion of Lebanon by Israel and the abominable massacre of Palestinian civilians in Sabra and Shatila. The international community is duty bound to apply sanctions against Israel under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.The conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  two neighboring Islamic countries  has already caused considerable losses in human life and material damage. In principle we reject any recourse to violence in solving a dispute which might arise between States and this is why my delegation reiterates here its appeal to the two parties for a cease-fire and for a peaceful solution to the problem. Consequently  we support the ongoing initiative within the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other initiatives which might help to bring about peace in that region.In Asia  the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue to be a source of concern to us. The continuation of the situations in those two countries and their regional and international effects emphasize the urgent need for peaceful solutions that could restore internal and regional peace. Such solutions necessarily involve the withdrawal of foreign troops  and strict respect for the independence and territorial integrity of those countries  and a settlement allowing the two peoples to determine their own fate in full sovereignty.Similarly  regarding Korea  we support the principle of the peaceful reunification of the two parts of the country  without external interference  and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula.Another political question merits comment-disarmament. The second special session of the General Assembly on that question  which opened in a spirit of euphoria  has somewhat dashed the hopes placed in it  inasmuch as its work has not led to any tangible results; however  it Las en Ale J not only Member States  international organizations  governmental and non-governmental organizations  but also the public to become fully aware of 4he danger inherent in the possession of nuclear and chemical weapons and  consequently  of the absolute necessity to freeze them immediately and gradually destroy them. Enormous resources  both human and financial  would thereby be freed and could be devoted to development.Fortunately  since dialogue between the major Powers has not ceased  my delegation remains convinced that wisdom will prevail over any negative considerations that could lead the world into a nuclear holocaust  which would spare no one.The world is living in a state of expectation  but the margin for optimism is a thin one  especially because other phenomena of domination and destabilization of small countries  such as the use of mercenaries  continue to develop. Indeed  in recent years there has been a renewal of acts of aggression by mercenaries and other irregular elements against countries attempting to enjoy political sovereignty and independence. Their activities are threatening international peace and security in the same way as armed conflicts between countries. The people of Chad has suffered firsthand the effects of those activities. That is why we urge the Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries to conclude its work and produce a convention very soon.Development questions are also of concern to the Organization and have been since its creation  and the struggle against the inequity of the international economic system is part and parcel of the struggle the international community must wage. Indeed  here we are in the middle of the Third United Nations Development Decade and still uncertain about our future. The problems which the developing countries have to face are increasing even though it is true that no efforts have been spared to find a solution-for example  the fifth session of UNCTAD  the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly  the creation of UNIDO to promote the industrial development of States  and many other initiatives.In spite of efforts to ensure our development and in spite of the levels of international negotiation  the gap continues to widen between the economies of the developed countries and those of the developing countries.The ills of international economic relations are more structural than cyclical. They include the increased deficit in the balance of payments of the poor countries  the continual deterioration in the terms of trade  ever growing inflation  rigid and unfavorable conditions for the transfer of technology  which are compounded by obstacles and limitations imposed on access by developing countries to international financial markets.We must add to those the vicissitudes of nature for some of these countries  such as Chad-landlocked  insular  prone to drought  and so on. To be sure  not everything is so negative  as shown by the adoption in April of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.' But there is a serious degeneration of the very spirit which should guide the new concept of international economic co-operation. That widens even further the gap between North and South-a source of political instability the world over. For that reason my delegation recalls that the gradual establishment of a new economic order requires  first  the democratization of international relations  which necessitates the overhauling and strengthening of international institutions. It would be desirable for the developed countries to practice policies compatible with the interests of the developing countries. That means the abandonment  to whatever degree  of the current tendency based only on solution of internal problems.The delegation of Chad draws the attention of the Assembly to decisions and resolutions the Organization has adopted in favor of geographically disadvantaged countries. These countries have great needs and would like both national and international financial institutions to pay particular attention to them. We believe that the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade should stimulate development in the third world. To do that  it is high time that we reformed the structures of the current economic system flowing from a global and integral approach to problems of the world economy with the participation of the whole international community.Certainly  the international community has not been unaware of these difficulties. It has shown its concern for our people since 1979. Thus  the General Assembly has adopted many resolutions on emergency aid and reconstruction assistance; the most recent -resolution 36/210 adopted in 1981-requests the Secretary-General to organize a pledging conference on assistance to Chad. In that connection  during my stay in New York I have had talks with the representative of the current Chairman of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kenya  with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and with the Administrator of UNDP  to whom I have expressed the earnest desire of my country to see that conference take place before the end of this year. We are confident that the Secretary-General will organize this conference in which we hope to see the largest possible participation by lenders and international organizations. To that end  we repeat our appeal to the international community for emergency assistance to Chad and for effective participation by lenders in the conference.Chad seeks only to live in peace and understanding with all countries that love peace and justice  in particular with its neighbors. It is in this spirit that we wish to refer here to a situation that has been of concern to the people of Chad since 1973  namely  the occupation of a part of our territory by a neighboring country  which occupation we have constantly condemned. This problem has already been raised in the OAU and the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations  and we still hope to see it solved peacefully. As soon as they entered N'Djamena  the Armed Forces of the North and the Council of State got in direct and indirect contact with that neighboring country  so as to create at the very outset detente between the two countries so that our two peoples might live in a climate of peace. In spite of our readiness for dialogue we are bound to note the silence on the other side; more serious still  there has been glaring interference.That was the message that I wished to impart to the Assembly  on behalf of my delegation. As representatives must have noted  owing to the special situation prevailing in our country  we have spoken at some length to state the concerns of our people. Our people has suffered too much from war and should now be entitled to lasting peace and its development with the assistance of friendly countries and the international community  to which we affirm that peace and security have been restored in Chad.Before concluding  we should like to repeat our appeal to the international community to help us effectively in the true battle that we intend henceforth to wage  that is  the reconstruction and development of Chad."
"130",6732,"TGO",37,1982,"In this last quarter of the twentieth century  the world is beset by upheavals which bode no good. We are seeing a major deployment of arms  to such an extent that a wise man of Africa rightly said that today the weapons of death are greater than those employed to ensure the survival of humanity. Palestinian and Lebanese peoples have been massacred by Israel  and the racist	regime in South Africa constitutes a continuing challenge to humanity at large  committing ever-increasing acts of arrogance and destruction against the front-line States. One's thoughts turn naturally to this painful question for the universal conscience: is there still hope of speaking of peace in a world of hatred?180.	As you are aware  Sir  you have acceded to the post of President of the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly at a critical moment for humanity. The United Nations was created to maintain and strengthen world peace  but today that peace is threatened more than ever. Thus we fully understand the complexity of your task. Your country  Hungary  has more than once experienced the complexity of events; therefore we are confident that your out-standing qualities as a seasoned diplomat  combined with your experience  drawn from the age-old history of your country  are assets that will enable you to guide our work  by calming passions  and creating the calm atmosphere essential to our deliberations. It is therefore  my agreeable duty to extend to you  both in my personal capacity and on behalf of the delegation of Togo  my heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly.181.	Your predecessor  Mr. President  did not have an easy task. With rare distinction  he rose above the general confusion and took a high stance in presiding over the deliberations  both those of the thirty-sixth session and those of the special session held during the course of his mandate. We extend to him our heartfelt congratulations.182.	We have all benefited from the unflagging concern of the Secretary-General  who  throughout almost a year in office  has been an able helmsman  a year in which our ship has crossed some storm- tossed seas. In his report he highlighted with characteristic sincerity the causes of those storms which threatened the existence of our States and our Organization. He deserves all our congratulations and thanks.183.	The key word which describes the international political situation this year is ""storm"". Can we still talk of peace when daily life is beset by war  assassination  kidnapping and persecution? One cannot ask that question without anguish  without despairing of the future for peace in the world.184.	Without being an evangelist  one has a clear impression that most of the conditions listed in the Apocalypse are now present. Not a day goes by without the teleprinters clattering out dispatches announcing the cold-blooded murder of innocent bystanders  or the explosion of a bomb which has destroyed apartment buildings at dawn while everyone was asleep or raids by racist Powers to destroy the already fragile economic infrastructures of developing countries  or the outbreak of what is in fact war in this or that country; the list is very long.185.	Invariably we return to the same question: should we despair of the world at this tumultuous end of the twentieth century? In other words  is the peace so necessary to the union and solidarity of peoples still possible? An examination of the various crises which afflict the world show that it is important to ask ourselves that agonizing question.186.	At the international level  the world economic crisis has reached a stage where an explosion is possible at any moment. The developing countries  emerging from the dark period of decolonization  started on bold programmes to revitalize their eco-nomies; but then came the energy crisis; we still have the aberrant system of the unequal trade; we still have the absurd increase of interest rates leading to the constant growth of the indebtedness of the poor countries to others; then there came the problem of the continual rise of the dollar  so that all their debts calculated in that currency are now quintupled  if not worse. Thus the efforts that they undertook have been cancelled out before having had any effect on their standard of living  on health  or on the level of education of their populations  which remain the most deprived in the world.187.	Even in the industrialized countries  the situation is no more encouraging. The crisis has reached unforeseen proportions. Factories have been closed and over 10 per cent of the population is unemployed 188.	In the face of such a crisis  unless the world takes care we will have the bitter surprise of living through another 1929; that is to say  a world crash which will hurl countries  all countries  into a cataclysm leading to a system rejected by mankind  one possibly worse than nazism  which grew out of the 1929 crisis. Will the rich come to their senses? For in such a crisis none will be spared. Let us stop talking of aid to the third world as if it were manna. The rich countries  as they realize the danger of a generalized crisis  must now understand that a global policy towards the developing coun-tries should be their main concern today. That global policy must be to raise the prices of raw materials  to stop any deterioration in the terms of trade  to do away with protectionist barriers in order to promote the trade of the developing countries and to enhance industrial redeployment and the transfer of technology  because there can be no viable development without industrialization. In ensuring an equitable distribution of the riches produced by the labour of all humanity  the rich countries will guarantee their own survival. But the danger would be great for all if the rich want to cling to that selfish policy of every man for himself which has produced poverty next door and a flood of poverty-stricken people which breeds criminals whose main concern is certainly not to guarantee tranquillity and peace for other people.189.	The industrialized world possesses the technology  whereas the young developing countries have substantial natural resources. The developed countries must know that it is the complementarity of the technology of their countries and the raw materials of the third world that will produce the balance necessary for peace in the world. If the rich manage to understand the need for this co-operation  then we may venture to talk of the possibilities of peace in the world at the end of the twentieth century.190.	Unfortunately  some States continue to think that complementarity is synonymous with the subjugation of the poorest to the richest of the earth and do not hesitate to use force to violate the independence and territorial integrity of other States and to flout their fundamental freedoms  disregarding the essential principles governing relations among nations and causing situations of tension  wars and destruction of human lives.191.	Thus the tragedies suffered by the peoples of the Middle East leave mankind perplexed and very often  in view of the absurdity of the massacres perpetrated by Israel  we have no traction because we do not understand. Indeed  about half a century ago  Hitler  on the basis of nazism  decided to annihilate part of mankind  the Jewish people. The nations of the entire world  to a man  rose to prevent the holocaust. And the Organization  through an historic vote  decided quite rightly that the Jewish people was entitled to a homeland  We fail to understand how today the State of Israel can refuse a homeland to another people  the Palestinian people; we cannot understand today how the Jewish people can have decided to annihilate part of mankind  the Palestinian people. Today  Beirut has been transformed by the Government of Israel into a place of extermination which oddly brings to mind certain camps where the Jewish people were literally massacred. Has that Government already forgotten the horrors of Oradour and the extermination perpetrated at Auschwitz? It is enough to cause the human conscience to despair. There Ss a double' standard  as has been quite rightly said by a famous French writer: ""Depending on whether you are powerful or poor  the verdict of the court will make you white or black."" The most elementary ethics seem not to exist for certain people.192.	Togo  for its pact  in view of the tragedy of the Middle East  has always supported and continue; to support the principle of negotiation  so that all peoples of the region can have a homeland  the only condition for guaranteeing peace and stability in the area.193.	From time to time Israel talks of negotiation  but negotiation requires several parties. If the side facing you is destroyed  then you will be the only one at the negotiating table and there can no longer be a question of negotiation.194.	There can be no possible explanation for the Beirut massacres. The Israeli population itself no longer understands its political leaders. The thousands of people killed were civilians  women  children and the elderly. It cannot even be said that those who were massacred were combatants. The pretext of terrorism used by Tel Aviv can no longer be taken seriously. Nazism  in wanting to exterminate the Jewish people  succeeded only in giving that people the only weapon left to it: terrorism. Prime Minister Begin has considerable experience of that and he will certainly remember it. Today  the massacres carried out against the Palestinian people have compelled that people to scatter to the four comers of the Middle East. By thus forcing the Palestinian people into a Diaspora  does the Government of Israel not see that it alone is creating the conditions which force the Palestinian people to use the only weapon left to it  one used by the Jewish people to gain a place under the sun  namely the weapon of terrorism? It is regrettable that the experience of nazism did not serve as a lesson. The mention of nazism reminds us of the concentration camps and the cremation ovens and we believe that the peoples who subscribed to the Charter had once and for all repudiated violence and killing as ways to settle disputes among nations. Therefore our conscience is sorely troubled by the savage massacres of Shatila and Sabra  since Israel was one of those which acceded to the Charter of San Francisco. Therefore  the Government and people of Togo join their voice in the general condemnation of the crime of genocide and demand that the responsibility of its perpetrators and their accomplices be brought to light.195.	In passing  we salute the memory of those martyrs who fell to the cowardly vengeance of those who believe that the Israeli invasion of foreign territories was the panacea for the problem of the Middle East  whereas the reality of the Palestinian fact is more than ever compelling.196.	Still on the subject of the Middle East  we note that two events have appeared recently which give us a glimmer of hope  notwithstanding the intransigence of the Government of Israel. The first was the acceptance by Yasser Arafat of the United Nations resolutions on the problems of the Middle East in their entirety. At the same time  the majority of the Arab countries are moving progressively towards recognition of the State of Israel. These elements  curiously  instead of being viewed by Tel Aviv as positive data  were played down by them. In a process of belligerence we must not always want to bring the adversary to his knees before envisaging any negotiation. History is full of telling examples: the Allies  in 1918 as in 1945  did not demand that Germany change its Constitution before any peace negotiations took place. The Allies negotiated with Germany as it was and the fundamental law creating the Federal Republic of Germany  for example  was passed much later. It is odd to lay down as a pre-condition to any negotiation on the Middle East a complete renunciation by the protagonist of ail his principles  since the aim of negotiation is precisely to obtain reciprocal renunciations of positions.197.	The second event which provides a glimmer of hope was the change in the attitude of the United States with regard to that part of the world. Its positive vote in the Security Council on resolution 521 (1982) on the Lebanon massacre represents a meaningful dynamic element. If these events can combine to create a solution to the Middle East problem  then we may venture to say that it is not too rash to talk of the possibility  however minimal  of peace in the Middle East  which has suffered for more than 30 years. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in committing itself behind its leader Yasser Arafat to the realistic process of peace  will once again furnish proof of its maturity and acute sense of its responsibilities.198.	Can we still speak of peace at the end of the twentieth century while we witness what is happening in South Africa and Namibia? Pretoria continues to defy humanity at large with arrogance. By its dilatory manoeuvres Pretoria is doing everything to hold up Namibia's independence. Using the impunity it enjoys  the Government of South Africa is bent on systematically destroying the already fragile infrastructures of the independent countries of southern Africa. The repeated invasions of Angolan territory perpetrated by the racist troops of South Africa  the raids against the territory of Mozambique and infiltrations into Zimbabwe  Botswana and other front-line countries constitute genuine acts of provocation.199.	The experience of the independence of Zimbabwe where the leaders of that country  after a struggle to recover their freedom  managed to set up a multiracial regime and where Zimbabweans co-exist whatever the colour of their skin  is proof that Africa is capable in Namibia  too  of facing its responsibilities in accordance with its maturity. Therefore the fears that South Africa claims to have that in Namibia  under the direction of SWAPO  a non-democratic regime might be established are only a manoeuvre that does not fool anyone. Africa has already given proof of its ability to transcend ethnic differences. The majority of the Namibian people under SWAPO is resolved to follow this irreversible current of history to establish State structures designed for harmonious coexistence among the various social groups in the country. Africa fights the apartheid system and gives daily proof of its determination to see that system eliminated from the planet.200.	It is therefore odd that it is the champions of apartheid who dare to voice fears about the possibilities of coexistence among the various racial groups in Namibia. This is a pretextóan ill-chosen one at thatówhich Pretoria is using to perpetuate its domination over Namibia. But the independence of that country is inevitable. Pretoria's prevarications can do nothing. Nothing will come of the South African Government's attempts to destabilize the front-line States. The combined efforts of Africa  assisted by the gracious understanding of the international community  will hasten Namibia's independence. That is why we can state that there is every hope that that country's independence will become a reality soon. But the sooner that independence comes the greater the number of human lives that will be spared.201.	The agonizing question of whether we can still hope for peace in this tormented world of today arises when we take a look at the present situation in Chad. Fortunately for that country  we can say: yes  today peace and reconciliation are possible in Chad.202.	Togo would like to express its satisfaction publicly that for the first time in 17 years one can go to Chad without being greeted with the gun-fire and explosions of the civil war. The process of reconciliation has been started to the satisfaction of all. Since the which brought to the head of the State of Chad the new President Hissein Habre in June 1982  the desire of the leaders and political organizations in Chad has been made manifestóresolutely to commit themselves to a process of reconciliation and peace. The late lamented Ahmat Acyl  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the now defunct Transitional Government of National Union  had stated that he favoured the peace and reconciliation process advocated by President Habre. He even wrote a long letter about this to General Gnassingbe Eyadema  as Chairman of the ad Hoc Committee on Chad. The brutal death of Ahmat Acyl did not permit him to see that initiative through to the end. But today the situation has been normalized throughout the territory of Chad after the whole southern part of Chad rallied to that effort.203.	It is important that the international community at large join in the ongoing process of peace and reconciliation in Chad  rather than engaging in rearguard action based on the defence of unavowed interests which run counter to those of the people of Chad. We make an appeal to all States which cherish peace for them to do all they can to participate in this endeavour of national reconstruction.204.	The Middle East and Africa are not the only flash-points in the world  but it would be rash to attempt to review all conflict situations which contain the seeds of a general breakdown of world peace. However  we should mention the tragedies of Afghanistan and Kampuchea where people have been refused the right to self-determination. Togo hopes nevertheless that the coalition Government which has just been established will finally bring to the people of Kampuchea the peace for which it hopes.205.	At the beginning of July 1982 Togo was host of the Governmental Conference of the Zone of Africa for the Support of the Independent Peaceful Reunification of Korea and we reaffirm our solidarity with the Korean people. Our Government supports the pro-posals made by the great leader Kim 11 Sung to form the Democratic Confederation of Korea. It is obvious that the Korean people as a whole wants to see the reunification of the country and is opposed to any attempt that would lead to a perpetuation of the two Koreas.206.	Finally  the Organization of African Unity [6Mt/] recently lived through some serious events which have given rise to doubts as to its ability to surmount the gravest crisis in its history. We believe that there also we can hope for a solution to the OAU crisis for the sake of the vitally needed world peace. Now combined eventsóand not only the problems of the Sahraoui Arab Republicóhave given rise to a grave crisis within the OAU. We are convinced that African wisdom will finally triumph. Were the Sahraoui problem the only one  the Committee on self- determination established by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government could find a solution which would enable the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly to take place.207.	Togo is convinced that no African head of State wants to see the OAU break up  and that indeed no head of State of the international community wants to see the OAU break up  because it has shown how much it can contribute to peace in the world. A crisis of growth after 20 years is quite normal and it should not frighten us.208.	There will always be crises in the international organizations. Indeed  my delegation endorses the analysis of the Secretary-General about the causes of the ineffectiveness of the Organization  and which explains the crisis we are undergoing  which has unfortunately already broken out in the OAU.209.	While we accept that the present OAU crisis is one of growth which will enable it to gain further strength  we have serious doubts about the future of the United Nations  which has been in existence for almost 40 years. It is not normal that at this age the Organization should continue to see violated the fundamental principles to which States have freely subscribed. It is not normal that resolutions and decisions of the Organization be flouted. The profound upheavals in today's international life have arisen from these violations.210.	It is important that all States examine their conscience  not only about the principles of the Charter but also about the scope and implementation of United Nations resolutions and decisions.213.. My Government subscribes to the specific proposal contained in the Secretary-General's report for a meeting of the Security Council at the highest level to discuss the question of measures which might strengthen the effectiveness of the Organization. Togo has more than once shared its experience in the cause of peace  and has participated in several mediation meetings; it is convinced that the Secretary-General's proposal can lead to action to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization.214.	This is the price to be paid for the maintenance of peace in the world  and we need that peace to build a just and equitable society. As General Gnassingbe Byadema  the President-Founder of the Togo People's Party and President of the Republic  has stated: ""The Togolese people cherishes for itself and all nations a will for peace and progress. This peace must be real and must lead to the effective emancipation of our various nations. ""That is why we should like to make an appeal to the international community to combine all its efforts to build a world of peace  justice and freedom."
"131",6778,"THA",37,1982,"The Thai delega¬tion takes pleasure in joining with the preceding delegations in extending to the President its sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to his office for the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At a time when the Organization is assuming ever increasing responsibilities  not only in the preserva-tion of peace  but also for the security and well-being of peoples in all regions of the world  we are gratified to have a person of his demonstrable experience  skill and impartiality to preside over our deliberations. In the coming months  many issues vital to the general peace  progress and prosperity of the international community of which we are all a part will doubtless be brought before the General Assembly. On us will be focused much attention and of us much will and should be expected. For in the United Nations will be vested many of the hopes and aspirations of the world's peoples. My delegation therefore pledges to the President and Vice-Presidents of the Assembly  as well as to the Secretary-General and his able staff  its full co-operation in the discharge of the heavy responsibilities that lie ahead.187.	The delegation of Thailand also has the honor to convey its deep appreciation to Mr. Kittani  Presi¬dent of the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly  for his distinguished services on behalf of the Organi¬zation. His invaluable contributions to the interna¬tional community have earned for himself and his country the high esteem of Governments and peoples around the world.188.	The past year has been particularly momentous. The seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly  on the question of Palestine  has been reconvened a few times recently to consider the pressing situation in the Middle East and  in particular  the tragedy that has befallen Lebanon. The military aggression committed by Israel against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon  resulting in the terrible loss of innocent civilian lives  including those of women and children  has undermined efforts on the part of the international community to find a just and lasting settlement for the conflict in the Middle East. Moreover  the world was deeply shocked by the ruth¬less massacre in west Beirut following t.ie violation of the cease-fire agreements by Israeli armed forces.189.	My delegation urges that a full and impartial investigation be conducted by the United Nations  with the consent of the Lebanese Government and the co-operation of all parties concerned  so that the facts may become known and the culprits brought to justice as soon as possible. Meanwhile  Thailand wishes to join in calling for the expeditious and total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions so that the people of Lebanon can once again be the masters of their own destiny.190.	Interpretation of national security interests by one party can never be permitted to be so broad as to encompass the right to invade and occupy a sovereign and independent State  to dislodge people from their homelands or to subjugate them in occupied territories. The Government of Thailand deplores the fact that the Palestinian people continue to be denied their inalien¬able rights. Every effort must continue with urgency to enable them to attain and exercise their rights  including the right to self-determination without external interference  the right to national indepen¬dence and sovereignty and the right to return to their homes and properties.191.	At the same time as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  including the right to statehood  the legitimate rights of all States in the region to exist within secure and recognized borders must also be recognized in the interest of peace. It is my delegation's firm belief that the conflict in the Middle East  with the question of Palestine as its core issue  must find a negotiated solution with the par¬ticipation of all concerned including the PLO  which represents the Palestinian people.192.	The Lebanese crisis has proved that there is no effective military solution to the Middle East conflict and that military might not crush the legitimate aspirations of peoples. On the contrary  such aspira¬tions have gained greater international support and will be more fervently manifested. The course of events in the Middle East must be steered towards a peaceful political settlement; otherwise it might take an ever downward turn drawing all concerned into a spiral of increasing violence. My delegation therefore wel¬comes the recent pronouncements of the United States Government as a positive development.193.	However  while the State of Israel is a recog¬nized reality  the legitimacy of Palestinian yearnings for statehood must also be recognized. In this connec¬tion the Arab countries have announced the Fez plan  which marks a historic step and establishes a frame¬work for further dialogues and negotiations accept¬able to the Palestinians and the key Arab States. Provided that the plan takes due cognizance of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  prospects for widening the dialogue to include other interested parties seem more promising. It is the earnest hope of my delega¬tion that these welcome new developments and the recent deplorable events in Lebanon will help to intensify efforts to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict that will result in the attainment by the Palestinian people of their rights and the enjoyment by ali States  including Israel and Lebanon  of secure existence within their recognized borders.194.	Over 20 years after the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is regrettable to note that peoples in many parts of the world are still struggling for the dignity that only freedom and self-determination can bestow. The valiant struggle of the Palestinian people finds worthy parallels in the situations in Namibia  Afghani¬stan and Kampuchea.193. My delegation is deeply concerned that the presence of South African occupation forces in Namibia continues to threaten peace not only in Namibia but also throughout southern Africa  in flagrant disregard of relevant United Nations resolu¬tions. Indeed  the continuing instability in southern Africa poses a threat to international peace and security. The Government of Thailand reiterates its view that the illegal occupation of Namibia must be unconditionally and immediately brought to an end to enable the Namibian people to achieve sovereignty and independence in an integrated Namibia.196.	It is our just expectation that the contact group will redouble its efforts to bring about a compre¬hensive settlement in Namibia that will also end the aggressions committed by South African forces against neighbouring front-line States. Continued failure to arrive at a political settlement would only confirm the justified reaction of SWAPO that it must attain its legitimate goals of self-determination  freedom and independence in a united Namibia by all possible means.197.	In Afghanistan the proud Afghan people con¬tinue to suffer under the yoke of foreign occupation. The Assembly has called for the immediate  uncon¬ditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. My Government fully supports the efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to seek a solution to the crisis. Continued humanitarian assistance must be accorded to the hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees forced to flee from their country and the ruthless suppression of Afghan patriots must be brought to an end. We join in urging the Assembly once again to help rectify the injustices perpetrated against the Afghan people. It is the responsibility of the Security Council to preserve international peace and security  and the permanent member concerned should recognize that its actions in Afghanistan only destabilize the precarious balance in that vital region of the world  and that any prolonged instability there will have serious repercussions beyond the Afghan borders to its own detriment.198.	The plight of the Palestinian  Namibian and Afghan peoples continues rightly  to be an interna¬tional issue of grave concern to the world community. In South-East Asia  the people of Kampuchea also have been denied the right to determine their own destiny  because their nation has been invaded and occupied by a more powerful neighbor. They have been forced to flee their homes to seek food and shelter in neighbouring countries. Moreover  they con¬tinue to be denied their basic human rights by the occupation forces. Therefore  the situation in Kam¬puchea presents a political and humanitarian challenge to the world community. The foreign invasion and occupation of Kampuchea have resulted in untold suffering for the Kampuchean people and created severe tension in South-East Asia. The present situation has interrupted the process ot constructive co-operation among countries of South-East Asia and brought about an intensification of big-Power rivalry in the region. Thus the conflict in Kampuchea consti¬tutes a threat to international peace and security.199.	In three successive years the General Assembly adopted three resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces  respect for the sovereignty  inde¬pendence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and the free exercise of self-determination by the Kampu¬chean people. However  these resolutions remain unheeded by the instigator of the conflict. My country  together with the other members of ASEAN  has endeavoured  within the framework of the United Nations  to seek a peaceful comprehensive political se dement to the conflict in Kampuchea.200.	Last year the International Conference on Kampuchea was convened by the Secretary-General at United Nations Headquarters to consider ways and means of achieving a just and durable solution of the Kampuchean problem. The Declaration adopted by consensus at that Conference^ reaffirmed that with¬drawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea  restora¬tion of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and the free exercise of self- determination by the Kampuchean people were the principal components of any just and lasting solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Conference also called for negotiations on a cease-fire and withdrawal of all foreign forces under United Nations supervision and measures for the maintenance of peace and order in Kampuchea and for the holding of free elections under United Nations supervision. Regrettably  these calls by the overwhelming majority of the international community have been ignored by Viet Nam  which maintains its military occupation of Kampuchea.201.	The Ad Hoc Committee set up by the Interna¬tional Conference on Kampuchea  under the chairman¬ship of Mr. Sarre of Senegal  has undertaken several missions in pursuit of the objectives of the Conference. My delegation would like to express its deep apprecia¬tion to Mr. Sarre and the Ad Hoc Committee for their efforts. We strongly urge all parties concerned  in particular Viet Nam and its allies  to join in this peace process under the aegis of the United Nations to effect a just and durable solution to the Kampuchean problem.202.	My delegation would also like to express its sincere appreciation to Mr. Willibald Pahr  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria and President of the International Conference on Kampuchea  for his constructive role. We should also like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General for this continuing concern with regard to the Kampuchean problem. We call once again on all States Members of the United Nations to recognize the usefulness of these efforts and to accord their full co-operation.203.	Despite the efforts made by the ASEAN coun¬tries in ongoing bilateral dialogues to facilitate a negotiated settlement of the Kampuchean conflict  we regret to report that no substantial progress has been made and that no substantive change in Viet Nam's position has been evident. Our hopes are constantly raised prior to every session of the General Assembly. At such times  seemingly new proposals are made by Hanoi or at its instigation  as in the recent Ho Chi Minh City communique and in the communication of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. However  upon closer examination  it is apparent that these proposals do not offer a viable basis for a just and lasting settlement of the Kampu¬chean problem.204.	In the Ho Chi Minh City communique issued in July  a partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea was offered. Subsequently  the Vietnamese authorities claimed that this partial with¬drawal had been completed in mid-July. However  there are reports indicating that there was merely a rotation of troops and new units from Viet Nam have been arriving in Kampuchea since the end of April. The relevant United Nations resolutions call for a complete and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. Indeed  a genuine commitment to that end by the party concerned would be welcomed as a positive step in the right direction. The Assembly  therefore  needs to reiterate its call for the total with¬drawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea.205.	Viet Nam has also proposed an international conference on South-East Asia with limited participa¬tion. As I have already mentioned  the International Conference on Kampuchea was convened in July last year  with the participation of over 90 States and parties concerned. Ad Hoc Committee was estab¬lished by that Conference to undertake efforts towards a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Kampuchean conflict. We once again call on Viet Nam and its allies to participate in the United Nations peace process on Kampuchea. As a State Member of the United Nations  Viet Nam should have no difficulty in participating in this United Nations framework for a negotiated settlement of the Kampuchean conflict.206.	On the one hand  Viet Nam appears to regard the situation in Kampuchea as an internal issue of concern only to the Heng Samrin puppet regime; on the other hand  Vietnamese authorities have stressed their preoccupation with the Chinese threat against the three Indo-Chinese countries. Therefore  it must first be ascertained that the Kampuchean problem to be discussed at an international conference would not be the mere question of a so-called Chinese threat against the puppet regime in Phnom Penh but the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Kampuchean people  free from foreign occupation and alien domination. The other countries of Southeast Asia must be satisfied that such proposals would not serve to legitimize Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea and prolong the suffering of the Kampu¬chean people.207.	Viet Nam has also proposed that a so-called safety zone  or demilitarized zone  be established along the Thai-Kampuchean border. However  the armed conflict in Kampuchea is not between Thailand and Kampuchea  but between Vietnamese forces and Kampuchean patriots. If a demilitarized zone is to be established  it should be along the Kampuchean- Vietnamese border. It should be recalled that Kampu¬chean resistance forces are there because of the Vietnamese occupation of their homeland. Only if and when such foreign occupation comes to an end can the Kampuchean patriots legitimately be expected to lay down their arms. To restore peace to Kampuchea and to reduce regional tension it is necessary that the 200 000 Vietnamese troops be completely withdrawn from Kampuchea.208.	Despite the presence of 200 000 Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea and their four-year onslaught against Kampuchean resistance  the latter has gained in strength and numbers. The new Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk is a natural and posi¬tive development that reflects the firm resolve and relentless determination of the Kampuchean people to resist the imposition of any form of alien domination. The new leadership of Kampuchea also offers renewed hopes for improving the prospects of achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.209.	The turmoil in Indo-China and in particular the continued armed conflict in Kampuchea have resulted in large numbers of people fleeing to seek food and shelter in neighbouring countries. Since 1975 over 1 million people from Indo-China have sought tem¬porary refuge in Thailand  a country of first refuge in South-East Asia. Many others did not survive the perilous journey overland or by leaky boat on the high seas. Although the numbers have been reduced and many refugees have been resettled in third countries  the situation remains of grave humanitarian concern to the international community. There are still over 150 000 Vietnamese  Laotian and Kampuchean refugees in Thai holding centers. Furthermore  with the fighting in Kampuchea there is every possibility that new waves of refugees and displaced persons —now numbering some 200 000 to 300 000 along the Thai-Kampuchean border—will sweep across the border into Thailand.210.	The Government of Thailand is therefore sadly disappointed at the recent sharp decline in the resettlement rates in third countries of Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand.The need to expedite their resettlement as well as to increase resettlement opportunities in third countries should be a matter of serious concern  not only to Thailand but also to all countries which uphold humanitarian principles. It is mainly because of international humanitarian assistance provided by donor Governments  United Nations agencies and over 50 voluntary agencies and Thailand's humane policy and co-operation that mass starvation inside Kampuchea has been averted.211.	My delegation would like to express our profound appreciation to the donor countries and to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  as well as to the various United Nations and voluntary agencies  for their dedicated efforts in this regard.212.	The needs of the Kampucheans remain real and manifest along the Thai-Kampuchean border as well as in the Thai holding centers. The Kampuchean influx and the Vietnamese incursions and cross-border shellings have also displaced close to 100 000 innocent Thai villagers. We therefore urge donor countries to continue to support the humanitarian programmes of the United Nations along the Thai-Kampuchean border and in the holding centers and to assist the Royal Thai Government in the relief and rehabilitation of the affected Thai villagers.213.	The resources of Thailand  a developing third- world nation  have been strained by the need to assist in the care and shelter of the large numbers of displaced Indo-Chinese persons. While the Govern¬ment of Thailand intends to continue to fulfill its humanitarian responsibilities in accordance with its traditions  the problem not only poses a heavy economic burden for Thailand but also has immediate and long-term political and security implications. The most natural solution would be for the refugees to return safely to their homes. The Royal Thai Govern¬ment  in co-operation with UNHCR  will continue to promote and assist in the program of voluntary repatriation by land  sea and air. Pending the full implementation of that program  safe relocation of the Kampuchean displaced persons in the border areas which are accessible to relief supplies seems to be a viable alternative.214.	It is worth noting that the humanitarian aspect of the Kampuchean problem can find a lasting solu-tion only if there is a comprehensive political settle¬ment of the Kampuchean problem as a whole. The international community must therefore redouble its efforts to resolve the Kampuchean conflict once and for all in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. To this end  Thailand and the member countries of ASEAN have sought the assistance of the international community in bringing about a negotiated settlement of the problem. The efforts of ASEAN are undertaken with sincerity and in good faith. We harbor no enmity towards any country  particularly those situated in our region. But the armed conflict in Kampuchea stands in the way of closer co-operation among the countries of South-Fust Asia and consti¬tutes a serious threat not only to regional but to interna¬tional peace and security. The peaceful settlement of the conflict will pave the way towards the establish¬ment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia which would provide for the orderly development of all peoples in the region  irrespective of differences in their political  economic or social systems.215.	One of the basic causes of international conflicts today is the economic discrepancy and exploitation among nations. In recognition of this fact  the United Nations system has devoted the greater part of its entire budget to the tasks of economic and social development. However  the fact remains that there are still nearly 1 billion people living in abject poverty in the world today  and by the end of the Third United Nations Development Decade their number will have surpassed the 1 billion mark.216.	In view of the present crisis in the world eco¬nomy  progress in the efforts to narrow the gap between rich and poor nations has not been satisfactory. Thailand's current fifth five-year plan is aimed at reducing the external trade deficit and population growth rate  restructuring its key productive sectors  eradicating poverty in rural areas and maintaining its annual growth rate of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent.217.	However  our export earnings have been ad¬versely affected by the protectionist policies of certain developed countries. In this connection my delegation reiterates the hope expressed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at their fifteenth ministerial meeting  in June 1982  that the GATT ministerial meeting in November 1982 will restore the basic task of GATT in ensuring that the principles of free trade are consistently practiced in the world market. We also hope that the sixth session of UNCTAD  in 1983  will successfully tackle such priority issues as pro¬tectionism  structural adjustment and commodities.218.	We live in an increasingly interdependent world. A global  integrated and comprehensive approach to world problems is essential if there is to be an agreed solution. For this reason  in 1974  the General As-sembly adopted the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which would ensure the full and active participation of the developing countries in gobal decision-making and the management of international economic co-operation for development.219.	My Government fully welcomed and endorsed the decision taken at the sixth special session as well as the subsequent adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and resolution 34/138  calling for the launching of global and sustained negotiations on international economic co¬operation for development. We are  however  dis¬appointed that  almost three years after resolution 34/138 was adopted by consensus  and despite con¬tinued endeavors and the flexibility shown by the Group of 77 and many of its industrialized friends  some influential Members continue to procrastinate concerning the launching of global negotiations. We earnestly hope that the latter will  in the spirit of Cancun  demonstrate the necessary will to proceed  as further postponement of the launching of global negotiations would not only aggravate the already deteriorating relations between North and South but also  in the eyes of the South  demonstrate a lack of good faith on the part of the North  which could impede further efforts at co-operation.220.	Whatever the outcome of the global negotia¬tions  my Government will continue to develop its economic co-operation with other developing countries in all fields as set forth in the 1981 Caracas Programme of Action/ in accordance with the principles of self- reliance  self-help and North-South co-operation. Economic co-operation among developing countries is not a substitute for global or North-South co¬operation  but it is an integral part of the collective action of the Group of 77 for the restructuring of international economic relations and the establish¬ment of a new international economic order. We therefore hope that  following the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Follow up and Co-ordination Com¬mittee on economic co-operation a among developing countries  in Manila last month  more concrete actions and vigorous implementation of the Caracas Pro¬gramme will be pursued.221.	My delegation believes that the United Nations system provides the most appropriate forum and a useful framework for identifying and focusing world attention on major issues as well as for seeking peace¬ful solutions to those issues. Therefore all countries  developed and developing  are urged to co-operate within the United Nations system in achieving our worthy common goal of a restructured and equitable economic order for the world community that will benefit all mankind. My delegation therefore pledges its best efforts to continue to play a constructive role in this regard.222.	The just and equitable utilization of the earth's resources is seriously distorted by the continuing arms race. The second special session of the General As¬sembly devoted to disarmament was convened at a time when the need to halt and reverse the arms race had become even more imperative than before. The recurrent crises and conflicts which have marked the international situation have heightened the sense of insecurity among some States and spurred the pro¬duction  acquisition  and stockpiling of weapons of destruction  including nuclear  conventional and chemical weapons  resulting not only in increased insecurity for all States but also in the retardation of the developmental prospects of most third-world countries. Efforts made both within and outside the framework of the United Nations to reverse the arms race have not been crowned with success.223.	But although the second special session on disarmament fell short of expectations  the convening of that session nevertheless served some useful pur¬poses. Among other things  it produced substantive advances in new ideas  suggestions and proposals in various fields of disarmament  many of which  if implemented  could contribute significantly to the disarmament process. Agreement was reached on guidelines for a World Disarmament Campaign which underline the universality of the program and allow all sectors of the public unimpeded access to a broad range of information and opinions on the questions of arms limitation and disarmament and the dangers relating to all aspects of the arms race and war  in par¬ticular nuclear war. The launching of the Campaign thus represents a step forward in the efforts to attain meaningful measures of arms limitation and dis¬armament.224.	The second special session on disarmament generated an unprecedented degree of public attention and interest  highlighted by mass gatherings of the people of many nations in support of the cause of disarmament. This should serve as an impetus for all of us to continue our efforts and revitalize the mul¬tilateral negotiating process  which was kept in being at the conclusion of the second special session on disarmament.225.	My delegation urges that disarmament and the reduction of the arms race in both nuclear and con-ventional weapons remain an issue of priority concern to the Assembly. The world has thus far been spared the horrors of nuclear war  but we all realize the consequences that such a conflagration would have for the human race. The specter and the reality of conventional wars  with the terrible suffering in¬flicted through the ever-increasing sophistication of weaponry  are still sadly with us. Wars have been fought because of the aggressive and expansionist tendencies of militarily powerful States  or have resulted from injustices inflicted and wrongs that remain uncorrected.226.	Our task must surely be to rededicate ourselves to the principles enshrined in the Charter on the non- use of force  non-interference in internal affairs and respect for the territorial integrity of States  while seeking to resolve international issues by peaceful means.227.	In this connection my delegation urges that a dialogue be agreed upon between North Korea and South Korea for the consideration of effective ways and means of reducing tension and strengthening peace in the Korean peninsula.228.	Injustices against entire nations and peoples continue to be committed in the Middle East  in Namibia  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. These appear to be among the most intractable and critical issues to which the General Assembly has addressed its attention over the past several years  and they represent cases where  in the Secretary-General's words:""Governments that believe they can win an international objective by force are often quite ready to do so  and domestic opinion not infrequently applauds such a course. The Security Council  the primary organ of the United Nations for the main¬tenance of international peace and security  all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts and its resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so.""229.	This is indeed a very dangerous trend and could eventually turn the Organization  which was intended to serve the cause of harmony and peace  into a breeding ground for international confrontation and anarchy.230.	The Thai delegation sincerely believes that each and every Member State has the duty and responsibility to reverse this trend  by rededicating ourselves to the principles and purposes of the Charter and by a renewed commitment to use the machinery of the United Nations more effectively. For only in this way can the Organization truly become an instrument for peaceful change and orderly progress for mankind."
"132",6894,"TTO",37,1982,"1.	Mr. President  may I  on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago  congratulate you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that your considerable experience and skill will con¬tribute significantly to the successful outcome of the Assembly's work. You are the proud representative of a country with which Trinidad and Tobago enjoys the most cordial relations. I would also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Ismat Kittani of Iraq  for his very commendable performance over the past year  as President not only of the thirty-sixth session but also of the second special session on disarmament and the emergency special sessions.2.	Twenty years ago  Trinidad and Tobago  a small newly independent developing country  joined the Organization. We  like many others  were attracted by the system of collective security enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It was this which impelled us to seek entry to the United Nations imme¬diately upon our achievement of independence. We had neither the desire nor the means to embark upon any large-scale expenditure for arms or sophisticated weapons of war in order to make ourselves inde¬pendently secure. Even those who have embarked upon such a course delude themselves into believing that they can be secure.3.	Today Trinidad and Tobago views with consider¬able concern the widening gap between the purposes and principles of the Charter and the increasing law¬lessness in the world community. This lawlessness is characterized by utter and distressing disregard for human life and suffering and little respect for the dignity of man. History will surely indict the United Nations and its Member States for their chronic inaction in the face of such lawlessness. The Security Council has failed to fulfill its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security and to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Loss of confidence in the United Nations system brings the world closer to the brink of disaster as nations seek to impose their will on others by force and to ignore decisions of the world body aimed at peacefully resolving international conflicts.634.	The refusal of Member States to renounce the use of force as an instrument of national policy and the refusal to respect the territorial integrity and inde¬pendence of States and to seek the peaceful settlement of disputes have given rise to a growing number of crises which threaten to engulf us all in a conflagra¬tion of unprecedented horror and destruction. The Secretary-General  whose skilful and untiring efforts in the cause of peace this past year must not go unrecorded  has warned that this trend must be reversed before once again we bring upon ourselves a global catastrophe and find ourselves without institu¬tions effective enough to prevent it . But will his warning be heeded? How can it be  when in the quest for a so-called balance of power nations continue to increase their nuclear arsenals? How can it be  when nations resort to arms and refuse to limit and reduce their weapons of mass destruction- weapons which threaten civilization itself?5.	During the past year a number of old conflicts have continued to fester and pose obstacles to peace. Several new conflicts have arisen which endanger international peace and security. From the South Atlantic to South-East Asia  from Western Sahara to the Middle East and from Africa to Central America  situations of intense conflict have brought disaster and untold suffering to millions of people.6.	A few days ago the world was witness to the most inhuman event in the Palestinian refugee camps of west Beirut. The entry into that part of the city of the Israel Defense Forces for the alleged purpose of preventing further bloodshed was the signal for permitting the unleashing of a reign of primeval terror which has resulted in the slaughter in cold blood of hundreds of unarmed civilians—women  children and the elderly—in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Revulsion at this barbarous act has echoed around the world. It is testimony to the enormity of the crime perpetrated by those who connived in its commission. We would dishonor the memory of the victims of this massacre and betray the people of Lebanon  if we did not provide at this time adequate and effective measures to heal their wounds  promote their unity and restore their national sovereignty. At the very least  we demand the total and unconditional with¬drawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory. The tragedy of Lebanon is inextricably bound up with the problem of the Palestinian people. Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its firm conviction that there cannot be and there will not be a lasting peace in the Middle East until the rights of the Palestinian people are recognized and respected and until the Palestinian people themselves have been allowed to exercise their right to self-determination.7.	The mounting toll of refugees and displaced persons fleeing political strife and economic disorder attest to the increasing inhumanity pervading our world today. These conflict situations invariably affect people. It is the mass of the people who suffer when the mechanisms contained in the Charter for the peaceful settlement of disputes fail or are ignored  as we see with increasing frequency. The fragile econo¬mies of developing countries and the development aspirations of whole generations of people are jeopar¬dized by actual conflict or by the profligate expenditure involved in preparing for conflict. International tension and great-Power rivalry are perhaps the principal cause of the deflection of the world's resources from their correct use—the advancement of the well-being of all mankind.8.	Nowhere is this inhumanity more sickening than in South Africa  where the apartheid regime of South Africa continues to defy international world opinion in its brutal repression and oppression of its black majority. The persistent attempts to establish Bantustans  the detention and banning of African leaders  and the death of freedom fighters and trade union leaders while in detention  serve only to confirm the need for more stringent action by the United Nations to compel South Africa to comply with its decisions not only with respect to conditions in South Africa itself but also with respect to Namibia  which it con¬tinues to occupy illegally.9.	We must once more condemn the obstinacy of Pretoria in impeding the achievement of inde¬pendence by Namibia. We must condemn that regime for its persistent use of Namibian territory for armed attacks on neighbouring States. We rebuke that racist regime for its attempt to set up a puppet Government in Namibia. Above all  we rebuke it for its ruthless exploitation of Namibia's natural and human resources .without any real benefit accruing to the indigenous population. It is time for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which sets the sole framework for the independence of Namibia. It is time to put a stop to the dilatory tactics employed by Pretoria over the past four years to deprive the people of Namibia of their peremptory right to self- determination and independence.10.	We cannot equivocate in our support for the Namibian people in their struggle to free themselves from the oppressive colonial yoke. Trinidad and Tobago's continuing commitment to the process of decolonization has been demonstrated by the leader¬ship role it has taken in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Territories still to be decolonized  many of them small in size and limited in resources  are of particular concern to Trinidad and Tobago since several of them form part of our own Caribbean region. Some of these Terri¬tories remain in a state of virtual economic depen¬dency. In these circumstances it is very difficult for them to exercise freely their right to self-determination. The colonial Power therefore has a duty to devote the necessary resources to preparing these Territories for independence. There is ample evidence to show that when the colonial Power wishes to do so it can.11.	If the political picture of the world which I have painted is one beset with problems  the economic one is no less troubled. I do not think that there is now any doubt that today we are experiencing the worst down-turn in the world economy since the 1930s. What is perhaps even more chilling is that there is little confidence in the prospect of global economic recovery in the short term and even less in the international monetary and financial system. Unemployment  one of the scourges of humanity  has reached unimaginable proportions. We in the developing world have lived with unemployment for decades. Levels of unemploy-ment of 18 per cent and 20 per cent were seen by some economists as normal for developing countries  while for developed countries 2.5 to 3 per cent was considered the norm.12.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is deeply concerned about the growing levels of unem¬ployment in developed as well as developing coun¬tries. It is concerned not only because of the human suffering involved but also because the monetarist prescriptions of certain major countries and financial institutions for dealing with the general economic situation are such that they exacerbate the problem. The high interest rates associated with monetarist policies have added considerably to the already over¬grown debt problem of the developing countries and resulted in unpredictable flights of capital.13.	Recent events have reaffirmed  if that were neces¬sary  just how interdependent the world has become. In the industrialized countries large deficits  tight monetary policies and high levels of inflation have resulted in high and volatile interest rates and a decline in industrial output  which in turn have affected the earnings of developing countries. At the same time the developing countries have faced a marked decline in the level of official development assistance  dete¬riorating terms of trade  and higher prices for imports  including food  and renewed protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries. Constrained by these conditions  developing countries are unable to pay for their imports and service their debts. Indeed  so severe are these constraints that most developing countries are experiencing negative rates of growth.14.	For the Caribbean the past year has been partic¬ularly difficult. Not only did the recession continue to decrease the demand for tourism  the primary source of foreign exchange for many countries  but the major exports—sugar  petroleum  bauxite/alumina and bananas—also faced softening or declining markets. For countries which have already been experiencing negative growth rates the net result has been that the economies of these countries are tottering on the brink of bankruptcy. In order to achieve growth rates of 3 to 5 per cent per annum over the next five years  the countries of the Caribbean Community will face an external resource gap of over $US 3 billion. They will need the support of the multilateral financial institutions if this gap is to be bridged. We therefore  view with some concern the decision of the World Bank to adopt a variable interest rate policy and to introduce a front-end lending fee which will make project financing much more difficult and painful. Without lower and more stable interest rates  initiatives designed to encourage investment in the Caribbean will not be meaningful.15.	Trinidad and Tobago believes that there is an urgent need for a significant increase in the level of World Bank lending. A minimum increase at the rate of 5 per cent m real terms is necessary if the Bank is to meet the requirements of developing countries.16. With regard to the International Monetary Fund [IMF]  Trinidad and Tobago supports the call for a substantial increase in and a redistribution of quotas so as to give developing countries generally and economic groupings and regions a greater say in the operation of IMF.17.	Trinidad and Tobago is disappointed that no consensus has been reached on the allocation of special drawing rights during the present basic period and that as yet  despite the repeated pleas of the developing countries  a direct link between special drawing rights and development finance has not been established.18.	Trinidad and Tobago has sought  within its own modest means  to contribute to the economic progress of the countries in the Caribbean community by making funds available to them through the Caribbean Development Bank and other regional financial insti¬tutions  as well as through our own programmes for technical co-operation and assistance. Over the past five years  Trinidad and Tobago has contributed $.5 billion in balance-of-payments support  loans on soft terms  and grants and project assistance to mem¬bers of the Caribbean Community. Even in these trying times Trinidad and Tobago maintains its commitment to assist its partners in CARICOM. We hope that other countries  particularly the better endowed ones in our hemisphere  will make good their promises of concrete support for the countries of the Caribbean. In six months it may be too late. We hope  however  that when such assistance is given  it will not have a divisive effect on the region and encourage alienation from principles cherished by all Caribbean peoples.19.	Trinidad and Tobago sees in the present situation a clear and accurate demonstration of the need for systematic transformation and more balanced global management of the international economy. We believe that the credibility  efficacy and relevance of the existing institutional structure and its theoretical and philosophical underpinnings have been called into question. That has rendered the call for the new international economic order more relevant than ever.20.	It is a matter of concern to us that efforts to launch the global round of negotiations on international economic co-operation for development have not met with great success during the past year. No agreement has been reached so far between the Group of 77 and the industrialized countries on procedure  agenda and time-frame for the launching of negotiations to tackle the problems of the world economy simultaneously in a coherent and integrated manner. Instead  developing countries see  with mounting frustration  their in¬terests bypassed or ignored in the GATT negotiations and in deliberations at the World Bank and IMF.21.	To the developing countries here assembled  I launch an appeal to move swiftly to implement the action program for economic co-operation among developing countries adopted by the Group of 77 at the High-Level Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries at Caracas in May 1981. Not until our efforts to change our focus and to reorient our patterns of economic collaboration bear fruit shall we see a more positive response from the developed community.22.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has noted with satisfaction that after 14 years of protracted dialogue and negotiation  the United Nations has finally adopted the Convention on the Law of the Sea. After much hard work  co-operative effort and give and take  a package deal was reached on 30 April 1982.23.	I must place on record the disappointment of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that one of the major contributors to that package deal has chosen to opt out of the painstakingly negotiated settlement. The decision of that major contributor to turn its back on a system which would make for a stable order in ocean space is to be regretted. It remains our hope that all States will sign and ratify the Convention to make it universally acceptable.24.	Perhaps it is not inappropriate that I voice the cumulative disappointment of all peoples at the failure to halt the arms race and to reduce armaments of mass destruction. The thousands who have marched in the streets of many cities of the world in order to draw attention to the existing situation and to signify their deep fear of the consequences to themselves and future generations of the arms race and nuclear catastrophe have sent a clear message that the world community cannot afford to ignore. Allow me once again to voice the concern of peoples everywhere for the urgent adoption of measures to alleviate  if not to solve  the current economic crisis  and to remove the hovering specter of depression.25.	In conclusion  I should like to urge the great powers not to import into the Caribbean their rivalries  conflicts and tensions. Of our neighbors in the hemisphere  we ask at all costs that they settle their disputes by peaceful means. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago  as it has done before  stands ready to assist in finding peaceful and amicable solu¬tions to disputes which threaten to disturb the peace in the Caribbean  and to retard the just aspirations of Caribbean peoples for peace  security and economic well-being."
"133",6940,"TUN",37,1982,"115.	Mr. President  the General Assembly in having unanimously decided to entrust you with the task of guiding its work has thereby paid a resounding tribute to you personally and to your country. It is Tunisia's agreeable duty to join in this tribute from this rostrum. At the same time  the General Assembly has conferred upon you a particularly heavy and delicate responsibility. Fully cognizant of the very exceptional gravity of the questions to be debated at this session  Tunisia is convinced that you will whole-heartedly guide our work with all the competence and devotion and all the effectiveness and objectivity of which we know you are capable. In expressing its warm con¬gratulations to you  my delegation would like to assure you of its complete co-operation.116.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay to your predecessor  Mr. Is mat Kittani  the tribute he deserves for the skill  objectivity and courtesy which he displayed with admirable consistency throughout the past year. His presidency will remain a matter of pride for his country  as well as all the other Arab  Moslem and non-aligned countries.117.	The year that has just elapsed has shown us once again that developments in the international situation since the previous session have not registered any appreciable progress. What is more  the conditions under which the present session is being held are marked by an even greater and more disturbing gravity.118.	One need only observe the current pervasive disorder in international relations to realize the risks the world is running. Whether it be the persistence of hotbeds of tension which we have not managed to put out or the emergence of new conflicts which we have not been able to prevent  whether it be the growing imbalance in international economic relations and their disastrous consequences for the third-world countries  whether it be  finally  the problems of security and the all-out arms race  inevitably we are faced with a turn of events extremely difficult to control.119.	When the elementary principles of international law are daily trampled underfoot throughout the world  when clear-cut acts of aggression are committed with impunity and in defiance of unanimously admitted standards  when genocide is premeditated and con¬fessed openly without the guilty party being ener¬getically and immediately thwarted in its dark designs and when international peace and security are so sorely undermined without the Security Council shouldering its primary responsibility in timely and appropriate fashion  we are entitled to feel doubts  indeed anguish  about the effectiveness and viability of the international order we have today.120.	Given that international relations are based more and more on the principle of interdependence and that the conflicts and crises which affect one group of parties automatically have an impact on the interests of other parties  we are forced to the conclusion that we stand together. We are at one concerning how we wish to build the world for ourselves and for future generations. We are at one concerning the conse¬quences of any serious decision which various parties may take unilaterally. It is here in this Hall  and nowhere else  it is within the Organization that this solidarity must be expressed and made real  and it is on the basis of the principles of the Charter that the unity of our goals and the unity of our action can be shown.121.	This is to assume that the Organization is strong and respected  that it can be the conscience of the world and at the same time a recourse for those among us who are victims of any violation whatsoever of the principles to which we adhere. In a word  it is to assume that the Organization is able to say what is right and to see that right is respected.122.	But what in fact do we see? Each time there is a flagrant violation of the Charter  the Security Council  to which the Member States have entrusted the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security  can only discuss the question. However  we must note that the veto  which has been used and abused more and more in recent times  all too often puts a stop to all discussion and thus to any action by the Council. When it is not the veto which obstructs the Council  it is the party complained of  which  with disturbing calmness and awareness of impunity  immediately rejects the resolution which has been adopted and declares null and void any initiative by the Council. In the words of the Secretary- General  we are perilously near to a new international anarchy.123.	In this situation  which is more and more dangerous for international relations  Tunisia has never missed an opportunity  especially of late during its term as a member of the Security Council  as Well as in the General Assembly—of showing its concern and calling for widespread awareness of that danger. My country  which has always given its full and unreserved support to all United Nations efforts to carry out its mission for international peace and security and to establish a better balance in economic relations  recog¬nizes that the United Nations has played an extremely important role  particularly in facilitating the irreversible process of decolonization and in clearly stating the relationship between the process of decolo¬nization and the process of development. My country considers  indeed  that the Organization is the unique and irreplaceable international forum for negotiation and  when necessary  for decision. This explains our fear and concern when we see the state of semi paralysis in which the United Nations finds itself. It also explains our great satisfaction 5n seeing our own concerns reflected in the report on the work of the Organization submitted by the Secretary-General.124.	It is happy and comforting to know that less than a year after taking office the Secretary-General has officially pointed out  with remarkable clarity and authority  the dangers which threaten the United Nations  and at the same time the world. It is equally comforting that the Secretary-General has taken care to put forward specific suggestions and proposals for retrieving  before it is too late  a situation which if left alone would inevitably lead to the decline of the Organization.125.	Aware of the consistent position taken by Tunisia in this connection  a position which we had the opportunity of stating again during his recent visit to us  the Secretary-General will not be surprised to hear Tunisia confirm to him from this rostrum its total confidence  as well as its support for any action to strengthen the Organization and defend its high and noble goals  because in my country legality is a watchword  and international legality is conceived of as an intangible principle which must necessarily underlie the conduct of international relations.126.	It is to international legality that Tunisia and its President have appealed each time some conflict in the world has had to be resolved. Recent events in the crucible of the Middle East have brought to the forefront the constant concern of President Bourguiba to endow his thinking and his actions with the neces¬sary legitimacy  on the basis of the sacrosanct principle of legality.127.	What has been called the Bourguiba Plan for a just solution to the Palestinian problem is based in fact on a return to and use of the international legal principles defined as early as 1947 which  regardless of their imperfections  could not be rejected by anyone  least of all by those whose birth and very existence depend on them—but those are the very people who today show the most complete scorn for international law  the principles of the Charter and the entire Orga¬nization  adopting an attitude of defiance and arrogance and ignoring the decisions and recommendations of the international community.128.	The General Assembly is beginning its work at a time when the entire world has just witnessed a frightful massacre carried out in cold blood in Pal¬estinian refugee camps by armed bands trained and financed by Tel Aviv  in the presence and with the complicity of the Israeli occupation forces which had encircled the Sabra and Shatila camps. The wave of Shock at this hateful crime has led to consternation  horror and outrage throughout the world. There is not the slightest doubt that by moving into west Beirut  in violation of the agreements reached through the intermediary of the Habib mission  the Israeli leaders bear the whole responsibility for this crime against humanity. Under the pretext of protecting the civilian population of Beirut  they in fact allowed their legion of mercenaries to do the dirty work. This tragedy  unprecedented in the recent history of mankind  is the logical consequence of the paranoia characteristic of those in power in Israel  who consider each Pal¬estinian a potential terrorist and  as such  an absolute evil which must be rooted out and exterminated. Is not a former Prime Minister of Israel alleged to have admitted to that sense of fear at the birth of each Palestinian child?129.	What can only be called the hasty retreat of the multinational forces of separation in leaving the refugee camps without protection  despite the fears expressed in the first place by the Palestinian leaders  was evidence of that criminal design. This appalling slaughter  among the victims of which were thousands of women  children and the elderly  is the result of this diabolical war launched by the Israeli Government on 6 June. In fact since that time  the Israeli Army  with considerable manpower and material of a very sophisticated kind  has invaded more than half of Lebanon  causing immense destruction and partic¬ularly heavy human losses among the Lebanese and Palestinian populations  estimated by UNICEF to be 30 000 dead and wounded in Beirut alone.130.	Under the false pretext of ensuring the security of its northern frontiers  where a ceasefire has been in force since July 1981  Israel has put into operation the final phase —in accordance with its strategy—of its plan to annihilate the Palestinian resistance centered on the PLO  leading to the elimina¬tion of the Palestinian presence in Lebanon  by terrorization and the destruction of their shelters.131.	In the past  the Tel Aviv authorities tried in vain to establish a tame new administration to carry out in Israeli-style autonomy in the occupied terri¬tories on the West Bank and in Gaza  once the democratically elected municipal councils had been dissolved and replaced by village leagues which are armed groups that bring about Israeli order  in the expectation that a quisling will emerge to serve as a likely negotiator.13z. Neither the systematic repression of the occupied territories  nor the use of sophisticated military arsenals  including phosphorous and frag¬mentation bombs as well as implosion bombs  or the terrible bombardment of west Beirut  has succeeded in overcoming the determination of the Palestinians to fight to defend their legitimate cause  as President Reagan himself recognized in his statement on 1 September.133. For 60 years  the Palestinian people  faced with Zionist designs on their country  have never ceased to fight. In spite of the ups and downs of an unequal struggle and the fact that on three occasions since 1948 the Palestinians have been dispersed  Palestinian nationalism has emerged strengthened from each test  because never in the long history of colonialism Las brute force succeeded in overcoming the determina¬tion of peoples who fight for liberation. The Pal¬estinian people  driven from their homeland and pursued with hatred and tenacity in exile  have paid heavily for their recognition of their inalienable right to self-determination and the establishment of their own State.134.	By subjecting an entire country to fire and bloodshed  by massacring savagely and indiscrimi¬nately thousands and thousands of innocent people  by depriving blockaded populations of any sanitary or humanitarian aid  by creating finally even more victims  including victims among their own ranks  which has never happened before in the confronta¬tions in that region  was Israel really  in those con¬ditions  responding to its need for security  or did it use its military power to ensure its supremacy?135.	If we are to believe Time magazine of 20 Sep¬tember 1982  Israel is the fourth largest military power in the world. In those conditions  how can they use vulnerability and insecurity as pretexts when what is involved is the appeasement of dominating and expansionist instincts? What is involved is an attempt to establish its own order in Lebanon  which is an independent and sovereign country. It is a question of stripping an entire people  the Palestinians  of its rights to self-determination and to a State  and of discrediting its unique and sole representative  the PLO.136.	That is what really lies behind the notion of security invoked each time by Israel; it is nothing but a code name to camouflage dark designs. Do we have to emphasize that security is the constant concern of all peoples in the region? It is also a condition neces¬sary to their development. Security cannot be con¬ceived of as being the supremacy of one State over others  implying a right to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries  nor could security be con¬sidered as a means of legitimizing the subjugation of- peoples.137.	One reality emerges clearly from all those events: that of an imperative need to end the tragedy of the Middle East. Any further delay would risk jeopardizing forever peace and security in that region and in the world. To that end  the Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples  with a single voice —through their leaders who met at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez—have shown their deter¬mination to achieve a just  overall and lasting solution of the problems.138.	Two basic principles were clearly defined: first  the withdrawal by the Israelis from all Arab terri¬tories  including Jerusalem  and then the recognition of the absolute right of the Palestinians to self- determination and to the establishment of their own State under the leadership of the PLO. It also involves the right of all the peoples of the region to live in peace under the guarantee of the Security Council; which has that role in accordance with the Charter.139.	That plan  which has the merit of international legality and takes into account all the recent public peace initiatives—in particular that by President Reagan in which we noted with satisfaction a more correct appreciation of the realities of our region—for the first time presents a specific means of implementing a lasting world solution.140.	However  whereas the peace efforts of the Arab countries arouse interest and even support among many countries  the Tel Aviv authorities  by the use of arrogance and defiance as an overriding weapon  remain hidebound in their complete and total refusal:  no  to the Fez Arab peace plans;  no  to the self-determination of the Pal¬estinian people and the creation of their State;  no  to the existence of the PLO  although it is recognized by 117 States;  no  to the Venice Declaration;  no  to the Franco-Egyptian plan;  no  to the Brezhnev plan; and  no  to the Reagan plan of September. The entire world is in the wrong; Israel alone is in the right.141.	At the Fez Summit Conference an historic turning point was reached by Arab countries  opening up new prospects towards a lasting peace. It is the duty of the Organization and of the Security Council in the first instance to assume their responsibilities  to end this infernal cycle of brute force which can only exacerbate passions  feed the extremists  creates radical attitudes and deals a fatal blow to the hopes for peace of the peoples of that region.142.	It is comforting to see the action taken by the advocates of peace in the Middle East  including Israel itself  growing continuously. Everything must be done to ensure that the Fez message of peace does not become one more lost opportunity.143.	If we are appealing today more than ever for respect for international legality  it is because in this period of disturbance and disorder in which we live legality is the only way for us to speak a common language. It constitutes for us all the law which each must respect.144.	It is this legality which we wish to see respected in Namibia and elsewhere. It is the illegal occupation of Namibia that we have always denounced with all our strength. It is recognition of the legitimate rights of the fraternal Namibian people  represented by SWAPO that we demand. It is the rapid and definitive solution of the anachronistic problem of Namibia in application of the relevant United Nations resolutions that is our deepest aspiration. It is our desire to see with us as soon as possible here in the United Nations a free and independent Namibia that we are expressing today  at a time when hope of a solution is dawning.145.	It is in that same spirit that we denounce most forcefully once again today the inhuman practice of apartheid  which the segregationist and racist Pretoria regime has made into a system.146.	We appeal to the conscience of the international community so that without further delay that aberra¬tion of our time may be ended  as mankind approaches the end of the twentieth century. It is a political  economic and social problem  but it is also and above all as we see it a problem of civilization. To the people of South Africa  to its leaders  represented by the African National Congress  who are steadfastly struggling for the sake of civilization  we reaffirm our esteem and our active solidarity.147.	Other equally grave hotbeds of tension continue to disturb the African continent. The conflict in Western Sahara that still disturbs the northern part of the continent  the conflict in the horn of Africa  the problems of refugees  and displaced persons  the problems of drought and hunger  make it necessary for the Africans themselves to redouble their efforts and draw on their traditional wisdom to find settlement procedures that are acceptable to all and thus to strengthen the ranks of the Organization of African Unity  which has throughout its history played a particularly positive and indeed irreplaceable role.148.	The OAU  to which nearly one third of the Mem¬bers of the United Nations belong and which is pursuing at the regional level the same objectives as the United Nations has demonstrated that it is able to contribute substantially to the work of the Organization  which is universal in its calling.149.	As regards the situation in Asia  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea  no notable progress has been recorded in the past year towards the solutions advocated by the General Assembly. Foreign forces are still occupying the territories of those two coun¬tries. The Afghan and Kampuchean peoples are still being prevented from exercising their right freely to decide on their own system of government. Interna¬tional legality and the principles of the Charter con¬tinue to be disregarded. It is time that the peoples of those two countries  like other peoples  at last had the right to speak.150.	The particularly sensitive Gulf region  because of the unjustified persistence of the war between Iraq and Iran  two fraternal neighbouring countries which should enjoy understanding and co-operation  con¬tinues to constitute a source of major concern to us and to all who desire stability and equilibrium in that region. We have noted with great interest the con¬structive attitude taken by one of the parties and we ask that international legality be respected  here as elsewhere  and that Security Council resolutions 479 (1980) and 514 (1982) be fully implemented.151. The use of force  regardless of its immediate results  can never bring about peace and security. It is through the peaceful settlement of disputes that the objective of genuine peace can be achieved. It is through dialogue and negotiation that just and lasting solutions can be found. This will always be our preferred course of action. We support this same course of action for the settlement of disputes that have lasted some time now  as well as for those that have emerged more recently  such as the conflict that broke out in the South Atlantic over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and which  because it grew out of all proportion  seriously disturbed the world.152. We appeal to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina  two friends of Tunisia  to resume  on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly  the dialogue which was interrupted  using once again the good offices of the Secretary- General  whose commendable efforts in that matter  had they not been hindered  would have spared many lives and thus enhanced the role of the United Nations.	 153. In this general context of disorder  tension and confrontation the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was held from 7 June to 10 July last. My country had hoped that that session would bring about a general awareness of the danger of widespread conflagration which haunts the world. It had hoped that the international com¬munity would take appropriate measures to prevent war and to arrive at an agreement which would prohibit for ever the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons  an agreement on which the fate of all mankind depends.154.	Our disappointment and our frustration were great when our efforts failed. The necessary political will for such an agreement was lacking  particularly on the part of those with the largest arsenals of weapons of destruction. Could it have been otherwise  when the biggest Powers seek only to ensure their own security without much concern for international peace and security?155.	We venture to hope that at this session those who in the past were not ready will have decided to make the necessary efforts to join their will to that of the great majority expressed here  especially through the non-aligned countries  and thus make it possible to prevent a nuclear disaster  achieve general and complete disarmament and focus exclusively on economic and social development in peace and security.156.	The international economic situation continues to stagnate in crisis and is cause for the most serious concern. Year after year we witness a worsening of the already very precarious conditions of two thirds of mankind. The facts are there  shameful  distressing.157.	In 1980 nearly 800 million human beings had an annual per capita income of less than $150 and they continue to live in miserable conditions of absolute poverty. If nothing is done to remedy this situation their numbers will increase in absolute figures by approximately 30 per cent and will reach the figure of 1 billion by the year 2000.158.	In a world economy characterized by uncer¬tainty and instability and affected by destabilizing and disturbing phenomena which seriously obstruct its growth rate in the short and medium term  the prospects for the developing world are grim indeed.159.	The sacrifices and efforts made by the devel¬oping countries  moreover  no longer receive the back¬up and support that are needed from a developed world which is becoming increasingly egocentric. In fact  official development assistance from member countries of the Organization for Economic Co¬operation and Development decreased by 6 per cent in 1981. Furthermore  the excessive indebtedness of the majority of developing countries has passed the critical threshold  and may at any time plunge many of these countries into bankruptcy. In addition  the proliferation and strengthening of protectionist measures in the developed countries may stifle  if they have not already done so  the emerging industries of the developing countries.160.	In brief  in their economic and social develop¬ment efforts the developing countries are facing serious obstacles: a deficit in the balance of payments  deterioration in the terms of trade  a decrease in the volume of their exports  higher debt-servicing costs  over-indebtedness and galloping imported inflation. The steady deterioration of the economic conditions of the developing countries does not seem to be of much concern to the industrialized countries  which  claiming domestic economic difficulties  obstruct change and oppose reform.161.	Urgent change is none the less greatly needed in order to restructure international economic relations on the basis of justice  equity and sovereign equality  in accordance with the objectives of the new interna¬tional economic order. To that end the members of the Group of 77 have proposed a new approach in a suitable framework. They are prepared to undertake  through global negotiations  an egalitarian  universal and dynamic dialogue  in order to study in a democratic forum  that of the General Assembly  the major problems in the way of international economic co¬operation. Instead of seizing the opportunity to engage in genuine  constructive and comprehensive negotia¬tions  our partners from the developed countries seem more concerned to safeguard and protect the excessive advantages inherited from an unjust economic order.162.	We are very disturbed at the lack of the sincere political will to launch the global negotiations on international economic co-operation for develop¬ment. We believe it is high time for the international community to reach agreement in this respect.163.	It is encouraging to see in the communique issued after the Versailles Economic Summit in June that the growth of the developing countries and the strengthening of constructive relations with them are vital to the political and economic prosperity of the world. Paradoxically  however  we are witnessing an erosion of the spirit of international co-operation. In recent years the developing countries have faced the rejection of dialogue by their industrialized partners from the north.164.	Our disappointment and our frustrations are increasing. Never before has international co-operation met so many obstacles  so often been deadlocked. We are even witnessing a calling into question of mutually accepted commitments to increase con¬siderably the financial resources of UNDP. The deterioration of the financial situation of UNDP is a source of concern and anxiety for all the developing countries. Such deterioration may not only hinder the implementation of those countries^ projects and pro¬grammes but even endanger the very principle of multilateral co-operation  which is urgently necessary for the international community  and in particular for developing countries.165.	It is essential  bearing in mind how far we are from attaining the objectives that we have set through our agreements  to redouble our efforts to give UNDP the financial means that it needs to enable it to sup¬port and aid the developing countries on a foreseeable  secure and continuing basis in their economic and social development efforts.166.	This attitude of rejection and obstruction on the part of certain developed countries is undeniably harmful to both the credibility and the ideals of the United Nations. It could destroy the rare achievements of multilateral co-operation  the results of so many years of effort.167.	We for our part will continue to believe in the virtues of dialogue and agreement  a democratic  com¬prehensive  global dialogue for the consideration of questions and for decision-making. In this respect  we are pleased that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has arrived at a convention which  despite the dissatisfaction that it may have provoked in certain quarters  none the less constitutes the embodiment of the law. We strongly hope that the results of 10 years of painstaking efforts and intense negotiations will soon be formally adopted by the entire international community.168.	The agenda of the thirty-seventh session  on only a few items of which I have touched  clearly demonstrates the seriousness of our responsibilities and the importance of the task before us  an enormous and most exhilarating task if we are truly to find solu¬tions to the problems of our day and prepare a better future for ourselves and our children. We must  first and foremost  rid ourselves of the specter of war and the threat of a nuclear holocaust  for which some with thoughtless equanimity are preparing.169.	It is urgently necessary to put an end to so-called localized wars and other regional conflicts which  like the one in the Middle East  spread and grow sharper day by day  bearing the constant danger of an overall conflagration.170.	We must take fully into account our com¬plementarity and our interdependence in order to prepare at last a new international order suited to our time. We must ensure strict respect for the principles embodied in the Charter and make this forum the primary place for agreement and negotiation  which alone can enable us to find comprehensive and generally acceptable solutions to our problems.171.	By adopting that course of action we defend the aims and objectives of the Organization and disprove the forecasts of its critics by strengthening its effectiveness  its prestige and its credibility. This is the course that Tunisia intends resolutely to pursue."
"134",6987,"TUR",37,1982,"May I first congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session. On this occasion it is a great pleasure for me to recall here that Turkey and Hungary have traditionally maintained friendly relations. As a colleague of yours for many years I have had the opportunity to appreciate your remarkable diplomatic skills  and I am confident that your guidance will enable us to channel our deliberations and work towards constructive ends. I wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani  who presided with diligence over the work of the Assembly during the past year under difficult and strenuous conditions. I wish also to reiterate our confidence in the Secretary- General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. His fortitude and his balanced  realistic approach to the problems besetting the world are a great asset to the United Nations as a whole.2.	The deterioration of the international situation has continued throughout the past year. East-West relations remain strained because of the infringement of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act ' and this hampers progress in arms control and in disarmament discussions so vital for peace and security in the world. The armaments race continues unabated. The world economy is going through its worst crisis since the Second World War. Against this background we are witnessing a greater tendency to resort to force and violence and a multiplication of conflicts and con¬frontations.3.	The thirty-seventh session is being held at a moment when we are all under the spell of the momentous events which have taken place in the Middle East during recent months. The whole world is stunned by the massacre of innocent men  women and children in the refugee camps of west Beirut. That outrage against humanity has compounded the tragedy unfolding in Lebanon since the Israelis invaded that country in early June.4.	The responsibility of Israel in the mass killings at the Sabra and Shatila camps is irrefutable. Israel has shown that it is not encumbered by any moral scruples in the pursuit of its political ambitions in the Middle East. It should be clear to everybody that there can be no peace and security in the Middle East unless Israel is deterred effectively from its intransigence  its propens ity instantly to resort to force and violence  its utter disregard for the interests of other countries in the area  its frightening contempt for human values and its defiance of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.5.	The aggression against Lebanon  the ruthless Israeli actions  the staggering human losses and the suffering and material damage inflicted upon the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples have been followed with abhorrence and revulsion by Turkish public opinion. We reiterate our condemnation of Israeli policies and actions. At the same time  we wish to make clear here that we view with mounting concern the dangerous implications of Israeli policies for the security of the Middle East as a whole  in which we have a vital stake.6.	The future course of events in Lebanon will be crucial for the entire area. Lebanon should be able to live as an independent and sovereign country and preserve its territorial integrity and unity. It should be under the influence of no other country of the region. We hope that  despite the convulsions it has suffered  the people of Lebanon will be able to achieve national reconciliation. Obviously  the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon is of paramount necessity and every effort should be exerted to prevent dilatory tactics by Israel.7.	The horror in Lebanon has heightened awareness of the fact that the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East conflict. There is greater sense of urgency in the efforts undertaken with a view to achieving a comprehensive  durable and just solu¬tion of the Middle East problem. We have in particular welcomed the recent initiative of the United States and the very constructive approach evolved by the Arab countries at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  which was held in September in Fez. The United States proposals contain elements which could con¬tribute significantly to the elaboration of a framework for future negotiations among the parties concerned. The proposals of the Arab Conference represent a common position and reflect the genuine desire of the Arab countries to achieve a balanced and realistic settlement in the interest of all the countries in the area. It is now up to Israel to respond in a positive manner to that approach and finally to alter its per¬ception of security for itself as consisting of continuous confrontation with its neighbors.8.	Concerning the substance of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict  I wish to repeat that we consider the following as indispensable ingredients of a lasting and just solution: withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including A1 Quds Al Sharif; recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish an independent State in their own territory; the participation of the Palestine l iberation Organization [PLO] as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in all peace negotiations  on an equal footing with the other interested parties in the conflict; the right of every State in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries; and the maintenance of the Arab and Islamic character of the Holy City of Al Quds Al Sharif.9.	The war which has been going on between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran for the past two years is a source of profound distress. From the very outset  we have felt deep anxiety over the disastrous conflict between two neighbouring Muslim countries. That war not only is detrimental to the interests of those two countries but also has grave implications for the security and stability of the entire Middle East.10.	We are saddened by the fact that various peace efforts have so far been of no avail. Turkey will continue to take an active part in the endeavors of the Islamic Peace Committee and persevere in its efforts to support them as an immediate neighbor of the two countries. We wish on this occasion to renew our appeal to both Iraq and Iran to put an end to the bloodshed and to embark with determination on the road of peace and reconciliation.11.	The dramatic developments in the Middle East cannot cloud our concern over the plight of Afghanistan. The valiant Afghan people continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination and remain under foreign military occupation. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General towards a negotiated settlement. Such a settlement should restore to the Afghan people their right to self- determination and lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country.12.	We realize that refugees are a tremendous burden for countries of asylum. As a humanitarian measure  we have recently settled nearly 5 000 refugees in Turkey. We have provided them a temporary home until they can return freely to their own country  if they so wish.13.	In Africa we follow developments regarding Namibia with a mixture of anxiety and guarded optimism. As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Turkey extends its unreserved support to the people of Namibia. We hope that on¬going negotiations for the independence of Namibia within the framework of United Nations resolutions will finally achieve their objective and thereby remove an important source of tension in the world. This would be a cause for rejoicing in an otherwise gloomy international scene.14.	Another ray of hope comes from Cyprus. Once the source of dangerous tension  that island has been enjoying peace and stability for more than eight years. Although a settlement has not yet been reached  the two national communities are committed to a con¬tinuous negotiating process. As a result of the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General  the intercommunal talks are now proceeding within a comprehensive framework encompassing allaspects of the Cyprus problem. The encouraging course of the negotiations has further strengthened our conviction that inter¬communal talks represent the only method for resolv¬ing the issue.15.	The two communities should now intensify their efforts to reshape their relations within a federal structure. They should concentrate their attention on dialogue. They should not be swayed by the counsel of those who would prefer a continuation of the con¬flict for their own selfish ends.16.	Turkey remains firmly committed to the objective of a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus question. We will continue to encourage the intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General.17.	The Kampuchean problem is another inter¬national issue which calls for an urgent solution. What is required is a political solution that would enable the people of that country to choose their government without coercion or intervention from outside. We should like to express the hope that the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea is a step which will contribute to such an evolution. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [/1SE/4JV] to bring peace to Kampuchea and promote stability and prosperity in South-East Asia.18.	I should like also to say a few words about the situation on the Korean peninsula. The division of Korea is certainly painful for all Koreans. We firmly believe that the reduction of tension on the peninsula and the creation of favorable conditions for a dialogue between the two parties concerned will contribute not only to the fulfillment of the national aspiration of the Korean people to unity but also to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.19.	The mounting terrorism and violence throughout the world is a cause for concern for the entire inter¬national community. some countries which have allowed their territory to be used for terrorist actions directed against other countries or have tolerated political and propaganda activities in support of such action are now becoming themselves the hunting grounds for all kinds of terrorism. That should increase the awareness that the need for international co-oper¬ation to curb this scourge is greater and more urgent than ever.20.	One manifestation of international terrorism is the attacks directed against diplomatic representatives. The General Assembly resolutions on the protection of diplomatic and consular agents and premises represent an important step in initiating international co-operation in this field. We hope that it will be possible this year to devise more effective measures for the prevention and elimination of such acts of terror.21.	Turkey has a special reason for feeling grave concern on this issue. Armenian terrorists have in recent years brutally assassinated more than 20 Turkish diplomats and officials. In the first week of August  Armenian terrorists launched an attack at Ankara airport in which nine people lost their lives and some 70 were wounded.22.	 	An intensive propaganda campaign  based on blatant falsification and distortion of history  lies behind these vile acts of terror. The Armenian propaganda alleges that a great number of Armenians were massacred in Turkey during the First World War. It demands vindication for this contrived and imaginary martyrdom.23.	No amount of propaganda and disinformation can alter historical truths or change political realities. After the First World War the Ottoman Empire collapsed and was replaced by a completely new State  the Turkish Republic. Many new States came into being on the territory of the Empire. But historical facts indicate that the assertions in Armenian propaganda are completely unfounded.24.	Prior to the First World War  the Armenians were concentrated in Istanbul  the capital of the Ottoman Empire  and in the eastern provinces. In none of the areas where they lived did they constitute anything more than a small minority. The Armenians found themselves in a majority only in a region of the Caucasuswhere eventually they created a State which signed a peace treaty with Turkey recognizing the present borders and later joined the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.25.	Armenian extremists began to resort to violence in the early 1890s in a manner very reminiscent of the activities of their successors today. They caused the deaths of a large number of innocent people. The outbreak of the First World War marks the most important crisis in relations between Turks and Arme¬nians. The Tsarist Russian Government then instigated the rising of the Armenians against Ottoman rule in eastern Anatolia  by promising the establishment of an Armenian State. That was the signal which prompted the Armenian extremists to commit large- scale atrocities against the Turkish population in eastern Anatolia  as the Russian armies advanced. It was only after these massacres that the Ottoman Government decided to move the Armenian population out of range of the Russian invading forces in eastern Turkey to central Syria  which was at that time within the boundaries of the Ottoman State. Specific instruc¬tions were issued for the protection of the life and property of the deportees.26.	Following those events  enormously exaggerated claims were put forward by Armenian propagandists. It was alleged that 1.5 million Armenians died. That is nonsense  since the total Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire did not exceed 1.2 million. Of that number  about half a million Armenians living in north¬east Turkey had moved to Russia at the outbreak of hostilities in the area. The deportees numbered approximately 400 000. A sizeable number found their way to Europe and the United States  and about 100 000 remained in Turkey after the war. There were of course Armenians as well as Turks who lost their lives during the war years. The number of Turks who died during that period was 2 million. Many of both communities died of cold  famine and disease and as a result of communal clashes upon the break¬down of law and order. Because Armenians collabor¬ated with invading Russian armies  many also died during military operations.27.	Neither moral nor historical justification can be found for the callous and senseless Armenian terrorism. It reflects a shameful rejection of the human values which the civilized world is trying to uphold. Armenian propaganda and violence can achieve nothing more than a long list of innocent victims.28.	Most of the support and aid that the protagonists of violence get from Armenian communities are obtained through extortion and intimidation. There is no doubt that the great majority of Armenians through¬out the world abhor the crimes committed by the fanatics among their ranks. The Armenians who continue to live in Turkey in full enjoyment of their rights and in complete harmony with Turks have condemned the acts of terror in the strongest terms. It is sad that some countries provide shelter and support to terrorists and encourage Armenian propaganda. These countries cannot disassociate themselves from the odious crimes being committed. At the same time  they are creating on their own territory an atmosphere propitious to the escalation of violence  which in the end can cause great harm to themselves.29.	In the economic Held  it is becoming increas¬ingly evident that the world economy is under the most adverse economic  financial and political pres¬sures of the post-war period. High rates of inflation  low rates of growth and severe current-account imbalances are indeed the order of the day. The dif¬ficulties confronted seem to be not transitory but lasting  as a result of maladjustments that have accumulated over a number of years.30.	Against the background of unstable and unpredictable economic conditions  many coun¬tries  particularly the industrialized countries  seem to be moving dangerously towards protectionism. Such a trend not only would be damaging to economic efficiency but also would diminish the prospects for economic growth.31.	It would be deceptive to think that domestic economic problems can be resolved effectively while the international economic system is in turmoil. Indeed  the economies of rich and poor countries are so interlocked that only international co-operation can restore growth and development. However  as the troubles of the industrialized countries increase international co-operation tends to diminish and con¬cern for developing countries wanes. Unlike the last major recession  in the mid-1970s  when increased aid and private capital flows to developing nations helped to shield them from its worse effects  this time the developing countries are left to face the full brunt largely unassisted. Developing countries  particularly the deficit developing countries  need more time and resources to carry out structural adjustments in a way that will minimize the loss of output  employment and income.32.	At no time has the economic interdependence among nations been more evident and at no time has there been greater need for the formulation of collec¬tive policies and reforms of established rules of conduct. Especially in the light of the current world recession  the formulation of a scheme for integrated development is indispensable.33.	It is with this conviction that my Government supports the launching of the global negotiations in an effort to deal with international economic issues in a comprehensive way. Sectoral approaches have not been sufficient or effective. It must be remembered that  as the major issues in international economic relations are interlinked  they can be resolved only through interdependence.34.	It is understandable that the developing coun¬tries are engaged in a process of extensive co-oper¬ation among themselves as well as in an effort to cope with many of the adverse effects of the deterior¬ating world economic conditions. We welcome the growing importance of South-South co-operation in this respect and believe that through such a process a: more meaningful dialogue could be established between the North and the South in dealing with the current inefficiencies and inadequacies of the world economic system.35.	Turkey  which is geographically situated between two continents  has always found itself playing a role as a link between Europe  the Middle East and the Islamic world. Indeed  it has for centuries been the meeting place between East and West and North and South. These factors explain Turkey's multidimen¬sional relations  namely  its efforts to improve relations with the countries of the region  its membership in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  its association with the European Community and  in particular  its expanding relations with the countries of the third world.36.	Although Turkey has great economic potential  it is still a developing country facing all the typical problems challenging other developing countries. Like them  it has been adversely affected by the rapidly changing and deteriorating world economic conditions. Its economy has for some time been in a state of crisis. However  at the beginning of 1980 it embarked on a vigorous stabilization program with the support of international financial institutions. Daring steps have been taken  and I can say with confidence that the results have been promising.37.	As can be seen  Turkey has done its part  as may have others  in good ""housekeeping""  and it will continue to do so with determination. The inter¬national community and its institutions as a whole must prepare themselves to respond to such positive adjustments- if we are to achieve any progress in finding effective ways of maintaining stable inter¬national economic relations in the interest of world peace and prosperity.38.	One encouraging aspect of this session has been the impact upon all of us of the first report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. He has put before us with clarity and perceptiveness the central issues the United Nations faces today. He has analyzed frankly and accurately the reasons preventing the Organization from fulfilling its basic mission of safeguarding peace and security and promoting international co-operation. We have been reminded appropriately of our duties and respon-sibilities. It is now incumbent upon us to reflect on the ideas of the Secretary-General and to come forward with renewed determination to transform the United Nations into an effective instrument of international peace and security and orient our bilateral and multilateral policies towards this objective."
"135",7049,"TZA",37,1982,"Sir  I should like to begin my statement by extending to you our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. This is a fitting tribute to your country and to you personally. We are gratified to note that  at this crucial time when the United Nations is being put to severe tests by ever-escalating tension and conflicts  as well as increasing economic problems  the membership of the Organization has entrusted a conscientious and able statesman with the task of steering us through this difficult course. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Kittani  who presided over the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly with efficiency  dignity and wisdom. We have noted with appreciation the commendable efforts continually expended by the Secretary-General in reasserting the authority of the Organization and putting it to the service of nations in time of conflict. In extending a formal welcome and hearty congratulations to him on his election to the post  I pledge my country's fullest co-operation with him in the years to come.Since the last session  the international community  particularly the Organization  has been confronted with trying times and challenging issues. The world watched in horror at the damage in Lebanon. We stood helpless as the conflict in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) degenerated into armed confrontation and took its toll. There is almost a subtle sense of resignation as	continues to devise the most brutal means of subjugating the people in South Africa. The Namibian people continue to be condemned to racist South Africa's illegal occupation and colonialism. And an end to the sad Iranian-Iraqi war continues to elude us.We are at present witnessing one of the most disturbing periods in the post-war era. The delicate balance so painstakingly fashioned over the many years through the process of international dialogue and detente is giving way to tension and confrontation. The procedures for the settlement of disputes which were so laboriously created have almost lost their influence over the trend of international relations. Today tension prevails in all areas of the world. Confrontation and outright resort to force become common means of settling disputes. The fundamental question is whether peace and security can be maintained in an environment where there is genuine concern that recourse to lawlessness will go unpunished by the international community or  at worst  be received with acquiescence by Members of the Organization.The politics of force  so reminiscent of the cold- war era  seem to be creeping back  thus poisoning the international political atmosphere. As a consequence  the global consensus that had evolved regarding various problems in the world  stands to be brushed aside by this resurgence of cold-war politics. In various parts of the world  perennial problems have continued to be resistant to solutions and new crisis situations have emerged.Peace is a deliberate process. To achieve peace  we must embark on a clear  deliberate and determined road in the search for solutions to the existing conflicts and look into viable means of averting those that are simmering. But we cannot do so unless our resolve is definite and our determination unflinching. We cannot do so unless we remain faithful to the ideals of the Charter and are willing to give it a chance to work. For Member States will be defeating the very purpose of their signatures to the Charter if  on the one hand  they extol its ideals and  on the other  pursue policies aimed at undermining it.constitutes constant aggression against the people of South Africa and a serious threat to international peace and security. It is a fact that apartheid is not invincible. But the struggle for its elimination is frustrated by the direct or indirect support the regime receives from some Members of the Organization. These Members  none the less  increase their co-operation with and support for that regime. We need not recount the number of times the international community has been preventedfrom taking action by the use of the veto. We need not remind the Assembly that the issue of comprehensive sanctions against that regime remains frozen  solely because of the unwillingness of some permanent members of the Security Council to consider it seriously. We need not spell out all the areas of economic and political  as well as military  co-operation.Regrettably  these obstacles placed on the path of the freedom struggle in South Africa have the effect of reinforcing the apartheid regime and making it even more insensitive to reason and more defiant of world opinion. The overall effect is to block the peaceful means towards the elimination of the scourge of . When peaceful avenues are thus blocked  the freedom fighters are left with no other option but to resort to armed resistance. The message which comes out loud and clear from the land ofis that the people of that unhappy land are prepared to make supreme sacrifices for their freedom and for their dignity. In concert with the rest of Africa  we reaffirm our support for and solidarity with the South African people and we reiterate our conviction that the international community can make an important contribution to that struggle if it shoulders its proper responsibility and institutes appropriate measures.Today  almost two decades after this body terminated the Mandate of South Africa and assumed direct responsibility for the Territory  the people of Namibia continue to be deprived of their most basic human rights It is indeed a sad commentary on the efficacy of the United Nations that Namibia should continue to be subjected to racism  colonialism and human suffering. The continued illegal occupation of that international Territory by South Africa is a flagrant violation of international law and constitutes an affront to world conscience and to the fundamental dignity of mankind.The	regime has a unique record of flouting international opinion. Inside Namibia it has unleashed a reign of terror against the people of the international Territory and particularly against the leadership and the heroic combatants of the South West Africa People's Organization. The regime has also been busy propping up internal surrogates in an attempt to facilitate the imposition of a neo-colonial solution to the problem.On the other hand  South Africa has been engaged in a systematic campaign of destabilization of the neighboring African States. Using the international Territory of Namibia as a launching pad  it has repeatedly committed blatant acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and  in the process  has inflicted damage and destruction to life and property. Women and children and other innocent civilians have been its constant victims and for more than one year now it has occupied parts of southern Angola  notwithstanding the international outcry and condemnation. Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe have also been subjected to aggression while the apartheid regime has continued its pressures on Botswana and subversion against the Kingdom of Lesotho. A part of its conspiracy against these African States  South Africa has been training  financing and equipping mercenaries to cause instability in some of them. All these acts constitute a clear threat to the security and stability of the region  with dangerous implications for international peace and security. They can be ignored only at our collective peril.Negotiations on the question of Namibia have become a saga of disappointment and frustration. Whenever there were prospects for a light at the end of the tunnel  those prospects were shattered by the introduction of new and unreasonable demands in the negotiating process. While we have been engaged in the negotiations aimed at securing a peaceful settlement to the Namibian question  we have maintained that: first  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the basis for achieving independence for Namibia and thus there is a need to have it implemented without delay; secondly  the Western contact group  at whose diplomatic initiative the plan for the independence of Namibia was originally conceived and which possesses considerable leverage over South Africa  has a duty to see to it that the plan is implemented; and thirdly  the central role of the Organization in working for the independence of the Territory must be underlined.Over the last few months the front-line States  SWAPO and Nigeria have been engaged in constructive consultations with the Western contact group regarding the implementation of resolution 435 (1978). We regret that  although some progress has been made  some issues remain outstanding. But the main obstacle remains the intransigence of the South African regime and this defiance by the South African authorities is regrettably assisted by the introduction into the negotiating process of an extraneous issue.It is thus a matter of deep regret that a non- issue should be made to pose as a difficulty. The attempt to link the independence of Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola poses a serious danger of derailing the entire exercise. The fact that this concept of linkage is now euphemistically called parallelism does not in any way change the substance of that policy. We have made it clear that this issue is against the letter and the spirit of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and constitutes interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. This position was reiterated by the heads of State and Government of the front-line States and by the President of SWAPO in their communique issued at the?? summit in Lusaka on 4 September this year. When we consider the painstaking efforts that have been made by all concerned with a view to achieving a negotiated solution to this seemingly intractable problem  it would be very sad indeed if these efforts were eventually to crumble because of an insistence on injecting into negotiations an issue which is totally alien to resolution 435 (1978). We are  in connection  gratified by the clear statement made by the Foreign Minister of France  Mr. Claude Cheyís son; in his press conference in Dar-es-Salaam yesterday  he made it very clear that France rejects the issue of linkage Freedom and independence for peoples and countries are principles we hold sacrosanct. It is in consonance with this policy that we have supported and shall continue to support the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence. It is a right which is engrained in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of African Unity	Thus while we search for a solution to the problem of Western Sahara  my country will continue to be guided by its commitment to these principles.Another tragic example of the powerlessness of the international community is the situation in Lebanon. The ongoing tragedy  with its implications for the sovereignty and integrity of a nation and the elementary human rights of the Lebanese and Palestinian people  is threatening to lead the entire region down the path of total conflagration. The Israeli occupation of Lebanon  the brutal war Israel has perpetrated against the Palestinians  the siege of Beirut and the dreadful massacres at Sabra and Shatila are a clear demonstration of the dangerously deteriorating situation in the area. Israel has invaded and continues to occupy the territory of a sovereign Member of the Organization. It bears responsibility for the murder of innocent Palestinian women and children. Perhaps one cannot adequately express in words the suffering  torment and the humiliation which the surviving people are being subjected to under Israeli occupation.We pay homage to the Lebanese and the Palestinian people for their heroism and steadfastness. We honor their monumental sacrifices  made in the cause of preserving their dignity and in the fight for what is right and just. We also pay a tribute to the Palestine Liberation Organization  which in a time of such profound crisis has demonstrated outstanding courage and statesmanship.Tanzania reiterates its firm belief that the restoration of peace and security will come about not through policies of military adventurism on the part of Israel  but through the promotion of the fundamental attributes of peace. A genuine and lasting peace hinges upon the enjoyment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination  including the right to establish an independent state of their own. The acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible  and hence Israel must withdraw from all the occupied territories. In consonance with that principle it must equally be underlined that respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the area is a necessary condition for the attainment of a genuine  viable and lasting solution to the problem.The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to be a matter of great concern to my country. We regret the fact that the two non- aligned neighbors are still engulfed in a seemingly unending war which has already claimed heavy casualties and has led to appalling devastation  of property. My country has actively supported  and will continue to support  the mediations efforts of the United Nations  the non-aligned movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  as well as those of individual countries which have sought to find a speedy  peaceful and lasting resolution of the conflict. In that connection  we note with appreciation the considerable efforts expended by the current Chairman of the non-aligned movement. Thus  we once more renew our appeal to the parties to the conflict through negotiations to bring about an end to the current conflict.Last year we expressed optimism over the situation in Cyprus. The momentum which has been injected into the intercommunal talks with the submission of comprehensive proposals encompassing both the territorial and constitutional aspects of the problem seems  unfortunately  to have lapsed. The persistence of this problem continues to plunge that tormented country into deeper division. My delegation will continue to support the efforts to promote dialogue and to search for a political framework within which the problem can be settled. We remain hopeful that the parties to the conflict will demonstrate a genuine willingness to co-operate fully with the representatives of the Secretary-General in evolving a mutually acceptable framework for bringing the tragedy to an end through the restoration of that country's unity and territorial integrity  as well as through the preservation of its sovereignty  independence and non-alignment.Tanzania supports the noble efforts of the Korean people towards the peaceful reunification of their country. At the same time we firmly believe that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the area would be a significant step towards ushering in a dialogue between the two parts of Korea  aimed at eventually bringing about peaceful reunification.Both in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  there must be concerted efforts on our part to settle the outstanding problems on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty   territorial integrity and nonintervention in the internal affairs of those States  to do this  however  there must be a willingness on the part of everyone to evolve a political framework within which these problems can be solved. For our part  we shall continue to support initiatives which are aimed at finding a political path to their final settlement.We view with deep disappointment the sterility of the many disarmament negotiations which have so far taken place. The second special session on disarmament was particularly disappointing. It reflected the trend away from a serious pursuit of disarmament. The arms race  far from being curbed  has been given a new and powerful impetus. The politics of force are threatening to destroy the fragile fabric of detente as preparations for war continue without let. Weapons are being perfected and new and more sophisticated ones roll from the assembly lines. Military budgets are at a record high. Notions of limited nuclear war and of so-called enhanced security through nuclear superiority seem to be working to undermine the basic climate of searching for peace through disarmament which has all this time been the cornerstone of all the negotiations. In sum  the spectre of a holocaust haunts the world as the international situation creates the possibility of an international conflagration.The politics of power have dangerously made countries prisoners of their own perceived sense of insecurity  which has in tum fuelled the race for more armaments. A new and courageous approach is needed to get out of this vicious circle. In that exercise  priority should be given to nuclear disarmament  for nuclear weapons pose the most immediate threat to the very survival of mankind.The Indian Ocean is close to our continent of Africa  and the Assembly  more than 10 years ago  adopted the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace to rid that area of military rivalry. But events are going in the exact opposite direction. The Indian Ocean is being further militarized by rival Powers. Contrary to the desire of the littoral and hinterland States for peace and security in the area  new foreign military bases are being established and nuclear warships and other weaponry are being introduced into the area. The ever-increasing foreign military presence and the rivalry of the great Powers put the peace of the countries in the Indian Ocean region further in jeopardy. We have also witnessed the regrettable obstruction by certain Powers of the holding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean. That situation calls for action. We therefore believe that  now more than ever  the Conference on the Indian Ocean is necessary.To an impoverished people  peace and security means more food  shelter and security from the scourge of economic underdevelopment. Because the arms race fritters away so much of the scarce resources and manpower while the majority of the people of the world live in abject poverty and misery may delegation sees those two elements as inextricably linked: linked  on the one hand  by the coexistence between lavish expenditure on armaments and the need for economic development; and  on the other hand  by the insecurity created by those armaments and that caused by economic hopelessness.In considering this close interrelationship between disarmament and development  therefore  the need to ensure that disarmament makes viable contributions to the social and economic development of the developing countries  and particularly to the establishment of the new international economic order  is an imperative one.All States Members of the United Nations do recognize the gravity of the deepening world economic crisis. Short-term measures adopted by certain developed countries in attempts to stimulate global economic recovery have failed to bring about the desired results. The crucial need to adopt a more realistic approach in order to eliminate the structural disequilibrium which characterizes the existing inequitable international economic system is becoming self- evident.	.Although the impact of the deteriorating world economic situation is increasingly being felt by the developed countries  it is the developing countries which continue to bear the brunt of this crisis because of the vulnerability of their poor economies to the unfavorable external conditions. These conditions  which are themselves structural in character  are made even worse by the unilateral adjustment measures adopted by some developed countries without due regard to their negative impact f*n the economies of the developing countries. Thus  for example  the protectionist measures against the raw materials and manufactured goods exported by the developing countries have led to a continued deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries. Many developing countries are having severe balance-of-payments problems. Yet the international monetary and financial institutions created to deal with such problems have proved insensitive to the development needs of the third world.Interdependence among nations can be of mutual benefit to all countries only if we also recognize imperative need to act collectively in our search for appropriate solutions to the global economic problems. But the international community is not inking in its recognition of the need for collective action on those problems. Through numerous resolutions and declarations  the Assembly has repeatedly appealed to all Members of the Organization to engage in meaningful negotiations with a view to implementing the goals and objectives of the new international economic order. General Assembly resolution 34/138  on the launching of global negotiations relating to international economic co-operation for development  still offers the best framework for the comprehensive coherent and integrated treatment of the interrelated issues in the field of raw materials  energy  trade  development  money and finance.Even at the risk of appearing repetitive  it should be stressed that what has been lacking is the necessary political will  particularly on the part of certain developed countries  to translate the desires of the international community into concrete action. And it is disappointing to note that some developed countries still insist on certain conditions which continue to delay the launching of these much-desired global negotiations. We wish  therefore  to express our sincere hope that all Member States represented here will rededicate their efforts at this current session to facilitating the launching of the global negotiations without further delay. Towards this objective my delegation pledges its full co-operation. We firmly believe that it is only through dialogue and negotiation that nations can find commonly acceptable solutions to their common problems  for the benefit of all the peoples of the world.There has been hardly any field in recent history where so many interests have been involved  where such interests have been so much at variance with one another and where reconciliation has been so complex a pursuit as the law to govern the oceans and seas of the world. If  therefore  there is one contemporary example of what the world community of nations can achieve through collective endeavors when such efforts are coupled with political will and a determination to succeed  it is the just-concluded United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Nobody has been  or could be  fully satisfied with it. It is  after all  the product of give-and-take. Indeed  many of us believe that more justice could have been done. That notwithstanding  we are confident that the Convention constitutes an adequate basis for the promotion of justice in the use of the oceans and a commendable step in the establishment of the new international economic order. We join those who have called for its signature and ratification and therefore entry into force as soon as possible. So historic an achievement is too momentous to waste  and the consequences of a fault would inevitably be too grave for all of us.It is evident that none of the problems facing humanity are completely beyond solution. The issue is not whether a solution is possible or not. Rather  it is how much longer these problems can wait to be solved—whether time is still on our side. Some problems constitute merely a threat to the well-being of man; some prolong suffering: and others are leading us to self-destruction. Our choices are not very many. But the decisions are ours  and the power to exercise our will is also ours. But time is not indefinitely on our side."
"136",7094,"UGA",37,1982,"The people of Uganda have placed their hopes for world peace and security in this Organization which was founded 37 years ago after the most disastrous war this planet has ever known. The collective determination which the peoples of the United Nations expressed in 1945 to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war must remain the fundamental objective of the Organization. I should like  on behalf of the delegation of Uganda  to extend to the President our warm congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. His wide diplomatic experience and his extensive knowledge of the United Nations uniquely qualify him to discharge the onerous responsibilities we have entrusted to him. Our satisfaction at his election is all the greater because he hails from Hungary  a count y with which Uganda enjoys very cordial relations. I take this opportunity to pay a most well  deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Ismat Kittani  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq. Mr. Kittani presided over the various sessions held by the General Assembly during his term of office with exceptional skill  devotion and competence. We wish him well in all his future endeavors. I also wish  on this occasion  to pay a very warm tribute to our distinguished Secretary General  who has worked hard  since his election to that high office  with much courage and rare commitment  to restore and enhance the effectiveness of the Organization. We are meeting here at a time when the question of Namibia is uppermost in our minds. We are asking more urgently than ever: when is Namibia going to be free? For how long will the present maneuvers to postpone the day of independence for the people of Namibia? There is no need any more to recount the number of occasions on the long journey towards Namibian independence when our hopes have been elevated only to have been crushed at every critical turn on the road. In the course of the last three months we have been treated to well publicized reports about substantial progress towards a negotiated settlement. Today  however hard we focus our gaze on the distant prospects  we cannot see any real or concrete manifestations of a settlement. Instead we are witnessing the injection of extraneous and irrelevant elements into the negotiations. We see no justification for any linkage between Namibian independence and the presence of Cuban military personnel in Angola. The former is a clear cut colonial issue and has been treated as such by the United Nations and by the entire international community. The latter  on the other hand  is a bilateral arrangement  which is by no means unique  between two independent  sovereign States. In any case  how can anyone forget that the presence of Cuban military personnel in Angola was occasioned in the first instance by South African aggression against Angola. Moreover  these acts of aggression have continued unabated to this very day. Even as we deliberate here today  South African troops continue to occupy the southern region of Angola. We challenge anyone to cite even a single instance of Angolan incursion into South Africa  with or without Cuban military personnel. Those who are touting the so called linkage are attempting to rewrite history. In spite of the obvious facts to the contrary they are seeking to create a make believe world  a world in which the aggressor appears as the victim and the real victim is projected as a threat to the aggressor. This so called linkage is a very suspicious scheme indeed  one which we find inadmissible and unacceptable. We want to state once again that Security Council resolution 435 continues to be the only basis for a negotiated settlement for Namibian independence. I wish to stress  moreover  the special political and moral responsibility which the five Western States bear in this matter. We urge them to admit that responsibility and to bring to an immediate end South Africa's intransigence and procrastination. We salute the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  their sole and authentic representative  for the heroic struggle they continue to wage against the occupying Power  as well as for the exemplary statesmanship they have demonstrated throughout the process of negotiations. In South Africa itself the situation has continued to deteriorate dramatically. The racist minority regime continues its oppression of the majority of the people with impunity. Freedom fighters have been given death sentences by the apartheid courts. Trade union movements are being subjected to the most repressive laws. Opponents of apartheid have been assassinated in detention centers and in neighboring countries. Helpless women and children have been forcibly evacuated from their urban settlements and dumped like waste into remote and unproductive reserves. In a vain attempt to consolidate further the apartheid system and divide the ranks of the oppressed  the Pretoria regime has tried to coopt some sectors of the oppressed communities into the segregated power structure  while that power structure continues to exclude the vast majority of the people from any exercise of political or economic power. This transparent ploy of divide and rule  like the other ploys before it  is bound to fail. In addition to supporting the internal resistance which is gaining momentum every day  the international community must spare no effort to isolate the racist minority regime. We condemn those countries that continue to strengthen the system of apartheid through their collaboration in the economic  military and nuclear fields. In this regard  we want to see the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 418 on the arms embargo against the minority racist regime. We urge the Security Council to act with speed to block the existing loopholes in the arms embargo regime. We take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the front line States for their relentless commitment to the cause of freedom and justice in southern Africa. We also reaffirm our solidarity with the liberation movements of South Africa in their just struggle to free their homeland from the grip of oppression. In particular  we salute the African National Congress for its significant contribution in this regard. We also take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the just struggle of the Sahraoui people under the leadership of POLISARIO. In the Middle East the peoples of the region are today living through a terrible nightmare  a nightmare which started with the massive and unprovoked Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June this year. Employing some of the most inhuman methods of mass destruction  such as cluster and phosphorous bombs  Israeli troops massacred thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians  the vast majority of whom were innocent and defenseless civilians. Most recently we were deeply shocked by the massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps in west Beirut. Israel's aggressive conduct can be explained only in the context of its long standing designs on Lebanon  namely the dismemberment of Lebanon and the control of the Litani River. We demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly. Uganda continues to maintain that the core of the Middle East conflict is the question of Palestine. The Middle East cannot know any peace until the Palestinian people fully realize their right to self  determination and nationhood. The sooner Israel accepts this reality  the better for it and for all the communities of the region. An American writer  I. F. Stone  expressed very well a universal concern in an article which appeared in New York Journal of 19 July 1982 under the title When Tel Aviv Was West Beirut when he stated: Can we Jews not recognize the image in our own mirrors? Can we not respond to a kindred people being made homeless once again  first in Palestine  now in Lebanon? If a Jewish State in Palestine  why not a Palestinian State  too? Who betterthan we should understand Palestinian desperation and homelessness? It is in recognition of this fact that Uganda reiterates its unflinching support for the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization  their sole and legitimate representative. It is for the same reason that we welcome and support the proposals adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez last month. In our view  those proposals are in full conformity with the various resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council on the situation in the Middle East. On the question of Korea  Uganda has always supported the desire of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. We have always maintained that the division of Korea is an injustice committed against the Korean people through the mechanism of foreign intervention. That injustice must be remedied through an early and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula  free from external interference. While we applaud the positive beginning ushered in by the joint communique of 4 July 1972 we especially welcome the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea wards the peaceful reunification of Korea. The tragic war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq continues to be a matter of grave concern to us. In our view  the continuation of that conflict is clearly not in the interests of either the Iranian or the Iraqi people. We appeal once again to the parties in conflict to abandon the path of war and settle their differences by peaceful means. Uganda remains concerned about the unhappy situations in Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea  all of which call for negotiated political solutions. The peoples of those countries must be allowed to determine their own destinies  free from any outside interference. We live in an era in which advances in science and technology have placed in our hands arsenals capable of destroying the world 30 times over. Even more ominous is the fact that we live in an era in which the nations that possess those deadly weapons of destruction are showing an increasing willingness to use them to wage limited and winnable nuclear wars. Such talk  needless to say  is cause for grave concern to all peace loving countries and peoples. Our concern has been heightened by the failure of the Assembly at the second special session on disarmament to adopt concrete measures to eliminate the dangers of war  halt and reverse the arms race and adopt a comprehensive programme for disarmament. The peoples of the world had placed high hopes on the outcome of the session. The mammoth rally held here in New York at the time of the session  as well as peace demonstrations all over the world in favor of disarmament  were a clear message of international public indignation at the unbridled arms race and in favor of peace. The failure to adopt concrete measures tor effective disarmament negotiations was therefore a deep disappointment to all peace loving peoples the world over. Those who contributed to that dismal outcome to the session must take full responsibility for the consequences that may follow. We believe that the deadlock in disarmament negotiations has and will continue to have negative effects on other areas of international cooperation. It is therefore of the utmost importance this session of the General Assembly find ways and means of breaking the deadlock. In this regard  we urge the big Powers to exercise restraint and flexibility and to show the necessary political will so as to further the cause of peace. We are meeting in the aftermath of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  held at Vienna  9 to 21 August  the report of which is before the Assembly. The potential of outer space represents a valuable common heritage for mankind. Outer space offers yet another unique opportunity for mankind to explore new frontiers with a common purpose and for mutual benefit. In the view of my delegation  the exploration and exploitation of outer space should proceedon the basis of a cooperative effort determined by an international set of binding principles and rules. The pursuit of cooperative objectives and common benefits precludes the promotion of contradictory interests. It is for this reason that my delegation is strongly opposed to the militarization of outer space. We urge strict adherence to the 1966 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies. On the economic f. the situation is equally grave. The global economic crisis  which is characterized by recession and rampant inflation  high interest rates and protectionism in the developed countries on the one hand and a serious deterioration in the terms of trade and increasing external indebtedness of the developing countries  on the other hand  has reached alarming dimensions. The situation has been compounded by the deadlock in international economic negotiations  the arms race and a drastic decline in the transfer of real resources to the developing countries. All those factors have combined to affect adversely the world economy in general and the development of the developing countries in particular. There has  in addition  been a sharp decline in the spirit of interdependence and in international cooperation aimed at finding constructive solutions to present problems. The emphasis which is increasingly being given to bilateral arrangements by some developed countries at the expense of multilateral cooperation has gravely affected the operation of multilateral agencies and programmes such as UNDP  and the economies of the developing countries. Under these circumstances  the launching of global negotiations remains one of the most important items on the agenda of the General Assembly. The hopes the international community has placed in the General Assembly to ensure that the process of correcting the structural imbalances in the present world economy is embarked upon without any further delay must be realized. As we have previously stated  our frustration has been increased by the glaring lack of progress in implementing the decisions unanimously adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  at which a solemn commitment to work for the establishment of the new international economic order was made by all of us. It was therefore with a deep sense of disappointment that we witnessed the failure at the thirty sixth session to break the impasse in the launching of global negotiations. In this regard Uganda is of the view that General Assembly resolution 34/138 of 14 December 1979  which was accepted by the international community as a whole  is the appropriate basis for launching the global negotiations. We appeal to those countries that are stalling to join the consensus on the need for an early launching of those negotiations. The present economic problems must not prevent us from charting a more stable and reliable path to meaningful international economic cooperation for development. If the global round of negotiations is not launched soon  we fear that there will continue to be increasing difficulties in other forthcoming negotiations such as those at the sixth session of UNCTAD and the fourth session of UNIDO. Indeed  the success or failure of the thirty seventh session will be judged by whether or not we can generate adequate political will to bring about a breakthrough for the launching of global negotiations. As one of the least developed countries  Uganda attaches great importance to the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted in Paris last year? for the purpose of arresting the economic deterioration of the least developed countries. We believe that its speedy and successful implementation requires a deeper sense of commitment to substantial resource focus on the least developed countries  especially on the part of the developed countries  international financial institutions and United Nations agencies. We are very concerned that no agreement has sofar been reached on the twin critical issues of specific additional and adequate financial targets for new and renewable sources of energy and the establishment of an energy affiliate of the World Bank. We hope  however  that the consultative mechanism contained in the Rome compromise for the mobilization of finance and the transfer of technology to the developing countries will receive the necessary international support. We have for a long time accepted that international measures of assistance are only supportive and cannot indeed  should not be a substitute for efforts by the developing counties themselves. In this regard we commend the efforts of the developing countries to implement the Caracas Programme of Action. The seriousness with which a number of Group of 77 sectorial meetings with regard to the implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action have been undertaken is evidence that the spirit of Caracas continues to grow. 39. Uganda remains committed to the strengthening of economic cooperation among developing countries as an essential component of the new international economic order and as an effective means of enhancing the collective self reliance of the developing countries. In Africa we are trying to foster economic cooperation under the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for Mie Economic Development of Africa. The international community should assist Africa in its efforts to implement the Lagos Plan of Action  which we hope will in time secure the economic integration of the continent. The year 1982 has been characterized by an increase in armed conflicts  escalation if the arms race  the persistence of potentially explosive territorial disputes; lingering colonialism and foreign interference and intervention. Unbridled big Power rivalry and the quest for spheres of dominance have continued to fuel the hotbeds of world tension. This increasing world tension has had a very negative impact on the work of the United Nations. It is against this background that we salute and commend the Secretary General for his bold and refreshing report on the work of the Organization. As a member of the Security Council  Uganda is familiar with the trend that has led to the steady erosion of the Security Council's authority and effectiveness. My delegation is of the view that the Secretary General's report deserves formal consideration by both the Security Council and the General Assembly  in order to work out concrete measures to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations. Uganda celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its independence last Saturday  9 October 1982. In two weeks' time it will be 20 years since Uganda was admitted as the one hundred and tenth Member of the United Nations. On this memorable occasion I should like to recall what the President of the Republic of Uganda A. Milton Obote  said from this rostrum at the seventeenth session 20 years ago with regard to the international situation: I am very conscious that Uganda joins the Organization at a time when humanity is at the crossroads of destiny  when great nations are re arming With the most devastating weapons ever known  when the world Organization and the world at large are ridden with ideological conflicts and the continuing effects of the cold war  and when vast resources that should be used for the alleviation of human misery are being channeled into nuclear armaments. Today the world seems dark  but these darkening scenes  we  as a new Member  pray  should not discourage us in the ability of the Member nations present here to realize the shortcomings of this Organization and to pledge their faith in its ability as the only positive hope for the restoration of sanity and peace among the nations of the world. Those remarks remain very pertinent today  indeed more so than in 1962. As we enter the third decade of our independence. I wish to reaffirm  on behalf of the Government and people of Uganda  our full commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and our faith in the ability of the Organization to develop the capacity to save present and future generations from the scourge of war."
"137",7139,"UKR",37,1982,"Mr. Presi¬dent  the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic warmly congratulates you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh ses¬sion of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal qualities and your diplomatic skill have won you the deep respect of delegations. It is a particular pleasure for us that the post of President of the Assem¬bly is occupied by a representative of the fraternal Socialist Republic of Hungary. Our delegation would like to assure you of its co-operation and wish you success in the performance of your responsible and difficult task.2.	Whenever one comes to the rostrum of the General Assembly one is keenly aware of the high responsibility entrusted by the peoples of the world to the United Nations. Here at the United Nations we find a reflection of the most urgent problems facing mankind  which require collective solutions in the interests of all countries and peoples.3.	No conflicts or contradictions among States  no differences in social systems  ideologies or ways of life can eclipse the common need: to preserve peace and prevent a nuclear war. The speeches of the majority of representatives have had as their theme a feeling of alarm for the fate of the world  an awareness of the fact that it is at a dangerous point and that everything must be done to avert the nuclear threat hanging over mankind.4.	Today  when the international situation has seriously deteriorated—and for this the imperialist forces are to blame—when those forces are pursuing an unbridled arms race which threatens to lead to a nuclear catastrophe  the words of the Charter  that the United Nations is called upon for to save succeeding generations from the scourge of warfar   are particularly relevant.The Ukrainian SSR  which played its part in the creation of the United Nations  in defining its purposes and principles  is working as always for an effective contribution by the United Nations to strengthening international peace and security  overcoming crisis situations and enhancing its role in the struggle to rid mankind of the threat of war. We believe that more active efforts by the United Nations aimed at securing peace and developing co-operation among States in accordance with the provisions of the Charter are of particular importance today when the world faces a situation in which its purposes and principles are ignored and violated.6.	In this difficult period of acute struggle between two opposed orientations in world policy there is no more important or more urgent task than that of limiting the arms race and striving for disarmament. The future of mankind depends upon the fulfillment of that task. For those reasons the Ukrainian SSR  together with all the socialist countries  supports the idea of the adoption of immediate and realistic measures to avert a nuclear war  to curb the arms race and bring about disarmament  to eliminate the hotbeds of international tension.7.	To preserve peace  to ensure the peaceful coexis¬tence of States with different social systems and to solve all controversial issues by peaceful means—these are the key goals of the Programme of Peace for the 1980s  adopted by the Twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is those goals which have determined the general thrust of the foreign policy initiatives of the Soviet Union. This coincides with the vital interests of the majority of the non-aligned countries and is in accordance with the peace-loving aspirations of all peoples and with the purposes and principles of the Charter.8.	Aggressive imperialist circles  however  particularly the United States of America  take a com¬pletely opposite position on questions of war and peace. The United States and its closest allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] have adopted a course of intensifying confrontation  speeding up the arms race  undermining the existing strategic stability in order to achieve military superiority  interfering in the internal affairs of States and encouraging aggression and the rule of inter¬national arbitrariness.9.	The United States has blocked the negotiations on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests  on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons  on the [imitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean  on the limitation of trade in and transfers of con¬ventional weapons and on anti-satellite systems. The NATO countries are to blame for the slowing down of the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. United Nations decisions aimed at prohibiting the manufacture of neutron weapons  the renunciation of the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and the holding of talks on nuclear disarmament remain unimplemented. Moreover  official representatives of the Unite j States Administration and certain leaders of NATO countries have put forward justification for the idea of the first use of nuclear weapons and the constant building-up of nuclear arsenals to those ends.10.	It is precisely that which is the true reason for the deterioration of the situation in the world and the intensified danger of war.11.	The world has witnessed material preparations for war  the constant threat of the use of force  the use of methods of power diplomacy and the indoc¬trination of the population with a spirit of militarism. This is a concrete manifestation of the reactionary nature of contemporary imperialism. Adventurism in international affairs which is inherent in imperialism is fraught with particular danger today precisely because the world has accumulated a vast potential of the most deadly weapons  which are capable of destroying life on earth.12.	In stressing the great seriousness of the time at which the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held  the delegation of the Ukrai¬nian SSR believes at the same time that the peoples of the world are entirely capable of averting a thermo¬nuclear conflict. The Ukrainian SSR  like other socialist countries  is convinced that in the present conditions we must seal  ever more actively ways and means of normalizing the international situation  using all available means which could serve to ease the unfavorable political climate. We believe that in this context the United Nations has a major role to play. The United Nations must not allow one State or a number of States to wipe out or throw overboard all the benefits brought about in international rela¬tions in the 1970s and what has been achieved by detente  and edge the world closer to the abyss of war.13.	What we need today is a genuine breakthrough towards the curbing of the unbridled arms race and promoting disarmament  and the immediate imple¬mentation of practical measures in that field. We do not need words declarations of good intentions. Only a constructive approach to the solution of the most acute present-day problems can prevent mankind from slipping towards the nuclear abyss.14.	Numerous concrete and realistic proposals on halting the arms race and on disarmament measures in various areas have been put forward by the socialist countries  with the aim of achieving this goal. They include the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe  adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 36/100  on the initiative of the Soviet Union  which declares that the first to use nuclear weapons will be committing the gravest crime against humanity and calls for joint efforts  through negotiations con¬ducted in good faith and on the basis of equality  to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race.15.	A concrete step of historic significance in this direction was taken by the Soviet Union when it unilaterally assumed the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. This gives a powerful impetus to the radical easing of the threat of nuclear war and the strengthening of confidence in inter¬national relations. But if this is to be achieved  all nuclear-weapon States must follow the example of the Soviet Union by assuming the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Then the threat of nuclear annihilation would be banished from the life of mankind  all aspects of international security would acquire a completely new character and new prospects would open up for accelerating progress in resolving questions of limiting the arms race and bring¬ing about disarmament.16.	We also believe that at this session the General Assembly could contribute significantly to the imple¬mentation of the Soviet proposal on the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in inter¬national relations.' The preparation and conclusion of such a treaty is of particular relevance today in the context of the deterioration in the international situation and when certain States are not only ever more frequently threatening to use force but  in violation of the Charter and United Nations deci¬sions  are actually using it in order to subject other States and peoples to their domination. A treaty on the non-use of force would be a reliable instrument against the use of any weapons for purposes of aggres¬sion. The time is ripe for such a measure. We are sincerely convinced that if the General Assembly made the renunciation of the use or threat of force with any type of weapons  nuclear or conventional  into a law of international life  it would serve the security interests not only of the nuclear-weapon States but also of the non-nuclear-weapon States.17.	A solid basis for the cessation of the buildup of the most dangerous means of warfare was created by the new proposals of the Soviet Union  put forward at the second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament 2 relating to the elaboration and stage-by-stage implementation of a program of nuclear disarmament  and the realistic proposals of many other States to curb and halt the nuclear arms race. It can be stated with some assurance that support by the General Assembly for the practical implementation of these measures for limiting arma¬ments and bringing about disarmament would con¬tribute to the strengthening of international peace and security.18.	There is no doubt that a significant contribution towards the achievement of this goal would be made by concrete agreements in the current Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons and the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe.19.	A serious obstacle to the development of new types and systems of nuclear weapons  as well as to the emergence of new nuclear-weapon States  would be created by the immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests by all States in all environments. Twenty years have passed since the conclusion of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and Under Watery but  because of the obstructionist position of certain nuclear States  it has not been possible to achieve the complete cessation of nuclear tests. Furthermore  it is common knowledge that the Pentagon is preparing new programmes for the qualita¬tive improvement of nuclear weapons and for the development of even more dangerous types and systems of such weapons. The United States has broken off the trilateral talks on the total prohibition of nuclear tests. In order to overcome this deadlock  the Soviet Union has called for the preparation and conclusion without delay of an international treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests and has submitted basic provisions of such a treaty for consideration at this session. The Soviet proposal takes into account all the positive achievements of the many years of dis¬cussion of the problem of the prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests  it also reflects the ideas and views of many States with regard  in particular  to questions of verifying compliance with any future treaty. The declaration by all nuclear-weapon States of a mora¬torium on ail nuclear explosions  including explosions for peaceful purposes  would contribute to the creation of more favorable conditions for the preparation of such a treaty. Such a moratorium would be effective pending the conclusion of the treaty itself.20.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is convinced that the speedy resolution of the question of the immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests would contribute significantly towards curbing the nuclear arms race and in particular halting the qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and the creation of new types and systems of such weapons  as well as towards strengthening the non- proliferation regime of nuclear weapons. Agreement on this very important issue—provided  of course  that all nuclear-weapon States evinced the political will and a constructive approach—would contribute to lessening the threat of nuclear war.21.	The Soviet Union has proposed that at this session the Assembly consider another item  entitled for Intensification of efforts to remove the threat of nuclear war and ensure the safe development of nuclear energy. The Ukrainian SSR attaches great significance to this question. In our Republic we are actively engaged in the rapid development of nuclear energy by building nuclear power stations which enable us to satisfy the ever-goring need for energy of industry  agriculture and scientific research.22.	It goes without saying that the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities even using conventional weapons would be tantamount  as far as the con¬sequences were concerned  to an attack using nuclear weapons  which the United Nations has already described as the gravest crime against humanity.23.	Therefore  the need to ensure the safe develop¬ment of nuclear energy flows logically from the task of preventing the unleashing of a nuclear war. In its approach to this question the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR proceeds from the belief that the safe development of nuclear energy presupposes that both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States  since they have an interest in the development and compre¬hensive peaceful uses of nuclear energy  should prevent actions which might lead to the deliberate destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities. Leonid Brezhnev  in his message to the participants in the twenty-sixth session of the General Conference of IAEA  stressed the need to do everything possible to ensure that nuclear energy—which is the greatest achievement of the human intellect—serves only the interests of peace and never becomes a means of destroying life on earth.24.	One of the most pressing problems continues to be that of the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons. The draft basic principles of a convention to that effect  which were put forward by the Soviet Union during the second special session on disarmament are designed to make it possible to take a decisive step in that direction.25.	The refusal of the United States to take part in the bilateral Soviet-American talks and its open policy of expanding the production and stockpiling of new types of chemical weapons  including binary weapons  as well as its policy of deploying them in some member States of NATO  have dashed the hopes of the peo¬ples of the world for an early solution to this important problem and increased the danger of chemical war¬fare. Furthermore  the refusal to negotiate and the building-up of arsenals of chemical weapons have been accompanied and covered up by false anti- Soviet propaganda.26.	The draft basic provisions of a treaty put forward by the Soviet Union take into account the views of other States  including the question of verification  and open up real prospects of reaching mutually acceptable agreements. To that end  it is necessary for the United States and its allies to show real willing¬ness and adopt a responsible approach to the matter.27.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that it is necessary to step up the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons within the Com¬mittee on Disarmament and to resume the bilateral talks on this question between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. In our view  the General Assembly could make a contribution to the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons by calling for a resumption of the talks and prohibition of the production and deploy¬ment of new types of chemical weapons  including binary weapons  and of their deployment in the ter¬ritory of other States.28.	The day before yesterday marked the twenty- fifth anniversary of an outstanding event—the launch¬ing by the Soviet Union of the world's first spaceship  which ushered in the space era. The world is entitled to take pride in the successes over the years in the exploration and uses of outer space  whose vast expanses should be used only as the arena of peace¬ful co-operation among States. In this connection the military space programmes which are being worked out and implemented by the United States must give rise to serious concern. Such dangerous developments call for the early conclusion of an international treaty on the prohibition of the deployment of weapons of any type in outer space  as proposed by the Soviet Union.229.	The limitation and reduction of conventional arms and armed forces is another important task. As a first step towards this an agreement should be reached not to increase armed forces or conventional arms  thus creating the groundwork for talks on their subsequent reduction.30.	The Ukrainian SSR was among the first to ratify the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. We believe that an early entry into force of this Convention would be conducive to the solution of the broader and more important problems in the field of the imitation and reduction of conventional weapons.31.	In view of the current international situation it is crucial to take specific steps to strengthen inter¬national security  eliminate hotbeds of tension and military conflicts  and halt acts of aggression in various parts of the world.32.	In recent months the situation in the Middle East has undergone a tragic and dangerous change. A military conflagration has once again Reared up which has consumed many thousands of human lives. New setbacks have emerged to a just settlement of the Middle East conflict. We have witnessed monstrous and evil crimes  the responsibility for which rests as an indelible stain on the hands of the ruling circles in Israel  which unleashed a destructive war against Lebanon. What has been done by the Israeli military clique in that long-suffering country is nothing short of genocide  a planned and deliberate extermination of the Palestinian people. The tragedy of Beirut has brought back to the memory of mankind the darkest scenes from the past—the bloody crimes of the Nazis in the Second World War. It ranks with such evil deeds of the Fascists as the massacre of the people of Babi Yar  Kiev  where in 1941 many tens of thousands of people were murdered  mainly women  children and old men and where  incidentally  side by side with Russians and Ukrainians many innocent Jews were kitted.33.	Blinded by military intoxication the ruling circles in Israel have trampled into the mud not only the time- honoured international rules and concepts that were reaffirmed in the Charter and the will of the international community expressed in numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Secu¬rity Council  but also their own human image. Such brutal behavior by the aggressor would not have been possible without the political protection and extensive military and financial aid Israel has been receiving from its influential American benefactors. Their role in the Lebanese tragedy is one of infamy  for without their support Israel would never have dared perpetrate this aggression.34.	Israel's growing aggressiveness is a direct con¬sequence of the Camp David conspiracy and of the so-called strategic consensus between Washington and Tel Aviv. It is absolutely clear to us that United States policy in the Middle East is further to escalate tension there so as to expand and consolidate its military presence  creating a spring-board for direct interference in the affairs of States of this and of adjacent regions.33. Today  more than ever  there is a need to move in the most responsible manner towards a comprehen¬sive and just settlement in the Middle East. It is clear that such a settlement cannot be achieved by means of hostile confrontation and separate deals or attempts to remove the Palestinian problem by military or other means contrary to the will of the Palestinian people. The plan for a Middle East settlement proposed by the President of the United States lacks the main element—recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a State of their own. Moreover  it openly proclaims that the United States is opposed to the creation of such a State.36.	A comprehensive political settlement of the Middle East conflict should include withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  the exercise of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including their right to create their own State  and creation of the conditions for the secure and independent development of all States in the Middle East. The modalities of a comprehensive  really just and truly lasting settlement in the Middle East are contained in a succinct form in a new major initiative by the head of the Soviet State  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  made public on 15 September.37.	It is our firm belief that a lasting peace in this region can only be achieved through the collective efforts of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. A proposal by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to convene an international conference on the subject is in keeping with this objective. We are ready to co-operate along these lines with all those who cherish the ideals of peace and security in the Middle East and in the world at large.38.	Developments in the world depend to a large extent to the shape of relations among European States belonging to different social systems. Through¬out the past decade the peoples of Europe have really felt the advantages of the policy of detente  which has had a favorable effect upon the political climate and has promoted the development and strengthening of mutually beneficial East-West co-operation in all fields. During this period the Euro¬pean peoples have come to realize that the only reasonable path is to continue detente and extend it to the military Held.39.	For the continent of Europe to become a con¬tinent of peace and genuine co-operation many artificial barriers put up lately must be removed and  as a matter of priority  the level of military con¬frontation in this region must be lowered.40.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR would like to reaffirm its position of principle in support of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. Efforts to secure a success¬ful completion of the intercommunal talks held under United Nations auspices must continue  as well as with regard to the settlement of existing outstanding issues in the spirit of understanding and good will. Demilitarization of the island  providing for the with¬drawal of all foreign forces and the elimination of all foreign military bases  is an important condition for a credible settlement in Cyprus.41.	The implementation of a proposal by the Mon¬golian People's Republic to conclude a convention on non-aggression and non-use of force in relations among States of Asia and the Pacific would make a considerable contribution to improving the world climate in general  easing tension and strengthening security in Asia. A successful restructuring of rela¬tions in this vast region  on the basis of the prin¬ciples of mutual respect for independence  sover-eignty  the inviolability of borders  non-interference  the non-use or threat of force and the settlement of disputes exclusively through peaceful means  would be an historic breakthrough for future developments in Asia. Mongolia's initiative has the same thrust as proposals to makethe Indian Ocean a zone of peace and other constructive ideas of Asian States.42.	We reaffirm our position of principle on the question of Korea  as well as our solidarity with the struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful  democratic reunification of its home-land  free from outside interference  and for the with¬drawal of foreign troops from South Korea.43.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR considers a complete cessation and the guaranteed non resumption of aggressive acts against Afghanistan  as well as of other forms of interference in its internal affairs  to be a major condition for normalizing the situation in Asia. To discuss the so-called Afghan question in the General Assembly and to ram through resolu¬tions devoid of political realism can only obstruct efforts aimed at settling the situation around Afghani¬stan. Concrete and constructive proposals for such a settlement have been put forward by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.44.	The Ukrainian SSR also supports the initiatives undertaken by the States of Indo-China with a view to strengthening peace in South-East Asia  con¬ducting a constructive dialogue and promoting co-oper¬ation with the States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and  in parti¬cular  the proposals contained in a joint communique of 7 July issued by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. We are confident that to make South-East Asia a zone of peace and stability is in the interests not only of the peoples of this region but also of world peace.45.	The aggressive policies of racist South Africa  which enjoys the extensive support of the United States and some other Western countries  pose a very grave threat to peace and international security. South Africa's subversion of and war actions against independent African States  particularly against Angola  in practice have not ceased. The Pretoria regime is flagrantly ignoring United Nations decisions on the granting of independence to Namibia. The inhuman system of apartheid is entrenched in South Africa.46.	The Ukrainian SSR is resolutely in favor of adopting mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to compel the South African regime to put an end to the heinous practice of apartheid  to halt its aggressive actions against neighbouring front-line States and to grant independence to Namibia.47.	One of the tasks facing the General Assembly at the thirty-seventh session is promoting the solution of international economic problems on an equitable and democratic basis. This is an important and urgent task because in that area we are witnessing many phenomena which are seriously impeding the realiza¬tion of the progressive principles embodied in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New Inter¬national Economic Order and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.  The imperialist forces which in the past sabotaged the elaboration and adoption of these fundamental instruments today bear the principal responsibility for the exacerbation of tension in all areas  including commerce and eco¬nomics. Their policy continues to be the main obstacle to progress in the normalization and democratization of international economic relations.48.	The Ukrainian SSR  together with other socialist countries  supports and will consistently support a policy of placing external economic links of States at the service of peaceful construction  mutual advan¬tage and the strengthening of relations of friendship and co-operation among peoples. We are also con¬vinced that the elimination of the threat of war  the strengthening of peace and the cessation of the arms race  being the tasks of primary importance that they are  serve as a reliable guarantee for progress in the field of social and economic development and in over¬coming the backwardness inherited from colonialism.49.	The debate at this session testifies to the growing awareness among Member States that today a parti¬cularly urgent task for the United Nations is to mobilize common efforts in those fields which would most effectively promote the strengthening of peace and be better in keeping with the interests of all peoples.50.	It is quite clear that the attempts by imperialist circles to involve the United Nations in psychological warfare against countries of the socialist community and a number of non-aligned States  to misuse to intervene in their internal affairs  run counter to these efforts. Those attempts and even appeals for a crusade against the USSR and the socialist countries are seriously hampering the development of international co-operation. We have more than once heard all sorts of threats and have been subjected to sanctions but the Soviet State has developed and will continue to develop successfully. The Soviet Union confidently approaches its sixtieth anniversary pursuing a peace¬ful foreign policy and seeking to achieve a higher material and spiritual state of well-being for its working people.51.	In December 1922  for the first time in the history of mankind  a State came into being where all rela¬tions were based on fraternity and mutual aid between people of different national and racial origins. The strength of the Soviet Union has been tested in the most severe trials  under conditions of foreign inter¬vention  political and economic blockade and atrocious Fascist invasions. The humanitarian nature of the principles which underlie the Union is constantly reaffirmed. The creation of the USSR strengthened our national statehood and showed that only in con-ditions of equality  freedom and mutual respect can people’s fully realize their spiritual and creative potential. The Ukrainian SSR therefore takes pride in the fact that it was among the first to call for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 60 years ago. Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  stressed during the celebration of the one thousand five hundredth anniversary of their city of Kiev: for The peoples of our country have teamed from their own experience that being together within one Union Sate multiplies their strength and speeds up social  economic and cultural development. And we shall tirelessly safeguard our sacred union and strengthen it in every way .52.	The multinational Soviet State which was born 60 years ago stands today as a powerful force in the struggle for the strengthening of friendship among all the peoples of the world and for lasting peace on earth.53.	The Ukrainian SSR  together with other Skates Members of the United Nations  is prepared to con¬tinue consistently  persistently and asolutely to multiply its efforts in the struggle for peace  social progress  co-operation and understanding among peoples."
"138",7186,"URY",37,1982,"Speaking for all members of the delegation of Uruguay  I wish to address to the President our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Similarly  I wish to convey to his predecessor  Mr. Kittani  our special appreciation for the efficiency with which he directed deliberations at the last session.257.	Uruguay is taking part in this session of the Assembly with the express desire of reaffirming once again as an absolute priority its historical commitment to peace. This commitment has been made manifest ever since our independence  in our support for dialogue as an instrument for settling disputes  and in our unremitting defense of international law.258.	In a world troubled by the most serious threats  where there is constant tension and confrontations are rife  even where peace and security have been firmly established  the international community must  without delay  demonstrate in a specific  practical and effective manner  that its attachment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations is not merely a formal promise or a passive expression of hope.259.	It is deplorable to note that in the interval since the last session of the Assembly new clashes  with their tragic toll of death and desolation  have taken place in many parts of the world. The sad reality of ongoing wars lends added urgency to the current negotiations and strongly underlines the unavoidable responsibility incumbent on each and every one of us  setting aside any dialectics.260.	Given the vicious circle of mistrust  tension and the arms race  civilized and fruitful coexistence can be obtained only to the extent that the various States exert their influence in their respective spheres in conformity with the international legal order and in strict observance of the obligations set down in the Charter.261.	It was this line of thinking that led Uruguay in a constructive spirit actively to participate in the work of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. When we take stock of the results achieved  it is frustrating to acknowledge the lack of substantial progress on a topic in which a great many hopes had been placed  namely the comprehensive program for disarmament. It is  however  important to mention that reaffirmation of the validity of the 1978 Final Document in resolution S-10/2  the commitment to abide by the priorities established in the disarmament negotiations  and the adoption of two resolutions on a World Disarmament Campaign and disarmament fellowships are concrete measures in the long and laborious process of building up universal understanding. My country welcomes them with satisfaction.262.	With regard to disarmament  Uruguay enthusiastically agrees that resources not spent on armament should be reallocated to developing countries. It also warmly supports as a form of progress the idea of using these resources for the development of nuclear-free zones which  although geographically limited  contribute to the cause and objectives of disarmament. It is to be hoped that this example  to which Latin America made an outstanding contribution with the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treat of Tlatelolco)  will be followed by other geographical areas  thus multiplying the number of zones to be gradually freed from the nuclear threat. However  the inalienable right of the developing countries to access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes should be strongly reaffirmed.263.	We should now like to offer some comments concerning the many conflicts now under way. Apart from constituting a threat to the basis of the harmonious coexistence of nations  these conflicts ignore the essential fact that we are all part and parcel of the same civilization  which is based on shared ideals. This deeply troubles the conscience of nations such as mine which regard any of their expectations as secondary to the cause of peace and place all their endeavors at its service.264.	During the conflict in the South Atlantic Uruguay noted with concern and anguish how the use of forceóa procedure irreversibly proscribed by the Charter of the United Nationsóemerged in the American community of nations. Those responsible chose to disregard the inexorable tide of history.265.	On various occasions and in various bodies my country has taken a position of solidarity with Argentina. This position is based on recognition of Argentina's right to claim sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. Today Uruguay confirms that recognition in keeping with the best diplomatic traditions of my country  having been one of the first to put forward in this very body the unquestionable right of Argentina to the archipelago under dispute.266.	Uruguay also reaffirms its strong desire to help in the search for a negotiated solution to the conflict. We are ready to participate in efforts to attain this purpose. To that end my Government would like to restate its willingness to offer the necessary facilities to the interested and concerned parties as well as to any possible mediators so that it may receive them in the traditional Uruguayan environment of peace and security.267.	We have no doubt of the need for a peaceful solution to the crisis obtaining in the South Atlantic  but we should like to express our firm desire that the solution not contravene the course of history or breed future confrontations.268.	Once again the situation in the Middle East is causing particular concern to my Government  which  faithful to the juridical and political principles that underlie our international conduct  is particularly alive to the anguish caused by the grave events that have come to pass in Lebanon269 We appreciate the values that Lebanon represents. It is a nation that loves peace and culture. The close links of friendship and respect between our countries prompt us to call for the strictest respect for its sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and political independence. In other words  we demand respect for its right freely to choose its own future without foreign intervention. This obviously implies the withdrawal from Lebanese territory of all occupying forces regardless of their origin.270.	In the judgment of my Government a strong and independent Lebanon constitutes an essential factor for peace throughout the region. The international community must exert every effort to co-operate with the people and Government of Lebanon in the attainment of these goals. It is likewise imperative that the parties to the conflict adopt an unswerving policy to that end.271.	Uruguay will firmly support any action designed to bring about peace in the Middle East. That is consistent with our position. It should be brought about through agreements negotiated among the parties involved without violence and with justice so as to guarantee all parties the possibility of living within safe and recognized boundaries in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.272.	In that spirit we are participating in the Sinai multinational peace-keeping force  and we are ready to co-operate in various actions to be undertaken in order to consolidate and broaden the process leading to a just and lasting peace in the region  regardless of extraneous interests and destabilizing factors.273.	Equally it bears repeating here that the objective of peace in the Middle East presupposes the existence and recognition of the State of Israel and its right and the right of other nations not to be attacked. Of course it is also necessary for the international community to understand the legitimate aspirations of the [people of Palestine to have a territory in which to settle and establish a free and sovereign State.274.	My country's foreign policy has been based on unswerving respect for fundamental principles such as non-interference in the domestic jurisdiction of States and the right of all peoples to self-determination. The application of these principlesówhich all have the same source  the preservation of the right to exercise sovereigntyóhas been constantly and seriously hampered by the actions of countries and pressure groups which  because of their support for internal forces  internationalize conflicts that clearly fall within the domestic jurisdiction of States. This has led to a situation in which the inalienable right of States to decide their own future without foreign pressure or undue influence is disregarded. This is dramatically evident in regions such as Central America  where  furthermore  violence and terrorism daily infringe the political  economic and social stability of countries  which is an essential element of the full development of the peoples of the region.275.	With regard to Afghanistan  the majority of the international community has expressed a strong desire for detente  an end to military clashes so as to avoid greater suffering and misery among the people  the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops  total respect for the rights of the civilian population and restoration of effective sovereign national authority. The persistence of the conflict creates a dangerous source of friction that must be resolved as soon as possible.276.	In the context of these particular issues  I must state that my Government attaches great importance to the achievement of a peaceful independent solution to the question of the unification of Korea through inter-Korean dialogue. That would help create conditions favorable for mutual understanding and for the general stability of the region.277.	It would be worth while to reactivate the good offices of the Secretary-General in this case for discus-sions between North and South Korea.278.	In all the international bodies in which it participates  Uruguay has always defended the principle of the self-determination of peoples. Therefore  we reaffirm once again the Namibian people's right to independence and its right to choose  in a climate of peace and free from undue pressures and external influences  its own political constitution  within the framework guaranteed by the United Nations provisional administration. Uruguay's stand on this issue is not anomalous; it is consistent with  and a part ot'  our unswerving commitment to peace and our emphatic rejection of any use of violence or terrorism.279.	Uruguay is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination We were the first State to accept the machinery set forth in that Convention for receiving individual complaints and communications. That position is not one dictated by circumstances; it has been energetically and unswervingly held by my country's representatives ever since the inception of the United Nations  ever since the Organization first gave impetus to the process of decolonization.280.	Although the great majority of the nations of the international community have ratified or acceded to that Convention  thus making it a universal instrument  discrimination on the basis of color  race  national or ethnic origin  or social class remains a tragic fact which shocks our conscience and is an affront to the spirit of progress of mankind.281.	The forced displacement of indigenous populations; the marginal existence of national or ethnic minorities; the existence of discriminatory laws; the persistence of practices based on notions of superiority or on racial hater: all these things convince us that the Programme for the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  which expires in December of next year  should be renewed and broadened.282.	Unfortunately the examples I have given are not the only manifestations of discrimination. It has also been manifested in the most painful forms of religious intolerance  which  in various parts of the world  continue to provoke a great deal of violence  persecution  and even genocide. In this connection  my country reaffirms its full support for the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief  which the Assembly adopted fast year in resolution 36/55. At the same time we urge the prompt resumption of consideration of a draft international convention on this matter. That instrument would serve as the basis  together with other necessary efforts  to combat theories  systems and institutions based on discriminatory principles which disregard the fundamental equality of the family of man.283.	Uruguay was also one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  which was adopted by the Assembly three years ago in resolution 34/180  and we welcome the fact that the Convention has come into force. We express the hope that it will help to ensure the participation of women  on an equal footing and at every level of society.284.	In that connection  we must mention a system that shocks the conscience of mankind and makes a doctrine of iniquity:	Uruguay is pleased to affirm with its usual conviction its radical opposition to that policy as well as to any other form of racism that openly and stubbornly contradicts the moral and philosophical premises that form the basis of our most deeply and dearly held cultural traditions.285.	The world crisis facing mankind is manifested not only in the destruction caused by those who ignore the single origin and nature of human-beings. It is also clear in the inability of the international community to put a stop to the ongoing violence which has become an integral part of the political practice of nations  nations with a long tradition of institutional stability and those recently emancipated from colonialism. That violence has resulted in constant acts of terrorism  with their tragic toll in murder  kidnapping and extortion; this seems to flourish in societies where democratic institutions prevail and where an attempt is made to preserve fundamental freedoms and individual rights. On the other hand  symptomatically  the phenomenon of terrorism does not appear in any country where totalitarianism exists with its systematic violation of human rights.286.	Acts of terrorism are grave offences against common law; they violate the most fundamental principles of persona! and collective security  whatever the political pretexts invoked for their commission.287.	Uruguay is a party to all the conventions adopted within the United Nations system and the Organization of American States with the aim of preventing and punishing acts of terrorism. It has also participated very actively in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism. Several of its proposals on the subject have been approved by that Committee.288.	Notwithstanding our recognition of the efforts that have been made  we must firmly state our dis-appointment at the fact that the international community has not adopted practical  specific and comprehensive measures to deal effectively with the grave and complex problem of terrorism. Although the maintenance of internal security is the responsibility of each individual State  co-operation among countries is essential to prevent and punish  in a co-ordinate way  crimes with international implications.289.	Although consideration of the underlying causes of acts of terrorism and violence deserve attention  it must not lead us to delay indefinitely the search for remedies to deal with what is an undeniable fact: that acts of terrorism are invariably repeated  deserving the repudiation of all civilized nations.290.	The efforts to prevent and punish crimes committed against diplomatic agents and other persons enjoying immunities established in international law are based on the adoption in New York  m 1973  of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons  including Diplomatic Agents. But we believe that a multilateral machinery must be established to deal with acts of terrorism affecting ordinary persons who do not enjoy the special protection of those immunities  but who are  none the less  entitled to international protection as human beings.291.	This year we have witnessed a historic event of great importance: the approval by the great majority of the international community of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - which establishes a new and comprehensive legal order applicable to the seas and based on the recognition of the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the littoral States in the waters adjacent to their coasts  in an exclusive economic zone  and on the continental shelf  with due regard for the jus communication and the rational exploitation of the resources of the sea.292.	It is also based on co-operation for the development of scientific research  the protection and pres-ervation of the marine environment  the administration by an international authority of that zone  of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction with the necessary powers for organizing and controlling those activities related to the exploration and exploitation of resources and the establishment of a production policy for that zone and a comprehensive system for the settlement of disputes.293.	However  we regret that some countries were not able to overcome their difficulties with respect to certain points and cast a favorable vote. Nevertheless  we trust and hope that they will be able to reconsider their position for the benefit of the common good. This would allow us to reach our objective  which would constitute an achievement of prime importance for the stability of international relations and the consolidation of world peace.294.	With regard to the environment  1982 has been a year rich in important events  to which our country contributed decisively and with conviction. The session of a special character that was convened by the Governing Council of UNEP last May in Nairobi commemorating the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  which was held in 1972 in Sweden  was followed by the tenth session of the Governing Council. A signal achievement of these two meetings was the renewal of the ""spirit of Stockholm""  the solemn ratification by more than 100 nations of their commitment to preserve the environment  thus ensuring a vital framework for humanity and the common heritage of future generations. The Nairobi and the Action Plan for the Human Environment? that were adopted represent a new policy approach. It is a more systematic and technical approach which includes a considerable strengthening of international action on the subject and the implementation of the resolutions adopted at the /M Meeting of Senior Government Officials Expert in Environmental Law  which my country was pleased to host in October and November 1981.295.	The Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space was held last August at Vienna. The objective of the Conference was to analyze at the world level those problems concerning the cosmos at a time when we are approaching a quarter century of the space age. Uruguay participated actively in the work of that Conference  firmly convinced that it was the appropriate time to take stock of the past and the present in order to make a realistic projection for the future with a view to genuine international co-operation on this question.296.	The enormous increase in the field of communications and the interdependence of peoples that provide our civilization with a real sense of unity has made it imperative for the field of communications to become an essential element in the economic and social development of all countries.297.	Faithful to this idea  we have adhered to the proclamation by the General Assembly of the World Communications Year and we are ready within our means to take part in the Plan of Action to be undertaken next year. To this end  we have already established a National Committee in our country in which all the relevant ministries and government services are represented.298.	Uruguay is a party to the international Covenants on Human rights  including the Optional Protocol to the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has always fought in every forum against the death penalty. Hence we were pleased to note the significant progress made in the drafting of a second optional protocol to abolish capital punishment  a vestige of history that denies the first right of manóthe right to life.299.	In the same spirit  Uruguay has taken part in the work of the Commission on Human Rights is preparing a convention against torture and other cruel  inhuman and degrading acts.300.	We have also reaffirmed our interest in any measure contributing to the strengthening and expanding of the machinery of the Organization to improve the effective enjoyment of individual rights and fundamental freedoms.301.	We also strongly support the planned international campaign against drug trafficking  within the context of the international Strategy for Drug Abuse Control. This campaign is designed to achieve the eradication of another human scourge.302.	There are other initiatives aimed at consolidating the objectives adopted by the Assembly when pro-claiming international years  such as the Year of the Child in 1979 and the Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. We support these initiatives. Given my Government's prime interest in these matters  we noted with satisfaction the considerable progress made in the drafting of a convention on the rights of the child  as well as that concerning the implementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons  designed to prevent incapacitating disabilities and to promote rehabilitation and the full integration of the handicapped into society.303.	None the less  it is our earnest hope that these aims will not become obscured by rhetoric  as has unfortunately happened frequently in the international community  which shows the international community's incapacity to go beyond the level of mere statements at a time when crucial and ongoing challenges facing mankind call for strong substantive action.304.	We know that there are good intentions; we know that there is no lack of theoretical concepts; but the shaping of a more just and equitable world economy  as well as the establishment of a legal order in a world fraught with individualism and violence  is still mere aspirations and nothing more.305.	A question affecting the whole of mankind on which we cannot remain silent is that of hunger and poverty which ruthlessly afflict more than 900 million people in the world.306.	Uruguay  a developing country  cannot accept with criminal indifference the suffering of others as well as the passivity of the machinery of a system that in practice violates the basic tenets of the Organization.307.	These situations  which deny the very minimum of human solidarity  demand the priority attention of the Assembly in order to restructure the links of interdependence and find solutions capable of alleviating the scourge of hunger and its cause  destitution. We must have the necessary political will to adopt appropriate measures allowing us to expect a certain measure of success in the struggle for better health and education in order to improve the lot of mankind and enhance the sanctity of life.308.	In the field of health  it is fitting to mention specifically the fact that Uruguay has begun a massive vigorous campaign to vaccinate all our population. This is the culmination of the constant work of prophylaxis that has been an ongoing concern of the health services of my country.309.	It is also worth noting that  in the Held of education  my Government is making every effort to implement an ambitious literacy program which will finally eliminate the already very low rate of illiteracy of no more than 5 per cent. The first stage of this campaign has successfully been completed recently this year.310.	It is paradoxical to note that at this time when we have witnessed the greatest achievements and progress and when science and technology borders on science fiction there still remain groups of people living in abject poverty. This is a harsh reminder of our unavoidable responsibility.311.	This question cannot be considered in isolation from the matter of trade  where we feel the effects of tariff barriers in our efforts to attain efficient food and agricultural production. That is especially true in those developing countries which have the good fortune of possessing great resources to contribute to the feeding of the world but which  because of actions {taken by industrialized nations  must face trade and marketing problems  to which I shall refer later.312.	Concerning the world economic situation  we must express our. deep concern at the gradual and continuing deterioration within an acute process that seems to accelerate day by day. The persistence of recessionary and inflationary processes  the increase in unemployment  the instability of exchange rates  imbalances in the balance of payments of the industrialized countries  the consequent irritating protectionist reactions and  finally  why not say it?óthe indifference and the lack of the political will on the part of the industrialized countries to face the demands imposed by the overwhelming world crisisóinexorably delay the economic progress of the developing countries  which are the majority of those gathered in the Assembly.313.	Within an economic framework such as that which exists today  which is marked by an intense and ever greater interdependence among the peoples of the world  it is imperative to find solutions based on a global economic approach  which makes it necessary to adopt a long-term global economic policy. This requires the optimum allocation of resources  which in turn signifies the redistribution and relocation of industries according to the competitive capacity of each country  the general  opening of economies in order to ensure an effective interplay of the laws of competition  and the adoption of a strategy capable of covering ail the developing areas without excluding key sectors.314.	Within the same line of reasoning and with reference to international trade  we must note the grave damage done to economic development in general and to food production and agricultural and industrial development in particular by the discriminatory practices and tariff barriers applied in many parts of the world  particularly by the developed countries.315.	We believe that the creation of an effective system of global security in the food sector must be accompanied by the parallel creation of an international financing system which will not be prejudicial to the food-producing developing countries. A new world food order is a prerequisite for any international economic order.316.	Within the structural readjustment that we are proposing  the problem of energy is also a priority that must be dealt with as a whole. A new world energy order must assure access by all non-oil- producing countries with a limited economic potential to sources of supply at reasonable and predictable prices. We must also consider the development and international financing of new and alternative sources of energy. This must be a pre-condition of the establishment of any new international economic order.317.	The developing countries are not resigned to this critical situation but insist upon a clear-cut position regarding the adoption of decisions by international bodies and greater participation in the acceptance of such instruments.318.	Within this context  we fully support the aims of and the steps taken to ensure the relaunching of global negotiations  on the understanding that what will be discussed concerning this subject is of interest to everyone in the international community. These negotiations must be carried out in conditions of absolute equality.319. It is difficult to understand how in the world of today we could reach agreements on energy and financing  international trade  protectionism and readjustment  raw materials and food  and industrialization and technology without the representation of all those interested and concerned. There must be an end to exclusion and selective participation and the question of the formal initiation of global negotiations must as soon as possible be brought to the Assembly.320.	It is worth noting that the developing countries have initiated a very significant attempt to establish a South-South dialogue through the implementation of a wide range of activities involving economic cooperation. Uruguay has participated and is participating with enthusiasm and good faith in this process  which offers clear hope of widening the basis of the economies of the developing countries and of bettering the standard of living if their peoples. That common effort is an appropriate and suitable response to the needs and requirements of our time  always bearing in mind the solidarity that must prevail among countries that are going through similar stages of development.321.	We firmly believe that development and security are intimately linked concepts and it could be said that there can be no integral development without the counterbalance of collective economic security through a multilateral juridical system that guarantees the full implementation of the rules and principles of co-operation for development. This is also applicable to the area of defense  in the case of economic measures or actions aimed at thwarting the sovereign will of States  the maintenance of the essential conditions of free and normal economic development and  in the last analysis  the effective practical application of international economic justice.322.	Uruguay has voted in favor of the program budget for the biennium 1982-1983. This is a budget in which the concept of zero growth is used for the first time  after many years of sustained increases. The comprehensive nature of the budget appropriations does not entail an increase in the financial burden.323.	The support of my country for this policy of austerity is based upon the unavoidable need to rationalize the hyperactivity of the United Nations and prevent the dispersal of effort. In this context  we should like the process of identifying and eliminating activities that are outdated  inefficient or of marginal usefulness to be intensified. This also applies to reduction of the very high percentage of costs absorbed by salaries and staff contributions. That percentage bears no reasonable relationship to the funds appropriated by the Organization for programmes of work of a substantial nature in the economic  social and humanitarian fields.324.	Finally  we should like to make reference to something of special importanceónamely  the strengthening of the role of the Organization and equitable representation of its members of the Security Council.325.	As I have already said  Uruguay fully understands and supports the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which are those that have always guided our foreign policy. Support for the objectives of international peace and security are  in the end  identified with the aims of the civilization to which we all belong. We reaffirm our faith in the present and permanent relevance of this civilization and we express our steadfast support for all measures aimed at overcoming the obstacles in the path of the development of harmonious relations and mutual respect based on justice among all the peoples of the world.326.	We place our greatest hope in the common effort of all those in the Organization and in the firm and unswerving application of the means and instruments available to the Organization. In this way we shall be able to make gradual but steady progress in maintaining and consolidating international peace and security  developing co-operation among nations  promoting the rules of international law and improving relations among States as well as on questions of the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes both regionally and internationally.327.	Only two months ago  our President Alvarez  analyzing the Latin American scene during a recent meeting of the Latin American Integration Association  said:""A world of super-Powers and mini-States  of groups of countries with enormous imbalances in their relative development  is their share in the fruits of progress and in their capacity to negotiate  calls for concerted action by those countries that are more excluded than weak  in order that it may become more just.""With its demographic influence  its common cultural tradition  its enormous and unexploited riches and its dedication to peace and law  Latin America has a!! the conditions necessary to constitute an influential area  not only in economic alignment but in the political and cultural spheres as well  within an international order where im-balances of power give rise to voluntary or involuntary situations of domination.""Setting aside questionable schemes used to group countries according to their level of development or relative power  I should like to see a Latin America that would be a totally new and independent force projected into the future as the continent of hope  of freedom and of justice  as the bridge and the link between the more developed and the most backward areas of the world.""328.	In this same line of thinking  I have no doubt that Uruguay will honor its commitment to America and to the world for the harmonious convergence of both currents  so that we can devote all our efforts to serving the aim of closer and more reciprocal constructive co-operation.329.	With regard to matters relating to the functions of the Security Council  the distressing events that occurred during this year make it more than ever necessary to amend the rule of unanimity that was established for the benefit of the permanent members of the Security Council  a rule that tends to perpetuate an obvious situation of privilege the exercise of which paralyses the Council's mission for peace.330. It is also necessary to say that with the passing of time and in the light of many painful and enlightening experiences it will become necessary to consider the possibility of giving thought to the most effective means of organizing the system of voting in the Security Council  above all in order to preserve intact its constitutional power to act for the preservation of peace  which is the very reason it was brought into being.33!. It is then fittingóand in this regard we fully agree with the proposal made by the Secretary- Generalóto hold a special meeting of the Security Council. This would be a frank  determined action that would enable us realistically to face those problems in the solution of which we are all ineluctably engaged.332.	In conclusion  my Government is prepared to support any effort designed to strengthen the Organization and to enable it fully to assume its responsibilities. Hence  we shall make a firm contribution to creating a climate favorable to dialogue and trust  to civilized and fruitful coexistence  starting along the road towards a community of nations without tutors or pupils  a community in which the legal equality of States will be expressed through a policy of full respect for the right of everyone freely to choose his own future without interference or aggression. This is the task we all face. It is an unavoidable and daily task that poses: a crucial challenge  one we must face and one we must overcome  guided by the same spirit of solidarity and brotherhood  as we continue along the path of peace and justice towards the new conditions the future holds in store for mankind."
"139",7233,"USA",37,1982,"I begin by paying a tribute to the new Secretary-General  who has brought great distinction to the office during his brief tenure. Dag Hammarskjold once told the General Assembly that whichever word one chooses independence  impartiality  objectivity—they all describe essential aspects of what  without exception  must be in the attitude of the Secretary-General . Javier Perez de CueBar  a man of the third world  and  I am proud to note  of the New World as well  has already demonstrated his strict adherence to this most exacting standard. In so doing  he has earned the esteem of my Government and the gratitude of all who believe in the purposes of the Charter.197.	I also congratulate Mr. Hollai of Hungary upon his election as President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.198.	As I stand here today I cannot help but reflect on my relation to this city and to this Hall. I was born about four miles from here. I was reared and educated not far away  just across the Hudson River  and I took a tour through this building just after it opened in 1952  marveling at the reality of a temple erected in the hope  at least  of abolishing war.  199.	When I took that tour back in the early 1950s  there was great public interest in what was called the Meditation Room. I understand the room is still here. But in the years since then this institution has become more famous for talk than for meditation. This Hall has heard great ideas eloquently expressed. It has also heard double-talk  platitudes and ringing protestations of innocence—all too often aimed at camouflaging outrageous and inhuman acts.200.	But we must not ridicule words. I believe that the greatest advance in human history was not the wheel  the use of electricity  or the internal combustion engine. Indispensable to progress as these have been  our most remarkable achievement was the slow  clumsy but triumphant creation of language. It was words that released our ancestors from the prison of the solitary. Words gave us the means to transmit to our children and the future the crowning jewel of human existence: knowledge. The Code of Ham¬murabi  the Bible  the Analects of Confucius  the teachings of the Buddha  the Koran  the insights of Shakespeare  the creed of Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King—all these were arrangements of words.201.	Is it not profoundly revealing that the first victims of tyrants are words? No people better know the meaning of freedom than those who have been arrested or beaten or imprisoned or exiled because of what they said. A single man speaking out—a Lech Walesa  for example—is more dangerous than an armored division.202.	All of us here  whether we arrived after a short one-hour flight  as I did  or came from the other side of the globe  as many others of those present did  enter this auditorium for one main purpose—to talk about what our Governments see as the problems ahead and how they should be solved. On one point at least we can all agree—the problems are many and difficult. I shall not try  in the minutes allotted me  to deal with each  or even most  of these issues in detail. Instead  I want to give the Assembly some sense of the principles and general approach that the United States will take toward our common problems.203.	Americans are  by history and by inclination  a practical and pragmatic people  yet a people with a vision. It is the vision—usually simple and sometimes naive—that has so often led us to dare and to achieve. President Reagan's approach to foreign policy is grounded squarely on standards drawn from the pragmatic American experience. As de Tocqueville pointed out   To achieve its objective  America relies on personal interest  and gives full reign to the strength and reason of the individual. That is as true now as when it was said 150 years ago. Our principal instru¬ment  now as then  is freedom. Our adversaries are the oppressors  the totalitarian  the tacticians of fear and pressure.204.	On this foundation  President Reagan's ideas and the structure of his foreign policy are so straight-forward that those of us enmeshed in day-to-day details may easily lose sight of them. The President never does  he consistently brings us back to funda¬mentals. Today I will talk about those fundamentals. They consist of four ideas that guide our actions: we will start from realism; we will act from strength  both in power and in purpose; we will stress the indispensable need to generate consent  build agree¬ments and negotiate on key issues  and we will conduct ourselves in the belief that progress is possible  even though the road to achievement is long and hard.205.	If we are to change the world  we must first understand it. We must face reality  with all its anguish and all its opportunities. Our era needs those who  asPericles said  have the clearest vision of what is before them  glory and danger alike  and notwithstanding that  go out to meet it.206.	Reality is not an illusion or a sleight of hand  though many would have us believe otherwise. The enormous  grinding machinery of Soviet propaganda daily seeks to distort reality  to bend truth for its own purposes. Our world is occupied by far too many Governments which seek to conceal truth from their own people. They wish to imprison reality by con¬trolling what can be read or spoken or heard. They would have us believe that black is white and up is down.207.	Much of present-day reality is unpleasant. To describe conditions as we see them as I do today and as President Reagan has over the course of his presidency  is not to seek confrontation—far from it. Our purpose is to avoid misunderstanding and to create the necessary pre-conditions for change.208.	So  when we see aggression  we will call it aggression. When we see subversion  we will call it subversion. When we see repression  we will call it repression.209.	The events in Poland  for example  cannot be ignored or explained away. The Polish people want to be their own master. Years of systematic tyranny could not repress this desire; and nor will martial law. But in Poland today truth must hide in comers.210.	Nor can we simply turn our heads and look the other way as Soviet divisions brutalize an entire population in Afghanistan. The resistance of the Afghan people is a valiant saga of our times. We demean that valour if we do not recognize its source.211.	And Soviet surrogates intervene in many coun¬tries  creating a new era of colonialism at the moment in history when peoples around the globe had lifted that burden from their backs.212.	Nor will we shy away from speaking of other problems affecting the free and the developing worlds. Much of the developing world is threatened by a crisis of confidence in financial institutions and the stultifying effects of State-controlled economies. The naturally vibrant economies of many Western nations and trade between the world's major trading partners are threatened by recession and rising protectionism. The great alliances that shore up world stability and growth—our hemispheric partnership  NATO—and the Western and Japanese industrial democracies are challenged by new as well as chronic strains.213.	Finally  the shadow of war still darkens the future of us all. There is no ultimate safety in a nuclear balance of terror constantly contested. There is no peace of mind at a time when increasing numbers of nations appear willing to launch their armies into battle for causes which seem local but have ramifica¬tions for regional and even global harmony.214.	The list of troubles is long  the danger of despair great. But there is another side to the present reality; it is a reality of hope. We are living in a fantastic time of opportunity.215.	Historians in the future will surely marvel at the achievements of human beings in the last half of this century. We have expanded the frontiers of thought—in science  in biology  in engineering  in painting and music and mathematics  in technology and architecture—far beyond the point anyone could have dared predict  much less hope for. We know much today about the oceans and forests and the geological strata that lock in the story of our past. We have more knowledge about a baby  or the brain  than was accumulated in 10 millennia before our time. We are learning to produce food for all of us; we are no longer helpless before the threat of disease; we explore our universe as a matter of course. We are confronting the nature of Nature herself. The oppor¬tunities are grand. This  too  is a clear reality.216.	Thus realism shows us a world deeply troubled  yet with reason for hope. There is one necessary condition: the only way we can enhance and amplify the human potential is by preserving  defending and extending those most precious of conditions—freedom and peace.217.	America's yearning for peace does not lead us to be hesitant in developing our strength or in using it when necessary. Indeed  clarity about the magnitude of the problems we face leads inevitably to a realistic appreciation of the importance of American strength. The strength of the free world imposes restraint  invites accommodation and reassures those who would share in the creative work that is the wonderful consequence of liberty.218.	Strength means military forces to ensure that no other nation can threaten us  our interests or our friends. But when I speak of strength I do not mean military power alone. To Americans  strength derives as well from a solid economic base and social vitality at home and with our partners. And  most funda¬mentally  the true wellspring of strength lies in America's moral commitment.219.	The bulwark of America's strength is military power for peace. The American people have never accepted weakness  or hesitancy or abdication. We will not put our destiny into the hands of the ruthless. Americans today are emphatically united on the neces¬sity of a strong defense. This year's defense budget will ensure that the United States will help its friends and allies defend themselves—to make sure that peace is seen clearly by all to be the only feasible course in world affairs.220.	Along with military readiness and capability must come the willingness to employ it in the cause of peace  justice and security. Today in Beirut the United States Marines—together with our allies  Italy and France—are helping the Lebanese Government und armed forces ensure the safety of the peoples of that tormented capital. I regret to report that I have just learned that one American Marine died and several were injured today in a mine explosion at the Beirut airport. Our marines represent an extension of American power not for war but to secure the peace. They are there to speed the moment when all foreign forces depart from Lebanon. There must be an early agreement on a timetable for the full application of Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Lebanon deserves the world's help—to secure peace and to rebuild a thriving society.221.	America will continue to use its strength with prudence  firmness and balance. We intend to command the respect of adversaries and to deserve the confidence of allies and partners.222.	The engine of America's strength is a sound economy.223.	In a time of recession  industrialized and less developed nations alike are bedeviled by excessive inflation  restricted markets  unused capacity  stagnating trade  growing pressure for protectionism and the most potent enemy of expansion—pervasive uncertainty.224.	The United States with its vast human and scientific resources can survive an era of economic strife and decay. But our moral commitment and our self-interest require us to use our technological and productive abilities to build lasting prosperity at home and to contribute to a sound economic situation abroad.225.	President Reagan has instituted a bold pro¬gram to get the American economy moving. Our rate of inflation is down markedly  and we will keep it down. That will add stability to the value of the dollar and give greater confidence to international financial markets.226.	The recent drop in United States interest rates will stimulate new investments within and beyond our shores. Conservation through market pricing of energy has reduced United States demand for world energy supplies. We are putting the recession behind us. A growing and open American economy will provide new markets for goods and services produced elsewhere  and new opportunities for foreign invest¬ments. Just as we have a stake in world-wide recovery  others will prosper as our recovery develops.227.	For wider prosperity to take hold  we must co¬operatively attend to these international issues. The lure of protectionist trade policies must be resisted everywhere—here in the United States and all over the world—whether in the form of overt import restrictions and export subsidies or by more subtle domestic pro¬grammes. These can only distort world trade and impair growth everywhere. Let us determine to make the November ministerial meeting of GATT a time to stem these protectionist pressures and to reinvigorate positive efforts for a more open trading system.228.	The implications of the external debt of many nations must be understood. Immediate debt problems are manageable if we use good sense and avoid destabilizing actions. But the magnitude of external debt will almost inevitably reduce resources available for future lending for development purposes. Economic adjustment is imperative. IMF can provide critical help and guidance in any country's efforts to smooth the adjustment process. The new borrowing arrange¬ment proposed by the United States can be crucial to this effort.	'229.	And the necessity of reducing government interference in the market must be recognized. Of course every nation has the right to organize society as its inhabitants wish  but economic facts cannot be ignored. Those facts clearly demonstrate that the world's command economies have failed abysmally to meet the needs of their peoples. The newly pros¬perous industrialized nations are those with the most free and open markets.230.	The bedrock of our strength is our moral and spiritual character. The sources of true strength lie deeper than economic or military power. They lie in the dedication of a free people which knows its responsibility. America's institutions are those of freedom accessible to every person and of govern¬ment as the accountable servant of the people. Equal opportunity  due process of law  open trial by jury  freedom of belief  speech and assembly  our Bill of Rights  our guarantees of liberty and limited govern¬ment were hammered out in centuries of ordeal. Because we care about these human values for ourselves so must we then be concerned  and legiti¬mately so  with abuses of freedom  justice and humanitarian principles beyond our borders. This is why we will speak and act for prisoners of con¬science  against terrorism and against the brutal silencing of the Soviet Helsinki Watch Committee. This is why we are anxious to participate in periodic reviews of the human rights performance of ourselves as well as of others. We welcome scrutiny of our own system. We are not perfect and we know it  but we have nothing to hide.231.	Our belief in liberty guides our policies here in' the United Nations as elsewhere. Therefore in this forum the United States will continue to insist upon fairness  balance and truth. We take the debate on human rights seriously. We insist upon honesty in the use of language; we will point out inconsistencies  double standards and lies. We will not compromise our commitment to truth.232.	The world has work to do for the realists  the pragmatists and the free. With a clear understanding of the troubled circumstances of the hour and with a strengthened ability to act  we need as well the vision to see beyond the immediate present.233.	All of us here represent nations which must understand and accept the imperative of fair engage¬ment on the issues before us and  beyond that  of common effort towards shared goals. Whether we are seeking to bring peace to regional conflict or a reso¬lution of commercial differences  the time of imposed solutions has passed. Conquest  pressure  acqui¬escence under duress was common in decades not long past—but not today. Not everybody who wants his concern addressed will find us automatically receptive. But when negotiations are in order America is prepared to go to work on the global agenda and to do so in a way that all may emerge better off and more secure than before.234.	We manage our problems more intelligently and with greater mutual understanding when we can bring ourselves to recognize these problems as expressions of mankind's basic dilemma. We are seldom confronted with simple issues of right and wrong  between good and evil. Only those who do not bear the direct burden of responsibility for decision and action can indulge themselves in the denial of that reality. The task of statesmanship is to mediate between two—or several— causes  each of which often has a legitimate claim.235.	It is on this foundation that the United States stands ready to try to solve the problems of our time —to overcome chaos  deprivation and the heightened dangers of an era in which ideas and cultures too often tend to clash and technologies threaten to out¬pace our institutions of control.236.	We are engaged in negotiations and efforts to find answers to issues affecting every part of the globe and every aspect of our lives upon it. Let me take up just two of these with you.237.	The agony of the Middle East now exceeds the ability of news bulletins or speeches to express: it is a searing wound on our consciousness. The region is in constant ferment. Unrest flares into violence  terror  insurrection and civil strife. War follows war. It is clear to everyone in this Hall that international peace  security and co-operative progress cannot be truly achieved until this terrible regional conflict is settled.238.	AM of us have witnessed in the past several months a graphic reminder of the need for practical peace negotiations in the Middle East. Of the nations in the world which need and deserve peace  Israel surely holds a pre-eminent place. Of the peoples of the world who need and deserve a place with which they can truly identify  the Palestinian claim is undeniable.239.	But Israel can have permanent peace only in a context in which the Palestinian people also realize their legitimate rights. Similarly  the Palestinian people will be able to achieve their legitimate rights only in a context which gives to Israel what it so clearly has a right to demand: to exist  and to exist in peace and security.240.	This most complex of international conflicts cannot be resolved by force: neither the might of armies nor the violence of terrorists can succeed in imposing the will of the strong upon the weak. Nor can it be settled simply by the rhetoric of even the most carefully worded document. It can be resolved only through the give and take of direct negotiations  leading to the establishment of practical arrangements on the ground. In other words  it can be resolved only through hard work. For those who believe that there is no contradiction between permanent peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people—and fbr those who believe that both are essential for peace and that neither can be achieved without the other—the task can truly be a labour of love.241.	On 1 September President Reagan challenged the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict to make a fresh start on the road to peace in the Middle East. The Camp David agreements  resting squarely on Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  with its formula of peace for territory  remain available to those who would accept the challenge to make this journey with us. The road will not be easy  but in his statement President Reagan made a number of proposals which  for those who are willing to join the effort  make the journey safer and easier.242.	I call on all concerned to accept President Reagan's challenge and hasten the realization of true peace in the Middle East 243.	In addition to the imperative need to resolve regional problems  there is an equally significant global imperative: to halt  and reverse  the global arms build¬up. As an American  I am aware that arms control and disarmament are a special responsibility of the world's most powerful nations  the United States and the Soviet Union. And as an American  I can report that we are fulfilling our responsibility to seek to limit and reduce conventional and nuclear arms to the lowest possible levels.244.	With this goal in mind  President Reagan has initiated a comprehensive program for negotiated arms reductions. In Central Europe  the most heavily armed region on this planet  the Western allies are seeking substantial reductions in troops of NATO and the Warsaw Pact to equal levels. To achieve this goal  we have recently introduced a new proposal designed to revitalize the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces  Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe.245.	In the area of strategic arms  the United States has also taken the initiative by calling for a one-third reduction in the number of nuclear warheads that American and Soviet ballistic missiles can deliver. And in the talks in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces  the United States has gone even further  by asking the Soviet Union to agree to a bold proposal for eliminating an entire category of weapons from the arsenals of the two sides.246.	But important as these negotiations are  the problems of arms controls cannot be left to the two super-Powers. The threat of nuclear proliferation extends to every region in the world and demands the attention and energy of every Government. This is not solely  or even primarily  a concern of the super¬ powers. The non-nuclear countries will not be safer if nuclear intimidation is added to already deadly regional conflicts. The developing nations will not be more prosperous if scarce resources and scientific talent are diverted to nuclear weapons and delivery systems.247.	Unfortunately  as the task becomes more im¬portant it also becomes more difficult. Greater quantities of dangerous materials are produced and new suppliers emerge who lack a clear commitment to non-proliferation. But the technology that helped to create the problems can supply answers as well. Vigorous action to strengthen the barriers to aggres¬sion and to resolve disputes peacefully can remove the insecurities that are the root of the problem. The United States  for its part  will work to tighten export controls; to promote broader acceptance of safeguards; to urge meaningful actions when agreements are violated; and to strengthen IAEA. As our action last week in Vienna should make clear  we will not accept attempts to politicize—and therefore emasculate— such vital institutions.248.	Perhaps the most common phrase spoken by the American people in our more than two centuries of national life has been you can't stop progress . Our people have always been imbued with the conviction that the future of a free people would be good. America continues to offer that vision to the world. With that vision  and with the freedom to act creatively  there is nothing that people of good will need fear.249.	I am not here to assert  however  that the way is easy  or quick  or that the future is bound to be bright. There is a poem by Carl Sandburg in which a traveler asks the Sphinx to speak and reveal the distilled wisdom of all the ages. The Sphinx does speak. Its words are: Don't expect too much . That is good counsel for ail of us here. It does not mean that great accomplishments are beyond our reach. We can help shape more constructive international rela¬tions and give our children a better chance at life. It does mean  however  that risk  pain  expense  and above all endurance are needed to bring these achieve¬ments into our grasp.250.	We must recognize the complex and vexing character of this world. We should not indulge our¬selves in fantasies of perfection of unfulfillable plans  or solutions gained by pressure. It is the responsibility of leaders not to feed the growing appetite for easy promises and grand assurances. The plain truth is this: we face the prospect of all too few decisive or dramatic breakthroughs; we face the necessity of dedicatingour energies and creativity to a protracted struggle towards eventual success.251.	That is the approach of my country  because we see not only the necessity but the possibility  of making important progress on a broad front. For example: despite deep-seated differences between us and the Soviet Union  both sides are now at work in a serious  businesslike effort at arms control; Presi¬dent Reagan has issued an important call for an inter¬national conference on military expenditure. The achievement of a common system for accounting and reporting is the prerequisite for subsequent agreement to limits or curtail defense budgets. The Caribbean Basin Initiative establishes the crucial bond between economic development and economic freedom. It can be a model for fair and productive co-operation between economies vastly different in size and character; and the diplomatic way is open to build stability and progress in southern Africa through inde¬pendence for Namibia under internationally accept-able terms.252.	Realism and a readiness to work long and hard for fair and freely agreed solutions—that is our recipe for optimism. That is the message and the offer which my Government brings to the Assembly today.253.	I began my remarks here today with an informal personal word. May I end in the same spirit? We must be determined and confident. We must be prepared for trouble  but always optimistic. In that way the vast bounties produced by the human mind and imagination can be shared by all the races and nations we represent here in this Hall.254.	A predecessor of mine as Secretary of State  whose portrait hangs in my office  conveyed the essence of America's approach to the world's dangers and dilemmas. He said we would act with  a stout heart and a clear conscience and never despair . That is what John Quincy Adams said nearly a century and a half ago. I give the Assembly my personal pledge today that we will continue in that spirit  with that determination  and with that confidence in the future."
"140",7305,"VCT",37,1982,"It is with a deep sense of pleasure that I venture to associate myself with the many well-merited complimentary statements  as my sources have indicated  made to Mr. Hollai on his election to this most important office of President of the General Assembly. I am sure that  as his predecessor and others before did  he will conduct the affairs of that office so as to enhance its authority and add greater lustre  meaning and dimension to the office itself and the Organization which its serves. I should like also to extend to the Secretary-General my warmest congratulations on his appointment as administrative head of this world body. He has assumed the reins of office during a year of varied far-reaching problems in different parts of the world. I wish to assure him that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will give full support to his endeavours to bring this troubled world by patient diplomacy to confront  face and resolve its problems  and so wish him a pleasant and rewarding term in office during which he will draw increasingly the respect of all inside and outside the Organization.The election of Mr. Hollai at this thirty-seventh session comes at a time of unprecedented conflicts and tension in the world. It was the ambitious hope of the founders of this United Nations that such problems as obtain today should not be the lot of the world. That these conflicts and tension exist and have persisted over the years is a serious continuing reflection on national attitudes: ambition  aggressiveness  duplicity  pride and honour.Thirty-seven years after the founding of the Organization  the only real change has come from expanded membership. Many former subject peoples are now free and independent  though not all are equal. National attitudes are following  in most cases  the same consistent pattern. We refuse to learn from the experiences of the past. Consequently  people are dying  combatants as well as non-combatants in Lebanon  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  Namibia and elsewhere  all in the name of furthering national ambition and objectives.For yet another year I urge again that the time has come for all Member States to condemn  and to continue to do so in the strongest possible terms  acts which clearly violate the Charter  resolutions and principles of this important world body. It must be realized that the Charter is not an instrument to be accepted when it is a convenient adjunct to national policy and abrogated when it is not. The Charter must be accepted as establishing an international code of conduct between nations. A code it is. By membership of the Organization we have all agreed to conform to its spirit and intent. It recognizes that disputes are often unavoidable given the present emotional level of the development of man. He may perhaps evolve into a different creature in another half million years  but for now he is Homo Homini Lupus. It was recognized that for our generation a mechanism was necessary  hence a machinery for the resolution of disputes was established. If the Charter is to be respected and if the authority of this body is not to be eroded  it must be respected  the machinery for resolving disputes must be rigidly adhered to  however painfully slow and frustrating may be the negotiations. Parties once at a negotiating table must show a willingness and desire to reach a consensus. This is the sane way  the humane way  the wisest and most resource-conserving way. Is it so difficult for leaders to accept this?I know there are those who would frown and say that this is Utopian and an unrealistic diatribe  for to accept this is to contemplate the remodelling of the innate conflicting attitudes of man. Yet  whatever may be said  it is always better for both sides to avoid confrontation and to settle a dispute at the conference table than on the battlefield. Even for the apparent victor  there are often more hydra heads springing from unexpected quarters than the one which the attempt was made to cut off by force of arms  by military surgery.Since 1947 there have been continuous problems between Israel  the Palestinian people and the Arab nations. For 35 years this problem has preoccupied the attention of the Assembly and of the Security Council and has not been resolved because of the two genuine but conflicting claims by the protagonists of both camps. Israel demands the right to exist within secure borders. The authentic voice of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization  demands a free and autonomous State in an area that is not exclusive of Israel.Recent events in Lebanon have compelled my country to look at this issue in greater depth and to speak out about the wanton destruction and carnage that have taken place  particularly in west Beirut. The death and destruction wrought before the massacre were inexcusable and indefensible by any norm of international law; but that a massacre that should have been foreseen or guarded against should have been committed while aid and assistance were given by Israel to the Christian militia deserves strong censure from the Assembly. A dark deed has drawn sharp and bitter protest and is viewed  justifiably so  with horror by civilized and rational people everywhere. That that act should have been committed on the soil of one Member State by another and that the army of the country ravaged is not at war or even in a state of preparedness for war makes it all the more reprehensible.Whatever allegations Israel may make to justify its conduct and action  the scale of the Israeli response was totally unwarranted and unjustifiable and cannot with good conscience be supported even by their most ardent admirers. The Old Testament advocated an eye for an eye; but Israel has taken 100 eyes for one eye. It is a most callous  inhuman display of brute military might which  while it may have achieved its political and military objectives  has released other possible adverse international forces which may be contained only if Israel withdraws its troops immediately and without pre-conditions from Lebanon and thereafter shows a willingness to accept that if it is to live within secure boundaries  as Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 stipulates  there must be an accepted corollary that it is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to have a homeland. The recent massacre now brings this need into sharper focus.Countries have to be careful that they do not  even by winning a war  lose the respect and goodwill of the international community as Israel has now done so successfully. No country  however large can allow itself to become an international outcast; still less one that is small  even though it is in possession of a powerful military machine. We all need the goodwill  friendship and support of each other. Total isolation must be the worst tragedy with which any country can be beset. Israel must in its own interest cease actions which suggest that it has a total disregard for international opinion.If we  inside and outside the Assembly  accept facts  however unpalatable they may be  apparent problems may become soluble and inexcusable and unpardonable Christian barbarities such as occurred in west Beirut may not recur. The fact is that Israel exists in the hearts of all Israelis and as a State. The fact is that the PLO exists in the hearts of all Palestinian people  wherever they reside. It is therefore ridiculous for either side to refuse to accept the existence of the other.For either side to continue to take firm and unyielding positions on this issue could lead to other even more tragic events which  while they must redound to the shame of the perpetrators and be to the utter disgust and anger of civilized people must not occasion guilt among us for any failure on our part to put an end to this impasse.There are now three options to be examined in the search for a peaceful solution to this Middle East crisis: first  the much-criticized and by some rejected Camp David accords; secondly  President Reagan's initiative; and  thirdly  the plan adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez.The opposing leaders should now come together and  with assistance  so orchestrate their actions that an effective and lasting peace can come to the area. Those who can encourage this process must do so  so that peace can come to a troubled and tortured land  Lebanon; so that peace can come to a strife-prone and strife- torn region  the Middle East; so that peace can exist between the Israelis and the Arabs  based on a just settlement of the Palestinian problem: a homeland.Lebanon should now be given the opportunity to become a unified country and to live and trade in peace. Its new President and Government must be given the support of the international community to make this possible. It is for the President and his Government to decide when all non-Lebanese troops should leave their country. When it is clear that the Lebanese army  with international financial support  is firmly in control  they should  on request  all immediately depart.The international community must not appear to be indifferent to the fate of Afghanistan  a relatively small country of 15.5 million people. Foreign troops are in that country. The presence of those troops is being contested by the inhabitants of that country—the Afghans. Whatever may be the stated reason for the presence of those foreign troops—whether in support and at the request of the present Government or otherwise—it is evident that a significant segment of the population  indeed a majority  is opposed to the Government and to the presence of those foreign troops. The fact is not contestable  since poorly equipped Afghans at great expense  in terms of loss of life and property  and at great suffering—both to combatants and to non-combatants—continue to wage resistance to an occupation of their country which they consider to be undesirable.Neighbouring States have over 3 million—or about one fifth—of the Afghans as refugees  placing great strain on the resources of those countries. Pakistan alone has over 2.7 million. Providing for these refugees is utilizing a substantial portion of the resources of international relief organizations. AH this must make one wonder what purpose is served by a continuing stalemate with blood  death and suffering as the end-product. The image of the occupying Power internationally is being affected  and the validity and wisdom of its political and military objectives must be questioned. Without asking for a response  I am sure that Afghanistan is an embarrassment to that occupying Power. It has touched a lever which it now wishes  quite likely  it had never touched  yet still somehow refuses to release.I appeal to the occupying Power to show that great courage which I know it possesses  and of which it is capable  and set a small country free to determine its own future as it wishes. Let it hold discussions with the Afghan nationalist fighters with a view to ending the conflict; let it agree to the holding of elections under United Nations supervision and secure observer status for such a team; let it negotiate  if possible  a neutral Afghanistan  but this should not be a pre-condition for the holding of free and fair elections. I appeal further to the occupying Power to start the process now and show the greatness and compassion of which it is capable. We of the Assembly must all work unceasingly to bring to an end the cycle of suffering  death and destruction occurring in that once quiet and peaceful country  now turned into a divided  suffering and unhappy land.The Kampuchean question is another very sad continuing episode. It is wrong for any outside Power to impose itself by force of arms on another country or by direct intervention decide who should administer a country. It is all the more heinous when to achieve that result it occasions untold human suffering. Those foreign troops now in occupation of Kampuchea should be removed. Our national concern is that we cannot be indifferent to human suffering  regardless of when or where it may occur but especially when it occurs under the domination of a foreign Power determined to demonstratethat might is right. Let the people decide whether they wish the new Coalition or the present Phnom Penh Government.The foreign troops occupying Kampuchea have caused  in addition to the loss of lives and property  severe refugee problems in neighbouring countries. Will this unremitting foreign intervention never cease? It should and must. The Kampucheans should be left in peace to determine their future by dialogue and through a freely supervised electoral process.The Iraqi-Iran war  although not one in which foreign troops are the interventionists or the protectors of their perceived but often misjudged interests  is nevertheless a terrible war  being fought with the most sophisticated types of conventional weapons in an important and sensitive part of the world. It is not for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  at this stage  to attempt to apportion blame before being fully apprised of all the facts; it is enough to recognize that this senseless slaughter of the flower and youth of both countries is a reckless squandering of an important national resource. The armies of the contending forces should agree to withdraw  at all points  within their respective borders and begin negotiations with a view to concluding a peace treaty. If there are any Member States which can in some measure exercise influence on one side or the other  or both  they should do so before this dread malignancy takes on incurable proportions—before it spreads even further  with dire consequences for peace in that region and for world peace. One cannot permit reason to be blind or deaf in a dispute. It is like searching for a tiger while blind and deaf  only to be destroyed by it.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines urges the representatives of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran to give support to the resolution of the Security Council and the sentiments of the General Assembly and  within the limits permitted  persuade their Governments to take such differences as exist to the conference table and endeavour to resolve them within the terms of the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions of the Security Council and the Assembly.Yet another year approaches without the inhabitants of Namibia having the right to determine their future as a free and independent people. For yet another year a regime in South Africa which refuses to recognize racial equality and which has institutionalized the dehumanizing system of apartheid against the black majority within its borders persists by every ruse and various stratagems to frustrate the aspirations of a people that wishes to be no longer a ward but a proud people in a free and equal country.The question of independence for Namibia should not be linked to any pre-condition  particularly when it is an issue not related to Namibia itself  but of a third State. Understandable  from a South African point of view  as that concern may be  no one should allow a direct and separate issue to be beclouded by what is  in our view  an extraneous consideration. The question for the General Assembly is no longer independence itself but where do we go from here to bring about independence for Namibia. The question of what progress is being made by the contact group on the implementation of the United Nations plan is speculative but this is still probably an area where results could be achieved. Let us intensify our actions to ensure that this issue is resolved before the Assembly meets for its thirty-eighth session.As a Member State  we shall continue to state that the greatest challenge to the effectiveness of the Assembly lies in the deliberate erosion of its authority by its members. Perhaps Saint Vincent and the Grenadines may have unwittingly been an offender already. Nevertheless  we should not ignore the Charter or resolutions of the United Nations without at the same time appreciating the adverse effect this must have on its total responsiveness. For small States such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  it should be obvious that it is necessary to ensure at all times that the United Nations is strong and responsive to problems  with the ability  through the collective will of the Assembly  to enforce its authority with regard to regional and world peace for the good of all mankind  since it is the best guarantor of the protection and independence of such States.Too often nations avoid the peaceful path and resort to arms  with unforeseen results. In a world replete with border disputes  civil terrorism and guerrilla unrest  and territorial claims  especially in this hemisphere  prudence and caution should make the negotiating table attractive. The path to a negotiated settlement or the resolution of disputes by discussion can at times be slow; yet this in itself should in no way frustrate the process. The results of quiet  painstaking diplomacy  even if the disputes are ultimately resolved through the process of arbitration  have always so far been more beneficial than the results of war.I spoke at length at the 23rd meeting of the twelfth special session on disarmament  and I do not propose to add anything further to what I said then except to welcome the start of discussions between the super-Powers on nuclear disarmament in the hope that it will be treated in as serious and urgent a manner as the gravity of the situation warrants. However  I would like to read out one portion of that statement: ""Given the suspicion and distrust that exist between countries  it can be appreciated that there are tremendous obstacles to be overcome in bringing about real and lasting disarmament. ""Countries that have been suspicious of each other for years  and still are  will not suddenly believe each other's words. Therefore  in order to eliminate this element of fear and doubt  which is the result of suspicion and mistrust  inspection and verification must be accepted as an inescapable provision of any such treaty. Any genuine desire to achieve disarmament must realistically accept that States have to move in the direction of an open-door policy rather than a closed-door policy. The prerequisite for reaching agreement on disarmament seems to be the ability of the parties to convince each other that no advantage is sought over the other and that there is nothing to hide by thereby guaranteeing the right of access to each other's territory for inspection. What should then be decided will be who would do the inspection and how such inspection should be carried out—whether by a team selected and controlled by this world body and answerable only to this world body or otherwise. This would actually mean that there would have to be a re-examination of the national concept of sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction. There can be no diminution or compromise of authority in giving to another an entitlement that would be reciprocal. This is the whole concept of ambassadorial and consular representation which specifically limits national jurisdiction on national soil and which encroaches upon national sovereignty in certain cases. This is now an internationally accepted principle set forth in a Convention. There are very rare occasions when this Convention is violated and  when it is  it is as a result of traumatic shocks within a national society. Similarly  what has been achieved in the area of diplomatic reciprocity should prove to be no more difficult in verifiable inspection to achieve disarmament. Willingness to agree to inspection is an indication of acceptance of how crucial inspection must be in reaching agreement on disarmament.""It must not be thought that it is only the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that are concerned  for all mankind is concerned. We  the others  the silent spectators  are all deeply concerned. There should and must be an end to nuclear proliferation  through a balanced reduction of the existing terror. Ultimately there should be an end to the international arms race in general  for which a few countries are responsible. It is they that possess the real capacity to fuel the arms race; and once they show the will it can and will cease.One of the continuing  lingering problems with which the Assembly is confronted is the creation of conditions conducive to the reunification of countries divided because of political and ideological differences or differences of language or religion. It must be a source of great hardship when the fabric of life in the parts of a divided country is torn. When there is little or no contact and when it is difficult for friends or families to be reunited  there is the temptation to want to resolve the problem by other than peaceful means. Consequently  in divided countries  when restraint has been shown it deserves praise  and the Governments must be further encouraged to seek the negotiating table as the best and most practical way to a solution. They should renounce the resolution of any dispute by means other than those the Charter envisages  even though they may not be Members.Not all these divided countries seek or can seek admission to the United Nations  but those that can and do seek admission should be admitted  either together or individually  without the possibility for any of the five permanent members of the Security Council exercising a veto against such admission. Such admission  in the view of my country  would assist in the promotion of peace and might well contribute to the realization of the national aspiration for the reunification of the divided countries. Although past experience has in no way suggested that there is reason for optimism  it has shown that admission has lowered the threshold of tension between divided countries  increased contacts in different areas and permitted a greater degree of dialogue.There is a place for both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Assembly. It is time the wounds of division were healed. The process of healing can begin here. Friends of both the South and the North should make this process possible.We in the Assembly must address once again the very grave danger to world security posed by international terrorism  which now appears to make a target of a diplomat for no reason other than that in the discharge of the functions of his office he speaks for his country and thereby personifies his country. We must bring our minds to bear on this problem so that those who perform duties similar to our own work can do so in greater safety. No self-respecting nation can permit itself to be blackmailed by the dark deeds of the terrorist. No self-respecting nation can submit to the will of terror. In such a situation selective terror could be applied against a country extraterritorially to achieve the objective  and unless and until all the countries of the world community take firm and serious collective responsibility for discouraging the commission of such acts on their soil by inflicting for such offences the severest penalties permitted under their legislation  when the perpetrators of the offences are apprehended  the trend is not likely to be contained.While man continues to demonstrate his inhumanity on the field of conflict and by oppression in other forms  there still remains a vast gap between the rich and the poor countries of the North and the South. Prodigious sums are budgeted and spent on the production  stockpiling and deployment of weapons of mass destruction  both nuclear and conventional. While the budgeted cost of defence increases  in most cases substantially  only a few nations have yet been able to achieve the United Nations target figure of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product  in aid to developing countries  to be attained by 1985.The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  certainly recognized the urgent need for aid flows to the developing world. Such payments include contributions made via multilateral institutions. Countries of the Development Assistance Committee are among those that have made the highest contribution of resources on liberal terms to developing countries as a whole as a percentage of their gross national product. In fact  four countries in the Committee exceeded the targeted amountin 1979 and 1980. According to 1980 figures  and based on information from the UNCTAD secretariat  the Kingdom of the Netherlands contribute gross national product with 0.99 per cent  and the lowest contribution from the countries in the Committee was 0.17 per cent. On average  the Development Assistance Committee countries gave just 0.57 per cent of gross national product in 1980—that is  just over half of the targeted amount. Only members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries exceeded 1 per cent  with an average of 1.51 per cent in 1979 and 1.45 per cent in 1980.While this terrible world recession has with high  though now falling  interest rates caused rising unemployment everywhere from the industrialized North to the impoverished South  with only a few exceptions  and has contributed to budgetary strains  balance-of- payment problems and liquidity squeezes within the economies of the developed and the developing countries  and may well tend to cause the development of an inward-looking attitude  nevertheless  even though it is natural for all Governments to be preoccupied with national concerns  introspection should not blind Governments to the realities of the world around them. Although the reality may be that some countries are facing severe financial and other problems  those small island States with highly vulnerable economies often based solely on primary products are in a still more perilous state and in need of greater official development assistance than ever before.In his address to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers at a meeting held at Marlborough House  in London  on 30 August last  the Commonwealth Secretary-General had this to say: ""... the tightening of lending because of the danger of default can precipitate the very danger it seeks to avert and quicken economic collapse. Joint action by private banks alone cannot provide an adequate  reliable basis for handling problems of today's dimensions. The liquidity squeeze is superimposed on a contraction of resource flows to developing countries. Aid flows from the Development Aid Committee and OPEC as a proportion of gross national product are declining  and the growth in World Bank lending  including from the International Development Association  is already projected at much lower levels than in the past."" This prognosis is gloomy for the developing countries. However  because the economies of the world are interdependent  it is also gloomy for the rich industrialized world. Of sheer necessity the weak must and will  through trade  directly promote the economic well-being of the rich. The rich should therefore continue to be generous in their aid to the poor  for a better world  such help is a necessary priority. As we all now stand watching a world writhing in financial and economic agony  we should not allow our national concerns to override all other interests and so shelve the need to renew the North-South dialogue in an effort to deepen our understanding of the institutional mechanism required to promote the introduction of a new economic order.There can be no doubt that there is a need for the restructuring of the world's economies. Neither the old nor the new economic theories seem capable of energizing the developed or developing economies upon which the economies of the poor and the underdeveloped countries are so dependent  whether for the sale of their primary products or in the area of tourism. There are too many external factors that seem to interplay and impinge upon national planning over which national planners have no control. It is the unpredictability of the multinational interplay of forces and factors with which small underdeveloped countries must contend and over which they have far less control than the developing or the developed countries.When the higher-priced production of beet sugar is subsidized within the European Economic Community  causing large surpluses in production and competition  the world demand for cane sugar falls  creating huge surpluses in developing countries  thereby sending prices down drastically  with the result that economies dependent on that crop are utterly destroyed  causing serious balance-of-payments problems. These are some of the difficulties which are beyond the control of national planners. There is therefore a need for the Economic and Social Council to look critically at this problem to persuade States which have been subsidizing the overproduction of beet to recognize the harm they are doing and to correct this injury.There are some programmes which in my country's view are having an impact. One such is UNDP. Since just before our independence  it has been having quite a significant impact on our developmental efforts in the area of statistics and economic advisory services. Since it appears that programmes of the Organization are in all probability going to be affected by the inadequate contributions of Members  it is our hope that this useful Programme will continue to receive the support of the international community. For our part  we are prepared to try to make our own modest contribution to this worthwhile Programme. As we demonstrate our faith in it  my country expects donors to keep faith with us and support it—not less generously  but rather more generously  than previously.In my country's policy statement on admission  at the thirty-fifth session  I said that our position on issues would be made quite clear. Our intention would always be to assist this world body in achieving and maintaining world peace as well as economic and social justice. We meant it then  and we still mean it. I wish to conclude as I did then: ""The Assembly can be a most effective instrument; but it cannot be and will not be greater than all of us collectively have the will to make it. Each of us representatives possesses the perception by conscience to know right from wrong. Nevertheless  we are all subject to the policies of our Governments and must represent them or resign. But can we not in the light of our thinking strive to influence those decisions  if-by so doing we would enhance respect for the integrity and credibility of this world Organization? To fail in this endeavour is not the problem; only to fail to try.""""General Assembly"" is a mere name. We are all gathered here in the General Assembly. ""United Nations"" are only words. Our countries constitute the United Nations. They can serve us as the Charter intended  if only we let them."
"141",7350,"VEN",37,1982,"First of all  Sir  I should like on behalf of the delegation of Venezuela and on my own behalf to congratulate you on your well- deserved election as President for this session of the General Assembly.In addition I should like to express our apprecia¬tion to Mr. Ismat Kittani for the effective manner in which he carried out his duties.I should also like to congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on his election as the fifth Secretary- General. His credentials  his personal qualities and his search for solutions to complex problems all indicate that his course of action as head of the Secre¬tariat will be a wise one. We wish him every success in his major aspiration to reactivate the political role which it is within the competence of the Secretary- General to fulfil.At the same time it is our duty to transmit to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our appreciation for the com¬mendable work he did during the 10 years he held the post in promoting the United Nations as an absolutely essential institution which we need to maintain  develop and strengthen.The report of the Secretary-General oh the work of the Organization raises questions of great importance and dramatic urgency for Member Staffs. Venezuela wishes to praise the frankness and direct style reflected in the report and at the same time to confirm our absolute adherence 6o the Charter and our hope that the political will of nations will be expressed without reticence in favour of collective action for peace and security  as stated in that document.If  as the Secretary-General states in the report  we are ""perilously near to a new international anarchy""  that is largely due to the constitutional role of the international organizations  which has led and leads to conflicts between national aims and the goals of the Organization  as is pointed out in the report.Resort to confrontation  violence and war in the pursuit of national interests has not infrequently been encouraged by the historical practices of powerful States and the growing scepticism regarding the results of measures taken by multilateral organizations whose actions towards peace are halted by the very States which enjoy privileges within the United Nations.We believe that the tragic conflict In the South Atlantic would not have led to such bloodshed if there had been multilateral action towards peace and timely attention to the just claims of peoples which had suffered from the unpunished aggression of the empires that were all-powerful in an international order which no longer exists today.The States with the greatest relative power in a world living in conditions of a balance of fear and the constant risk of a nuclear war can hardly expect to consolidate their privileges by considering overall relations among peoples in terms of their own specific interests. These privileges in many cases were acquired at the expense of the dignity and the resources of the weaker people. As long as justice and respect for the nations which represent two thirds of all mankind are not reflected in resolute action by United Nations organs constant disappointment will merely foster a phase of absolute cynicism in international relations .The consequences of colonialism and neo-colonialism have been devastating for peace. Venezuela maintains that the continent of Latin America should be a reserve of peace. We share the feeling of all the fraternal people of our hemisphere that the elimination of the colonial strongholds which still exist in our hemisphere brooks no delay. There is no valid argument for any European nation to retain territories  authority or troops in America.In order ""to reinforce the protective and pre-emptive ring of collective security""  as the Secretary- General urges in his report  we  the Member States without hegemonistic ambitions  would like the United Nations machinery to be respected and imposed upon ail States equally  for disappointment regarding he effectiveness of the Organization and the lack of hope of any future improvement are caused by the belief that the powerful accept mechanisms and deci¬sions only when it suits them  and that when it does not they create obstacles to them or ignore them.Serious consideration of practical ways for the United Nations to develop its capabilities and to be used as a positive institution in the promotion of the free and peaceful progress of mankind in our time forms part of the Secretary-General's plan of action. Venezuela considers that his report contains coura¬geous ideas and is prepared to respond constructively within the possibilities open to it.My country wishes to point out that the ability to use properly the means available today to the Organization to tackle the grave problems which mankind faces depends decisively on the States which have the privilege of being permanent members of the Security Council.We are convinced that the Assembly will adopt sensible and just resolutions on the Malvinas  the Middle East  apart/ten/ and Namibia  ratifying and strengthening previous resolutions on those delicate subjects  to mention only some of the more striking matters referred to in the Secretary-General's report.If hope and confidence in the United Nations are to be restored  ways must be found to make those resolutions effective  with the full support of the international community  ways which will make it possible to overcome the obstacles which selfishness and injustice are undoubtedly raising in order to prejudice the harmonious coexistence of peoples.The statement made by the President of Venezuela  Mr. Herrera Campins  at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly had as its motto ""Faith in the United Nations and hope for peace. At that time he affirmed that ""This is an Organization of peace-loving countries'. In that spirit it was created  and in that spirit it should continue. That is the spirit that imbues Venezuela's foreign policy in all situa¬tions.""Venezuela is attending this most important yearly exercise of the United Nations at a time when the Organization's reputation and effectiveness have been shattered. International crises succeed one another and continue. One of the problems which causes most concern is the situation in the Middle East  which has been exacerbated by recent events in Lebanon. We are following closely the tragic events there  realizing that we live in a world in which important and far- reaching events cannot be viewed as isolated facts. Violence in all its forms is rampant in the region. What has happened in Lebanon has shown the extreme cruelty to which some will resortMass crimes have become a new practice in the face of which the international community has found itself unable to act. Today the world is the victim of an evil game which threatens to bring it to catastrophe and chaos  in the absence of effective machinery to enable all States to live together harmoniously.Venezuela considers that at this session  more than any other  because no other session has been held in the shadow of such painful and complex circum¬stances  the General Assembly must make an effective contribution and find a valid solution which will put an end to war and map out as soon as possible the road leading to peace. The escalation of acts of retaliation seems to be uncontrollable  encouraging and increasing the use of violence.As Mr. Herrera Campins said in his speech at the thirty-sixth session with regard to the Middle East  ""peace cannot be achieved nor kept until there is a global solution to the conflict accepted by all the parties involved and until the legitimate rights of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples to live in peace and freedom are recognized"" [%?/<?.  para. PR].In its international conduct  Venezuela has consistently followed a policy of decolonization. This attitude is demonstrated by its constant support for the innumerable resolutions that have been submitted on the subject. Puerto Rico has been a special concern of Venezuelans ever since the beginning of the struggle for the emancipation of Latin America led by our Liberator Simon Bolivar. Venezuelans share  with a deep-rooted feeling  his ideal that Puerto Rico should be a member of the Latin American family. We recog¬nize the existence of democratic freedoms in that sister island  and we expect that its sovereign future will be an expression of its people's legitimate right to self-determination.The Government of Venezuela recently took a step of great significance in the Held of decolonization when it recognized the Democratic Arab Sahraoui Republic as a sovereign and independent State  one closely linked to Hispanic culture.Venezuela has formally applied for full member¬ship in the movement of non-aligned countries. Venezuela shares the fundamental principles and objectives which brought that movement into being and recognizes it as a forum in which the majority of the countries of the world are represented  thus constituting a force to promote peaceful coexistence  economic and social development and the political independence of its member States.The twelfth special session of the General As¬sembly  which was held at United Nations Head¬quarters this year  ended in virtual failure because of the Assembly's inability to adopt the comprehensive programme for disarmament. The results of the special session should serve as a lesson for States  particularly nuclear-weapon States  which bear the greatest responsibility in this field  and they must redouble their efforts in the cause of disarmament and see to it that those efforts are reflected in concrete action in the Committee concerned.Venezuela is persevering in its policy of co¬operation with the countries of Central America and the Caribbean. Accordingly  the programmes derived from the San Jose Agreement remain fully in force. Our commitment to the institutionalization of freedom and democracy in the area has been maintained without interruption and with absolute clarity  as has our rejection of interference by bloc politics.We support the effort of the Government of El Salvador  which bore fruit with the exemplary civic testimony of the elections held on 28 March. The people of El Salvador went to the ballot boxes in numbers unprecedented in their history  bearing witness to their desire for peace and their repudiation of violence. Venezuela welcomes the happy out¬come of the democratic process in Honduras and expresses its hope that complete normalization will soon become a reality in Guatemala and in Panama.We reaffirm our unswerving determination to co¬operate in the strengthening of peace  freedom  justice and a pluralist democracy in an area in turmoil where nothing that happens is alien to us. In this respect  the President of Venezuela  the only head of State invited to attend the celebrations marking the third anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution  recalled on that occasion the international commit¬ment to respect pluralism that the leaders of that country had entered into.The efforts of Venezuela and Mexico with regard to the tension between Honduras and Nicaragua are being made in the context of a striving for peace  freedom and democracy within Latin American channels without recourse to foreign action.Venezuela  like many other developing coun¬tries  views with profound concern the persistent deterioration and swift decay of the international economic situation. Nobody is unaware of the extreme gravity of those developments and their inevitable social and political consequences  which are the most serious threats to stability  progress and peace in the world. It is noteworthy that the most recent analyses of the world economy by international organizations shows such agreement. From a broader and universal perspective  the United Nations itself in the 1981¬1982 economic survey  when referring to the wide¬spread stand-still in the world economic expansion  stated that this ""slow-down affected all major regions and groups of countries  independent of their level of development or economic structure. The decel¬eration was particularly intense in the developing countries"".'Taking a similar view  the report by the UNCTAD secretariat categorically affirms that ""the developing world is facing the gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression "" and that ""this is the product of the malfunctioning of the economies of developed market-economy countries  and has been intensified by the growing disarray in the trade and financing systems"".For their part  organizations and specialized agencies such as GATT and IMF confirm those evalua¬tions. The symptoms of this situation can be summarized by the following indicators: low growth rates in production  the collapse of prices for commodities  the contraction of international trade  the revival of protectionism and counter trade practices  monetary and exchange instability  extensive and sudden fluctua¬tions in the balances of payments  extraordinarily high levels of indebtedness and soaring debt- servicing costs  a pull-back in productive investments and a flare-up of financial speculation  alarming and rising unemployment rates  lowering of expenditures for social purposes  growing military costs and an acceleration of the arms race by the great Powers.The situation I have just described is the result of contradictory and mistaken economic policies  as well as of the disorganization and malfunctioning of the world economy in its three basic aspects  commercial  financial and monetary. The increasingly blatant absence of rules and growing arbitrariness make forecasting impossible and thus sustain widespread unrest.Thus  we see how the developed countries  instead of strongly encouraging the development of exports by the developing countries by just remunera¬tion for their commodities  which in the long run would have led to a healthy expansion of interna¬tional trade for the benefit of all  have preferred to finance the imports of the third world on scandalously exorbitant terms. The effects of those actions are striking: after a phase of expansion of international trade  which was artificially and pathologically sustained  in large measure  by the rising indebtedness of the third world  the burden of the corresponding financial charges is now being turned against the industrialized countries themselves as a result of the drastic curtailment of the import capacity of the developing countries  which virtually eliminates them as factors promoting international trade.The total debt of the developing countries will be far in excess of the incredible amount of$6P0 billion by the end of 1982. This debt imposes intolerable burdens on the foreign exchange earnings of the developing countries and makes them increasingly insolvent. In Latin America alone the debt will amount to $280 billion by the end of this year. The amortiza¬tion of this debt represents the equivalent of 56 per cent of Latin American exports. This situation  which in the context of traditional conditions is now to be reinforced for strategic purposes  could have grave political and social consequences.The situation I have described is an unpre¬cedented challenge to the international financial system. The developing countries will have to make constant efforts to revitalize their economies  increase their productivity and improve their efficiency in the management of financial resources. All this will have to be done in a way that will be socially and politically bearable.The developed world must accept its responsi¬bilities  not only for the sake of the principle of justice  but also in its own interest. Financially  it will be necessary to preserve the capacity of international organizations which supply funds on preferential terms. This implies the need to review contributions to IMF  the World Bank  the Inter-American Develop¬ment Bank and similar institutions so that their resources bear some relation to the size of existing problems. There is one fact which cannot be ques-tioned: the economies of the industrialized countries cannot be sustained without the support of strong development in the third world.The time for major decisions is drawing near and we cannot afford to let slip any opportunity to have our voice heard. We  the developing countries  must reaffirm by our presence and active participation the importance of forums such as UNCTAD and must be attentive to what might happen at the next GATT ministerial meeting.We have been fighting for a complete restruc¬turing of the international economy  and we have denounced the policy of making the developing coun¬tries bear the brunt of that readjustment. All this has brought the world economy to the critical situation in which it finds itself today. It would be senseless to expect that the steps the situation calls for will be taken overnight  just as it has been senseless to postpone the essential dialogue. An atmosphere of mutual trust must be established to contribute to the charting of a new course for the world economy. This is a pre-condition of the lessening of international tension and the building of a more rational and more humane world  in which harmony  justice and peace will prevail.The developing countries promoted the idea of global negotiations and the international community endorsed it when resolution 34/138 was adopted by the Assembly in 1979  but so far the momentum needed to make them a reality has been lacking. Despite all the efforts made—not only by the Group of 77 but by practically the entire international com¬munity—hesitation  mainly on the part of the United States  has prevented the launching of global negotia¬tions although these were approved at Cancun with the agreement of the head of State of that important country  without which the negotiations would lose their true scope and meaning.In these circumstances  we  the developing coun¬tries  have been thinking about the need to be less vulnerable to the dealings of the countries of the North and  in any case  to stimulate effective co¬operation among ourselves as a consequence of our solidarity.Barely a month ago the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee  a key organ which was established in 1981 in the Caracas Pro¬gramme of Action 3 held its first meeting in Manila. The results of the meetings of experts were reviewed there  and on that basis important recommendations were made  to be submitted shortly to the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77. Without any doubt  it can be concluded that the Caracas Programme of Action is functioning. It is complementary to efforts which might be made in North-South negotiations and a contribution to the establishment of the new international economic order.In the last quarter century Venezuela has succeeded in consolidating a genuine democracy solidly rooted in the conduct and beliefs of the Venezuelan people  a democracy which endeavours increasingly to play its part within a philosophy of social justice and respect for the freedom and dignity of all citizens. The promotion and effective defence of and respect for human rights have been important tenets in the foreign policy of Venezuela. These form the basis of our support for people that are struggling to gain  maintain or recover their right to freedom  as a contribution to the solution of present conflicts which affect and bar the progress of mankind in its quest for peace and well-being for all.It is of the utmost importance for Venezuela to seek a peaceful and practical solution to the terri¬torial controversy with the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.Venezuela is a country in which the mixture of the indigenous peoples of America with the Spanish conquistadors and African groups has created a population which rejects all forms of racial discrimi¬nation and in which political  social and economic democracy is practised  thus setting an example of coexistence and pluralism.It is fitting to recall that Venezuela in its 172 years of independent life has never had a single war  not even an armed encounter  with any of its neighbours. This is an assertion which few countries in the world could make  and it is a source of satisfac¬tion and pride for Venezuelans. The land borders of Venezuela with Colombia and Brazil were established by peaceful means. The maritime borders with four countries have already been set by common agreement  and Venezuela is at all times opento negotiations with its neighbours to solve all matters of common interest.For 16 years now Venezuela has been tirelessly repeating its invitation to Guyana to negotiate  to seek mutually acceptable solutions to the dispute. The cause of the dispute is the mutilation of our territory by the British Empire. During the last century  starting from the Esequibo River  which was the boundary with the sector of Guyana which they had taken away from Holland  the British advanced from year to year  almost day after day  over the territory of defenceless Venezuela  making a mockery of its protests  until this culminated in an unprecedented legal farce  in which a so-called Arbitration Tribunal  with no Venezuelan judge or lawyer  imposed a totally arbitrary demarcation line. It did not even take the trouble to give any kind of justification  reason or explanation  however spurious or unprecedented  of what was from every point of view an unbridled plundering.The history of this humiliating mutilation cannot be forgotten by Venezuelans. Our entire tradition and all our instincts move us to desire to maintain and develop with the Guyanese people the closest relations of friendship  co-operation and solidarity. In truth  like ourselves  they were the victims of British impe¬rialism and  like ourselves  they are a people which is trying to achieve development. For this very reason v"": have insisted tirelessly on holding real and sincere negotiations  inspired by justice and equity  which will lead us to overcome this problem that we have inherited  in a satisfactory and practical way.The obligation for Venezuela and Guyana to negotiate their differences is not only a moral imper¬ative  not only a duty under international law  but  in this specific case  a commitment freely entered into in the Agreement signed at Geneva on 17 February 1966/ In fact  although the Venezuelan territorial claim naturally preceded the independence of Guyana  Venezuela  faithful to its tradition and to its principles  was most careful to do nothing which would in any way be used as a pretext to thwart or delay decolo¬nization for its neighbouring people. Shortly before the proclamation of indepen¬dence  Venezuela and the United Kingdom  with the full participation of the Government of what was then British Guiana  negotiated and signed the Geneva Agreement  designed to seek satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the dispute. This international instrument is the legal and political framework for the pursuit of solutions to the dispute and Venezuela has adhered to it in all its actions. A is regrettable that thus far the Government of Guyana has failed to comply with its obligation to negotiate seriously and sincerely. Nevertheless  Venezuela has insisted that  within the peaceful procedures provided in the Geneva Agreement  the injustices of the past should be corrected  and thus lay more solid founda¬tions for a fruitful and lasting co-operation between the peoples of Venezuela and of Guyana.Guyanese spokesmen have for years been carrying out a systematic campaign to incite feelings of sympathy  by presenting their country as a small and poor nation whose territory is the object of the covetousness of a rich and powerful neighbour  and trying to create an image of Venezuela as an aggressor country  indifferent to the laws  to justice  and to the solidarity that should exist between countries which are struggling to develop. This kind of assertion  repeated relentlessly  tends to produce prejudices among those who have not had an opportunity to know and analyse the facts. For almost two decades international forums have been hearing Guyanese assertions about an imminent aggression  and yet it is an obvious fact that there has been no aggression.We have explained the conduct of Venezuela from its birth to independent life and regarding the dispute that we are dealing with. There is not the slightest basis for asserting that the Venezuelan terri¬torial claim is prompted by coveting of present or potential riches which the people of Guyana could have used to achieve prosperity and development. Before the independence of Guyana  British companies were exploring for and exploiting oil on a large scale both in Venezuela and in Trinidad. British companies went mining gold in Venezuela and bauxite in Demerara. It will be easily understood that the British  before liberating their colony  had thoroughly eval¬uated the potential oil and valuable minerals of the lands that they controlled. Although prospecting has continued since the date of independence  no exploitable mineral resource has been found on the territory which Venezuela claims.The truth is crystal clear: Venezuela's claim is based neither on territorial ambition nor on covetous- ness of the wealth of others. Had it been so based  our claim could never have received  as it has  the unanimous support of Venezuelans of the most varied political tendencies under all democratic Governments  which  during the last five presidential terms  within a system of complete freedom of expression  have defended the rights of our country. That is because this unanimity of the Venezuelan people has its origin in a very deep wound. For this reason  we fail to under¬stand those who  representing the Guyanese people  take the stand as heirs to the fruits of British colonial imperialism and defenders of its unjustifiable abuses.After repeated rejections of our formal invita¬tions to the Government of Guyana to begin negotia¬tions which will provide a satisfactory and practical solution  Venezuela will submit to the Secretary- General 3ts decision to indicate a means to settle the dispute; thus our conduct will be in accord with the letter and the spirit of the international treaty signed between the parties  known as the Geneva Agreement  with a view to finding a solution to the dispute by peaceful means.Venezuela would like Guyana to participate as the continent moves towards integration. Venezuela wishes to have a positive relationship with its neigh¬bour. We feel certain that the people of Guyana share that desire. We greet all Guyanese  convinced as we are that an appropriate solution to the differ¬ences we have inherited from colonialism will spur us on our way to convergence toward progress and development. Venezuela wishes above all to win the battle for peace and brotherhood with Guyana  because we are neighbours and because in large measure we are born of the same American history.On 24 July 1983 it will be two centuries since the birth of the Father of our Venezuelan nation  Simon Bolivar  one of the great liberators of America. The United Nations  with appropriate solemnity  commemorated in 1976 the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the convening by the Liberator Bolivar of the Amphictyonic Congress in Panama and in 1980 the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his death. My country wishes to express its gratitude in advance for the tribute which will be paid to the Liberator in this political forum of the nations of the world on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.His prophetic thinking on the need for a uni¬versal organization in which matters regarding the peaceful coexistence of nations could be dealt with has a particular significance and pertinence today. Bolivar's bicentenary brings all Latin America together in harmony on the international scene. It demands that we make a constructive effort to make the new hemispheric dialogue a shining success. It leads us to strengthen our ties with all peoples  especially those who have faced historical and political challenges similar to those faced by us.Venezuela reaffirms its absolute loyalty to the ideals of Bolivar and commits itself to pursue a positive policy in all its actions as regards both our hemisphere and the world as a whole."
"142",7389,"VNM",37,1982,"On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  I should like to extend to Mr. Hollai  of Hungary  warmest con¬gratulations on his election to the high office of Presi¬dent of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and express my conviction that with his eminent talents and wealth of experience he will  together with other members of the General Com¬mittee  guide the work of the present session to fruitful results.80.	We are living in a period of complex upheavals and difficult challenges. The creative labour and the economic and other achievements of the world's peoples in the past 37 years are in danger of being destroyed by the tension clouding the international situation. In the hope of extricating itself from the prolonged economic recession and coping with the growth of the forces of peace  democracy  national independence and social progress  and in an attempt to continue to impose its will on other peoples  during the past three years the United States—in collusion with other reactionary forces—has launched a global counterattack against the independence and sover¬eignty of peoples and against world peace. It has stepped up the arms race to an unprecedented level in its quest for military supremacy. Billions of dollars have been spent on the production of weapons of mass destruction  including the neutron bomb. It has decided to deploy medium-range missiles in Western Europe  shamelessly proclaimed the doctrine of a for limited nuclear warfare   introduced the rapid deployment force into the region of the Persian Gulf  reinforced its fleet in the Caribbean Sea and built new military bases in the Indian Ocean  with a view to preparing for aggression and intervention in every continent  thus creating new hotbeds of tension in various regions of the globe.81.	This adventurist and bellicose policy constitutes an extremely grave threat to international peace and security  and runs counter to the aspirations of billions of people throughout the world. The collusion between the ring-leader of imperialism and international reactionary forces is a cause of tension and could lead to an explosive situation. More than ever before the struggle for international peace and security is an urgent and primary task for all peoples. With the exception of the military-industrial complexes of the imperialist Powers seeking excessive profits from war and the arms race  nobody today profits from war. The profound aspirations to peace of billions of peo¬ple are what give the peace movement unprecedented power  capable of staying the armored hands of the imperialist and reactionary forces. The united efforts of and the co-ordinated struggle carried on by the socialist countries  the non-aligned countries and the forces of peace and democracy in the Western coun¬tries have a great opportunity of averting the danger of a nuclear war and countering the warlike and aggres¬sive policy of the imperialists and international reactionaries.82.	Having undergone 35 consecutive years of war while the rest of the world was enjoying the longest period of peace in the century  the Vietnamese people are profoundly conscious of the significance of peace. Together with all peace-loving forces on this planet  our people have waged and are still waging an untiring struggle for national independence  foiling one after another all the schemes of imperialism and inter¬national reaction  aimed at turning South-East Asia into the hotbed for a new world war.83.	In the past several months alone  15 million Viet¬namese have participated in demonstrations  briefings and seminars and have signed petitions in response to a nationwide campaign for peace and disarmament. We unreservedly support the peace and disarmament initiatives put forward by the socialist and non-aligned countries. In particular  we highly appreciate the unilateral commitment of the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  and see in this a gesture of historic importance. If  like the Soviet Union  all nuclear Powers—and first of all the United States of America—were to make similar commit¬ments  the possibility of rebelling the danger of a devastating nuclear war would immediately become a reality  even at a time when the major Powers have not yet reached an agreement on disarmament. The new proposals of the Soviet Union  announced by Foreign Minister Gromyko to the General Assembly at the 13th meeting  once again prove that the Soviet Union spares no effort to prevent war and to defend world peace. Likewise  we give our full support to the proposal of the Soviet Union and the Secretary- General for a conference of States Members of the Security Council at the highest possible level to seek a solution to problems relating to international peace and security.84.	As an Asian country bordering the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean  Viet Nam warmly welcomes the initiatives of India and other non-aligned countries  aimed at making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. Likewise  we firmly support the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic on the signing of a convention on non-aggression and non-use of force in relations among countries in Asia and the Pacific. The implementation of these proposals would consti¬tute an effective contribution to international peace and security.85.	Those who have a conscience cannot remain indifferent to the abominable crimes perpetrated by the Israeli aggressors against the innocent civilian population of Lebanon and Palestine. The atrocious massacres in Lebanon are reminiscent of the crimes committed by the Hitlerites during the Second World War  by the American aggressors at My Lai during the Viet Nam War and by the Pol Pot clique in Kam¬puchea. As long as murderers in the Middle East of the Hitler and Pol Pot type remain unpunished  slaughters such as those committed in Lebanon will not be the last crimes against humanity. The Govern¬ment of the United States cannot clear itself of the crimes of aggression and genocide of the Israeli Zionists.86.	Together with all of progressive mankind  the Vietnamese people indignantly condemn the Israeli aggressors and those who have provided them with billions of dollars  and weapons  and we demand due punishment for those aggressors. Once again  we reaffirm the resolute support of the people and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the just struggle of the PLO  the Syrian Arab Republic  Lebanon and other Arab countries against the Israeli aggressors and their protectors. Israel must withdraw all its troops from all the Arab terri¬tories it has illegally occupied. A just solution for the situation in the Middle East cannot be achieved unless and until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  whose sole authentic representative is the PLO  are guaranteed  including the right to found their own independent and sovereign State. Any separate solution is aimed only at dividing the Arab coun¬tries and encouraging the aggressors  and is certainly doomed to failure.87.	The present situation in southern Africa is causing us no less concern. Unless checked in time  the crimes being committed in the Middle East may be repeated in southern Africa  where the Pretoria racists are pursuing a ferocious policy of apartheid  violently opposing the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa for national liberation  and launching piratical attacks against Angola  Mozambique and the other front-line States. The Vietnamese people wishes to express its profound sympathy and firm support for the just cause of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  under the leadership of SWAPO and the African National Congress JVC]  respectively  as well as that of the front-line States. We fully support all measures taken by Angola to deliver a well- deserved riposte to the aggressors.88.	We totally support the struggle of the people of Seychelles and of Madagascar against imperialist subversion and intervention. We demand that the United States return Diego Garcia to Mauritius.89.	The Vietnamese people resolutely stand by the peoples of Cuba  Nicaragua and Grenada in their current struggle against the threat of aggression and in defense of the fruits of revolution. We fully sup¬port the peoples of El Salvador  Chile and other Latin American peoples in their fight against their dictatorial regimes. Our special sympathy goes to the Puerto Rican people in their struggle for independence from colonial domination. In their struggle to regain sover-eignty over the Malvinas Islands  the people of Argen¬tina can rely on the solidarity of the Vietnamese people.90.	The Government and people of Viet Nam vehemently condemn the policies of the imperialist countries which use political pressure and carry out hostile acts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Polish People's Republic  with a view to wiping out the socialist achievements of the Polish people.91.	We resolutely support the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the fraternal Afghan people in their struggle against the imperialists' and international reactionaries' undeclared war  in defense of their independence and sovereignty  and to safeguard the fruits of the April revolution. We unreservedly support the just struggle of the Korean people for the reunification of their fatherland. The persistent struggle waged by the people of Western Sahara for their national independence as well as that waged by the people of Cyprus for their territorial integrity enjoys the constant and firm support of the Vietnamese people.92.	Having suffered from the yoke of colonialism and having had to wage a protracted struggle against the aggressors  the Vietnamese people fully and consistently support the struggle of the peoples in Asia  Africa and Latin America for the elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism  for the defense of their national independence and for the building of a new  just and equitable international economic order.93.	We are of the view that at this juncture  when the burdens of the economic crisis and of the arms race are weighing so heavily on the developing coun¬tries and when the United States is resorting to its policy of embargo and economic sanctions to impose its will on other peoples  the struggle of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America to build a new international economic order is of necessity linked with the common struggle of the peoples of the world for peace and disarmament and against the imperialist policy of aggression and intervention. The experiences of the past years have taught us that only by waging a struggle on the economic  political and other fronts can the peoples of the developing countries become masters of their own political destiny and natural resources and force concessions from imperialism.94.	The causes of world tension in the past three years are precisely those that threaten peace and stability in the South-East Asian region.95.	After failing in their attempts at collusion with United States imperialism in holding back the com¬plete victory of the Vietnamese  Lao and Kampuchean peoples in their wars of resistance for national salva¬tion  the reactionary elements in the Beijing ruling circles have considered the emergence of a unified Viet Nam as the biggest obstacle to their strategy of expansionism in South-East Asia. Since 1975  China has used the Pol Pot clique as its essential instrument to weaken Viet Nam and to carry out its policy of expansionism. Since the overthrow of the Pol Pot clique and China's defeat in February 1979 in its war of aggression against Viet Nam  the new leaders of the modern for Middle Empirefor  have waged a war of destruction in all fields against Viet Nam and the other Indo-Chinese countries. At the same time  they have kept oh using the remnants of the Pol Pot troops and have fabricated the so-called Kampuchean prob¬lem in a bid to reinforce their collusion with the United States and other reactionary forces against the three Indo-Chinese peoples and to incite confron¬tation between the Indo-Chinese countries and those which are members of ASEAN  with a view to under¬mining peace and stability in South-East Asia so that China may fish in the troubled waters.96.	In order to conceal its expansionist and hegemonist schemes  China has fabricated the so-called Vietnamese threat to the ASEAN countries  with a view to inciting the latter to oppose Viet Nam and sowing disorder in South-East Asia.97.	It is necessary to point out that this is not the first time that the aggressors have used such a pretext to justify their acts of aggression against Viet Nam. As is widely known  in 1964 the United States con¬cocted the for Tonkin Gulf incident for  as a pretext for unleashing its air and naval war of destruction against the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. What the Bering expansionists are now doing is just a repetition of the shameful acts committed in the past by the colonialists and imperialists against Viet Nam.98.	At present  China requires the settlement of the so-called Kampuchean problem as a pre-condition for the normalization of relations between Viet Nam and China and claims that it is the root cause of the Sino- Viet Nam conflict. Yet it is only too evident that since early 1978 China has used the question of the Hoa people—Vietnamese of Chinese descent—to launch a campaign of subversion against Viet Nam  as it did against Indonesia in 1965 and to invade India in 1962. They will certainly resort to similar pretexts when they find it necessary to provoke conflicts with other coun¬tries in South-East Asia.99.	History has proved that policies based on fabrica¬tions are always doomed to failure. At present more and more people have become aware of the fact that the so-called Kampuchean problem is in essence China's opposition to Viet Nam and the other Indo- Chinese countries  and not in the least a conflict between the ASEAN and the Indo-Chinese countries. The latest developments in South-East Asia have further enlightened world public opinion about the fact that the Beijing leaders are the only ones who do not want peace or stability in that region. China has time and again rejected all our proposals aimed at easing tension on the Viet Nam-China border and at resuming talks between the two countries to find a peaceful solution to the disputes. Moreover  China has sought all ways and means to sabotage the dialogue between the Indo-Chinese and the ASEAN countries to settle matters relating to peace and stability in the region.100.	Despite the hostile policy being pursued at pres¬ent by the Chinese leaders against Viet Nam and the other countries of Indo-China  the Vietnamese people never look upon the Chinese people as their enemies. Bearing in mind the age-old friendship between the two peoples  we believe that the present abnormality in the relations between Viet Nam and China is only a temporary phenomenon. It has been our consistent policy  and still is  to persevere in peaceful negotia¬tions to settle all differences between the two coun¬tries. We stand ready to resume the Viet Nam-China talks at any level  at any place and at the earliest pos¬sible time  with the aim of normalizing relations between the two countries.101.	With the desire to promote reconciliation among the countries in the South-East Asian region  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  on behalf of the Indo-Chinese countries  sent a letter dated 15 September 1982 to the ASEAN countries further clarifying the proposals made by the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Lao People's Republic  Kampuchea and Viet Nam  held in July 1982 in Ho Chi Minh City  on settling questions relating to peace and stability in South-East Asia. We regard these proposals as matters to be negotiated between the two groups of countries. We are ready to listen to other views and to respond positively to the legitimate concerns of the ASEAN countries. We hold that the two sides should respect each other's legitimate interests  that they should respect the principles of equality  mutual respect  non-imposition of one side's views upon the other and non-interference from out¬side. Only in those conditions can all issues con¬cerning South-East Asia be settled properly and peace and stability in the region be guaranteed.102.	The situation in Kampuchea is developing favorably. Under the leadership of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the Kam¬puchean people have over the past three years overcome their most serious difficulties and hardships and thus have continued the miraculous rebirth of their nation after the nightmare caused by the Pol Pot genocidal clique. World public opinion particularly welcomes the policy of national unity and concord of the Government of the People's Republic of Kam¬puchea as expounded in a recent statement by Mr. Hun Sen  Vice-President of the Council of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs  concerning those Kampucheans who are still in the ranks of the Pol Pot clique or are collaborating directly or indirectly with them. If they cease this collaboration and respect the Constitution of the People's Republic of Kam¬puchea  they will be entitled to enjoy all rights of citizenship  including the right to stand for and vote in Kampuchea's free elections  in the presence of foreign observers. With its foreign policy of peace and non- alignment  the People's Republic of Kampuchea  together with other countries in the Indo-Chinese peninsula  is playing an increasingly active role as a factor for peace and stability in South-East Asia.103.	We make this appeal to the international com¬munity: if for the time being it is unable actively to assist the Kampuchean people in accelerating their rebirth and to promote dialogue and reconciliation between the Indo-Chinese and ASEAN countries  at least refrain from doing anything that may poison the atmosphere  which is improving in this region.104.	As a Member of the United Nations  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam hopes that the Organization will do its best to perform the noble tasks entrusted to it by the peoples of the world. It is regrettable; however  that throughout the 37 years of its existence  in spite of the goodwill and com¬mendable efforts of many Member States  the United Nations has not yet fulfilled the aspirations of mankind. The great changes brought about by the peoples of the world in that period of time in their struggle for peace  democracy  national independence and social progress have all taken place outside the United Nations.105.	In the course of the struggle of the Indo- Chinese peoples and countries in the Moodiest war in history  the United Nations did not recognize the right of the Indo-Chinese people to be represented  while the imperialist and reactionary forces hostile to those three peoples had an important voice in this Organization. Today  when the peoples of the world greatly rejoice at the rebirth of the Kampuchean people who survived the genocide  the criminals of the Pol Pot genocidal clique and their accomplices in the for coalition government of Democratic Kampucheafor  have not yet been ousted from this body. However  the rebirth of the Kampuchean people is absolutely irreversible. All attempts to reimpose the genocidal regime on Kampuchea will certainly fail.106.	Mankind now faces extremely severe trials. World peace and international security are being threat¬ened by the frantic arms race and the policy of insti¬gating chaos in the world. In such a situation  the peoples of the world are urging the United Nations to discharge its responsibility to history. We believe that in order to strengthen the role and effectiveness of this Organization and to turn it into a real instrument of peace and international co-operation it is essential that Member States strictly respect the purposes and principles of the Charter and refrain from turning this Organization into an instrument for interfering in the internal affairs of other States and infringing the sovereignty of other peoples. The United Nations can accomplish its historic mission only if it supports the struggle of the peoples for justice and responds to the ardent aspirations of billions of people on our planet for the maintenance of world peace  the defense of the national independence of peoples  the develop¬ment of international co-operation and the building of a prosperous and happy life for all. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will spare no effort to make its contribution to that noble cause."
"143",7498,"YEM",37,1982,"Allow me at the outset to take this opportunity to express to Mr. Imre Hollai my warm congratulations  personally and on behalf of the Yemen Arab Republic  on his election as President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. We confirm to him that we are overjoyed to see him in that important post and we wish him full success in his tasks  which involve onerous responsibilities. We are sure that the work of this session will be crowned with success thanks to his expertise and acknowledged statesmanship. For our part  we shall spare no effort in cooperating with him in carrying out his great responsibilities in ensuring that the session does the work required of it at this crucial phase through which our world is now passing. We wish  through you  Sir  to put on record our well deserved appreciation and admiration for Mr. Ismat Kittani  who conducted the proceedings of the thirty sixty session in a brilliant and exemplary manner  which was characterized by objectivity and effectiveness. We wish him success in his future tasks. My delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary General for the constructive efforts he has made and the commendable he has done in the short period since his assumption of the post and for the way he has fulfilled the responsibilities which the nature of his sensitive task involves. I wish also to convey the greetings of the Yemeni people to all the peace loving people of the world represented at this annual and respected gathering.We all know that the United Nations came into being as a result of the strong desire and determination of the peoples of the world to avert the tragedies of further world wars. This resolve reflects the sincere and profound conviction that it is necessary that peace and security prevail throughout the world and that we end  once and for all  all violence  aggression  military threats  hegemony  intervention and colonialism in any form. Therefore  in the minds of all  the United Nations is linked with noble concepts and superior values  because it is the crucible of all sincere efforts to achieve peace and the supremacy of justice in all dimensions  and the starting point for efforts that will lead to understanding and solidarity among nations  instead of division and wars.For this reason  my country has reaffirmed more than once its commitment and adherence to the principles of the Charter and its noble purposes in all fields  for this is the proper way to establish normal and peaceful relations among all nations and solid guarantees of the achievement of international peace and security. Therefore all Member States should support the Organization in its constructive role and should abide by its resolutions more loyally than ever before. We should combine our efforts to ensure that the basic principles of the sovereignty  equality and independence of all nations  regardless of size  position  military strength  or social  economic or political system  will prevail.We in the Yemen Arab Republic  too  support the right to self determination and full and effective independence of all peoples that suffer under the yoke of imperialism and racial domination and that struggle to achieve the noble goal to which we aspire. At the same time we affirm our unshakable belief in the need to ensure the unity and territorial integrity of all nations and non intervention in their internal affairs. We also affirm the right of all nations to self determination  and  above all  the right of the Palestinian people to self determination  to return to its homeland and to establish an independent State on its own soil.We view with a sense of gratification the efforts exerted by the United Nations to preserve international solidarity  support liberation causes and to ensure well being and economic and social development everywhere. However  we look forward to further achievements  because the Organization can achieve more than it has already. It can redouble its efforts towards international peace and security  the assurance of justice for all the peoples that long for it in Palestine  in Lebanon  and in Namibia  and the greatest good of the whole world by providing norms and safeguards that guarantee respect for and compliance with the resolutions of the Organization.Proceeding from this premise  we support every detail of the report of the Secretary General on the work of the Organization and on increasing its efficiency and overcoming the difficulties that stand in its way. These difficulties represent a real challenge that should be faced by all Member States if we want the Organization to be a real instrument for the consolidation of peace  which we all so deeply desire  and of justice  to which we all aspire.The Yemen Arab Republic reaffirms its belief in fundamental human rights  the dignity of the individual and the promotion of international peace and security  and calls for continuous dialogue and permanent understanding among nations and peoples. It calls for resistance to dominating influences  no matter by whom  and seeks to widen the scope of cooperation among brother and friendly countries. It deplores more deeply than ever before the fact that these principles in which the international community came to believe after painstaking and agonizing experiences are not being effectively implemented in international relations  which causes us to look to the future with deep pessimism and concern.We do not have to look very far to confirm this prognosis. It is sufficient to consider the development of the international situation since the last regular session of the General Assembly. Many of the international conflicts have worsened and become more complex and serious. Many of the problems raised during the thirty sixth session and even before that  at previous sessions  remain unresolved; they have become more complicated and it will be more difficult to solve them in the near future.What shall we say to the deprived  the persecuted  those that yearn for justice for freedom and for the support of the international community? What shall we tell the displaced  the wounded  the maimed and murdered Lebanese and Palestinians who have appealed to the Organization and the conscience of the world  because their rights have been usurped and they have been the victims of aggressors in their own home and in the refugee camps? Shall we tell them that the Security Council  the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security  has been convened more than once in order to consider the abominable aggression by Israel against Lebanon and that each time the representative of a super Power  the United States of America  used its right of veto in order to obstruct the cessation of the massacres in Lebanon whose victims were men  women and children  and to obstruct the imposition of sanctions upon Israel in accordance with the Charter?What is the responsibility of the United States concerning the issues of international peace and security in the world after all that? For some time past Lebanon has been persistently complaining of the violation by Israel of the cease fire agreement through repeated Israeli aggression against southern Lebanon and through the violation of the independence and national sovereignty of the country and the support extended to the rebels against Lebanese authority.Today we face a new situation after the barbaric invasion of Lebanon by land  by sea and from the air. Towns and villages were destroyed  including the capital  Beirut. Houses were pulled down over their occupants and the most sophisticated internationally prohibited means of destruction were used. Despite all that Israel is still there  engaged in occupying  usurping  murdering and destroying with impunity  ' assured of the military  political and economic support of the United States without which it could not have continued its aggression. It is really surprising and at the same time revolting that the United States and some other Western countries did not use their influence early and still have not done so to compel Israel to withdraw from Lebanon and to stop the bloodshed and the daily massacres that Israel has committed on Lebanese territory  it is terrible that the United States should claim to preserve international peace when it supports Israel  which currently represents the greatest and the gravest threat to international peace and security. This claim  which clearly involves a contradiction  has practically disclosed the role of the United States in supporting the Israeli aggression against Lebanon and in focusing American diplomacy on the ousting of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon  without linking it to the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self  determination and to establish their own independent State on their soil.We wonder how the United States can reconcile its international responsibilities concerning international peace and security and its strategic cooperation with the State of Israel which today represents the most dangerous regional military Power seeking expansion and hegemony over the Middle East region. We consider this cooperation and this alliance to be the factor that encourages Israel to persist in its aggression against Lebanon and that it has an adverse effect on all efforts aimed at reaching a just solution to the conflict in the Middle East.The Yemen Arab Republic has heard more than enough words of condemnation and denunciation they will not return rights to those who have been deprived of them and will not restore life to an innocent child killed by the American war machine and Zionist hands. Words of denunciation have become unacceptable from those who could have influenced events  especially those who knew in advance what was to happen in Lebanon and could have prevented it. We firmly believe that the new Zionist arrogance and Israeli terrorism  immune to international resolutions  its arrogance with regard to all norms and legal instruments  and the constant acts of aggression  have proved more than ever before that Israel is not a peace loving State and that it should not have a voice in the Organization  which is made up of all the peace loving nations. All the Members of the Organization should adopt practical measures against Israel and punish it for the crimes it has perpetrated and for its breach of international peace and security and should compel it to implement Security Council and General Assembly resolutions concerning the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self  determination and to the establishment of their State on their soil and concerning an immediate withdrawal from Lebanon and from every bit of occupied Arab territory. It should be compelled to pay compensation for all the material losses it has caused and the leaders of the new Fascist Zionist terrorism should be prosecuted for their inhuman unprecedented massacres  devoid of all human feelings. Israel has become the true and indisputable representative of neo Nazism at its worst.Israel thinks that if it destroys Lebanon it could put an end to the Palestinian presence and to the Lebanese national movement and get rid of the PLO  thus achieving the security and stability it seeks  through force and through starting wars from time to time and devising ways to increase its aggression  expansion and colonial settlement. This sick concept led Israel to wage wars against the Arab countries  beginning in 1948  then again in 1956  in 1967  in 1973 and finally in Lebanon in 1982. In each war Israel emerged with a piece of land taken from a neighboring Arab country after having usurped all Palestinian soil bit by bit. But it has not achieved security and stability in accordance with its military concept in spite of all that and will not achieve them; rather the contrary holds true Israel has been a continuous source of tension and jeopardy to international peace and security since its inception. It is time now that Israel and its friends and allies  particularly in the United States  should realize that security and peace in the area can only be achieved through the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self determination and to the establishment of their own independent State on their soil  under the leadership of their sole  legitimate representative  the PLO. Without that peace and security will not be achieved  for Israeli concepts are based on an illusion founded on expansion and aggression.It is now imperative for the United States to consider its unjust biased attitude in favor of Israel if it wants to make any positive and constructive contributions to the solution of the Palestinian question and the Middle East crisis. It should cooperate with the international community to compel Israel to implement General Assembly and Security Council resolutions in the interest of international peace and security  which have become jeopardized and are about to collapse as a result of the wanton acts and constant defiance of the Organization  including the flouting of its resolutions  whether those concerning the return of Arab territories occupied after the 1967 aggression or those concerning the right of the Palestinian people to return home and to establish their independent State on their soil  Palestine.Those who advocate right  justice and peace are those who support the rights of the Palestinian people  which are inalienable and historical rights. Those who support Israel are aligning themselves  through such support  with the new Israeli fascism. It would be more appropriate to speak of peace in the Middle East if the efforts of all those who love peace were directed towards the adoption of practical measures to ensure the halting of Israeli arrogance and its continual flouting of international resolutions  and to compel Israel finally to withdraw from all the Arab countries it occupied after the aggression of 1967  as well as to halt the judaization measures being taken in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  who have been displaced  and to involve the PLO in all the efforts that are being made to maintain peace in this sensitive area of the world by peaceful means  since it is a main party to a conflict that has lasted too long. That conflict has resulted in many tragedies and many victims  so many that it is now no longer a military and political conflict alone but a problem that is a daily torment to the living conscience of mankind  which is agonizing over the massacres perpetrated by Israel against the Arab people of Palestine and Lebanon.The international community is today called on to impose deterrent sanctions against the war criminals and neo Nazis who now head the Israeli State  and who have no hesitation  in using the most heinous methods of destruction  and weapons which are prohibited internationally  against the peoples of the area. We are facing a new situation  which we must consider in order to draw the proper conclusion from it. Terrorism now has a State that protects it and exercises it  for the first time in contemporary history. Yet this State is a Member of the United Nations  while at the same time it rejects United Nations resolutions  and carries out acts of aggression  murder and repression whenever and wherever it wishes.It is easy to understand the effect this must have on the future of peace and security in the area  and even in the world at large. Even more incomprehensible than all this is the insistence of the United States of America on giving military and political encouragement to that terrorism  continuing to support it in international forums  and standing by it politically in its aggressive stances by the abuse of the veto in the Security Council every time that the international community tries to impose practical sanctions against Israeli arrogance and evil practices that defy the reason and the imagination  particularly those hideous massacres of Palestinian women  children and old people in Beirut.Those who could have prevented the aggression and could have compelled Israel to refrain from entering Beirut or the Palestinianrefugee camps will stand before mankind as responsible for the inhuman and criminal massacres in the camps of Sabra and Shatila. The United States of America cannot escape its responsibility for those genocidal crimes  committed in violation of the ethics and honor of mankind  because it undertook responsibility for the process of negotiation and for the supervision of the evacuation of the Palestinian fighters from Beirut  providing all necessary political guarantees to protect those who remained behind. But it appears that the credibility of United States policy and ethics completely collapses whenever Israel is concerned. That fact should be noted by everyone.We deeply deplore this situation  and we doubt the integrity of the role played by the United States of America in the area  after the last farce of American diplomacy in Beirut. We call on the Organization to stand firmly against Israeli Nazism  which has today become the major challenge to all peace loving nations. We also believe that the international prosecution of all the criminals and murderers responsible for the Beirut massacres is an essential requirement for mankind  after the commission of such crimes amid the shocked silence of the international community  to ensure that no such hideous massacres are repeated by those in Israel who thirst for more blood and would not hesitate to commit such murders again in the near future. Those who were responsible yesterday for the massacres of Deir Yassin and Qafr Qasim are responsible today for the massacres and hideous murders in west Beirut. Unless the international community hastens to shoulder its full responsibilities  inexorable tragedy will be inflicted on the Palestinian and Lebanese people  and on the peoples of the whole area.My country has more than once expressed its profound concern over the terrorism and piracy in the area  and the acts of oppression  repression and torture that Israel is committing against the Arab population in the occupied territories  a population living under and unjust rule and inhuman laws while their territories are occupied and settlements are being built on areas taken from the neighboring Arab countries by coercion and aggression. My delegation calls on all nations and peoples firmly to denounce and condemn such Israeli acts based on aggression  oppression and expansionism  and it calls for the imposition of all possible stringent political and economic sanctions against Israel  to compel it to act in compliance with the will of the international community  withdraw from the occupied territories and restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate rights.We attach great importance to the work of the current session. We call on it to meet its responsibilities of working for peace  rekindling the hopes that have become dimmed and restoring confidence to all those who have become so disillusioned through seeing the repeated acts of aggression carried out by the racist Pretoria regime  which is committing crimes of murder  torture and oppression against the majority of the people of South Africa  as well as committing with impunity repeated acts of aggression against the people of Namibia and the peace loving front line States.The present collaboration between the two racist entities in Tel Aviv and Pretoria has resulted in acts of murder  oppression  torture and Apartheid surpassing anything known previously. In recent years those two entities have begun to exchange information on nuclear research and the production of nuclear weapons with a view to the imposition of terrorism and imperialism in the area.My country firmly and unconditionally believes in and supports the liberation movements in the world  foremost among which are the PLO and the South West Africa People's Organization  and reaffirms that the Namibian problem will never be solved and the occupation of Namibia can never be ended unless the Organization continues its efforts  upon which the people of Namibia pin all their hopes of freedom and independence. We believe that the implementation of United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  represents the practical basis for solving that problem  which has been complicated and burdened with further ramifications as a result of the defiance of South Africa and at its rejection of the United Nations resolutions designed to end its illegitimate occupation of Namibia.The United Nations indeed the whole world has condemned South Africa for its shameful racist policy which is exercised by force against the black majority and for its inhuman torture  persecution and exile of the black people in South Africa. The Pretoria regime even boasts of committing these crimes and is competing with its permanent ally  the Zionist regime  in finding new means of repression and humiliation and establishing settlements.The Namibian issue must emerge from its situation of stagnation  especially since the United Nations devoted a special session of the General Assembly to discussing the Namibian question in all its aspects. It must not remain a source of tension and trouble in Africa and continue to threaten world peace and security. The world M living today in a state of economic imbalance. The rich of this world are becoming increasingly rich and the poor increasingly poor. As a result of this grave division  which rests on inequality  the gap is increasing day by day and a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm in regard to setting of the new economic system based on justice and equality and building new world economic and monetary structures is today more urgent than ever before. But enthusiasm alone is not sufficient: it is necessary to crystallize the strong political will that can redress the frightening imbalance and redistribute wealth instead of confining it to certain Powers. We must constantly bear in mind the interest of all parties.The emergence of negative phenomena in world economic life  such as the increasing protectionist trend in the markets of the industrialized countries  the fluctuations of the exchange rate and the skyrocketing of interest rates on food commodities  consumer goods and capital goods have led to the deterioration of world trade conditions and the enormous deficits in the balance of payments of developing countries.The increasing indebtedness of these countries year after year  added to the deterioration of the economic and social growth rate therein  results in these developing countries alone paying the price and sacrificing their development in the interest of the rich  industrialized countries. Hence  the General Assembly is called on to give this subject increased attention and study in order to correct the imbalance in international economic relations and to take action to achieve more progress in the negotiations concerning this question  having regard to its importance to the international community in general and to the interests of developing countries in particular.The peoples of the third world cannot remain forever a source and exporter of raw materials and a market place for manufactured goods. It is not in the interest of the international community these States remain in a condition of economic impotence  unable to cope with their financial obligations towards others. Consequently  it is necessary to achieve constant development and progress in these countries. But the modernization and development process is linked in its tum to science and technology and the method of the transfer of such science and technology to developing countries  with the help of those who are more advanced in those areas  in order to promote their scientific capability and their administrative and technological know how. That must be done if we really want to avoid more crises and deterioration in the world economy We can all achieve prosperity and happiness for mankind at large if we work with a common approach and if the developed countries pledge themselves to a courageous monetary reform  to revise their present economic policies and increase their development investments in the developing countries in order to alleviatethe suffering and deprivation of the people of those countries and restore some balance and harmony to the troubled world economy. There is no doubt but that the promotion of the specialized world financial institutions in the United Nations system in the field of economic and social development constitutes a direct contribution to the achievement of the well being of mankind. Mutual respect  non interference in the internal affairs of States and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  the freedom of each State to decide on its own its economic and social structures in accordance with its national and political options constitute a sure guarantee of cooperation and peaceful and constructive coexistence and represent the appropriate process for promoting the policy of international detente. The Arab Republic of Yemen  which has founded its policy on respect for nation sovereignty and the exchange of interests and economic benefits with others in accordance with the principle of equality  rejects totally the policy of hegemony and military force in international relations  as it rejects also  absolutely  the principle of setting up military pacts  bases and facilities. It is greatly concerned over the emergence of signs of tension and cold war between the Western and Eastern World and the pursuit of aggressive practices by some States and the negative impact that this has on international relations  in addition to endangering the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States of the world to danger.Signs of deterioration in international relations have become more tangible today than ever before as a result of the use of military force in solving international disputes and of interference in the internal affairs of States and the persistence of the frightful arms race  especially in the nuclear field. This constitutes a threat to mankind that could have the gravest results. Consequently  all States must take the necessary measures to improve international relations  promote the policy of detente and peaceful coexistence  affirm international legitimacy and define means of making the concept of disarmament a tangible fact ensuring security to the human community and happiness to mankind. The super Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  must renew their Talks for limiting nuclear weapons and to eliminate all obstacles that are impeding the pursuit of these negotiations. Complete disarmament and the cessation of the nuclear arms race have become two vital prerequisites for all the peoples of the world that are looking forward to the day when this feverish race towards destructive arms will come to an end so that mankind may feel secure about its existence and future so that the efforts and money wasted on the manufacture  purchase  and stockpiling of weapons can be diverted to solving the crushing economic crisis from which many peoples of the world are suffering  and to meeting the material and spiritual needs of men. The second special session devoted to disarmament was a golden opportunity to hear all the opinions and concepts on which future negotiations should be based.For us  peace is an essential and noble objective. We must exert maximum efforts to promote peace everywhere in the world  for there is nothing more precious and more important to all the peoples than peace. But we feel disappointed and suffer when we see that hatred and war have replaced love and understanding among States and peoples. Peace has been shattered today in some parts of the world  such as the Arab Gulf  the Horn of Africa and the Falkland Islands. Arbitration  mediation and peaceful and diplomatic solutions are much better than recourse to force  which in most cases leads to a dead end  perpetuates grudges between peoples and obstructs the process of cooperation and peaceful coexistence among nations.The war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued for more than two years despite the ties of a common creed and proximity and despite the mediation efforts exerted by the non aligned countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  as well as by the United Nations. Now Iraq has responded to those mediation efforts and withdrawn its forces to its borders. It would thus have put an end to hostilities but for the pretexts invoked by Iran to continue the war and to postpone the settlement if the conflict by negotiations and peaceful means between the two Moslem neighbor countries. We call on Iran to seize this opportunity and respond to the peace proposals; to cease its aggression against the territory of Iraq and not to abandon hope of a reconciliation with that neighboring Moslem country.We appeal to the Organization to redouble its efforts to bring those destructive hostilities to an end and we call on the two conciliation committees  of the non aligned movement and the Islamic Conference  to continue to use their good offices to bring about an end to the war and the restoration of rights  in order that peace may once again prevail in the lands of Iraq and Iran.My country  which firmly believes in regional cooperation between neighboring countries  is also interested in the maintenance of security and stability in the region. Therefore it views with profound concern the continuing state of tension in the Horn of Africa and calls for the solution of the border problems and of the historical and political problems between the nations of the area through negotiations and peaceful means  for the sake of the peoples of those countries and to prevent any foreign intervention in their internal affairs under the pretext of providing aid and support to one party or the other.My country rejects any military presence or bases in the Indian Ocean or the Arab Gulf. It reaffirms that the security of the Gulf and the Arab peninsula is the responsibility of the countries of the region and their peoples. It calls for support for the need to consider the Indian Ocean  the Arab Sea and the Red Sea areas that should be free from any fleets or military bases. We support the efforts made in the Committee on the Indian Ocean and the necessity of convening the Conference on the Indian Ocean during 1983  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 36/90. We look forward to the day when signs of tension will disappear one e and for all from  that sensitive part of the world. It is extremely dangerous to let the hotbeds of tension and conflict increase every day.As regards Afghanistan  we reaffirm the right of the Afghan people to self determination  free from foreign intervention of any form and from any source. We believe that it is high time to find a peaceful solution to that conflict  in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations.On Korea  we affirm the necessity of putting an end to the dispute between the two parts of the peninsula and of reaching a peaceful solution of the problem  on a democratic basis  acceptable to both parties. An encouraging environment should be provided for Korean unity through the withdrawal of foreign forces from the area and the seas around it.As regards the Cypriot conflict  it is the firm position of my country that there should be an agreed solution between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots aimed at the reunification of the island on a democratic basis which will ensure freedom of religion and expression and civil rights for all Cypriots. The Organization would be fulfilling its responsibility for the preservation of peace and ending the anomalous situation in which the island finds itself now by applying all the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and considering them a basis for settling the Cypriot conflict.One of the positive achievements of which we are proud in the Yemen Arab Republic is our success in keeping our country free from international polarization and the rivalry between the super Powers. My country adheres firmly to the policy of non alignment and positive neutrality. We are proud of belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference and to the League of Arab States and we believe that the continuing cooperation between the United Nations and those organizations will undoubtedly be a crucial factor in the implementation of many social and economic plans and will contribute to the solution of many international political problems.We also feel that all our endeavors should be aimed at developing our country and raising the standard of living of our people so that we may keep pace with other countries of the world. This is the concern of our political leadership  under President Ali Abdulla Saleh  who considers the issue of reunifying the two parts of Yemen to be of extreme importance in its endeavors to achieve progress and dignity. There have been many achievements socially  economically and politically as regards reunifying the two parts of Yemen on a democratic basis. We have reached the stage of periodic meetings between the Presidents of the two parts of Yemen to consider programmes of integration and reunification at all levels.My country has devoted all its efforts since the revolution to serious and pressing efforts to promote the welfare of Yemeni citizens and provide a proper climate for the establishment of democracy  justice and political freedom  and on this basis to initiate a process of setting constructive goals at a high level. My country is anxious to ensure the success of all plans beneficial to it. It has so far been able to fulfil the essential needs of all citizens and to set up the major infrastructures  which we consider to be the cornerstone of production  despite the fact that the revolution took place only a short time ago. We have the patience and faith to continue our march and to work for reconstruction  development and fruitful cooperation with all countries of the world on a basis of equality  good neighborliness  mutual respect and non intervention in the internal affairs of others  settling ail our conflicts peacefully  so that everyone can enjoy peace and security and we can help each other in an atmosphere of sincerity conducive to the happiness of mankind as a whole.Finally  I wish to thank the President and express my appreciation and commendation of all his sincere efforts in the interest of achieving international peace  justice and freedom."
"144",7545,"YUG",37,1982,"Mr. President  I should like first of all to congratulate you on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. It is my particular pleasure to welcome you  the representative of a neighbouring country with which Yugoslavia has been developing friendly relations and comprehensive good-neighborly co-operation  to this important and responsible post.93.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General for his high personal and statesmanlike qualities  as well as far the selfless efforts he exerted during the short but very dynamic and difficult period since his election. We are very pleased to see the representative of friendly and non-aligned Peru in this high and exceptionally important post. His election also honors the whole Latin American continent  as well as being recognition of the growing influence of the policy and movement of non-alignment in international relations.94.	I avail myself of this opportunity to point out our particular gratitude and appreciation to the President of the thirty-sixth session Mr. Ismat Kittani  the representative of Iraq  a country with which Yugoslavia has firm friendly ties  for the outstanding efforts  objective attitude and skill with which he guided the thirty-sixth session of the General Assem¬bly  the second special session on disarmament and other meetings of the General Assembly in the course of the past year  which was fraught with numerous problems and difficulties.95.	Although there are certain differences in the assessments of the causes of the present state of affairs in the world  we believe that there is almost no dispute that we are now witnessing one of those crucial turning-points in the history of international relations  when a choice has to be made between a perilous downhill slide caused by the increase of tension  and a halting of this dangerous trend by reversing the developments and directing them towards the renewal of international confidence and respon¬sibility  which have been so badly eroded. This would pave the way for a process of equitable and peaceful negotiation on a number of conflict situations and crises present in the world. There is no doubt that the situa¬tion in all spheres of international relations has deterio¬rated to such an extent that the whole international community is faced with that choice  which is all the more dramatic since there are no signs of improve¬ment. On the contrary  many things are getting out of control and are acquiring their own momentum which  in turn  produces more tension.96.	There are three phenomena which constitute an inseparable whole and which are the major causes of negative developments. These are the unabated and spiraling arms race  which has acquired unforeseen proportions; the denial to countries and peoples of their right to free social development and self-determination; and increased rivalry  based on positions of strength  in establishing new boundaries of spheres of interest and influence and shifting the existing boundaries. All this is being done in the name of a self-arrogated right to protect social systems  to impose foreign models of development and to declare entire regions as the inviolable zones of security of big Powers. The use of force tends to become a legitimate form of behavior aimed at imposing the blocs as sole arbiters in international affairs. To this end  bloc policy resorts to the use of the most diverse methods of destabilization  ranging from interference in internal affairs and economic pressure to military intervention and direct aggression.97.	The Secretary-General was  therefore  right when he said in his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization that ""The past year has seen an alarming succession of international crises as well as stalemates on a number of fundamental inter-national issues"". This is a grave but regrettably true and irrefutable observation. This situation is less a result of cyclical aggravation than of the profound crisis of the post-war bloc system based on the balance of terror. The entire development of international relations since the Second World War has shown that the historic processes of emancipation and the striving for independent and undisturbed develop¬ment are deeply rooted and universal. In spite of all attempts to the contrary  the policy of the division of the world into blocs  aimed at controlling those processes and at preserving the system of domination and the policy of rivalry  has failed. This could not be achieved either through the cold war or by limited detente  by outbreaks of situations of conflict and other forms of interventionism or by attempts to crush the resistance of peoples to foreign domination and their will to establish their own national and social identities. In short  the arms race  limited wars and military interventions have not given any substantive advantage to either bloc  nor have they strengthened their internal cohesion. On the contrary  the bloc perception of international relations not only has failed to remove the possibility of global war but has constantly led the world to its brink.98.	The blocs cannot solve in the old way the crises existing both within their own ranks and in inter¬national relations and they are not willing to do so on the new basis; they are trying to overcome them at the expense of small  economically and militarily weak countries. All this undoubtedly points to the obsolescence of the existing system of international political and economic relations  which is caught today in a web of mutual contradictions. The blocs are attempting to find a way out by intensifying and expanding their power. They are incapable of com¬prehending the altered structure of the international community and the growing awareness of nations and peoples  which have never been stronger  better organized and more committed to changing the existing international relations. Never has the gap been wider between the old relations and the new needs and possibilities for changing the existing state of affairs for the better  nor have the dangers threatening the world ever been so immediate and so far beyond control. There is practically no field in political and economic relations in which serious aggravation of difficulties has not occurred. The relaxation of tensions and the efforts to settle disputes by peaceful means are giving way to increased manifestations of the cold war and the use of force. Major channels of negotia¬tion  whether bilateral or multilateral  have been blocked  and communication for the purpose of negotiation has been reduced to the lowest level. The security and independence of many nations  as well as the most essential conditions of economic development  are threatened daily. The manifestations of such a state of affairs are  unfortunately  very numerous.99.	The arms race  with the unrestrained and uncon¬trolled growth  quantitative and qualitative  and stock¬piling of weapons  constitutes today a most direct threat to world peace and an instrument for preserving the existing inequitable system of international relations. Negotiations on specific aspects of the limitation of the arms race or its control or on disarmament have for years been bogged down  while the Programme of Action contained in the Final Docu¬ment of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  unanimously adopted at the first special session devoted to disarmament  has not been implemented. At the second special session on disarmament the Assembly was not only unable to do further work on an international strategy for a long-term process of disarmament  but  in a way  took a step backwards. Detente not only failed to become a coherent strategy for peace but  as the transition from cold war to peace  experienced a crisis precisely at the moment when it was about to achieve the most durable results  particularly in Europe.100.	The existing focal points of crisi are constantly becoming linked with new ones in an uninterrupted chain stretching from the Mediterranean  through the region of the Gulf  the Indian Ocean  southern Africa and South America to the Caribbean and Central America.101.	The longstanding practice of tolerating Israel’s aggressive policy in the Middle East has brought about a situation which has no precedent in recent history  and for which it would be hard to find a parallel even in the Second World War. Not only does there seem to be no end to the Israeli policy of expansionism and its violation of all the decisions of the United Nations and all the norms of inter¬national behavior  but Israel has resorted to genocide against the Palestinian people and keeps encroaching upon the independence of Lebanon  A premeditated and cold-blooded massacre of helpless Palestinian and Lebanese people is carried cut before the eyes of the whole of mankind  which is unable either to prevent the crimes or to punish the perpetrator. It has become obvious that this is a continuous and premeditated policy of aggression against and extermination of the Palestinian people and an attempt to find a ""final solution"" to the Middle East crisis without it or against its will. Such a policy is based on the illusion that the Palestinian question can be resolved without fulfilling the aspirations of the Palestinian people  which are  like those of any other nation in the region  to live in peace and security on its own territory and in its own independent State; without recognizing the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and without Israel's withdrawal from all territories occupied in the 1967 war.102. The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  adopted a constructive plan  the implementation of which should be supported by the entire international community. It is encouraging  also  to see a positive development even among those elements that until yesterday supported Israel automatically in all mani¬festations of its aggressive policy. It is high time to put a stop to this policy of extermination of the Palestin¬ian people and to enable it to exercise its inalien¬able rights. From the latest developments we should draw the lesson that it is no longer sufficient to express anger  disappointment  abhorrence or guilty conscience and to engage in the rhetorics of propa¬ganda but that it is indispensable instead to take resolute action. No one can avoid responsibility for the latest brutal atrocities in Beirut  least of all those that could have prevented it.103.	In South-East and South-West Asia the state of crisis persists unchanged. The peoples of Afghan¬istan and Kampuchea are prevented from exercising their right to a free life and are still subjected to foreign intervention. The international community has  through United Nations resolutions and the positions taken by the conferences of the non-aligned countries  laid down the basis for a peaceful political solution of these problems  which can be achieved only through the withdrawal of foreign troops and the elimination of all forms of outside intervention.104.	3n Africa  particularly southern Africa  racist and colonialist strongholds still exist  while attempts are being made to tum that continent into an arena of bloc rivalry. These neo-colonialist tendencies threaten the independence and security of the coun¬tries of the continent and obstruct the positive role played by the Organization of African Unity. It is high time that the question of Namibia was solved  and the long-expected final agreement on its accession to full independence should be reached at this very session of the general Assembly. We believe that this is indispensable and will be possible if we exert additional efforts and show greater resolve. Success in solving the outstanding problem of Namibia would show that the most complex issues can finally be resolved through negotiations. It would help to reawaken the shaken faith in the United Nations. On the other hand  procrastination would undoubtedly bring the already tense situation in this part of the world to the brink of explosion  with wider inter¬national implications. The liberation of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  as well as the creation of conditions enabling the people of Western Sahara to express its will freely within the framework of the right to self-determination  would be of the utmost importance for the strength¬ening of the independence and the faster economic and social development of all African countries. The people of Korea has net yet exercised its right to unification  in spite of the position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which de¬serves international support.105.	Cyprus remains divided. United Nations efforts based en clearly formulated positions on the establish¬ment of an independent  united and non-aligned Cyprus have yielded no results. We welcome the continuation of the intercommunal talks and hope that they  together with all the other efforts being exerted  will bring about a just and lasting solution.106.	In Central America and in the Caribbean peo¬ples are fighting for their national and social identity and for liberation from all kinds of patronage and foreign interference.107.	The deterioration of the situation in Europe is manifested primarily through the escalation of the arms race  the introduction and deployment of new types of weapons and the obstruction of the channels of eco¬nomic  cultural and other forms of co-operation among European countries. In addition  European security is directly affected by the situation and security in the broader region of the Mediterranean  including the Middle East  as well as by the relations between blocs in all parts of the world. Therefore  we attach great importance to the resumption of the Madrid follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the successful outcome of which would most certainly have a positive impact on international relations in general.108.	Our efforts in the Mediterranean are directed to transforming this sea and its hinterland from a region of confrontation and constant sabre-rattling into a region of overall co-operation  security and mutual interaction of the cultures of Mediterranean countries and peoples. In a word  our efforts should be directed towards creating the conditions of peace  co-operation and progress for all.109.	The economic situation is becoming ever more critical and a prolonged crisis is permeating all areas of the world economy and international relations. Although no country is immune to certain difficulties  the developing countries  which are victims of both the crisis in the world economy and the inequitable system of international economic relations  are hardest hit by such a situation.110.	The critical situation in the world economy is accompanied by ever more frequent severing of economic ties  retrogression of multilateral economic co-operation and withdrawal into one's own narrow boundaries. International economic co-operation is stagnating and giving way to unilateral and bilateral moves which do not lead to solutions but provoke even sharper conflicts. The causes of the present crisis lie above all in the structure and the existing imbalance and inequality of the current system of international economic relations. That is the source of the constant widening of the economic gap between developed and developing countries  which not only further destabilizes the world economy but also constitutes an increasing danger to peace and security in the world.111.	The greatest responsibility for such a state in the world economy is borne by the industrially most developed countries. Their extremely restrictive eco¬nomic and monetary policies have not only led to deep recession and increased unemployment but also hampered economic growth in developing countries  considerably increased their indebtedness and criti-cally aggravated their balance of payments.112.	The present financial crisis which is shaking the world economy and the international financial system is a direct consequence of the longstanding stagnation of the world economy and international economic relations. Many countries  particularly the developing ones  have found themselves in a critical financial situation. The fact that the developed countries show insufficient understanding of the efforts of developing countries to overcome these difficulties seriously threatens the economic growth and development of the latter  and this could have far-reaching political and social consequences.113.	The way out of the present particularly difficult economic situation can be found only in the strength¬ening of multilateral economic co-operation and the establishment of the new international economic order. The solution of the accumulated economic problems would be in the interest not only of developing coun¬tries but also of the entire world economy and of progress in general. In the context of the present situation  which is fraught with a number of problems and uncertainties  global negotiations within the United Nations system and progress in general appear to be the only possible course. The launching of global negotiations has never been so urgent.114.	The general unfavorable development of the situation in the world has blocked the work and the functioning of international organizations and almost all multilateral institutions. Particularly disquieting is the situation in which the United Nations finds itself. The Organization is becoming ever more helpless in its efforts to play the role of an effective guardian of peace  the protector of the independence of countries and peoples and a forum for solving major inter¬national issues by promoting co-operation. The impotence of the Security Council was manifested recently in connection with the Lebanese crisis  as in similar cases in the past  owing to the lack of political readiness on the part of the big Powers and the abuse of the right of veto. Victims of aggression can rely less and less on the United Nations for effective support.115.	The constant deterioration of international rela¬tions calls for a most urgent global response from the world community. It is becoming ever more obvious that the key issues of the present-day world cannot be dealt with and even less resolved in a bilateral context  between blocs and the big Powers. These issues can be solved only on the basis of equal par-ticipation and joint responsibility of all members of the international community in their defense of peace as the common heritage of mankind  and within the framework of a new system of international relations. The movement and policy of non-alignment—which is constantly and actively contributing to the develop¬ment of a new concept of international community and to the solving of international issues—have always advocated the need for such global responses. There¬fore  a strong and independent non-aligned movement  which is constantly limiting the areas of bloc con¬frontation  narrowing the room for the creation of spheres of interest and widening the basis for inter¬national co-operation  is essential not only to the non- aligned countries but also the entire international community.H7. The non-aligned countries will urge once again at the current session that the existing tensions be overcome through a dialogue in which all countries would participate on equal terms. Their assessment that peace cannot be built on a balance of terror  the arms race  bloc division  spheres of interest  imposition of foreign will and diktat upon peoples and countries  has been fully confirmed. Not only would such peace be fragile but it would also condemn the world to perpetual instability. Only such peace enabling all countries and peoples to exercise the right to free development and equal security can be stable and lasting. Those positions of the policy and movement of non-alignment are more important and crucial today than ever before.118.	Such a conception of non-alignment is founded on the irrepressible aspiration of peoples to participate in international life freely and on a footing of equality. The validity of such an approach is also confirmed by the fact that the number of non-aligned countries in the world has never been larger  that it constitutes today two thirds of the international community  that they have neverbeen more determined to oppose any policy of force and that resistance to the suppression of freedom and equality has never been more resolute than now. Indeed  owing to non-alignment inde¬pendence today does not amount to mere balancing between the blocs or to neutrality  but to active involvement in international affairs. That is the basis for our optimism that a way out of the current crisis can be found and that the international community must not be engulfed by desperation.119.	At this session we are confronted with the major and responsible task of opposing energetically any further deterioration of international relations and to begin solving issues on which agreement can already be reached. The dangers are too imminent and the priorities too well-known to allow any hesitation which could have irretrievable and unforeseeable con-sequences. AH the States Members of the United Nations should be actively involved along these lines  regardless of ideological  bloc  regional and other orientations  and irrespective of the level of economic development. Special responsibility is borne by coun¬tries which have certain special rights due to their military and economic power. There is a solid basis of common interest for such an effort. Resolute political action should be taken for the purpose of changing the present state of affairs  broadening the foundations of co-operation and returning to detente. That would be beneficial to all countries.120.	In order to achieve this  it is necessary to proceed to broad political negotiations  aimed at halting the arms race and controlling it within the framework of the process leading to general and complete disar¬mament. Each step toward that end would be welcome; it could be taken without any danger of diminishing security  since the leading nuclear Powers possess a sufficient quantity of weapons for multiple mutual destruction. If this is not done  the race against armaments will be lost. No question of prestige or illusory political advantage anywhere in the world should prevent talks on the halting of the arms race.121.	Far-reaching decisions on starting the nego¬tiating process on all problems are also necessary  taking into account that they should not infringe upon the legitimate right of all peoples and countries to security and an independent development. Any com¬promise in this sense would be not only amoral but also destabilizing. Therefore  such negotiations should deal not only with the arms race  because the halting of the arms race  and even the launching of the process of disarmament  in spite of its significance for the problem of world peace or war  could not bring about peace and security for all peoples unless the use of force is restrained.122.	It is an illusion that stability and development can be limited to one part of the world  while other parts remain hunting grounds and spheres of rivalry and exploitation. It is confirmed every day that the big Powers cannot be sole arbiters even in their own backyards. That is why fundamental changes should take place not only in their mutual relations  but also in their relations with the rest of the world  proceeding from the perception that the world has changed  that peace is indivisible  that peoples are not ready to accept positions of passive resignation or to live in permanent political  economic and cultural sub-jugation..123. The non-aligned countries have always under¬lined the particular importance of and the need for the strengthening of the role of the United Nations as an irreplaceable forum for the maintenance of peace and security in the world and for the solving of major international problems. The principles and the goals of the policy of non-alignment are in their essence linked with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  with which they constitute an indivisible whole. For this reason the non-aligned countries are deeply interested in the full implementation of the Charter and of the role of the United Nations that inspired its creation.124.	We believe that it is never redundant to emphasize that all countries in their international behavior should strictly comply with the obligations they undertook when signing the Charter. We are thinking here above all of non-interference in the internal affairs of State  the absolute inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations  full respect of independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  as well as the right of all peoples to decide on their own destiny.125.	The United Nations should become an instru¬ment which will enable these principles to become everyday practice. The Organization  namely its Member States  must strive for the establishment of a system of collective security which will guarantee freedom and opportunity for independent development to every country. The present very dramatic moment in international relations is the consequence of nu¬merous violations of obligations undertaken on the basis of the Charter and of the non-implementation of the decisions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council.126.	A system of international relations should be established which would fully secure respect for and implementation of decisions adopted by the main United Nations bodies. The primary responsibility for this is borne by the Security Council  which according to the Charter is the principal organ for the main¬tenance of international peace and security. We consider that particular obligations of the permanent members of the Security Council for the main¬tenance of international peace  respect for the principles of the Charter and the implementation of the decisions of the United Nations should again be pointed out. As a first step in that direction we should secure at least the full implementation of decisions adopted unanimously in the Security Council.127.	We propose that comprehensive and con¬crete action be undertaken for the realization of the effective role of the United Nations in solving major international issues. We consider that there is enough room for the promotion of such a role for the United Nations. Perhaps this is the right time for a com¬prehensive review of the functioning of the United Nations  namely  of ways of improving its effec¬tiveness. To that end  the experience gathered during almost 40 years of existence and work of the United Nations should be studied. Article 109 of the Charter could serve as the basis for such an endeavor  embracing all efforts of the Member States and the organs of the United Nations. In this way  concrete and practical measures for the future could be elaborated.128.	We believe that a particular role should be played by the Secretary-General  who in his report has pointed to the existing problems and difficulties. We should request him to devote particular attention to the effective functioning of the United Nations and to suggest adequate measures. His efforts can  of course  yield results only to the extent to which he will be given support by the Member States.129.	Let me now add a personal note in this playdoier on the urgent need to undertake concrete measures to strengthen the role of the United Nations. There are now assembled in this Hall many represen¬tatives with considerable experience of the work of the Organization. Speaking for myself  in the many years of my deep and active involvement in the work of the United Nations I have looked to this rostrum where 1 am now standing from all possible angles in this Hall  from all different vantage points  as a member of a delegation  as a permanent representative and even as President of the General Assembly. We have wit-nessed here many historic events and heard the addresses of so many statesmen and distinguished figures from all over the world. In all those years I have listened  probably  to more than a thousand speeches and addresses in the general debates of the general Assembly alone. Many representatives gathered here have done the same. Why should we not benefit from our own experience  from the many lessons we have been taught  by advancing many suggestions on how to strengthen the role of the United Nations by improving the organization of the work of the General Assembly and its main bodies  by improving the procedures and effectiveness of the work of this unique world organization?130.	The role of the United Nations and the effective¬ness of its work can be strengthened and improved first of all by influence from outside  with the political willingness of the Member States and their Govern¬ments  but it could be strengthened also from inside  with a better atmosphere for work and a more dedicated involvement of all representatives and members of the Secretariat. At this historic moment in international affairs  with aggravations and escalations of all kinds  the time is coming to review again the experiences of the past in the work of the United Nations and to design new moves for strengthening the role and effec¬tiveness of the Organization  which  with its place in the history of mankind  should never be doomed to failure.131.	In conclusion  may I say that we expect the Assembly at this session to contribute to the non-use of force against independent countries and to securing their free national and social development; to render collective resistance to the arms race; to contribute to the establishment of a universal relaxation of tension; to contribute to the launching of global negotiations  for which  in spite of all difficulties and ambiguities  favorable conditions have been created proceeding from the fact that all sectors have publicly acknowledged that global negotiations are a political and an economic necessity of the world today; to give impetus to the resolving of crises  primarily those which involve the liberation of peoples under foreign and colonial domination as well as all other crises where security  territorial integrity  indepen¬dence and the self-determination of countries and peoples are jeopardized; and to prevent any encroach¬ment upon the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of peoples and to undertake resolute measures against all those who have violated the widely accepted principles and goals of the United Nations as well as the decisions adopted by its bodies.132.	Otherwise  we should find ourselves faced with chaos and world catastrophe. The imposition of the policy of faits accomplis as practice in international relations must not be allowed.133.	The delegation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  together with the delegations of non- aligned countries and all other countries offering their co-operation  will make its full contribution to the achievement of that goal.134.	We are aware that the differences in the per¬ception of the world will remain  that they are constant and ever-enriching elements of its pluralistic nature but  in our opinion  they should not be incompatible with our common interest in maintaining universal peace  which is increasingly becoming the pre-condition for the survival of humanity."
"145",7611,"ZMB",37,1982,"I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that with your vast knowledge and experience in international relations you will ably steer the Assembly towards a successful conclusion. I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation. I wish on this occasion to commend your predecessor  Mr. Kittani of Iraq  for having ably presided over the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session. I wish also to commend the Secretary-General for the impressive manner in which he has discharged the responsibilities of his office. We wish him every success.2.	We are meeting once again to continue our collective efforts to find solutions to world problems. Since the last regular session  there is very little that we can point to in the direction of progress that we have achieved. Indeed  the year has been one of the most turbulent in recent times.3.	The international community has witnessed not only the perpetuation of tensions and rivalries  which have now become the order of the day  but has also watched with horror and apprehension as some of these tensions and rivalries have flared into open warfare  resulting in loss of human life and occasioning untold misery for surviving victims. The continuing armed conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq  the conflict in the South Atlantic  the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and subsequent massacre of Palestinian civilians in the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in Beirut  the grave situation in southern Africa and the deterioration in the relations between the super-Powers  among others  have been of great concern to the international community.4. Of equal concern to us in Zambia is the fact that so many international and regional bodies whose essential purpose is to find peaceful solutions to world problems have been deadlocked. For example  the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the countries of the non-aligned movement have not been able to meet at summit level this year as scheduled. Furthermore  the Security Council  an institution which the Organization established for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security  has been reduced to a mere debating forum and its resolutions are now honoured more in the breach than in the observance. We are thus drifting into a situation where the United Nations will no longer be in a position to protect the weak or the humble from wanton aggression by the strong and the bully in our midst.5. We live under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust and in an era where conventional weapons have proliferated 'and have been perfected. Efforts by the Organization to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control have so far not yielded any meaningful results. It is regret-table that at the second special session devoted to disarmament the Assembly could not even adopt a document on a comprehensive programme• of disarmament. The current disquieting international situation demands that we rededicate ourselves to the cause 'of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. As recent public demonstrations supportive of disarmament have shown  the peoples of the world are growing restive and impatient at the lack of progress in the field of disarmament.6. Allow me now to turn to the problems relating to the state of affairs in the international economy. When the developing nations called for the establishment of a new international economic order way back in the mid-1970s  their aim was not to redistribute the existing wealth throughout the world  thereby scaling down the level of affluence in the developed communities. On the contrary  their primary concern was to create conditions that would allow them to develop their material and human potential to the full and consequently eradicate poverty  hunger9 disease and ignorance which are rampant in their own countries. Accelerated development of the developing countries poses no threat to the economies of the developed countries. It can only lead to the attainment of better conditions of Jiving for an mankind and an equitable sharing and utilization of the resources of our one world. However  our concerted attempts to bring about a fair and just economic system have foundered at every turn. Past negotiating conferences such as the Paris talks  the fourth and fifth sessions of UNCTAD  the third conference of UNIDO  the Committee Established under Resolution 32/l7( on the preparations for the launching of the global negotiations  and many others have not yielded tangible results. Today the international community is in a much worse condition. than it was a few years ago.7. The developed countries are experiencing least growth rates  persistent and rising unemployment and instability in their currencies. For them the problem of how to rescue their economies from further recession and possible collapse. They have accordingly resorted to protectionism and restrictions in trade  investments and transfer of resources  measures which themselves are exacerbating  the already fragile and declining economies.8. The developing countries  on the other hand  are experiencing decreased export earnings coupled with increased costs of essential imports such as food and energy  an escalating external debt burden and a tight reserve situation. Under these circumstances they have no aliern2tive but to reduce their overall economic activities and as a result per capita gross national product declines from year to year. The consequence of that situation in most developing countries  especially in Africa  has been an increase in the incidence of absolute poverty.9. These trends do not augur well for the economies of either the developed or the developing countries  especially when they manifest themselves at such an early stage of the Third United Nations Development Decade. Here too we need to review the collective decisions we took two years ago when we set out the policy guidelines of International development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Concerted efforts have to be undertaken to reverse the present trends. The international community has already diagnosed the world economy and ascertained that the remedy lies in structural adjustments.10. My delegation is of the view that the responsibility for promoting development and meeting the needs of our peoples naturally rests with national Governments. None the less. the international community  including the United Nations system itself  should assist in mobilizing the resources and expertise necessary to help those countries in need to resolve their numerous developmental problems.11. The current situation is more alarming  not only because of the magnitude and dimensions of the economic recession but also because of the erosion of international co-operation and the limitations in certain policies which are instituted to deal with recession. In a world of rising expectations and increasing communications between nations and social groups  a lack of response to the pressing demand for improving the quality of human life can be a real source of conflict not only at the national but also at the international level. In this respect  the level of voluntary contributions to UNDP  to mention but one  has experienced a decline. There is real danger that  if the present trend in voluntary contributions to the various .United Nations development-oriented agencies continues  the much cherished and noble aims and ideals of the United Nations body in this regard are likely to be compromised.12. My delegation firmly believes that institutional changes and structural reforms in the world economy which could contribute to lasting solutions to our current problems can only result from a global and integrated approach to these problems. The global negotiations  which were decided upon by the General Assembly in its resolution 34/138  offer the best chance to the international community to achieve the desired objectives. It is through meaningful inter-dependence and collective action that economicprogress will be achieved. We hope that the global negotiations will be launched in the not too distant future and that they will result in concrete measures which all countries will find It easy to adopt  and thereby bring about the necessary structural changes leading to the establishment of a new international economic order.13. The international political agenda is made up of many and complex problems which equally provoke grave concern and require urgent solutions. Let me now briefly reiterate Zambia's position in respect of some of them.14. We are concerned about the increase in the great Power rivalries in and around the Indian Ocean. We want to see the long-delayed Conference on the Indian Ocean  to be held at Colombo  convened urgently with a view to adopting effective measures to fulfil the aims and objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of IS.	We support the efforts by  the  Organization. including the good offices of the Secretary-General. to find political solutions and to obtain the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea.16. We support the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the reunification of Korea and once again call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.17. We remain steadfast in support of the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. We call for meaningful progress in the intercommunal talks and for an early agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus.18.	I wish now to focus particularly on the questions of southern Africa and the Middle East~ as well as to outline briefly Zambia's perception of the institution of the United Nations.19. The situation in southern Africa still looms over us as one of the major factors contributing to the deterioration in international relations. The issues in that perturbed region are well known. I wish none the less to recount them. They are  first  the continued illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa; secondly  the policies and practices of apartheid of the South African regime; and  thirdly  South Africa's military aggression against and its destabilization of neighbouring Independent African States.20. Four years have passed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia. That resolution was welcomed by the international com-munity as a practical and realistic basis for the termination by South Africa of its illegal occupation of Namibians for the Territory's process to its long-delayed independence. To date  Namibia remains under illegal South African occupation as the numerous efforts undertaken to put resolution 435 (1978) into effect have ~en of no avail.21. This session of the General Assembly takes place against the background of renewed efforts to break out of the impasse over the implementation of resolution 435 (1978). Consultations involving the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the front-line States and Nigeria on the one hand and the contact group of five Western States and South Africa on the other have been held in the last three months here in New York with a view to resolving outstanding issues pertaining to the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. These consultations resulted in agreement on virtua1ly all relevant issues. The one important out-standing issue concerns the electoral system to be used to elect a constituent assembly in Namibia. South Africa has not made its position known on this issue.22. It is the firm view of my Government that the momentum which has been generated in regard to the independence of Namibia should not be lost. We wish to see the implementation process begin without further delay. South Africa should not be given any pretext to frustrate further the implementation of resolution 435 (1978). We would  therefore  utter a caution against the introduction of extraneous issues which would have the effect of delaying the independence of Namibia. In this regard  we reject the linkage that is being insisted upon between Namibia's independence and the presence of Cuban forces in Angola. There would be absolutely no justification for Namibia's independence to be delayed on account of issues which are clearly outside the  -letter and spirit of resolution 435 (1978).23.	On the question of apartheid and minority rule in South Africa  my country has been unequivocal in condemning that obnoxious system. We have repeatedly warned South Africa that a people cannot be suppressed forever. Already  the struggle by the non-white people of South Africa has become formidable. The march is on  and no amount of arms  mass arrests  police brutality or torture will stop it until the apartheid system is destroyed and majority rule is established in that country.24.	It is true that the racist regime has become more ruthless in suppressing the uprising by the oppressed majority  but so too has the people's determination to fight that regime intensified. The policy of bantustanization and the concept of divide and rule  whereby the regime is trying to play the Coloured and Indian communities against the black people by allowing the former a few more privileges than their black colleagues  will deceive no one. They have been exposed for what they are: desperate manoeuvres aimed at perpetuating apartheid.25.	The oppressed people of South Africa wish to see the establishment of a democratic system of government in their country. That is a quest for Justice that requires support from the rest of civilized mankind  including in particular those countries of the Western world which invest heavily in South Africa  and which  through those strong economic links with Pretoria  could bring maximum pressure to bear on the South African regime to abolish apartheid and bring about majority rule.26.	Let those who have interests of any sort in South Africa not be blinded by the massive short-term profits that they are reaping under apartheid. It will be in their long-term interest to exert effective pressure on South Africa lo abandon the apartheid system.27.	My Government is also seriously concerned about South Africa's continued acts of aggression against front-line and other States in southern Africa. As the international community is well aware  South African military forces continue to this day to occupy part of Angolan territory in flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola. In addition  South Africa persists in carrying out military incursions and cross-border raids into Angola under the pretext of hot pursuit against SWAPO freedom fighters. South Africa is also persistently engaged in clandestine and open operations which embrace military aggression and economic subversion as well as harassment of the neighbouring independent African States with a view to destabilizing them.28.	It is in the light of that situation that I urge those who are allies of the Pretoria regime not only to point out the folly of its adventurism  but also to cease giving support to it. I also urge the Assembly to demand urgently the complete and unconditional withdrawal of South Africa's military forces from Angola  and the cessation of all its acts of aggression against and destabilization of the front-line States and other neighbouring States.29.	With regard to the Middle East problem  I wish to express my Governments indignation at and condemnation of the unprovoked and premeditated invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces and the cold-blooded massacre of innocent Palestinian civilians in refugee camps. The loss of civilian live~ and massive destruction of property caused by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon are reminiscent of the holocaust of the Jewish people themselves in Nazi Germany  and should be unreservedly condemned by all peace-loving peoples the world over. It is ironic that a people which suffered so much under Nazi Germany tyranny should now have become the standard-bearer and apparent admirer of Nazi-type atrocities.30.	I wish to state that the solution of the problem does not lie in the liquidation of the Palestinian people or in their expulsion from Lebanon. It is foolhardy for Israel to believe that it can put an end to the legitimate and cherished aspirations of the Palestinian people through massive use of force of arms.31.	The invasion of Lebanon and the massive loss of innocent lives in that country have highlighted the urgent need to find a lasting solution to the Middle East problem  at the core of which• lies the question of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state in Palestine.32.	We call upon those who have the leverage to exert pressure on Israel to abandon its acts of aggression against its neighbours and to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people. We remain convinced that a just and comprehensive solution to the problem of the Middle East should be found within the frame-work of the United Nations.33.	The report' of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  which is before the Assembly  is incisive  frank and objective. He has eloquently expressed the concerns of many people all over the world who believe in the United Nations and want the Organization to be strengthened so that it can meet the cha1lenges of the present-day world and fulfil its historic role in the maintenance of international peace and security.34. My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General. The events of this year above all require that .we take a critical look at the peace-making and peace-keeping role of the United Nations  particularly that of the Security Council  which regrettably seems to have been reduced to the role of a mere spectator while some of its permanent members have actively pursued initiatives of their own outside the framework of the United Nations.35. If we truly believe in the institution-the United Nations-we cannot and should not  as its Member States  merely give lip service to the Organization. nor should we seek to find solutions based on narrow national interests to important problems of universal interest and concern outside the United Nations framework.36.	Political will on the part of all Member States is of the essence if we are to strengthen the United Nations and revitalize its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. We need political will to implement and strictly adhere to the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. We need political will to engage earnestly in a constructive dialogue to examine and perfect the mechanisms for promoting the aims and objectives of the United Nations.37.	Let me say specifically that it remains the considered view of the Zambian Government that all Member States should do everything possible to support the work of. the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. No single issue should be considered sacrosanct. The Special Commit-tee should have the latitude to consider all issues relevant to the strengthening of the United Nations and enhancing its effectiveness in resolving the problems which trouble international relations.38. The United Nations remains the only hope for mankind in the long search for lasting solutions to the multifaceted problems confronting our one world. Let us therefore rededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and do all we can to ensure that the Organization lives up to the expectations envisaged by the founding fathers."
"146",7643,"ZWE",37,1982,"It is my privilege to deliver the statement ofthe Republic of Zimbabwe to the Assembly onbehalf of my Minister for Foreign Affairs  whohas had to go home on urgent business. Thefollowing is his statement.The Government and people of the Republic ofZimbabwe warmly greet the Secretary General andall delegations and wish the session success. Ishould like to take this opportunity tocongratulate Mr. Hollai on his election to thepresidency of the thirty seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. He has my best wishes and thoseof my delegation in the very importantresponsibility which the Assembly has placed onhis shoulders. He can certainly count on mydelegation's cooperation with him in his work.May I also join other speakers who have paid athoroughly deserved tribute to Mr. Kittani ofIraq  for the way in which he presided over thethirty sixth session of the General Assembly  aswell as the special sessions.As this is the first opportunity for me to offermy personal congratulations to Mr. Perez deCuellar  on his election to the highest office inthe Organization  I wish to do so now. This is of course  in addition to the messages offelicitation and good wishes which the Governmentof Zimbabwe communicated to the Secretary Generalthrough the normal channels soon after hiselection and also during the recent specialsession of the General Assembly devoted todisarmament. The Government of the Republic ofZimbabwe is particularly satisfied at hiselection for several reasons  the most importantof which are his outstanding qualities both as aperson and as a diplomat  which are well known toall in this Assembly  and  equally important  thegreat honor which his election represents to hiscountry  Peru  to the nonaligned movement and tothe third world.There can be no denying the fact that the thirtyseventh session of the General Assembly is takingplace against the background of a criticallydeteriorating international situation. I wish torefer to some of the things which contribute tothis atmosphere of fear  tension and insecurityin our world. In so doing it is my sincere hopethat when we conclude this session we shall all as individuals and nations  rededicate andrecommit ourselves to the high principles of theCharter and to world peace.The current vicious arms race  especially thenuclear arms race  if it is not quickly andeffectively checked  could lead only to a nuclearconflict  resulting in the complete destructionof this planet; and  as the Secretary General hasalready warned in his report on the work of theOrganization  nothing worthwhile will survive anuclear holocaust if one comes. Let us remindourselves  therefore  that what is at stake hereis the survival of the human race. If so far however  we have been spared this no victor  novanquished' war  it is perhaps because the worldhas not yet been so unfortunate as to producepersons sufficiently crazy and foolish to wish toinscribe their own names on the pages of historywhich no one will ever survive to recount.It has already been observed by speakers beforeme that Mother serious threat to world peace andsecurity is the production and stockpiling ofmore sophisticated conventional weapons. Althoughthey know full well the destructive capacities ofsuch inhuman weapons  some of the nation’spossessing them seems most eager to employ themin the pursuit of so called national interestsand objectives  the achievement of which does notseem beyond means that are more acceptable undercivilized international law. In fact  those whopossess these dangerous weapons of death anddestruction often assume postures and positionswhich render ineffectual the mediatory and peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations and otherinternational bodies concerned with seekingpeaceful solutions to conflicts. Such has beenthe common frustration of the Security Council the OAU  the nonaligned movement and otherinternational and regional organizations. In mostconflicts threatening regional or internationalstability  peace and security  such as  forinstance  those in the Middle East  the PersianGulf  the South Atlantic recently  Afghanistan South East Asia or southern Africa to mentionsome of the current areas of tension and conflictresolutions and decisions of those organizationsare met more with defiance and violation thanwith compliance. We in Zimbabwe had as  indeed has all peace loving peoples of the world highhopes and expectations of the second specialsession of the General Assembly on disarmament.We are just as deeply disappointed that thesession did not produce any tangible result.However  in spite of the failure of the specialsession  we remain even more firmly convincedthat there can be no other course for theinternational community than to continue itsefforts to achieve arms control leadingultimately to total disarmament. This will notonly ensure peace for us as individuals andnations  but will certainly lead to a fresh andmore balanced review of our already criticallyderanged sense of priorities in the allocationand distribution of the scarce resources of ourplanet. For example  we are convinced that the$US 500 billion now annually squandered on armsof death and destruction will be diverted towardsnational  regional and interregionaldevelopmental projects designed to benefit peoplerather than to destroy them.It is not being suggested or implied here thatsuccess in arms control or disarmament willcreate a world free of tension and even conflict.These will always be there. What is beingsuggested  however  is that the temptation toresort lightly to the use or threat of force inresolving political disputes between nations islikely to be reduced markedly?A cursory review on a regional basis of ourworld  and especially of the political scene will very quickly reveal how far we have wanderedfrom the path  the ideals and the goals whichinspired the authors of the Charter of this greatOrganization  of which we are all proud to bemembers. I wish to start this review with thesouthern African region. There the Apartheid andracist Pretoria regime continues its oppressiveand repressive policies against the blackmajority in South Africa. The same racist regimecontinues its illegal occupation of Namibia indefiance of the resolutions  decisions anddeclarations of this Organization  the OAU andthe nonaligned movement and the wishes anddemands of the people of Namibia.When in 1978 the five Western countries now knownas the Western contact group successfullypersuaded the Security Council to adopt the nowwell known resolution 435  they argued that thisproposal offered prospects of an immediatepeaceful ending of racist South Africa's illegalcolonization of Namibia. Indeed  resolution 435has since been universally accepted as the onlyfair  practical and realistic basis for thepeaceful settlement of the Namibian independencequestion. Efforts have since been made toimplement the plan  which the illegal regime alsoaccepted. Yet Namibia still remains occupied.I wish to refer briefly to the most recentefforts involving the front line States  Nigeriaand SWAPO on the one hand and the Western contactgroup and South Africa on the other. The frontline States  Nigeria and SWAPO cooperated inthese efforts  genuinely hoping that they wouldfacilitate the implementation of the UnitedNations plan outlined in Security Councilresolution 435. During and after the abortiveGeneva Conference in 1981  the Western contactgroup informed all concerned that South Africahad certain concerns which must be dispelledbefore the implementation of the United Nationsplan for Namibian independence. We were furtherpersuaded that once these so called concerns hadbeen dispelled South Africa would cooperate inthe implementation of resolution 435.We can say without hesitation that all theparticipants in the recent consultations including South Africa itself  were agreed at theend of the exercise that South Africa's concernsregarding resolution 435 had all been completelyallayed; that is  all matters and questions relatingto resolution 435 (1978) and to theimplementation of the United Nations plan hadbeen discussed and fully clarified to thesatisfaction of all concerned  including SouthAfrica. I should mention in passing  however that South Africa still has to specify which ofthe two electoral methods will be employed inNamibia  that of single member constituencies orthat of proportional representation.It must be emphasized here that SWAPO has timeand again reiterated its readiness to sign acease fire agreement and to take part in free andfair elections under United Nations supervision as provided for in the United Nations plan. Asrepresentatives here will recall  this has beenSWAPO's position since the abortive GenevaConference of 1981.What  then  the General Assembly must be askingitself  is blocking progress towards theimplementation of Security Council resolution 435(1978)? The front line States  Nigeria and SWAPOare and have long been ready to proceed to thenext point at anytime  as soon as the electoralmethod is known. SWAPO needs to know this inorder to make the necessary preparations for theelections.What I have said so far indicates tremendousprogress towards a peaceful settlement of theNamibian question. Let me also say that thisprogress is greatly attributable to SWAPO'scooperation and to the air of optimism andmomentum generated in the capitals of the Westerncontact group before and during the six weeks ofconsultations. Yet all this momentum and goodwill may soon be lost if South Africa and somemembers of the Western contact group continue tomanufacture pretexts for delaying theimplementation of Security Council resolution 435(1978).In this regard  let me make Zimbabwe's positionvery clear. I am referring here to the politicsof linkage and parallelism which have beenformulated to make the departure of Cuban troopsfrom the People's Republic of Angola a precondition of the independence of Namibia. Thisstrategy  which is not related in any way toSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978)  and whichis the creation of certain members of the contactgroup and Apartheid South Africa in order topromote and serve their own bilateral interests is totally unacceptable to Zimbabwe. Dragging theissue of the Cuban presence in Angola into theNamibian question is an unwarranted andunacceptable interference in bilateral affairsand relations between the sovereign States ofAngola and Cuba  which are Members of theOrganization and of the nonaligned movement.Moreover  those who subscribe to this ridiculousand absurd view should be reminded that  whileracist and colonialist South Africa continuallycommits acts of aggression against the People'sRepublic of Angola  Cuban troops have never setfoot on South African soil. With regard to theobnoxious system in South Africa itself Zimbabwe's position is well known. We have alwayssaid that we should like to see the totaldismantling of Apartheid and racist minority rulein that part of our region. We demand instead ademocratic system of government which sees allthe people of that country  regardless of race religion  language and sex  as equal citizens oftheir land. We call upon the leaders of theApartheid regime in Pretoria to negotiate withthe legitimate leadership of the oppressed andexploited black majority with a view to workingout ways and means of establishing a system ofgovernment guaranteeing every South Africanfreedom and social justice. The recently proposedso called Presidential Council giving limitedrepresentation to South Africans of mixed raceand Asians in that country is totallyunacceptable to the people of South Africa  whoare now solidly behind the armed struggleprosecuted by their liberation forces.The Government and the people of Zimbabwe supportthe struggle for liberation  equality and socialjustice being waged by the liberation movementsin South Africa. We strongly condemn thecontinued incarceration of Comrade Nelson Mandelaand other legitimate leaders of the people ofSouth Africa by the racist Pretoria regime. Thisand the numerous political murders committed bythe racist rulers against the opponents of theiniquitous system are also violations of humanrights. We appeal to the international communityto continue and even to intensify its material moral  diplomatic and political support to thestruggling people of South Africa in theircommendable efforts to free themselves from theApartheid yoke.In its desperate efforts to frustrate theliberation process in Namibia and the dismantlingof the Apartheid system within its borders  theoppressive regime is busy waging destabilizingcampaigns against the neighboring independent andsovereign States of Angola  Botswana  Lesotho Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe. Economicblackmail  bullying and sabotage  politicalpropaganda and subversion  and open militaryaggression and mercenarism are the common tacticsemployed by Apartheid in its campaign of regionaldestabilization. As the Assembly is well aware the regime's forces have been occupying part ofAngola's territory for a year now and there issufficient evidence that more incursions arebeing planned.The abortive coup d’état against the legitimateGovernment of the Republic of Seychelles earlierthis year by Pretoria mercenaries and criminalsis also part of this campaign of destabilization.So also is the recruiting  training  equippingand supporting of dissident groups in some of theneighboring independent States for the purpose ofresisting legitimate Governments there.Zimbabwe's position on the question of thedestabilization of neighboring States by SouthAfrica is that this will not deter us from ourdeclared policy of offering moral support andwhatever material support we can to theliberation struggle in that land. Zimbabwedemands that the Pretoria regime should stopforthwith its destabilizing campaigns against ourcountries. It should withdraw its forces fromAngola forthwith and unconditionally. The whiteminority Government of apartheid South Africamust be warned that no country has any rightwhatsoever to violate international law withimpunity. I should now like  before leaving theAfrican region  to turn to the question ofWestern Sahara. As the Assembly knows  thisquestion has for a long time been on the agendaof the OAU and of the United Nations. The peopleof the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic deservemore support in their just struggle for selfdetermination in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 1514 (XV). Because the Government ofthe Republic of Zimbabwe is totally convinced ofthe justness of the Sahraoui people's cause Zimbabwe has recognized the Sahraoui ArabDemocratic Republic as an independent andsovereign State. We believe that the resolutionadopted by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment at its eighteenth session  held atNairobi in 1981  providing for the signing of acease fire between Morocco and the POLISARIO andfor the holding of a referendum to beadministered by a neutral force offers the bestprospects for settling the question of WesternSahara.Zimbabwe views with deep concern efforts bycertain members of the OAU  apparently withoutside encouragement  to polarize and thereforeparalyse the OAU.The past few months have witnessed a tragicdeterioration in the situation in the Middle Eastregion  as has been horribly exemplified byZionist Israel's invasion and occupation ofLebanon and the massacring of thousands ofinnocent Palestinian refugees in the Sabra andShatila camps on 16 and 17 September. Thecivilized international community was deeplyoutraged  shocked and revolted by this genocidalact and crime against humanity  whose sadism canonly be compared to the crimes committed by theNazis  ironically enough against Jewish people during the Second World War. Surely the worldcannot behave as if the thousands of defenselessmen  women and children in the two camps werekilled by a natural disaster. The barbaricslaughter was planned and carried out by theZionist Government. That Government and itssupporters who  if they had wanted to do so could have prevented the massacres  should beheld responsible for this crime against humanityand appropriately punished by the internationalcommunity.We have time and again emphasized that nosolution of the Middle East question will beacceptable unless it recognizes the inalienableright of the Palestinian people to national selfdetermination and to the establishment of aPalestinian State under the leadership of the PLO.It is our view that the Palestinians and theirLebanese brothers and sisters richly deserve tobe commended for their courage  resilience anddetermination in the face of naked aggression andintimidation by Zionist Israel. Zimbabwe salutesthem  especially the gallant PLO forces who forseveral weeks courageously defended their peopleagainst Zionist butchers.While still in the Middle East  we should like toexpress our deep concern about the continuingconflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran andIraq. It is our sincere hope that peace may cometo this area where regional stability andsecurity are seriously threatened.Afghanistan is another area of concern to theOrganization and we feel obliged to reiterate ourposition with regard to it. We feel that apolitical settlement is urgent and that this isonly possible on the basis of the withdrawal offoreign forces and the cessation of all outsideinfluences and pressures. Accordingly we callupon all concerned to respect that country'sindependence  sovereignty and nonaligned status.With regard to Cyprus  Zimbabwe would again wantto see the end to all forms of foreignintervention and interference  so that the peopleof that republic may be able to determine theirown future freely. The Government of Zimbabwestrongly supports the independence  sovereignty territorial integrity and nonaligned status ofCyprus  as one united country. We share theconcern expressed by many speakers before us thatthe intercommoned dialogue initiated under theauspices of the Secretary General’s SpecialRepresentative has not yet produced any tangibleresults.Poland is another area of international concern.Our own view is that it is only the people ofthat country free of external pressure intervention and interference who can resolvetheir internal problems. We believe very stronglythat any solution imposed from outside andagainst the will of the Polish people is totallyunacceptable.Zimbabwe's position with regard to the situationin South East Asia remains unchanged. We believevery strongly in a peaceful political solution tothe Kampuchean problem in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations and thenonaligned movement. Thus  we would like to seethe withdrawal of all foreign troops fromKampuchean soil so that the various factionscontending for the mastery of that country mightmeet to discuss and resolve their differences forthe benefit of the suffering masses of thatcountry.Zimbabwe believes in the principle of selfdetermination and the termination of all formsand manifestations of colonialism. For thatreason we find unacceptable Indonesia's militaryintervention in East Timor. It is our belief therefore  that the struggle waged by the EastTimorese under the leadership of FRETILIN is ajust one  deserving international support. Wecall upon Indonesia to withdraw its forces fromEast Timor.I should like to tum to the question of theKorean peninsula  another area of majorinternational concern. We note with great regretthat the massive foreign military build up in theSouth continues unabated and poses a grave threatto international peace and security. The enemiesof Korean unity and the supporters of the twoKoreas myth have also been trying to confuse theinternational community by their deceitful talkof the possibility of free and fair elections inthe South. This cheap propaganda cannot deceiveanybody  as we all know that there can be no freeand fair elections in a territory under militaryoccupation.While my Government will support negotiationsbetween North and South Korea  we believe that nomeaningfulnegotiations are possible under the prevailingconditions. We would therefore like to see theimmediate withdrawal of foreign forces from theSouth  so as to create an atmosphere conducive tomutual trust between the artificially dividedpeople of the peninsula. It is our strong viewthat President Kim Sung's proposal for aconfederate system offers realistic prospects fora settlement in the troubled area. If adopted  ithas every chance of putting the Korean people onthe road leading to the ultimate goal of completeKorean reunification.The recent crisis over the Falkland or MalvinasIslands in the South Atlantic merits comment. Inthat regard  we believe that the tragic events inthat region could have been avoided if theparties to the conflict had observed theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.As Zimbabwe is opposed to the use of force in thesettlement of disputes between States  we wish tourge the two parties to seek a peaceful  just andlasting settlement through negotiations.I wish to comment briefly on the internationaleconomic situation. It will be recalled that itwas at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State orGovernment of Non Aligned Countries  held atAlgiers in 1973  that the idea of a newinternational economic order was introduced. Thatconcept  which has since been debated at manymeetings and conferences  is attractive to thedeveloping countries  as it seeks to halt theperpetuation of a misdistribution of our world'swealth. Last year  in this very Hall mydelegation and many others referred to and warnedagainst the dangerous deterioration in the worldeconomic situation. That same warning is stillvery relevant today  especially since thatdeterioration in the world economic situation mayadversely affect world stability  peace andsecurity.Zimbabwe and all developing countries have beenhoping  almost in vain  that a conciliatoryspirit would intervene to facilitate theconcluding of global negotiations for a newinternational economic order. Unfortunately however  up to now no progress has been achieved as several opportunities have been lost.While the industrialized countries continue to beuncooperative on this vital matter  their owneconomies have not been able to escape theravages of one of the worst world economicsituations. It must be observed  however  thatdeveloping economies are the hardest hit. Theindustrialized countries are experiencinginflationary spirals  massive unemployment currency weaknesses and high interest rates. Slowgrowth rates are becoming a common feature oftheir economies  too. Regrettably  theserecessionary conditions are now being used asexcuses for inward looking policies and forprotectionism against export commodities fromdeveloping countries. We call for the immediateliberalization of trade relations in favor ofdeveloping countries. The balance of paymentproblems of the developing countries continue togrow. The deficits of the latter countries especially the non oil producing countries  havereached astronomical figures  reflecting themultiple crises afflicting the internationaleconomy. Clearly  the international monetarysystem needs restructuring to reflectcontemporary economic realities. The core of sucha system should be the participation of thedeveloping countries in the decision makingprocess and the enhancement of their ability tohave a significant impact on the democratizationof the international monetary system.The problem of energy is closely linked to thatof our economic development. Our countries haveserious difficulties in meeting their oilrequirements  and the oil bills of non oilexporting developing countries have reachedunprecedented proportions. This is  however  anarea where the developed countries and the oilexporting  newly industrializing countries canplay a crucial role in alleviating the generalparalysis now crippling oil importing developingcountries. We do appreciate the efforts made bysome members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to try to resolve this acuteproblem. What we would appreciate even more isgreater cooperation in the exploration of energyresources  especially in the area of new andrenewable sources of energy.Another area of concern to us is that of globalfood supplies. The eradication of hunger andmalnutrition is  and should be  a collectiveinternational effort. The establishment of aworld food security system and an internationallycoordinated system of nationally held foodreserves would go a long way towards amelioratingcurrent world food shortages and would alsoguarantee surpluses for our expanding populations.It is quite obvious that most countries cannotescape the malignant consequences of the worldeconomic crisis. Indeed  some countries are facedwith stagnation and outright zero growth rates.There is therefore the need to intensify economiccooperation and collective self reliance amongStates  particularly among the developingcountries. The new international economic orderwill  however  remain illusory unless thedeveloping countries prove that they are willingto be assertive and determined to play aneffective role in international economicrelations.Finally  may I congratulate and thank theSecretary General for his frank  objective andhonest report on the work of the United Nations to which I have already had occasion to refer inmy statement. The delegation of Zimbabwe agreesentirely with every aspect of the report andstrongly endorses the references to the need toexamine more critically the peace keeping andpeace making roles of the United Nations especially the Security Council. The SecretaryGeneral's report is both a welcome inspiration tomy delegation and a challenge at a time whenZimbabwe is looking forward with humility toserving on the Security Council. The report hascertainly refocused our attention on the noblepurposes and principles of the Charter  to whichZimbabwe is recommitting and rededicating itself."
